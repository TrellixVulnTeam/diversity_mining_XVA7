      "supplemented with coal and fuel oil to generate steam used in the paper making process and, at a few mills, to generate electricity \n",
      "used on site. In our virgin fiber mills, we use biomass, natural gas and coal to generate steam used in the pulping and paper making \n",

      "As a result of our vertical integration, our mills’ sales volumes may be directly impacted by changes in demand for our \n",

      "cartons, and we sold approximately three-fourths of our containerboard production, including trade swaps and buy/sell transactions, \n",

      "\n",
      "The industries we operate in are highly competitive, and no single company dominates any of those industries. Our paperboard \n",

      "in North America, and to a limited extent, manufacturers outside of North America. Our competitors include large and small, \n",
      "vertically integrated companies and numerous smaller non-integrated companies. In the corrugated packaging and folding and \n",
      "beverage carton markets, we compete with a significant number of national, regional and local packaging suppliers in North \n",
      "America and abroad. In the solid fiber interior packaging, promotional point-of-purchase display and converted paperboard products \n",
      "markets, we primarily compete with a smaller number of national, regional and local companies offering highly specialized \n",
      "products. Our recycled fiber brokerage and collection operations compete with various other companies for the procurement and \n",
      "supply of recovered paper, including brokers and companies that export recovered paper to international markets. The Land and \n",
      "Development segment competes in the real estate sales and development market, primarily in the Charleston, SC region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because all of our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments, we regularly bid for sales opportunities to \n",

      "Use of Estimates\n",
      "\n",
      "Preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that \n",
      "affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated \n",
      "financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ \n",
      "from those estimates, and the differences could be material.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include estimates \n",
      "to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill, intangibles and property, plant and equipment, to determine the useful lives of assets \n",
      "that are amortized or depreciated, and to measure income taxes, self-insured obligations, restructuring activities and allocate the \n",
      "purchase price of an acquired business to the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. In addition, significant estimates form \n",
      "the basis for our reserves with respect to collectibility of accounts receivable, inventory valuations, pension benefits, deferred tax \n",
      "asset valuation allowances and certain benefits provided to current and retired employees. Various assumptions and other factors \n",
      "underlie the determination of these significant estimates. The process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes \n",
      "into account factors such as historical experience, current and expected economic conditions, product mix, and in some cases, \n",
      "actuarial techniques. We regularly evaluate these significant factors and make adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Revenue Recognition\n",
      "\n",
      "We recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have \n",
      "been rendered, our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Delivery is not considered \n",
      "to have occurred until the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. The timing of revenue recognition \n",
      "is dependent on the location of title transfer which is normally either on the exit from our plants (i.e., shipping point) or on arrival \n",
      "at customers’ plants (i.e., destination point). We do not recognize revenue from transactions where we bill customers, but retain \n",
      "custody and title to these products until the date custody and title transfer. We do not have any significant multiple deliverable \n",
      "revenue arrangements.\n",
      "\n",
      "We net, against our gross sales, provisions for discounts, returns, allowances, customer rebates and other adjustments. We \n",
      "account for such provisions during the same period in which we record the related revenues. We include in net sales any amounts \n",

      "Prior to the adoption of ASU 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment”, the goodwill impairment model is a \n",
      "two-step process. We have not yet adopted the ASU. An amendment to ASC 350 became effective December 2011 that allows a \n",
      "qualitative assessment, prior to step one, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit \n",
      "exceeds its carrying amount. We did not attempt a qualitative assessment and moved directly to step one. In step one, we utilize \n",
      "the present value of expected net cash flows to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units. This present value model \n",
      "requires management to estimate future net cash flows, the timing of these cash flows, and a discount rate (based on a weighted \n",
      "average cost of capital), which represents the time value of money and the inherent risk and uncertainty of the future cash flows. \n",
      "Factors that management must estimate when performing this step in the process include, among other items, sales volume, prices, \n",
