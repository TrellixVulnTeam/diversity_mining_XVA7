Research consistently shows that diverse teams are more creative and more productive, which in our business, makes all the difference. Diversity is also transforming consumers. For us to compete effectively, our workforce has to reflect the world's changing demographics and more important, its changing marketplace.
Our goal is to be one of the world's most diverse and inclusive companies. Our approach addresses the issue in a systematic and structured manner. We believe this is the only way to achieve the lasting culture change that we seek across our organization and drive long-term, sustainable results.
In terms of accountability, IPG is the first holding company to link CEO compensation at its major U.S. companies with performance against diversity initiatives. We are also the first in our industry to establish a CEO Diversity Council, which includes CEOs of the major IPG agencies. Over the last five years, the company has also increased the activities of IPG's Diversity & Inclusion department, which supports our agencies as they focus on the recruitment, retention and development of employees both at the corporate level, and at IPG's business units. 
We know IPG has a ways to go, but we're already seeing real results. Embracing diversity makes us a better partner to our clients, a more attractive employer, and better at creating value for shareholders.
