People At WU Give Their Best Everyday
We show our appreciation to our employees by offering Global Total Rewards programs that encompass more than just compensation and benefits. These include paid time off, recognition, world-class training, and a culture that celebrates diversity and inclusion.
To ensure our programs are competitive across our global workforce, the Company regularly benchmarks our programs against those of other leading companies. We are also continually evaluating our rewards programs to ensure they meet employeesâ changing benefit needs.
