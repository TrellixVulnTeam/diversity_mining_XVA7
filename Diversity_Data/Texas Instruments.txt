Our goal is to provide an environment at TI where every person can thrive. We want our employees – no matter their backgrounds, work-styles, ideas or differences – to feel empowered to be who they are, and do their best work. The TI Diversity Network brings together more than a dozen employee-led networks – open to all TIers. Learn more on TI.com ›
