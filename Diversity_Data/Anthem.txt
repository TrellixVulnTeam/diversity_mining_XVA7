A Healthier Generation
Since 2010, the Boys & Girls Clubs of America (BGCA) and the Anthem Foundation have teamed up to deliver health promotion and programming that improve the health and wellness of today’s youth.
As a signature partner, the Anthem Foundation provides support for BGCA’s proven program Triple Play: A Game Plan for the Mind, Body and Soul. Triple Play recognizes that focusing on whole-child health fosters young people’s ability to gain diverse knowledge and skills that help them overcome barriers to wellness and positively affect their future health. Today, nearly eight million children have participated in Triple Play.
“Social determinants of health”—how people live, work and play—affect health profoundly. The Anthem/BGCA partnership supports whole-child health and wellness programming reaching those who need it most. BGCA serves a diverse population of youth through 4,300 club sites nationwide and on U.S. military installations around the globe.
To broaden awareness of the program, the Anthem Foundation works with BGCA to promote Triple Play and explain its benefits. A recent press release garnered 14,280,270 impressions. On June 28, 2018, National Triple Play Day took place in New York; 13 interviews about it earned an audience impression of 64,861,212. And an easy-to-understand video highlights the program’s strengths.
