Every year, the employees of Hershey Entertainment & Resorts (HE&R) welcome more than 6 million guests from down the street and around the world. We recognize that the more perspectives we have within our company, the more welcoming we are to all those who visit and seek employment here. In fact, our company has four core values, one of which is "Respectful of Others," which we define as treating all people with dignity, while respecting their differences and ideas. For more information on how we provide an inclusive and welcoming experience to our employees, guests, and suppliers, please view our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Report.
