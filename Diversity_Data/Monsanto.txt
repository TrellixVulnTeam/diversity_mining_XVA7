Our commitment to diversity also results in programs aimed at external audiences, such as supplier diversity, scholarships, university partnerships, and other key relationships with organizations around the world.
We search for the brightest talent, regardless of race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, disability, veteran status, gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation (real or perceived).  To be successful, you are encouraged to build networks and relationships across every level of the company and across all geographies.
 
Business Resource Networks
Recognizing that different members of the company have broad and varied needs, we support a variety of employee-organized and led business resource networks -- African and African American; Asian; Hispanic; Women; Gay, Lesbian and Transgender; Families; Veterans; and Differently Abled.  

The networks’ mission is to further the professional development of their members so that they can make their fullest contribution to the achievement of our corporate goals and objectives. To help facilitate this and create dialogue between employees and senior management, all the networking groups have an Executive Team member as a sponsor.
Another key driver for diversity is the commitment of our senior leadership, from our CEO to the Executive Team and their direct reports. Through our Inclusion & Diversity Council, comprised of senior leaders from all functions, we develop more leaders to shape our culture of inclusion, and encourage the mentoring and recruiting of diversity champions at every level.
Our success depends on our strong ongoing efforts to attract, retain and develop talented employees with broad experiences and backgrounds that bring new and innovative ideas and viewpoints to our organization.
