MGM Resorts is an entertainment company, through and through. For nearly two decades, we have been a leader in diversity and inclusion and LGBTQ rights. As we thought about the intersection for those two important pillars of our DNA, we saw a gap -- there really wasnât music that connected to one of the most important values of our organization â inclusion. We believe that everyone should have that experience with music that speaks to them specifically.
