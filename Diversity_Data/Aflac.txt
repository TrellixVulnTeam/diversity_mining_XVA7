Work Environment
Join a company that’s been named to Fortune Magazine’s “100 best Companies to Work For” 17 years in a row. As part of the Aflac team you’ll find yourself in a supportive work environment with an organizational culture that champions an open-door management philosophy, competitive salaries, excellent benefits and more:

Award-winning training and development classes
Advancement opportunities
A healthy work-life balance
Generous vacation and personal time off (PTO) policies

While we’re a dedicated company—with promises to keep to more than 50-million policyholders worldwide—it hasn’t stopped us from enjoying our philosophy of camaraderie and having some fun along the way. (After all, we do happen to have the Aflac Duck as our brand ambassador.)
You’ll also find things like team building, employee appreciation, community service and fostering a great work-life environment are all part of a multi-faceted culture employees experience here.
And they’ve all been part of our core values for more than 60 years.
Diversity
Aflac is committed to a culture that embraces an environment of understanding and empathy. You’ll quickly see that we’ve built a company where every employee in our diverse workforce can perform at their very best.
But our diversity efforts don't stop at our front door. They extend into our community through outreach and service—and by our agents, suppliers and business partners. Through our Diversity Council we’ve developed initiatives to implement, support and help further our diversity-related efforts across the globe.
The result is an enlightened environment that allows us to serve our customers with the compassion and respect they deserve. Especially when they need us most, during a life-changing event or an accident or illnesses. All from a brand that everyone knows and trusts.
