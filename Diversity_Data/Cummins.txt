Stronger Together
Diversity and inclusion have been a part of Cummins core values for more than 40 years, dating back to our CEO J. Irwin Miller who led the company from 1947 to 1977. Miller believed in the power of listening, and wanted to hear from a wide variety of voices before reaching a decision, believing no single gender, race or ethnicity had a monopoly on wisdom.
Cummins employees embody the companyâ€™s philosophy of diversity. We operate across cultures, functions, language barriers and time zones to solve the technical and logistical challenges created by the complexity of a global business.
We differ in age, gender, race, nationality and language, as well as in personality, behavior, sexual orientation and religious beliefs. We have varying skills and abilities, including education, experience and functional capability. Our diversity reflects the countries and communities where we live and work, as well as the customers we serve.
Cummins commitment to diversity has been recognized by a number of organizations and publications. DiversityInc named Cummins to its list of the Top 50 Companies for Diversity for a tenth consecutive year in 2016.
Also for the 10th consecutive year, Cummins was awarded a perfect score in the 2015 Corporate Equality Index by the Human Rights Campaign, the largest U.S. civil rights organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees, with more than one million members and supporters across the United States.
