        Our accelerated approach to diversity and inclusion
      

Googleâs mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. When we say we want to build for everyone, we mean everyone. To do that well, we need a workforce thatâs more representative of the users we serve.
Google is committed to creating a diverse and inclusive workforce. Our employees thrive when we get this right. We aim to create a workplace that celebrates the diversity of our employees, customers, and users. We endeavor to build products that work for everyone by including perspectives from backgrounds that vary by race, ethnicity, social background, religion, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, veteran status, and national origin.
Thatâs why weâve embraced a refreshed and accelerated approach to diversity and inclusion.  Read our 2018 Diversity Annual Report to hear from Danielle Brown, VP - Chief Diversity & Inclusion Officer, on how we plan to deliver our strategy.
