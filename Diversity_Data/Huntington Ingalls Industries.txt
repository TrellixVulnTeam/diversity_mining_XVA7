At Huntington Ingalls Industries, our employees are truly our most important assets and are instrumental to our success.
We value relationships that are based on mutual respect and appreciation of differences as a formative part of the inclusive culture that is essential to our success as a company. Within this inclusive culture we promote “character, civility and community” (Fluker, 2009).
We gain a key competitive advantage by building a community that values contributions and perspectives from a variety of backgrounds, skills and experiences regardless of race, ethnicity, color, religion, sex, disability, nationality and other differentiation. Our leaders leverage the differences within their teams.
Our corporate values — Integrity, Safety, Honesty, Engagement, Responsibility and Performance — and Code of Ethics guide us and serve as reminders that trust and respect are the foundation for an inclusive environment.
