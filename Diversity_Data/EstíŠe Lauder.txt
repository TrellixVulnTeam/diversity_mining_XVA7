At The Estée Lauder Companies, we emphasize inclusion first because an inclusive environment is the catalyst to leverage the diversity in our organization. We like to define these terms as follows.
Inclusion: A commitment to creating an environment that recognizes, values and respects the differences we all bring to the workplace, allowing everyone to do their best work.
Diversity: All the human characteristics that make us who we are and fuel our perspectives, behaviors and ideas.
We are committed to promoting and maintaining an inclusive culture. No one person, group or culture has all the knowledge, skills or information necessary for success in our business. We believe that diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives result in greater innovation and better problem-solving across our organization.
"We are encouraged to share our insights and inspiration across all levels of the organization," says Solee, an employee on Clinique's marketing team. "Our leaders are always open to hearing from us, the millennials. I may be among the youngest with the least experience, yet I am still recognized as one of the great assets of the Company."
