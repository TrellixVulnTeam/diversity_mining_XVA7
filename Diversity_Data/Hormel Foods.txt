To facilitate this culture, we offer diversity training and maintain relationships with organizations at colleges and universities to increase the diversity of our talent pools.
Internal groups, such as the Executive Diversity and Inclusion Steering Committee and the cross-functional Corporate Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Council, are champions of diversity and inclusion, and advocates for change.
The Executive Diversity and Inclusion Steering Committee sets the strategic direction for the organization. Its members provide a roadmap for building a culture of inclusion where employees feel they belong and are valued. The Corporate Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Council is responsible for championing diversity and inclusion initiatives, and providing cross-functional input.
