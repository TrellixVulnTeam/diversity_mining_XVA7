Equality is a core value at Salesforce. We believe that businesses can be powerful platforms for social change and that our higher purpose is to drive Equality for all. Creating a culture of Equality isnât just the right thing to do, itâs also the smart thing. Diverse companies are more innovative and better positioned to succeed in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
We strive to create workplaces that reflect the communities we serve and where everyone feels empowered to bring their full, authentic selves to work. There is more work to be done, but with the help of our entire OhanaÂ â our employees, customers, partners, and communityÂ â we can achieve #EqualityForAll.
