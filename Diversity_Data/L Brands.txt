World-class brands. The sexiest fashion show ever. Scents that make you smile. They all speak for themselves. But, behind the glitz and the glamour is a team of highly talented, dedicated associates with uniquely different characteristics, qualities and talents that we embrace and foster.
At L Brands, we focus on recruiting, retaining and advancing diverse talent for an organization that reflects the customers we serve and the communities where we live and work. Being part of this environment lets you be yourself – to share your perspectives, ideas and thinking about the way you see the world. We take our commitment to diversity and inclusion seriously by incorporating this value and message into our learning curriculum for all associates. By encouraging a workplace where diversity and inclusion are valued, our associates, suppliers and vendors help to ensure that the products we sell and the service we provide always delight our customers.
The fact that we’re all different is the one thing that we have in common. And we believe that together, that makes us better.
Associate Resource Groups
With more than 93,000 associates, our Associate Resource Groups create an opportunity for associates to connect with one another around shared interests. These groups volunteer in the community, support professional development and help shape our company culture.

We Respect Our Customers
L Brands is adamant that all of our customers, regardless of race, be treated with dignity and respect at all times. Our customers' December 2016 experience at our Quintard Mall Victoria's Secret store should not have happened, and it does not represent who we are or what we stand for.
