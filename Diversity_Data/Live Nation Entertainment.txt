I would like to build a workforce that represents and reflects the customers we serve. To strengthen the emphasis on outreach, recruitment, leadership development and retention of a high performing diverse workforce. 
We’ll work to inspire and encourage senior management to focus and capitalise on the value of diversity with the goal of creating an educated, empowered and forward thinking workforce that sets the standard of diversity and inclusion within our industry.
