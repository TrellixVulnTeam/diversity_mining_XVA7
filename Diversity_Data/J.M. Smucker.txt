We Are Better Together
Situated on 120-acres, our state-of-the-art Orrville Corporate Campus is designed to create a warm, welcoming environment that facilitates open communication and collaboration – providing a sense of community where people are proud to gather, work, and learn from each other. We believe our campus fosters an inclusive environment which strengthens our Company and enables every employee to reach their full potential.
Some unique features include our LEED® Certified Renewal Building – which houses a wellness facility with a two-story, fully-equipped fitness center, medical care center, and massage therapy. Just down the hall in the Orchard, employees can select from an ever-changing menu which features breakfast and lunch classics along with specials derived from seasonal and local ingredients – along with many of our own products. Our dining area’s Grind2Energy™ transforms food waste into a clean, renewable source of energy, further supporting our continued commitment to sustainability. On the opposite end of campus, our Child Development Center offers parents the peace of mind that comes with working just steps away from their children.
These amenities – among others – support our commitment to our employees’ well-being and provide ways for employees to be a part of a community where they can thrive.
