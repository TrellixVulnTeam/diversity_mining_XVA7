Girls and STEAM
Oracle supports several nonprofit organizations working to expose girls and underrepresented students to computer science, and science, technology, engineering, art, and math (STEAM). See our Grant Portfolio.

Additionally, our own education initiatives—Oracle Academy and Oracle Education Foundation—give special attention to student populations historically underrepresented in STEAM studies and careers, including girls and students of color.
