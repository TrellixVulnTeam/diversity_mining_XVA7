We’re big believers that mentoring is a great way to support your
  career, whether you’re looking to give or receive guidance. We have a
  variety of mentoring programs that support our culture of
  collaboration. Mentoring at AbbVie takes many forms, helping employees
  in all stages of their careers. And it can be in the form of a
  one-on-one partnership or an informal sounding board.


Ikechi joined AbbVie in 2013 as head of brand management
  coordination, global marketing rheumatology, and later was named
  associate director, focusing on strategic challenges across the
  various rheumatology indications. After being invited to join the
  Executive Mentoring Program, he was paired with Roopal Thakkar, M.D.,
  based on their respective profiles.
Roopal is a long standing employee at AbbVie, joining the company in 2003.


Both have found the program beneficial. Not only did the mentoring
  relationship enhance Ikechi’s understanding of AbbVie’s priorities, it
  helped him navigate his career progression. Meanwhile, Roopal found
  that he became a better listener as a mentor and gained insights into
  other aspects of AbbVie’s business.
“The program has enhanced my career by deepening my understanding of
  AbbVie’s priorities as a company. I am a big supporter of the value of
  mentoring relationships, both as a protégé and as a mentor, and
  believe that they are critical to success in almost any career field.”

“A successful mentor/protégé relationship will serve to bring out
  the best in both participants. It is incumbent upon all of us to share
  useful learnings across the organization. We all learn as we ‘teach,’
  thus all mentoring relationships are mutually beneficial.” – Roopal
