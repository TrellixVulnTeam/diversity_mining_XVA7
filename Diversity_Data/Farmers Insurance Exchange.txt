WOMEN'S INCLUSION NETWORK
With a majority of American women making their families' insurance purchase decisions today, and with nearly 40 percent serving as their family's primary income earner, Farmers leadership recognized the clear need to focus on the critical role that women at Farmers play, both in leading our organization and in guiding the company’s communication and marketing efforts for this key market segment. That's the reasoning behind the establishment of the Women's Network, with over 1,600 members and 17 regional chapters across the country led by our top talent.
