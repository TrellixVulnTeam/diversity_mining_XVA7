          At JCPenney, we recognize that our Associates’ passion, energy and 
		  talent form the foundation of our success. Our goal is to ensure every 
		  Associate's career at JCPenney is a rewarding one.

          We are 
		  honored to be recognized as a top employer with diverse teams at every 
		  level, but it is an even greater privilege to serve our diverse 
		  communities. We are committed to providing great value, excellent 
		  service and a welcoming environment to customers from all walks of 
		  life.

		  We value diversity such as race, color, religion, 
		  ethnicity, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity 
		  and expression, marital status, family status, age, citizenship, 
		  disability and veteran status. We believe diversity also includes your 
		  background, your culture, and the experiences you’ve had… the things 
		  that motivate and drive you. It’s about everything that makes you 
		  uniquely you!

          We know we are at our best when we respect, embrace 
		  and value all those differences that make us unique. Join us and be a 
		  part of a culture where customers feel welcome and Associates thrive!
