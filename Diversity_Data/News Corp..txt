CORPORATE DIVERSITY STATEMENT

At News Corp, we appreciate the importance of creating an environment in which all of our employees can feel valued, included and empowered to bring great ideas to the table.
We recognize that each employee’s unique experiences, perspectives, and viewpoints across our various companies are critical to creating products that engage and inspire customers all over the world. Therefore, our goal is to foster an environment that is an incubator for great ideas, is attractive to the best talent, and that creates a profound sense of pride across our Company.
Our diversity and inclusion efforts will therefore focus on:

Leading and managing inclusively – embracing different cultures, ethnicities, genders and sexual orientations
Creating a work environment that fosters growth and advancement
Engaging with our audiences in a way that reflects and respects their unique perspectives and experiences

Our diversity and inclusion objectives, and progress towards achieving them, will be assessed annually to ensure they align with our business and talent objectives.
