We want our employees to be empowered to speak their minds, and to be heard. Every Amazonian should feel comfortable sharing their unique perspectives, and every Amazonian should seek out the perspectives of others. We want our employees and the communities where we operate to embrace that we are all human, we are all different, and we are all equal."
