From the team members we hire to the customers we serve, inclusion and diversity is a way of life at American Airlines. Every day, our team members work to make American a place where people of all generations, races, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, gender identity, disabilities, religious affiliations and backgrounds feel welcome and valued.
"Best place to work"
In 2016 the American Association of People with Disabilities and the US Business Leadership NetworkÂ® named American one of the best places to work and awarded our team a perfect score on the Disability Equality Index for our leadership in the community and diverse employment practices.
