Education
At McDonald’s, we pride ourselves in offering our people world-class learning and education opportunities. From our long legacy of preparing restaurant managers at Hamburger University to running multi-million dollar businesses to our global leadership development programs, we find education and training to be vital for our future competitiveness.
Our Global Diversity, Inclusion & Community Engagement department has created an education portfolio entitled ‘Food for Thought’, Beyond Bias. The overarching objective is to offer an education experience where everyone is aware of their unique ability to create delicious feel-good moments for our customers, and is able to develop meaningful relationships with colleagues that inspire the higher levels of engagement we need to drive business growth.
‘Food for Thought’, Beyond Bias education is firmly centered in our core belief that, “Our Unconscious Bias can slow us down; moving ‘Beyond Bias’ speeds us up”.  Unconscious Bias can negatively impact the potential feel-good moments between our employees and our customers. They are the stereotypes, both negative and positive, that exist in our subconscious that affect our behavior: How we work better together. The level at which we are committed to lead. Our ability to move FAST and be customer obsessed.
