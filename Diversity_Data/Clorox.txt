Today’s global marketplace requires inclusive thinking and diverse, everyday leadership. For us, this means creating a culture where every Clorox employee feels a sense of belonging. It means building a workplace where every person feels respected and valued for his or her unique world view, experiences and thought processes. It means leading by example, at every level within the company, and encouraging each other to share ideas for winning in a multicultural environment.
Our employee resource groups and business resource groups are designed to help drive inclusion and diversity within Clorox. With more than 2,000 members and allies, ERGs and BRGs aim to foster greater understanding of different perspectives and backgrounds through cultural events and panel discussions. These groups are an important forum for career mentorship and development and support to our local communities through regular volunteer activities.
Our ERGs and BRGs also help drive the business by serving as vital internal focus groups, inspiring product innovations, accelerating product placement plans and deepening our understanding of the multicultural consumer. Most of our ERGs began more than a decade ago, but new groups have formed over the years based on employee and business demand.
