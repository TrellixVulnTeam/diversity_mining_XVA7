Diversity and Inclusion
Building, maintaining and expanding a globally inclusive culture is also central to our company’s continuing success. Harris values diverse ideas, perspectives, experiences, backgrounds and lifestyles in our workforce. We recognize that bringing a variety of backgrounds and perspectives to the table generates the innovation that fuels our growth.
Harris strives to create an inclusive environment that enables employees to develop and apply their talents, give back to their communities and advance their careers. Our Employee Resource Groups connect those with shared values and interests and help attract, develop, engage and retain a high performing, diverse workforce.
We are working hard to improve gender representation at all levels of our company. We’ve made good progress and recently held our biennial Women’s Leadership Conference.
