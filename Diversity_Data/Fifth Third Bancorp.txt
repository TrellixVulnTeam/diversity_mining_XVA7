Leadership Message
As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, “It is always the right time to do what is right.”
Those profound and simple words reflect the expectation and absolute dedication at Fifth Third to operate in all respects as a socially responsible company. We work to make a positive impact by treating people both inside and outside our Company with the respect and attention they deserve. With every transaction and every interaction, we want to earn a reputation for being trustworthy and for conducting ourselves in a highly ethical and professional manner. We firmly believe we all are members of one community, and we want to be your one bank.
I’m excited to work for the betterment of our communities. Our $30 billion commitment to the community is a tangible example of our focus on corporate citizenship. It's what building a better kind of bank is all about-the kind of bank that fundamentally improves the lives of customers and the well-being of communities.
