HOW DO WE OPERATE?
We foster inclusion, create a sense of belonging and unleash diversity in all its dimensions. That's how we win with patients. 
At Merck, we understand that diversity and inclusion are fundamental to our success and core to future innovation.
We engage talented, intellectually curious diverse people who feel confident challenging one another's thinking, can experiment and take risks, and can approach problems collectively from multiple points of view to drive business results.
