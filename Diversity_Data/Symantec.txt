UK Gender Pay Gap Report
In April 2017, the UK Government introduced legislation that required organizations with over 250 employees to publish their Gender Pay Gap (GPG) data. The purpose of analyzing and publishing gender pay gap data is to help organizations identify causes of pay disparity, if one exists, and to promote actions to mitigate.
The UK Gender Pay Gap (GPG) regulations have given Symantec an opportunity to see how well we’re living up to our values and commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) in the UK, and across the business. It is important to us that all employees feel a sense of belonging and that they are valued. Our commitment to pay equity continues with further evaluation of existing processes and a focus on closing any gaps that may exist.
