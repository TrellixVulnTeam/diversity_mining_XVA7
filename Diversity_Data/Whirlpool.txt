At Whirlpool Corporation, we value all people, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, age, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, physical ability, thinking/leadership style, or any other visible or invisible diversity. In fact, it is these differences, as well as our unique backgrounds and experiences, that provide the diversity of thought, great ideas, and innovation needed to grow our business. That is why we strive to create an inclusive culture that celebrates and values our diversity, and the difference it can make to our employees, our consumers, and our communities.
