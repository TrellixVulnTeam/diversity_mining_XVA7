Union Pacific’s commitment to diversity and inclusion is based on our desire to create an environment where people can be their best, personally and professionally. From an employee’s perspective, a diverse culture increases engagement, improves morale and supports safety. From a business perspective, diversity improves the company’s decision making, problem solving, and strategic thinking, which translates into a competitive advantage with bottom-line results.
Founded by Abraham Lincoln more than 150 years ago, Union Pacific understands that to remain an innovative, industry-leading company, we must draw upon the expertise and experiences of people from all backgrounds. The company relies on Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) – representing minorities, veterans and women – to help the company attract, engage and develop a diverse workforce. Additionally, these ERGs extend themselves into the many diverse communities we serve through recruiting and volunteer service activities.
Our mission, “Dedicated to Serve,” unites Union Pacific’s employees as we work for the good of our customers, shareholders, communities and one another. Fostering a culture of inclusiveness is critical to position Union Pacific for the next 150 years.
