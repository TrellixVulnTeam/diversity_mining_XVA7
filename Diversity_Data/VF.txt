Our goal to maintain an inclusive culture will help us build a diverse talent pipeline and allow us to better serve our consumers around the world.
EIDC / GWAC
Internally, we have created our Executive Inclusion and Diversity Council (EIDC) to help guide our global I&D Strategy by building and maintaining a highly inclusive culture that celebrates the diversity of our associates and understanding the multicultural marketplace. The EIDC is led by our CEO and includes business leaders from around the world.

These networks are open to all associates and promote advocacy, mentorship, support, education and individual professional development. Our current ERGs include:
