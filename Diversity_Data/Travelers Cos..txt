The insurance industry, and the world, is undergoing dynamic change â€“ Travelers is no exception. We recognize the skills that are critical to our success in a global economy and the overwhelming importance of acquiring a cross section of people whose ideas and views are represented across our company. 
Diversifying your workforce requires accountability, the commitment of your people and an unwavering tenacity. At Travelers, we are dedicated to these tenets of Diversity and Inclusion, and we have challenged ourselves to be innovative and to push through boundaries in order to open avenues across race, color, religion, gender, gender identity, age, national origin, disability, veteran status, marital status, genetic information and sexual orientation.
