At Henry Schein, we encourage, embrace, and appreciate diversity in our workplace, and use our commonalities and differences to leverage and enhance our effectiveness inside and outside our Company. Our Team Schein Members and our customer base reflect the growing cultural diversity of our world. Henry Schein takes part in a variety of initiatives and programs that address and support the issue of diversity in

				our Dental, Medical, International, and Technology businesses. Through our continued involvement, we help our practitioner customers better serve their patients and bring much needed services to underserved communities. We were also one of four founding corporate sponsors of the ADA’s Diversity in Leadership Institute. The Institute was created to foster leadership training and a corporate mentoring network within the dental industry in order to improve the business management skills of dentists from racial, ethnic, or gender backgrounds that have been underrepresented in such roles.
Additionally, we partner with and provide financial and logistical support to organizations such as the Hispanic Dental Association, the Indian Health Services clinics, the National Dental Association, and many other outreach programs within the U.S. and other countries. At Henry Schein, our approach to diversity is part of our Company’s value system—and our commitment of responsibility to our worldwide community.
