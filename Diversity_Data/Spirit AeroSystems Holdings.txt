Defining Diversity

At Spirit, our definition of diversity goes beyond race, gender and age. It considers all the unique qualities each employee brings to the business—job experience, travel and cultural experiences, education and training, and much more. 



“Spirit continues to invest in creating an all-inclusive environment, where employees of all backgrounds and experiences are given the opportunity to make positive contributions to the company and to their own personal development.”
– Lucretia Taylor, Senior Manager of Diversity
