Diversity and inclusion is central to everything we do. It’s evident in every relationship we have – within the workplace where all associates are treated with respect and dignity, across the marketplace by how we interact with our customers and suppliers, and in the community through charitable giving and community service.
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is reflected in how we value relationships, how we conduct business, and how we lead our organization.
We embrace diversity and inclusion because it’s simply the right thing to do.
