Omnicom and its networks are proud supporters of ADCOLOR which was founded by our Chief Diversity Officer, Tiffany R. Warren. ADCOLOR champions diversity and inclusion in creative industries. Their process is twofold. First, they help individuals and organizations RISE UP, letting their accomplishments and ideas shine. Then they teach new leaders and would-be-mentors how to REACH BACK and find others who deserve to be noticed and promoted. ADCOLOR strives to create a network of outstanding diverse professionals and advocates by honoring their accomplishments and leveraging their stories as a road map for others to follow.  By highlighting the achievements of African-Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanics, members of the LGBT community and diversity and inclusion champions, ADCOLOR aims to inspire the next generation of multicultural professionals.
