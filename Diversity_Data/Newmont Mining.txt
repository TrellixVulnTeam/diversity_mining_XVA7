			Historically, the mining industry’s workforce has been male-dominated, especially among leadership ranks. With operations all over the world and recognizing the importance of attracting more diverse talent, Newmont launched business resource groups (BRGs) in 2014 to help foster the exchange of ideas and create a more diverse and inclusive culture.
		

			BRGs can be effective advocates for change and often identify and provide solutions to important business matters. Common activities include enhancing employee engagement; promoting professional development; sponsoring program, policy, system and process changes; and representing Newmont in the community at recruiting and/or philanthropic events aligned with the goals of the BRG. 
		

			To ensure success, we assessed the level of employee interest and enthusiasm as well as existing informal groups. Based on the findings, we formalized the BRG structure in Australia and launched new BRGs at the corporate headquarters in Denver. To date, our BRGs represent the interests of women, veterans, multicultural and millennial generation employees.
		

			Throughout 2014, the BRGs’ contributions toward our goal of building a more inclusive workplace include: 
			
Launched a pilot mentoring program in Australia focused on the development of women;
Created a learning series at our headquarters dedicated to increasing awareness about the areas and cultures where Newmont operates at our headquarters; and
Hosted an event honoring those who served in the United States Armed Forces and partnered with veteran support organizations on volunteer and fundraising opportunities.


			Lessons learned from the initial BRGs will inform improvements as we expand BRGs to additional regions.
