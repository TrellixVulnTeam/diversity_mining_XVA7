                                            We strive to create an inclusive culture which includes and supports gender identity and sexual orientation.
                                            We are dedicated to attracting and developing a diverse, talented workforce that will create and deliver a spectrum of content for our diverse audiences across multiple platforms and live events.
                                        

                                            Workforce diversity, when defined as inclusion, drives a commitment to embrace our differences while creating workable solutions for our
                                            clients. We embrace those differences and consider our differences to be one of our greatest strengths. Inclusion and workforce diversity
                                            are terms used to describe a business strategy. However, at iHeartMedia, Inc. they are much more than that - inclusion is about letting
                                            people in, and eliminating barriers that would keep people out. Inclusion is about people working together, creating solutions for our
                                            advertisers across our multi-media assets of Radio and Outdoor.
                                        

                                            Our ZERO TOLERANCE policy that prohibits discrimination extends beyond our employees, into each and every market in which we conduct
                                            business. We operate openly within a corporate culture that allows each and every employee the opportunity to excel.
