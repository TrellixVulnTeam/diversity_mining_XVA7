Our Burlington
“Our Burlington” is the philosophy behind creating a supportive, results-driven, diverse and fun place for our associates to work, learn and grow.
Diversity

					Our goal is simple—to make diversity and inclusion an integral part of how we run our business, how we serve our customers and communities, and how we engage each other every day.
				
 
					At Burlington, we don’t just talk about diversity, we live it. 
				
 
					Partner organizations include: include the Black Retail Action Group (BRAG), through which Burlington supports a scholarship program and celebrates the recipients at a gala event, and the Philadelphia chapter of the NAACP, through which we participate in a career event to engage candidates from diverse backgrounds.
				
 
					Of our more than 35,000 associates, 74% are female and 70% are people of color. Within our management ranks, 64% percent of our team is female and 37% are people of color.
                
“Your Voice”
 
					Our  annual “Your Voice” survey helps us understand the associate experience, evaluate our performance, identify our strengths, and pinpoint areas of opportunity for improvement. Listening to feedback and taking steps to create positive change are important parts of our mission to be an employer of choice.
				
 
					Recent survey results indicate that over 70% of associates who participated would recommend Burlington as a great place to work!
