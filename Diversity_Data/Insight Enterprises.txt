Insight’s most unique benefit
Each year, our teammates voluntarily donate toward the In It Together Foundation through a payroll deduction. This fund is used to help fellow teammates and their families in times of need.
Since the launch of this program in 2013, we’ve raised $750,000 and helped hundreds of teammates across North America. See what our leaders have to say about this program in celebration of its fifth anniversary.
