It’s our culture and our people. If you ask anyone at NetApp why they work here, the answer is inevitably the same: it’s the people. At NetApp, we place trust, integrity, teamwork, and caring at the heart of what we do. As such, we’ve created a culture where people feel empowered to make a difference; where we’re passionate about innovation and collaboration; and where we take care of each other, our customers, our partners, and our communities simply because it’s the right thing to do.
