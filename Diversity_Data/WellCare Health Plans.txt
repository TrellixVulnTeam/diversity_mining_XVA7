A Passionate Team with One Strong Focus
At WellCare, everyone shares a commitment to our mission - to serve our members and communities in which they live. Our culture is one of empowerment, teamwork and concern as we all work together to help create healthier lives for members and deliver cost-effective solutions.

A Commitment to Embracing Diversity

We know that in order to serve our members, we need the best efforts and ideas of individuals from a multitude of backgrounds, cultures, orientations and perspectives. We believe that diversity is crucial to providing the services we do - and it helps us understand the needs of our members. WellCare provides a welcoming, inclusive and enriching environment for all associates.

A Firm Emphasis on Community

At WellCare, we continually strive to help our members, and their communities, lead better and healthier lives. We have many advocacy and community-based programs designed to connect community resources and help members navigate the local social support network. The WellCare Community Foundation is a non-profit, private foundation whose mission is to foster and promote the health, well-being and quality of life for the poor, distressed and other medically underserved.
We also encourage associate volunteerism, specifically with low-income, underserved and senior populations, through our WellCare Associate Volunteer Efforts (WAVE) program. WellCare's employees proudly champion deserving organizations, such as Feeding America, OneBlood, Habitat for Humanity, Metropolitan Ministries and the United Way.
