It starts with a premise that we are a global company, our members are diverse, and the content we produce should reflect that. In order to tell stories around the world, we need our employees to reflect the world. As we grow globally, we look for employees with a wide range of perspectives and backgrounds. We are an equal opportunity employer and strive to build a diverse team from all walks of life.While the conversation around these topics tend to usually focus on diversity as the solution to all problems, we understand that inclusion plays just as much of an important role, if not more. We believe we have to work from the inside out. If we create a space where all employees and all voices are heard, understood, and appreciated - great work will happen.
