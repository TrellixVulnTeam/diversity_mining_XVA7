Diversity and Inclusion
To understand Halliburton's commitment to diversity and inclusion, you need only look around at our vast global community. The Halliburton community spans more than 70 countries. We have more than 50,000 employees comprising 140 different nationalities, a four- or five-decade range of experience levels, thousands of different combinations of educational backgrounds, all races, male and female. Our Company represents diversity on a global scale, and maintaining a diverse workforce is an integral part of our long-term business plan.
You see, we believe that the most productive team is one that is able to maximize business
                        success by ensuring that the unique contributions of all members are included in the process of
                        finding the best solutions. That’s why, at Halliburton, no matter who you are, or what you look
                        like, you will be given the opportunity to have your voice heard – and the opportunity to
                        succeed. We understand that diversity matters, because great minds don’t always think
                        alike. 
Our Vision
Recognize. Influence. Distinguish. 
Our Mission 
Respect and acknowledge differences which enrich our workforce potential, global communities and
                        competitive edge while creating sustainable business results.
