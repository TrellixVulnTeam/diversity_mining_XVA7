At PG&E, we strive to provide an environment where our employees are enriched by being here and able to do their very best work. We do this by creating an inclusive culture and diverse workforce—one that reflects the diversity of our customers, works to meet the needs of the communities we serve and builds a strong and diverse supply chain. This commitment to diversity and inclusion is a critical part of our values and how we endeavor to approach each person every day.
