Diversity & Inclusion Councils
Tech Data’s Diversity & Inclusion Councils in each  location are comprised of leaders with cross-functional representation. In each  location, councils are charged with integration of Tech Data’s Diversity &  Inclusion (D&I) strategy within our core business. This strategy benefits  our workforce, customers and vendors, as well as the communities we serve.  Their cross-company representation enables them to identify successes and  opportunities from a D&I perspective.
