We are excited to support our employees and enhance our workplace through Employee Resource Groups (ERG). By establishing ERGs, we not only help our employees expand their networks to other areas of Liberty Mutual, but we support our recruitment initiatives, maximize new market opportunities, better meet our customer needs, and develop innovative solutions.We believe that the inclusion of allies is a critical component of ERGs, as it gives employees of different backgrounds an opportunity to learn about others and make their communities stronger. As a result of experiencing each other's similarities and differences through the ERGs, we create an inclusive environment which fosters employee engagement, innovation and enhanced business results.  Amigos@Liberty + Allies — Dedicated to the Hispanic/Latino Community.
