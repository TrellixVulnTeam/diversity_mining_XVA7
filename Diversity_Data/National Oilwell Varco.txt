Diversity

Diversity supplies the strength NOV needs to thrive in a global, ever-changing environment. Because NOV values the varied backgrounds and perspectives of each of our employees, the Company is committed to providing a work environment free of unlawful discrimination and harassment based on any status or activity protected by applicable law, such as race, color, creed, citizenship status, religion, sex, sex stereotyping, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy (which includes pregnancy, childbirth, and medical conditions related to pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding), national origin, ancestry, age, mental or physical disability, marital status, genetic characteristics, veteran status, or any other status protected by applicable law.
Training and Development
Training and talent development are integral to NOV’s success. There are many programs throughout NOV that are designed to develop employees. Achieve, NOV’s learning management system, is utilized to give, track, and assign training as needed throughout the company. Also, NOV offers classes and, in some cases, joins with other institutions to offer specific training or education in areas such as solids control management, environmental regulatory updates, and drilling and equipment handling.
