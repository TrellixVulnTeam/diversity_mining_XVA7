We don’t look the same, act the same or think the same, but across Danaher our associates are united by a shared purpose – to help people realize life’s potential.

“We are working hard to build an organization that celebrates difference, learns from diverse perspectives, and values inclusion as a core foundation of our company culture."
- Ernest Adams, Global Diversity and Inclusion Leader

We believe that real breakthroughs come from teams that think big and respect each other’s differences – different ideas, different perspectives, and different experiences.
We encourage all voices to be heard, both internally as we collaborate and externally as we listen to our customers’ most pressing needs.
We empower creativity and unconventional thinking to help us uncover breakthrough solutions and accelerate the pace of innovation.
We believe with conviction that diversity helps us uncover more powerful customer insights and ultimately creates a competitive advantage in the markets we serve.
But most of all, we recognize that creating a culture rooted in Diversity and Inclusion is an ongoing journey. Our deeply embedded commitment to continuous improvement reminds us that we can keep learning, keep improving and keep striving for better.
