A key component of our journey to becoming a great company is our commitment to global inclusion and diversity. Increased inclusion and diversity helps make BD the right place for all associates. Diversity removes barriers to ensure that every associate has the potential to succeed in reaching their personal and professional goals. It also allows us to attract the best and brightest associates and uncover new business opportunities.
Our people reflect the communities we live and work in, the customers and patients we serve, and our broad range of thought and experience. Their diversity is an integral part of our success. At BD, we acknowledge value and respect diversity. To succeed in a dynamic industry, we have created a work environment where all associates can be their true self.
Inclusion is a state of being valued, respected and supported. It is about focusing on the needs of every individual and ensuring the right conditions are in place for each person to achieve his or her full potential.
Diversity is any dimension that can be used to differentiate groups of people from one another. It means respect for and appreciation of differences in ethnicity, gender, age, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, education and religion.
