Diversity at Citi
Research and experience both confirm that when a company embraces diversity, the most talented people are not just attracted to joining the company, but are also much more productive and motivated to stay. Maintaining a truly diverse environment has been proven to be a leading indicator of the quality of our culture in addition to being an effective way of connecting to an equally diverse client base.
At Citi, our employees reflect the remarkable range of cultures and perspectives of our clients across the more than 160 countries and jurisdictions where we do business â a powerful advantage that combines global insights with deep local knowledge. We recognize that unique individuals, collaborative teams and inclusive leaders have far-reaching impact and are the engines of new ideas. Itâs our willingness to embrace the richness of our diverse teams, ideas and possibilities that drives our growth and progress.
Embracing diverse teams, ideas and possibilities helps us drive growth and progress because itâs a key part of who we are and how we thrive.
