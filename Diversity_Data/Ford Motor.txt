Diversity at Work
It is important that we embed our Diversity & Inclusion strategies into every part of our company, to leverage our innovative workforce, compete in the marketplace, and to serve the community. Therefore, Diversity & Inclusion is a collaborative effort across our entire enterprise. Some of our cross-functional collaboration includes working with: Employee Resource Groups, Ford Fund & Community Services, Minority Dealer Operations, Recruiting, Supplier Diversity, and Worklife Flexibility & Benefits Programs.
Employee Resource Groups (ERGs)
Ford has demonstrated commitment to both diversity and inclusion by endorsing and leveraging the power of Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). ERG’s are organizations of employees who share similar characteristics or life experiences, and desire to use those similarities to create cross-functional workplace connections, provide professional development and advance business imperatives. Ford’s ERG’s were started in the early 1990s and now include thousands of employees in a number of organizations throughout the world.  Ford’s senior leaders actively demonstrate visible commitment to diversity and inclusion by serving as key sponsors to our ERGs, which provide support, guidance and resources.  As a result, our ERGs have supported our company by helping the business to attract, develop and retain talent. They hold educational and cultural events and support many diversity-related efforts such as college campus recruiting. Participation is open to all Ford employees. Read more about each ERG at Ford.
Ford Fund & Community Services
Ford Fund & Community Services leads our corporate citizen initiatives in the communities we serve by supporting not-for-profit organizations in three major areas: Education, Community Development, and Auto Safety. Since 1949, Ford Fund & Community Services has provided more than $1 billion in investments with partners who help us drive a brighter future, and have placed a high priority on supporting organizations that promote diversity and inclusion.

Dealer Diversity
Diversity and inclusiveness are part of Ford’s DNA, and growing a strong minority presence in our dealerships remains a key focus. At year-end 2013, Ford had 164 minority-owned dealerships, which represents 5 percent of our 3,263 U.S. Ford and Lincoln dealerships. At Ford, we continue to work with our Ford Minority Dealers Association (Ford MDA) to sustain and strengthen the current minority dealer portfolio with dedicated resources to increase profitability. Together we are directing efforts toward growing the minority ranks of dealership management and employment to better reflect the community and to facilitate a greater number of future Minority Dealer principals.
Recruiting
Ford always explores new opportunities to seek top talent globally with innovative ideas to help us compete.  Whether a fresh graduate or a seasoned professional, our employees are on the forefront of developing technologies and innovations that have a positive impact on the lives of our customers and contribute to a better world. As such, we seek the best and the brightest from all over the globe by participating in a multitude of diverse career fair events. Within the U.S., Ford has formal partnerships with six professional organizations who strive to generate diverse talent for the company.

Supplier Diversity Development
Ford Motor Company’s (Ford) Supplier Diversity Development (SDD) Program was launched in 1978, one of the first programs in the United States. Ford recognized that it had a social responsibility to provide business opportunities to diverse communities that had been historically, socially and economically disadvantaged. When the company initiated its SDD Program, there were few Minority, Women or Veteran owned and operated companies with the capability to deliver the goods and services required by Ford and other automotive manufacturers. 
In 1978, at the direction of Henry Ford II, a program was designed to identify high-potential minority entrepreneurs and assist them in growing their companies to competitive positions in the automotive industry. Having achieved success in the minority business community, Ford expanded its program in 1995 to include Women owned businesses and encouraged their growth in the automotive industry. In 2013, Ford included Veteran owned businesses in its diversity program. Since the launch of our program, Ford has spent more than $74 billion with diverse suppliers. 
Ford’s SDD Program is nationally recognized for its leadership and continually strives to manifest its tradition of corporate social responsibility and achieve its business objectives consistent with the Program’s guiding principles:
- To deliver extraordinary support and assistance to certified Minority, Woman, and Veteran owned business that have been historically, socially and economically disadvantaged.
- To create business opportunities and initiatives that enable diverse suppliers to grow into profitable and sustainable enterprises.
- To have the Ford supply base reflect the Company's workforce and customer base.

Worklife Flexibility Programs and Benefits
The challenges presented by a dynamic environment of intensifying global competition and a changing set of employee needs and expectations present us with many strategic opportunities. Our inclusive worklife programs, such as reduced and flexible schedules, job sharing, and telecommuting options, provide us with a viable means to meet our business challenges and provides high employee engagement and satisfaction.
To ensure success with our worklife programs, we equip our employees with cutting edge IT productivity and communication tools that transform our employees into virtual “digital workers.”
The benefits of such inclusive programs lead to increased productivity, innovation, quality and profitability, as well as better job satisfaction and commitment.
