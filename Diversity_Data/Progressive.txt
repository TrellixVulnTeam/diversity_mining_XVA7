Hilda
Manager CRMPhoenix, Arizona21 years at Progressive
One thing is certain: Hilda doesn't sit still or settle. At a young age, she watched as family members ran their own businesses in her home country of Guatemala. That entrepreneurial spirit was instilled in her and is one reason she is constantly looking to grow, learn, and share with others.
Before she started at Progressive 21 years ago, she craved a company culture that shared her personal values. She found that the culture and core values here were a pretty great fit with her own, especially when it comes to integrity.
Hilda was first hired as a bi-lingual consultant working with both Spanish- and English-speaking customers. She's never looked back and has continued to expand and share her skills and talents. "I grow to give back, both at work and in the community. I know I can't help others if I don't develop myself first."
She also led Progressive's Latin American Networking Association (PLANETA). She and other PLANETA board members have worked to help Progressive people better understand and communicate with our Latino customer base, candidates, and employees, as well as provide development opportunities for employees. Outside of work, she volunteers at her church and is a big advocate of young people and teachers.
