We are passionate about the individuals who make up our company and believe it is incumbent upon our leaders – and all of us as colleagues – to create and maintain an environment where employees can contribute to their potential. Valuing diversity and inclusion is key to this mindset.
While Corning’s formal diversity journey began in the early 1970s, we are a company whose success as one of the world’s leading innovators in materials science has been built by the brilliance and determination of our diverse workforce for more than 165 years. Today we celebrate diversity and inclusion on a global scale with more than 40,000 employees in nearly 25 countries.
It is a priority for us to attract, develop, promote, and retain the world’s best diverse talent with deep technical and commercial knowledge. We want Corning to be the employer of choice for these individuals, and we distinguish ourselves through our strong Values, approach to inclusion, and a robust portfolio of employee development offerings.
Another priority is to expand leadership opportunities for Corning’s diverse emerging talent, and this focus is paying off. Over the past decade, our diversity and inclusion efforts have significantly improved the representation of diverse individuals at the highest levels of the organization. Going forward, we will continue these efforts to ensure our diverse talent is given every opportunity to be a part of the global leadership team that carries Corning forward in our chosen markets for another 165 years.
