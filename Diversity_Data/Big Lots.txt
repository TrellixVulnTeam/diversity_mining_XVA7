"I've been an associate for over 15 years, since the store opened, and have done various roles from cashier to inventory prep. But my new role as a leader has taught me so much. Learning everything you can is the best way to grow and keep moving forward. You have to be organized, approachable and able to communicate effectively. And never underestimate the power of teamwork. You need your team to be successful."
Janice, Dock To Stock Lead
