OUR COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY.
We recognize the value that diversity contributes to our organization and the competitive advantage we can maintain by having a broad range of talents, perspectives, and ideas with a commitment to continuously improving our business.
We ensure every Associate, applicant, customer, vendor, and shareholder is treated equitably, and we respect the attributes they offer. Examples of such attributes may include age, race, color, gender, disability, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, gender identity, national origin, marital status, and citizenship. Furthermore, we acknowledge the values and needs of a richly diverse customer base, and support the communities where our Associates live and where we do business.
