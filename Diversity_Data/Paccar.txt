PACCAR is committed to providing a workplace free of discrimination, harassment and retaliation. PACCAR expects all employees to comply with our Code of Business Conduct and equal employment opportunity commitments.
PACCAR will not discriminate against individuals on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, disability, veteran or other legally protected status. This applies to recruitment, selection, placement, promotion, termination, rates of pay, and other conditions of employment.
Harassment based upon a personâ€™s race, color, religion, national origin, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, disability, veteran or other legally protected status is a violation of PACCAR policy. Harassment includes disparaging or derogatory comments, or other improper conduct by a manager or supervisor, coworker or a non-employee business contact such as a supplier or contractor and may occur on or off PACCAR premises.
