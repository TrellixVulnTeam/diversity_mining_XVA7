Serving our communities.Conagra feels a deep responsibility to care for the communities where our employees and customers live and work. At a time when communities often face tough challenges, we look for ways to leverage our support – product donations, employee volunteerism and cash contributions – to make the greatest possible impact. Conagra’s employees bring a passion for community involvement and service, multiplying the benefits of our corporate giving.NOURISHING THOSE IN NEEDHunger is an issue we’re especially passionate about. We believe everyone has a right to healthy and nutritious food. Through the Conagra Brands Foundation, we support select nonprofit organizations working on a broad array of initiatives, such as food access, nutrition education, cooking skills, and healthy and active lifestyles. We’ve even supported select urban agricultural programs that, in addition to increasing food access, provide entrepreneurial skills to help individuals participate in the farm-to-fork economy.
