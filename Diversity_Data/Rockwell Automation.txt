CAREER MANAGEMENT
When our employees are matched with the right role, research tells us and we know from our own experiences that they have the best opportunity to contribute, doing work that is valuable and rewarding to them, the company and to support our customers every day.
Suitability Model
                                  The Suitability Model is a research-based methodology that will help us match the right people to the right roles. The model, which can be applied to any role in the organization, helps managers assess an individual's capability to specific role requirements, guide development planning and make placement decisions.
