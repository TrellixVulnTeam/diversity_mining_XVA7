Driving innovation with a diverse team
Diversity is the catalyst of innovation. We’re committed to empowering talented people from every background and perspective to thrive. And we are proud to be recognized on Fortune’s 2018 list of Most Admired Companies. We strive for a diverse workforce that includes people of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, gender and sexual orientation, veteran status, abilities, and those who bring diverse thoughts, opinions, experience, and leadership styles - and all other characteristics that make people unique. Our culture reflects our commitment to diversity as well. We work in ways that honors involvement, respect, collaboration and connection—where the richness of ideas, backgrounds, and perspectives are cultivated to create business impact. We embrace these principles in all that we do, to deliver the best customer experience and make PayPal the best place to work. And we actively support our employees through our Diversity & Inclusion Communities, open to all who support the community vision: PayPal Pride, Unity, Opportunity, Serve, and Amplify.
These communities:• Act as a key support mechanism and sounding board for our commitment to creating a fully inclusive environment for all PayPal employees.• Serve as a collective voice around shared issues or concerns specific to the needs of a particular community, promoting a sense of “belonging” and an inclusive and respectful workplace.• Provide opportunities for employee development, education, training, recruitment, retention and business outreach and development. • Support innovation by providing insights on new markets, product development, and multicultural marketing, while enhancing PayPal’s reputation in the marketplace.
