Diversity and Inclusion
Diversity: Embrace it. Share it. Celebrate it!
Here at Hertz Global, we believe our core strength lies in our ability to embrace differences and create opportunities for all employees, customers, owners and franchisees, and suppliers. A diverse body of talent with fresh ideas and perspectives is one of the essential ingredients to a company's long-term success.

What does Diversity mean to us?
Diversity is at the heart of our business. It's a way of thinking. It's an assortment of different thoughts, beliefs, and ways of living. We believe in equality for everyone, regardless of race, age, gender, gender identity, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation.
Our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are voluntary, employee-led groups that serve as a resource for our team by fostering a diverse, inclusive workplace aligned with Hertz Global's mission, values, goals, business practices, and objectives. Members of the ERGs work together to create a positive work environment at Hertz Global by actively contributing to our mission and efforts specific to inclusion, such as recruitment and retention. They provide personal and professional development through mentoring, volunteerism, and community involvement.
