BUILDING A BALANCED TEAM
As one of the nation's premier energy companies, NextEra Energy is committed to recruiting, developing and retaining great people at all levels. A key part of that commitment is to attract and maintain a diverse and multi-generational workforce that can help us meet the continually evolving needs of our customers. To reinforce our commitment, we continue to develop and implement corporate-wide diversity and inclusion training for all of our employees and further strengthen our Corporate Diversity Council and Employee Resource Groups.
At NextEra Energy, we define diversity broadly. We provide an inclusive work environment that is free from discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, color, age, sex, national origin, religion, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, genetics, disability or protected veteran status. We also appreciate diversity of thought, style, technical and functional capabilities or leadership. When talented employees from varied backgrounds are engaged and contributing to our business success, we all benefit.
