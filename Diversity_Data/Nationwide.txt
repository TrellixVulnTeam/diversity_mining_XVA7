Our philosophy
A diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to Nationwide's success. Bringing together the unique characteristics of each of our associates -- gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, nationality, disability, veteran status, ethnicity, race, religion as well as many other differences such as thinking styles, personalities and work experience -- is an integral part of who we are and how we operate as a company. We are proud of Nationwide's inclusive culture that supports every associate's success and encourages an environment where they can feel challenged, appreciated, respected and engaged.
