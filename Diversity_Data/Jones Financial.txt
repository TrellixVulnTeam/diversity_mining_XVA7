This program was created to foster mentoring relationships. It encourages cross-cultural development of mentor and mentee relationships to create an opportunity for both parties to learn more about each other and their cultures.


The mentors are encouraged to learn about their mentees' work styles, their strengths and development needs in terms of career strategies and leadership potential. Mentors also share their knowledge and experiences with mentees to help aid in the mentee's ability to identify strategies for personal and professional development.
