Diversity and inclusion are essential to our ability to deliver on our promise to help customers secure their financial futures. 
Our commitment
We believe diversity of thought, background, experience and people drive innovation. It is through our inclusive culture that we can attract the best employees, empower our customers, and help our communities achieve great things.
At Lincoln, diversity broadly encompasses: attributes of people such as mindset, physical and sociological traits including, but not limited to, race; ethnicity; gender; age; physical abilities; socio-economic status; sexual orientation and gender identity and expression; veteran status; religious beliefs; political beliefs; and other ideologies and perspectives in the workplace, marketplace and communities in which we operate. By inclusion, we mean a sense of belonging: feeling respected, valued for who you are; feeling a level of supportive energy and commitment from others so that you can do your best work.
Lincoln Financial is honored that many of the practices we have established, refined and implemented have been acknowledged with industry awards and recognition.
