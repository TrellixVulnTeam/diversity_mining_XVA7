A Culture of Inclusion
SunTrust believes it takes a well-rounded combination of people and ideas to foster creativity and a more competitive company. That’s why we’re committed to fostering an inclusive environment where we acknowledge, respect and employ all dimensions of diversity and where all teammates have the opportunity to maximize their contributions to our clients and communities.
At SunTrust, creating a culture of inclusion means:

Attracting and retaining the most talented and effective workforce
Creating an atmosphere of respect that capitalizes on our differences
Fostering beneficial community relationships
Reaching out to different segments of the community
Providing proactive supplier opportunities for minority-, women-, LGBT-, veteran-, disabled-owned and small businesses

Here are just a few ways SunTrust promotes a diverse and inclusive environment:
We have an inclusive corporate culture. 
The SunTrust Executive Inclusion Committee provides leadership to ensure inclusion is woven into the business strategy. The Enterprise Inclusion Council and eight teammate networks represent "inclusion in action" where teammates carry out strategies to sustain an inclusive corporate culture.
We nurture business growth in our communities. 
We identify lending, investment and partnership opportunities with companies in our communities which provide business growth and economic expansion.
We give back to our communities.
SunTrust teammates are encouraged to volunteer with community service organizations and schools to build stronger communities.
We've received public recognition for promoting inclusion.
Black Enterprise Magazine, Atlanta Business Journal, Virginia Center for Inclusive Communities, Spelman College, Human Rights Campaign, Diversity Journal and the Florida Diversity Council have recognized SunTrust for our inclusive efforts.
