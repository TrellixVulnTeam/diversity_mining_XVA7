We believe diversity includes the broadest possible range of cultures, backgrounds, experiences and perspectives, while inclusion means creating an environment where all people and ideas are valued. Our goal is to welcome everyone â customers, employees, suppliers and visitors alike. Our passion for diversity and inclusion is not only about doing the right thing; it also helps us achieve our purpose to help people secure their future and protect the ones they love.

Diversity at Every Level
For diversity to live across an organization, it also needs to live at every level. Thatâs why we actively pursue workforce diversity, including in our boardroom. 45 percent of our Board of Directors is comprised of women and people of color, making it one of the most diverse groups in the industry and among FORTUNEÂ® 5001 companies.
We place a strong emphasis on relationship-building activities, like engaging diverse employees in mentoring and networking opportunities and efforts that drive business impact (Check out the opportunities). Our Business Resource Groups (BRGs) are internal diversity and inclusion champions who support recruitment, community outreach, awareness and education, brand recognition, marketing, retention and professional development. We currently have eight national BRGs representing African Americans, Asians, Latinx, members of the LGBTQ community, individuals with disabilities and their caregivers, armed forces members, veterans and military family members, young professionals and women leaders.
