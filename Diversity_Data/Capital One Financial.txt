 We started Capital One with a simple principle—attract great talent and give them the opportunity to be great.
Embracing diversity is critical to getting the best talent. We believe our workforce should reflect the communities and customers we serve. Our associates bring a diversity of backgrounds, perspectives and experiences to our company. Harnessing the collective wisdom of our people enables us to build a great company and bring breakthrough products and services to our more than 65 million customers. Ensuring that Capital One is a place where all people can thrive also reflects our company’s values: Excellence and Do The Right Thing.
We want to unleash the talents of our more than 40,000 associates to deliver on our mission to bring ingenuity, simplicity and humanity to banking. We embrace a meritocracy of ideas without regard to sex, race, color, age, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, protected veteran, disability or other protected status. We have embedded diversity throughout our talent acquisition, talent management and supplier practices, and our efforts have been recognized. Among many awards, we’re honored to have been named a Top Company for Executive Women and one of the Best Places to Work for LGBT and Disability Inclusion. We’ve also been recognized by the National Minority Supplier Development Council with a Corporation of the Year award for Corporate Excellence in Access to Capital.
I am fortunate to work with the amazing people of Capital One. To a person, they lead with their hearts and elevate those around them. Diversity in all of its forms—diversity of people and diversity of thought—will remain a foundational part of who we are and how we work.
