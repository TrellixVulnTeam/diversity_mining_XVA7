Reach Out Helps Promising Women Advance
American Express was the primary sponsor of Reach Out, a first-of-its-kind, 10-month program launched in India to provide women leaders from 5 top Indian companies with the skills, contacts and inspiration they need to reach the highest levels of their organization.
Participants attended online and in-person events, forums, and learning circles, with both peers and senior leaders. Each of the participating companies hosted a group workshop focusing on a specific topic, such as the need for executive sponsorship of women leaders.
