GLOBAL DIVERSITY & INCLUSION


Diversity of talent. Diversity of customers.
Diversity of suppliers. Diversity of experiences.
Making a world of difference.
At Praxair, we strive to create a work environment that treats all employees with respect, supports new thoughts and ideas, encourages growth and development, recognizes our differences, and embraces inclusion. Praxair is also committed to partnering with others to help ensure that we remain an employer of choice for the ever-increasing pool of diverse global talent.

As a high-performing global industry leader, we must attract, retain and develop a diverse, talented and engaged workforce that reflects the diverse populations in which we operate and grow our businesses. And we do this by providing strong, dynamic leadership, a challenging work environment, industry-leading performance, competitive pay and benefits, and rewards and recognition for outstanding performance.Â
