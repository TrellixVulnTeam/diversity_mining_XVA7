What Do We Value?
Since 2014, we’ve been on a journey to become a Purpose-driven organization. It started by defining our Purpose, Real food that matters for life’s moments, which helped us capture who we are, what we believe, and the company we want to be.
Our Purpose serves as our guide through the seismic shifts taking hold in consumer and industry trends. And, it’s been a guide through the changes we’ve made within our own organization – through the repositioning of our businesses, the shift in our talent, and the addition of several companies that joined our team to accelerate our growth and innovation.
We’ve made great progress on our journey, including our work to define what real food means to us through our Real Food Philosophy. But, we have more to do. To truly activate the philosophy and become a purpose-driven organization with innovation at the helm, now is the time to reinvent our culture, and that starts with a simple question – What do we value?
In 2016 the Campbell Leadership Team set out to answer that question. Each word was meticulously and purposefully chosen with the goal of redefining Campbell’s Values to create the behaviors and culture we need to live into our Purpose.
We believe in these Values and the accompanying behaviors that put forward a clear and simple call-to-action in our relentless effort to grow and innovate. They are a representation of what our company and our people have always stood for, while also inspiring us to embrace change to compete effectively in a dynamic marketplace.
Diversity and inclusion, workplace flexibility and corporate social responsibility are key elements of our culture, as you can see in related sections on this site.
We are Purpose-driven and Values-led. Join us on our journey as we become the leading health and well-being food company and help us deliver superior consumer value.
