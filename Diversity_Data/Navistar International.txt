InclusionNavistar believes in a corporate culture where the different perspectives and insights of professionals from varying backgrounds are equally valued â and equally encouraged. And we work hard to ensure it. We believe that all Navistar team members should have the ability to recognize their career goals, and we actively encourage respect and openness amongst all employees. We have a singular goal as an organization â to be recognized globally as the premier performer in our space â and at Navistar, we rely each of our 12,000 employees to work together toward this one objective.VeteransAt Navistar, we believe our returning warriors are one of our nationâs most precious resources. In addition to doing all we can to ensure the safety of our troops at home and abroad, we are proud to support the Wounded Warrior Projectâ¢, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to honor and empower wounded warriors. Tens of thousands of wounded warriors and caregivers receive support each year through WWP programs designed to nurture the mind and body, and encourage economic empowerment and engagement.

We are also active supporters of the WWPâs Warriors to Work program and consider it a privilege to stand by our soldiers as they return to the civilian workforce. To this end, we have pledged â through the First Lady and Dr. Jill Bidenâs Joining Forces initiative â that at least 6 percent of employees hired between August 2011 and December 2013 will be veterans.
