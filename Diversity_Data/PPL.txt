We understand at PPL that differences make us stronger.
We see diversity as beyond race and gender. We value differences in thinking that arise from different backgrounds, socio-economic, visible and invisible disability, generational and life stages. We are committed to ensuring our employees feel welcomed, valued and included so that they can be as effective and successful as possible at work.
PPL supports the principles of non-discrimination and equal opportunity. We recognize that our communities are diverse, and our goal is to empower others to celebrate differences and raise understanding. We are committed to promoting an inclusive culture through volunteerism and partnerships with nonprofit organizations devoted to furthering diverse, accepting communities.
