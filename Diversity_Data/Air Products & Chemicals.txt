Individually Strong, Collectively Powerful
With about approximately 16,000 employees in 50 countries, diversity and inclusion is a valued part of the culture of Air Products. The unique perspectives and experiences our employees bring to their work are essential to meeting our customers’ needs and bringing innovation to the wide range of markets we serve, from food processing to metals processing to transportation. That is why we’ve set a goal to become the most diverse industrial gas company in the world and why we foster a collaborative and respectful work environment where everyone can achieve their true potential.



“We need to create an atmosphere of respect for everybody, no matter where they come from. If you hire people who look like you, talk like you, and think like you, how do you find the unique perspective? How do you challenge the status quo if everyone on the team sees the world the same?”
