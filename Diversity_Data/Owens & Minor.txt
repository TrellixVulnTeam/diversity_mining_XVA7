Diverse Perspectives Make Us Stronger
'Together' may well be the most important word in our company's Vision Statement because it conveys our commitment to collaboration, diversity, and inclusion. At Owens & Minor, we know we cannot accomplish our goals unless we work togetherâ€”together with our manufacturer and provider customers, and our talented, diverse group of teammates.

Our company highly values the diverse perspectives of our manufacturer and provider customers, our business partners, and our teammates. We insist on inclusion, support, and respect. We nurture, engage, and empower those around us. We invest in and participate as active members of the larger, global communities in which we live and work.
At Owens & Minor, we believe that the power of collaboration helps make healing happen for the patients our customers serve.
