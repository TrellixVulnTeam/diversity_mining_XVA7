Flexibility
Our people power our organization, and our sustainability depends on meeting our employees’ diverse needs while also addressing business needs. With a more flexible work environment, we can achieve positive outcomes for both.
When possible, flexible work arrangements can help you balance work and personal commitments with alternatives to the traditional workday, the standard workweek or the traditional workplace. Our formal Flex Work Program offers five possible flex work options: flex place (remote working), flex time, compressed schedules, reduced schedules or job-sharing.
Sponsorships and Partnerships
Around the world, we work with many organizations that provide you with career development resources:
Boston WINs
We launched Boston Workforce Investment Network (Boston WINs) in June 2015. Boston WINs is our multi-year $20-million venture philanthropy initiative founded and led by the State Street Foundation in partnership with five high-performing nonprofits focused on education and career development. Through this financial support and a collaborative approach, our partners will scale their reach so that more Boston youth will receive key services to prepare them for college and career success.
