At SpartanNash, we are fueled by our passion to provide our customers, coworkers and communities with the best quality products, services and shopping experiences possible. Yet our drive takes us so much further than the aisles of the local grocery store or U.S. military commissary.
As a Fortune 400 company with a family of nearly 15,000 associates, we are continuously evaluating our social responsibility and environmental sustainability initiatives to ensure our corporate responsibility commitments create impact and remain in alignment with our financial performance and expanding operations.
We are excited to share our 2017 Corporate Responsibility Report, which highlights our commitments and accomplishments in our five focus areas – cultivating local relationships and product development, advancing diversity and inclusion, volunteering, minimizing waste and reducing energy consumption.
At SpartanNash, we are mindful that our business decisions, products, services and operations have a direct impact on the environment, our communities, customers and coworkers. As you flip through the 2017 Corporate Responsibility Report, you’ll see how our corporate responsibility commitments come to life – through both stories and statistics – as we take food places in more sustainable, socially conscious ways.
Take a look and let us know what you think.
