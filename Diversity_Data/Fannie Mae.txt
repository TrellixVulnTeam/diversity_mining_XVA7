 
Why is diversity and inclusion a vital part of who we are and what we do at Fannie Mae? It allows us to better serve America's diverse housing market. Simply put, we believe that a diverse, inclusive workforce makes us a better place to work and helps us achieve better business results for the people who count on us.
Engaging our Employees
Our goal is to support an inclusive culture that enables all employees to be fully engaged and feel respected and valued for who they are, enabling them to do their best work and achieve the company’s vision to be America's most valued housing partner. Ten different Employee Resource Groups—including African American, LGBT, Indians in the U.S., Christian, Young Professionals, and Muslim—offer employees of all backgrounds and interests a chance to connect, learn, and grow as we support Fannie Mae's important work.
