CSX prides itself on fostering an inclusive culture where every employee is fully engaged to maximize his or her potential. This dedication allows us to better serve our customers and create a competitive advantage.
		Â 

Our focus on diversity has received national recognition, and we are constantly looking for new ways to be more inclusive. This is why CSX employees participate in inclusion groups, community events and employee engagement surveys that help us identify new ways to create a collaborative culture.

	What Diversity, Inclusion and Engagement Mean to CSX:
Diversity is Who We Are
We appreciate all the characteristics that make each of us unique - the discernible attributes like race, gender or age; and the less evident ones like personality, education, military status, life experiences, sexual orientation or identity, and geographic origin. Our openness to diversity broadens our access to the best talent and ensures we retain a dynamic workforce that continually contributes to our legacy of achievement.
Inclusion is How We Work Together
By providing a workplace where everyone feels welcome, we help ensure our people respect and trust one another and that each of us has the opportunity to grow and perform to our greatest potential. We encourage all employees to contribute their distinctive skills and capabilities to help us realize our vision of being the safest, most progressive North American railroad, relentless in the pursuit of customer and employee excellence.
Engagement is How Connected We Feel
We are in this together - the success of our people directly impacts the success of our business. We want to hear employees' ideas and concerns, ensure people feel valued, and provide everyone with the information they need to do their jobs well. In doing so, we engage each employee to become more enthusiastic about our company, to speak highly of CSX, and to perform their best work every day to help drive business results.
