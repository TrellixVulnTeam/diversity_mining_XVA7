DEAR
CUSTOMERS 
EMPLOYEES 
AND
SHAREHOLDERS 

At  Nordstrom,  our  number  one  goal  is  to  improve  customer 
service.  This  approach  has  always  guided  our  strategy  and 
served  our  stakeholders  well.  2015  was  no  exception  though 
we  faced  a  challenging  retail  environment  in  the  second  half 
of  the  year.  We  ended  2015  with  record  sales  of  $14.1  billion, 
an  increase  of  approximately  $1  billion  from  the  prior  year.  
We  also  increased  our  market  share,  with  net  sales  growth  of 
7.5  percent  and  a  comparable  sales  increase  of  2.7  percent.  
For the first half of the year, we achieved results that exceeded 
our expectations. In the second half, we experienced a noticeable 
shift  in  consumer  spending  that  has  continued  into  the  early 

months  of  2016.  With  our  team’s  many  years  of  experience 
successfully managing through challenging cycles, we worked to 
adjust our sales expectations, inventories and expenses as quickly 
as possible to reflect these trends. Even with these adjustments, 
higher markdowns taken as a result of lower-than-planned sales, 
combined  with  an  elevated  promotional  environment  during 
the  holiday  season,  caused  our  earnings  results  to  be  below 
our  expectations.  We  continue  to  monitor  trends  and  make 
appropriate adjustments to ensure that we remain competitive, 
have the best product available for our customers and improve 
our overall results.

CUSTOMER STRATEGY
We’ve made many strategic decisions over the years to evolve our 
business as our customers’ preferences have evolved. Nordstrom 
was  among  the  first  retailers  to  invest  in  ecommerce,  new 
technologies and organizational alignment to support a seamless 
customer  experience.  While  retail  and  customer  expectations 
are changing at an even faster pace today than just a few years  
ago, we believe our attention to the customer keeps us focused 
on long-term success.

Our customers desire a relevant experience no matter how they 
choose  to  shop—full-price,  off-price,  in  stores  or  online.  Each 
represents  an  opportunity  for  us  to  connect  with  customers 
on  their  terms,  which  means  an  experience  that  is  increasingly 
relevant,  convenient  and  personalized.  Our  goal  is  to  build  a 
seamless ‘One Nordstrom’ customer experience. We know the 
value of our strategy, in addition to driving sales, new customer 
acquisition  and  increased  market  share,  is  that  customers  who 
shop Nordstrom across multiple channels spend more than that

BIG SUCCESS IN B.C.: THE OPENING OF OUR FIRST INTERNATIONAL FLAGSHIP STORE IN VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, MARKED THE MOST SUCCESSFUL  
IN OUR HISTORY. LOCATED IN THE HEART OF DOWNTOWN VANCOUVER, THIS NEW STORE IS AN EXCITING STEP FORWARD IN ENRICHING OUR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE,  
AND WILL PROVIDE GREAT LEARNINGS AS WE OPEN FLAGSHIP STORES IN TORONTO IN 2016 AND MANHATTAN IN 2019.

of  a  single-channel  customer.  The  total  number  of  customers 
we  serve,  the  number  of  new-to-Nordstrom  customers  and 
customer engagement (those who shop more than one channel) 
are all up. One highlight of this is that 5 million new customers 
shopped Nordstrom Rack in 2015—an important channel for us 
for acquisition and increased cross-shopping.

We’ve  made  significant  investments  that  enable  customers 
to  shop  seamlessly  across  stores  and  online,  as  well  as  grow 
our  business  through  new  markets  like  Canada  and  expanded 
ecommerce capabilities—all of which have helped increase sales 
and market share. Our online business now represents more than 
20 percent of our total net sales, a notable increase from eight 
percent just five years ago. With over $3 billion in capital invested 
over the last five years, we grew net sales by 50 percent, or nearly  
$5 billion during this time. We’ve always considered 2015 to be a 
peak investment year and that hasn’t changed. What has changed 
is the current environment, which requires us to adapt even more 
as we remain focused on improving profitability. 

FULL-PRICE:  
NORDSTROM AND NORDSTROM.COM 
As  a  full-price  retailer,  the  constant  pursuit  of  newness  and 
fashion  to  increase  relevance  with  customers  is  at  the  core  of 
our business. We’ve also invested to enable a seamless customer 
experience  across  stores  and  online.  When  we  execute  well, 
we’re  able  to  differentiate  ourselves  and  offer  customers  a 
consistently  great  shopping  experience  on  their  terms.  We’re 

continuously  improving  the  experience  we  offer  customers  in 
our full-line stores with improved services such as Buy Online & 
Pick Up in Store, which we launched in 2008, and more recently,  
curbside delivery. 

Comparable  sales  of  our  full-price  business—Nordstrom  U.S. 
full-line  stores  and  Nordstrom.com—increased  2.3  percent  in 
2015, and net sales for our full-price business, inclusive of Canada 
and Trunk Club, increased 5.1 percent. We opened five new full-
line stores last year including our first international flagship store 
in Vancouver, British Columbia, which was the most successful 
opening in Nordstrom history. This store represents a major step 
forward and will help influence the level of service we envision as 
we execute our plans to expand our flagship presence to Toronto 
in 2016 and Manhattan in 2019. We continue to believe Canada 
represents  a  $1  billion  opportunity  and  we’re  pleased  with  our 
results to date. We also opened stores in Ottawa, Ontario; San 
Juan,  Puerto  Rico;  and  Milwaukee;  a  second  full-line  store  in 
Minneapolis; and relocated one store in Los Angeles. Each new 
store reflects our latest store design, which is now featured in 10 
locations, including significant remodels of our flagship stores in 
Seattle and on Michigan Avenue in Chicago. In 2016, we plan to 
open two full-line stores in Toronto, including our second flagship 
store in Canada, our second store in Austin, and we relocated our 
store in Honolulu, which opened on March 11, 2016.

We believe that by 2020, one-third of our customer experiences 
will  end  with  a  package  at  their  front  door.  As  a  result,  when

shopping online, how and when that package arrives helps shape 
how  that  customer  views  great  service.  To  support  the  growth 
of Nordstrom.com in 2015 we opened a new fulfillment center 
in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania that, combined with our existing 
facilities in Cedar Rapids and San Bernardino, greatly improves 
our ability to meet and exceed our customers’ rising expectations. 

Customers  want  to  do  business  with  retailers  that  are  in  step 
with  how  they  choose  to  shop  and  mobile  is  an  increasingly 
important link between the store and online experience. This year 
we made several improvements to our mobile app that enhance 
the customer experience, such as linking a customer’s Nordstrom 
Rewards account to their Nordstrom app and a ‘shop my store’ 
feature that allows customers to filter inventory that is specific to 
the store they’re shopping. Each improvement is designed to offer 
the customer more control of their own experience. As a result, 
we’ve seen strong growth in mobile sales, which now represents 
over one-third of online demand, up from less than five percent 
just five years ago.

TRUNK CLUB 
In  2014  we  acquired  Trunk  Club,  a  high-growth  personalized 
clothing service that complements our own approach to customer 
service.  In  fall  2015  we  collaborated  to  expand  this  concept 
with the launch of Trunk Club for women. Trunk Club is a great 
example of combining the online and offline worlds to deliver a 
personalized, differentiated shopping experience.

OFF-PRICE: NORDSTROM RACK,  
NORDSTROMRACK.COM AND HAUTELOOK
Nordstrom Rack is a wonderful source of new customers for the  
company. It’s provided access to new markets and a pipeline of  
new customers since the inception of our Rack business over 40  
years ago. Nordstrom Rack, Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook  
comparable  sales  increased  4.3  percent  and  total  net  sales 
increased  14  percent  in  2015,  which  was  29  percent  of  net  
company sales. Serving our customers in the ways they want to  
shop  has  driven  the  growth  in  our  off-price  online  business.  
Last  year  we  launched  Nordstromrack.com  and  combined  it 
with HauteLook so customers are able to shop both on a shared 
website.  Those  businesses  together  grew  approximately  50 
percent  in  2015,  generating  a  half-billion  dollars  in  sales  and 
surpassing our expectations. It took 15 years for Nordstrom.com 
to reach $1 billion in sales. We believe Nordstromrack.com and 
HauteLook combined have the potential to reach that milestone 
in half the time. Rack stores continue to be highly productive with 
solid returns for our investment. We opened 27 Rack stores in 
2015, and we expect to open 21 stores and relocate two in 2016.

INCREASING RELEVANCE
More than any one thing, new and relevant merchandise and brands 
drive our business, keep customers coming back to Nordstrom 
and help attract new customers. Growing brands such as Topshop/ 
Topman,  Madewell,  Brandy  Melville  and  Charlotte  Tilbury  are 
playing an important role in attracting new customers. This year

we  also  launched  SPACE,  a  shop  for  emerging  and  advanced

STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP
In 2015 we completed the sale of our credit card receivables to 
TD Bank. Our number one goal was to ensure we continue to 
have a one-to-one relationship with our valued cardholders, with 
Nordstrom  retaining  all  aspects  of  customer-facing  activities. 
We  were  also  pleased  to  be  able  to  return  capital  directly  to 
our shareholders in the form of a special dividend and through 
continued  share  repurchase.  We’re  pleased  with  the  outcome 
for  shareholders  and  our  partnership  with  TD.  We  found  TD 
to  be  a  strong  cultural  fit,  sharing  our  customer-focused 
approach  and  providing  capabilities  to  help  us  further  enhance  
the customer experience.

CONCLUSION
The customer is in control now more than ever with access to 
increasingly more information and choices. The rapidly changing 
landscape challenges us to build on our culture of service in new 
and exciting ways that adapt to our customers’ expectations. Our 
customer-focused strategy is an important point of differentiation 
that  guides  every  decision  to  better  serve  customers  on  their 
terms.  We’re  proud  of  the  collective  efforts  of  our  team  and 
we  thank  them,  and  you,  our  shareholders,  for  your  continued 
support of Nordstrom. 

Finally,  we  would  be  remiss  if  we  didn’t  single  out  the  strong 
leadership  we  have  had  from  Rick  Hernandez,  our  retiring 
Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors.  Rick  joined  our  board  in 
1997, became Lead Director in 2000 and Chairman in 2006. 
His  many  contributions 
include  helping  us  strengthen  the 
governance of our company, partnering to create a world-class 
group of directors and providing a steady hand and expertise to 
our executive team on many matters including strategic direction, 
leadership  development  and  succession  planning  as  we  have 
developed a position of leadership in the retail industry. We are 
grateful  for  his  partnership.  Rick  will  remain  on  the  board  and 
we’re delighted to welcome in Phil Satre, another terrific board 
member, as Chairman beginning in May.

A NOTE FROM OUR 
CHAIRMAN

In 2015 Nordstrom gained market share despite the difficult retail 
environment that confronted all retailers during the second half of 
the year. The company accomplished this through continued focus 
on serving customers how, when and where they prefer to shop. 
Your Board of Directors and management remained committed 
to strong financial discipline and continued our efforts to achieve 
increased efficiency and productivity in all aspects of the business. 
Further, your Board and management honored our commitment 
to  operate  the  business  with  the  highest  standards,  principles, 
policies and people that are deserving of your trust and investment.
Your Board acknowledges the rapid pace of change in retail today 
and  firmly  believes  that  focusing  on  the  customer  is  the  right 
strategy. As the Board looks back on 2015 and ahead to the future, 
we strongly support the executive management team led by Blake, 
Pete  and  Erik  Nordstrom.  Given  their  collective  experience, 
knowledge of our industry and the management team they have 
assembled, the Board of Directors believes Nordstrom is evolving 
in-step with its customers to serve them better and positioning the 
company for long-term success.  
We have a dedicated, independent Board that is deeply committed 
to  the  highest  standards  of  corporate  governance.  Nordstrom 
shareholders are benefited by an exceptional group of directors 
who  are  engaged  with  management  and  support  the  long-term 
goals the Board has set. At our annual shareholder meeting, four 
directors  will  be  retiring  from  service.  On  behalf  of  the  Board 
and  management,  I  want  to  thank  Phyllis  Campbell,  Michelle 
Ebanks, Robert Miller and Alison Winter for their leadership and 
many, many contributions over the years. This past year we also

SHAPE AND DEFINE OUR SUCCESS FOR MANY YEARS TO COME.

added  three  new  independent  directors:  Tanya  Domier,  CEO 
of  Advantage  Solutions;  Gordon  Smith,  CEO  of  Consumer 
and  Community  Banking  at  JPMorgan  Chase  and  Brad  Tilden,  
CEO  of  Alaska  Air  Group.  Our  new  directors  bring  with  them  
vast and broad experience, and a fresh perspective that is aligned 
with  Nordstrom  values  and  customer  focus.  We  are  pleased 
to  welcome  them  aboard  and,  as  we  evolve  and  transition  new 
members  onto  the  Board  and  thank  those  who  depart,  we 
remain committed to having a diverse board that represents our 
customers, employees and communities.
Each  quarter  the  Board  completes  a  rigorous  evaluation  of  the 
business, reviewing subjects including strategies, expected returns 
and  shareholder  value.  We  were  pleased  that  an  outgrowth  of 
those kinds of reviews resulted in the completion of the sale of 
our credit card receivables to TD Bank Group this past year. Upon 
the  successful  completion  of  the  transaction,  we  were  able  to 
distribute proceeds of $1.8 billion to shareholders through a special 
cash dividend of $4.85 per share and an increase to the company’s 
share repurchases. 
Our  company’s  commitment  to  serving  customers  with  quality 
products  and  services  in  the  most  efficient  way  possible  is  the 
foundation of our long-term growth strategy. As the Board looks 
to the future, we remain focused on opportunities to strategically 
position the business for long-term success and to hold ourselves 
and management accountable for bottom-line results. We know 
we must continue to evolve to meet rising customer expectations 
for service across all of our businesses, and we know that this will 
shape and define success in the near-term and for many years to 
come. On behalf of our entire Board of Directors, I thank you for 
your support of Nordstrom.
On a personal note, I will be retiring as Chairman of the Board of 
Nordstrom, Inc. after the upcoming annual shareholder meeting. 
I have had the distinct honor and pleasure of serving Nordstrom 
shareholders  in  several  capacities  for  approaching  20  years, 
including service as Lead Director for five years and Chairman for 
the last 10 years. This company has a long legacy of competing to 
better serve its customers and I am humbled that I was able to play 
some part in our past success. Should you, the shareholders, so 
choose, I will remain on the Board and will be pleased to transition 
the Chairman position to an extraordinarily qualified and capable 
Board member, Phil Satre. All of us on the Board are excited and 
confident in Phil’s leadership and look forward to a strong future 
under his Chairmanship. Thank you for the opportunity to serve 
you, our shareholders.

LEAVE IT BETTER THAN WE FOUND IT

At Nordstrom, our commitment to being a socially responsible 
company is guided by a simple idea: leave it better than we found 
it. Our corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy focuses on 
ensuring our efforts to take care of our communities and respect 
the environment also drive meaningful business results. 

Our customers and employees have told us transparency around 
our  approach  and  results  is  increasingly  important  to  them.  
To  steer  our  work  and  hold  ourselves  accountable,  we’ve 
established  measurable  targets  and  report  annually  on  our 
environmental,  human  rights  and  giving  programs—including 
what we’ve accomplished and opportunities to improve. 

HERE ARE A FEW OF OUR HIGHLIGHTS FROM 2015:

GIVING — In response to feedback from our customers and employees, we evolved our giving program. Our new 1% Gift Card 
Give  Back  program  allowed  us  to  increase  our  giving  to  support  nearly  500  local  organizations  in  every  market  where  we  do  
business through cash grants, and launch our Employee Charitable Match program. 

HUMAN RIGHTS — 100% of Nordstrom Product Group (NPG) factories have been audited to our Partnership Guidelines 
(expectations for following local laws and providing safe and healthy workplaces). When issues were found, we worked with the 
factories to create corrective plans that will help them sustainably remediate the findings. In addition, together with our long-term 
manufacturers, we helped provide social development programs such as HERhealth and HERfinance.

ENERGY  —  We  reduced  the  energy  we  use  per  square  foot  by  7%,  bringing  our  total  amount  reduced  since  2009  to  19%.  
We’re committed to making an additional 15% reduction by 2020, ensuring we’re doing our part, based on science, to help reduce 
our contribution to climate change. 

WASTE — Thanks to recycling and composting programs in our stores and buildings, the hard work of our employees and the 
support of our customers, we were able to divert the majority of our waste away from landfills.

PACKAGING AND PAPER — We continued to make changes to help reduce the amount of paper we use, such as finding 
opportunities to package orders from our Fulfillment Center more efficiently. Moving forward, we’ll be using different paper and 
fewer pages in our catalogs, which will save 2.1 million pounds of paper in 2016.

Earlier this year, our company leaders established our 2020 CSR 
goals. These goals take into account our business needs, feedback 
from many stakeholders and our overall commitment to doing the 
right thing: reducing our carbon footprint, conserving resources, 
offering  our  customers  sustainable  and  healthier  products, 
giving back to our communities and supporting human rights in 
factories that make our private label products. We share details 
on those goals, and plans to reach them, in our annual Corporate 
Social Responsibility Sharing Our Progress Report, which will be 
posted online at NordstromCares.com. To receive a copy of the 
report via email, email us at csr@nordstrom.com.

PART I

Item 1. Business.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Founded in 1901 as a retail shoe business in Seattle, Nordstrom later incorporated in Washington state in 1946 and went on to become one 
of the leading fashion specialty retailers based in the U.S. As of March 14, 2016, we operate 323 U.S. stores located in 39 states as well as a 
robust ecommerce business through Nordstrom.com, Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook and TrunkClub.com. We also operate three Nordstrom 
full-line stores in Canada. The west and east coasts of the U.S. are the areas in which we have the largest presence. We have two reportable 
segments, which include Retail and Credit. 
As of March 14, 2016, the Retail segment includes our 118 Nordstrom-branded full-line stores in the U.S. and Nordstrom.com, 197 off-price 
Nordstrom Rack stores, three Canada full-line stores, Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook, five Trunk Club clubhouses and TrunkClub.com, our 
two Jeffrey boutiques and one clearance store that operates under the name “Last Chance.” Through these multiple retail channels, we strive 
to deliver the best customer experience possible. We offer an extensive selection of high-quality brand-name and private label merchandise 
focused on apparel, shoes, cosmetics and accessories. Our integrated Nordstrom full-line stores and online store allow us to provide our 
customers with a seamless shopping experience. In-store purchases are primarily fulfilled from that store’s inventory, but when inventory is 
unavailable at that store it may also be shipped to our customers from our fulfillment centers in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Elizabethtown, 
Pennsylvania, or from other Nordstrom full-line stores. Online purchases are primarily shipped to our customers from our Cedar Rapids and 
East Coast fulfillment centers, but may also be shipped from our Nordstrom full-line stores. Our customers can also pick up online orders in 
our Nordstrom full-line stores if inventory is available at one of our locations. These capabilities allow us to better serve customers across 
various channels and improve sales. Nordstrom Rack stores purchase merchandise primarily from the same vendors carried in Nordstrom 
full-line stores and also serve as outlets for clearance merchandise from our Nordstrom stores and other retail channels. Nordstromrack.com/
HauteLook offers a persistent selection of off-price merchandise, as well as limited-time sale events on fashion and lifestyle brands and are 
integrated with a single customer log-in, shared shopping cart and streamlined checkout process. Nordstromrack.com combines the 
technology expertise of HauteLook with the merchant expertise of Nordstrom Rack. Online purchases are primarily shipped to our customers 
from our San Bernardino fulfillment center. Furthermore, we can accommodate returns from these sites by mail or at any Nordstrom Rack 
location. 
Through our Credit segment, our customers can access a variety of payment products and services, including a Nordstrom-branded private 
label card, two Nordstrom-branded Visa credit cards and a debit card for Nordstrom purchases. The credit and debit cards feature a loyalty 
program designed to increase customer visits and spending. Although the primary purposes of our Credit segment are to foster greater 
customer loyalty and drive more sales, through our program agreement with TD Bank, N.A. (“TD”) (see Note 2: Credit Card Receivable 
Transaction in Item 8), we also receive credit card revenue. In addition, we save on interchange fees that the Retail segment would incur if 
our customers used non-Nordstrom-branded cards.

For more information about our business and our reportable segments, see Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations and Note 17: Segment Reporting in Item 8.
FISCAL YEAR
We operate on a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to January 31st. References to 2015 and all years within this 
document are based on a 52-week fiscal year, except 2012, which is based on a 53-week fiscal year.
TRADEMARKS
We have 147 trademarks, each of which is the subject of one or more trademark registrations and/or trademark applications. Our most 
notable trademarks include Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, HauteLook, Trunk Club, Halogen, BP., Zella, 14th & Union, Tucker+Tate and 
Caslon. Each of our trademarks is renewable indefinitely, provided that it is still used in commerce at the time of the renewal.
RETURN POLICY
We have a fair and liberal approach to returns as part of our objective to provide high-quality customer service. We do not have a formal 
return policy at our Nordstrom full-line stores or online at Nordstrom.com. Our goal is to take care of our customers, which includes making 
returns and exchanges easy, whether in stores or online, where we offer free shipping on purchases and returns. Our Nordstrom Rack stores 
generally accept returns up to 90 days from the date of purchase with the original price tag and sales receipt, and also accept returns of 
Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook merchandise. Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook generally accept returns of apparel, footwear and accessories 
within 90 days from the date of shipment.
SEASONALITY
Our business, like that of other retailers, is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Due to our Anniversary Sale in July and the holidays in the fourth 
quarter, our sales are typically higher in the second and fourth quarters than in the first and third quarters of the fiscal year. In 2016, our 
Anniversary Sale will shift to the last week of July and the first week of August, which will move one week of event sales to the third quarter. 

4

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS
We operate in a highly competitive business environment. We compete with other national, regional, local and online retailers that may carry 
similar lines of merchandise, including department stores, specialty stores, off-price stores, boutiques and Internet businesses. Our specific 
competitors vary from market to market. We believe the keys to competing in our industry are providing great customer service and customer 
experiences in stores and online, which includes compelling price and value, fashion newness, quality of products, selection, convenience, 
technology, product fulfillment, personalization and appealing, relevant store environments in top locations.
INVENTORY
We plan our merchandise purchases and receipts to coincide with expected sales trends. For instance, our merchandise purchases and 
receipts increase prior to our Anniversary Sale, which has historically extended over the last two weeks of July. We also purchase and 
receive a larger amount of merchandise in the fall as we prepare for the holiday shopping season (from late November through December). 
At Nordstrom Rack we invest in pack and hold inventory which involves the strategic purchase of merchandise from some of our full-line 
stores’ top brands in advance of the upcoming selling seasons to take advantage of favorable buying opportunities. This inventory is typically 
held for six months on average and has been an important component of Nordstrom Rack’s inventory strategy. We pay for our merchandise 
purchases under the terms established with our vendors.

In order to offer merchandise that our customers want, we purchase from a wide variety of high-quality suppliers, including domestic and 
foreign businesses. We also have arrangements with agents and contract manufacturers to produce our private label merchandise. We 
expect our suppliers to meet our “Nordstrom Partnership Guidelines,” which address our corporate social responsibility standards for matters 
such as legal and regulatory compliance, labor, health and safety and the environment, and are available on our website at Nordstrom.com.
EMPLOYEES
During 2015, we employed approximately 72,500 employees on a full- or part-time basis. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, 
employment increased to approximately 74,000 employees in July 2015 and 78,000 in December 2015. All of our employees are non-union. 
We believe our relationship with our employees is good.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Our business faces many risks. We believe the risks described below outline the items of most concern to us.
RISKS DUE TO STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL FACTORS
Our customer strategy focuses on providing a seamless and high-quality experience across all Nordstrom channels and failure to 
successfully execute our plans could negatively impact our current business and future profitability. 
We are enhancing our customer shopping experience in our stores, online, and in mobile and social channels by pursuing a heightened 
focus on technology and ecommerce to fuel our growth. With the accelerated pace of change in the retail environment, we may not be able to 
meet our customers’ changing expectations in how they shop in stores or through ecommerce. If we target the wrong opportunities, fail to 
make investments at the right time or pace, fail to make the best investments in the right channels or make an investment commitment 
significantly above or below our needs, it may harm our competitive position. If these technologies and investments do not perform as 
expected, are not seamlessly integrated, or are not maintained properly, our profitability and growth could be adversely affected. 

6

We are continuing our plan to accelerate the number of new Nordstrom Rack store openings. New store openings both at Nordstrom Rack 
and in our full-line stores involve certain risks, including the availability of suitable locations, constructing, furnishing and supplying a store in 
a timely and cost-effective manner and properly balancing our capital investments between new stores, remodels, technology and 
ecommerce. In addition, we may not accurately assess the demographic or retail environment for a particular location and sales at new, 
relocated or remodeled stores may not meet our projections, particularly in light of the changing trends between online and brick-and-mortar 
shopping channels, which could adversely affect our return on investment. We also intend to open stores in new and international markets, 
such as Canada and Manhattan, and expansion will require additional management attention and resources and may distract us from 
executing our core operations. In addition, competition from strong local competitors, compliance with foreign and local laws and regulatory 
requirements and potentially unfavorable tax consequences may cause our business to be adversely impacted.

As we execute our plans and continue to evolve and transform our strategy, we may not adequately manage the related organizational 
changes to align with our strategy or appropriately monitor, report or communicate the changes in an effective manner. In addition, we may 
not gather accurate and relevant data or effectively utilize that data, which may impact our strategic planning and decision making.
Our growth strategy as it relates to ecommerce could have adverse impacts on our results of operations if not successfully 
executed.
We are continuing our investment in ecommerce as advancements in technology have impacted shopping behaviors of consumers. 
Computers, mobile phones, tablets and other devices allow customers to browse and transact anywhere or anytime. Our growth strategies in 
this area span the development of applications for electronic devices, improvement of customer-facing technology, timely delivery of products 
purchased online, enhancement of inventory management systems, greater and more fluid inventory availability between online and retail 
locations, and greater consistency in marketing and pricing strategies. This business model has a high variable cost structure driven by 
fulfillment, marketing and technology costs and will continue to require investment in cross-channel operations and supporting technologies. 
If we do not implement and expand our ecommerce initiatives successfully or we do not realize our anticipated return on these investments, 
our profitability and growth could be adversely affected. In addition, if customers shift to ecommerce more quickly than we anticipate, we may 
need to accelerate our ecommerce initiatives and investments and may experience higher costs adversely impacting our profitability. 
Our stores located in shopping malls may be adversely affected if the consumer traffic of malls decline.
Many of our stores are located in desirable locations within shopping malls and benefit from the abilities that we and other anchor tenants 
have to generate consumer traffic. A substantial decline in mall traffic, the development of new shopping malls, the availability of locations 
within existing or new shopping malls, the success of individual shopping malls and the success of other anchor tenants may negatively 
impact our ability to maintain or grow our sales in existing stores, as well as our ability to open new stores, which could have an adverse 
effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
Improvements to our merchandise buying and fulfillment processes and systems could adversely affect our business if not 
successfully executed. 
We are making investments to improve our merchandise planning, procurement, allocation and fulfillment capabilities through changes in 
personnel, processes, location logistics and technology over a period of several years. If we encounter challenges associated with change 
management, the ability to hire and retain key personnel involved in these efforts, implementation of associated information technology or 
adoption of new processes, our ability to continue to successfully execute our strategy or evolve our strategy as the retail environment 
changes could be adversely affected. As a result, we may not derive the expected benefits to our sales and profitability, or we may incur 
increased costs relative to our current expectations.
If we do not effectively design and implement our strategic and business planning processes to attract, retain, train and develop 
talent and future leaders, our business may suffer. 
We rely on the experience of our senior management, who have specific knowledge relating to us and our industry that is difficult to replace, 
and the talents of our workforce to execute our business strategies and objectives. If unexpected turnover occurs without adequate 
succession plans, the loss of the services of any of these individuals, or any resulting negative perceptions of our business, could damage 
our reputation and our business.

Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries  7

Even if we take appropriate measures to safeguard our information security and privacy environment from security breaches, our 
customers and our business could still be exposed to risk.
Our Retail and Credit segments involve the collection, storage and transmission of customers’ personal information, consumer preferences 
and credit card information. In addition, our operations involve the collection, storage and transmission of employee information and 
Company financial and strategic data. Any measures we implement to prevent a security or cybersecurity threat may not be totally effective 
and may have the potential to harm relations with our customers or decrease activity on our websites by making them more difficult to use. In 
addition, the regulatory environment surrounding information security, cybersecurity and privacy is increasingly demanding, with new and 
constantly changing requirements. Security breaches and cyber incidents and their remediation, whether at our Company, our third-party 
providers or other retailers, could expose us to a risk of loss or misappropriation of this information, litigation, potential liability, reputation 
damage and loss of customers’ trust and business, which could adversely impact our sales. Any such breaches or incidents could subject us 
to investigation, notification and remediation costs, and if there is additional information that is later discovered related to such security 
breach or incident, there could be further loss of customers’ trust and business based upon their reactions to this additional information. 
Additionally, we could be subject to credit card fraud losses due to external credit card fraud.
If we fail to appropriately manage our capital, we may negatively impact our operations and shareholder return.
We utilize capital to finance our operations, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, manage our debt levels and return value to our 
shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. If our access to capital is restricted or our borrowing costs increase, our operations 
and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Further, if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns, our operations, 
cash flows and returns to shareholders could be adversely affected.
Ownership and leasing real estate exposes us to possible liabilities and losses.
We own or lease the land and/or building for all of our stores and are therefore subject to all of the risks associated with owning and leasing 
real estate. In particular, the value of the assets could decrease and their operating costs could increase, due to changes in the real estate 
market, demographic trends, site competition and overall economic trends. Additionally, we are potentially subject to liability for 
environmental conditions, exit costs associated with disposal of a store, commitments to pay base rent for the entire lease term or operate a 
store for the duration of an operating covenant. 
Our customer and employee relationships could be negatively affected if we fail to maintain our corporate culture and reputation.
We have a well-recognized culture and reputation that consumers may associate with a high level of integrity, customer service and quality 
merchandise, and it is one of the reasons customers shop with us and employees choose us as a place of employment. Any significant 
damage to our reputation could negatively impact sales, diminish customer trust, reduce employee morale and productivity and lead to 
difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified employees.
The transaction related to the sale of our credit card receivables and resulting program agreement with TD could adversely impact 
our business.
In October 2015, we completed the sale of a substantial majority of our U.S. Visa and private label credit card portfolio to TD. While this 
transaction was consummated on terms that allow us to maintain customer-facing activities, if we fail to meet certain service levels under the 
program agreement with TD, TD has the right to assume certain individual servicing functions. If we lose control of such activities and 
functions, if we do not successfully respond to potential risks and appropriately manage potential costs associated with the program 
agreement with TD, or if this transaction negatively impacts the customer service associated with our cards, our operations, cash flows and 
returns to shareholders could be adversely affected, which could also harm our business reputation and competitive positioning. 
The concentration of stock ownership in a small number of our shareholders could limit your ability to influence corporate matters.
We have regularly reported in our annual proxy statements the holdings of members of the Nordstrom family, including Bruce A. Nordstrom, 
our former Co-President and Chairman of the Board, his sister Anne E. Gittinger and members of the Nordstrom family within our Executive 
Team. In our proxy statement as of March 11, 2016, for the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, these individuals beneficially owned an 
aggregate of approximately 30% of our common stock. As a result, either individually or acting together, they may be able to exercise 
considerable influence over matters requiring shareholder approval. As reported in our periodic filings, our Board of Directors has from time 
to time authorized share repurchases. While these share repurchases may be offset in part by share issuances under our equity incentive 
plans and as consideration for acquisitions, the repurchases may nevertheless have the effect of increasing the overall percentage 
ownership held by these shareholders. The corporate law of the State of Washington, where the Company is incorporated, provides that 
approval of a merger or similar significant corporate transaction requires the affirmative vote of two-thirds of a company’s outstanding 
shares. The beneficial ownership of these shareholders may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire us, delay or otherwise prevent 
a significant corporate transaction because the consummation of any such transaction would likely require the approval of these 
shareholders. As a result, the market price of our common stock could be affected.

8

Investment and partnerships in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt our core business. 
We have invested in or are pursuing strategic growth opportunities, which may include acquisitions of, or investments in, other businesses, 
as well as new technologies or other investments to provide a superior customer shopping experience in our stores and online. Additionally, 
our business model will continue to rely more on partnerships with third parties for certain strategic initiatives and technologies. If these 
investments, acquisitions or partnerships do not perform as expected or create operational difficulties, we may record impairment charges 
and our profitability and growth could be adversely affected. 
RISKS DUE TO ECONOMIC AND EXTERNAL MARKET FACTORS
A downturn in economic conditions could have a significant adverse effect on our business. 
During economic downturns, fewer customers may shop for the high-quality items in our stores and on our websites as they may be seen as 
discretionary and those who do shop may limit the amount of their purchases. This reduced demand may lead to lower sales, higher 
markdowns, an overly promotional environment and increased marketing and promotional spending. 
Our business could suffer if we do not appropriately assess and react to competitive market forces and changes in customer 
behavior. 
We compete with other international, national, regional, local and online retailers that may carry similar lines of merchandise, including 
department stores, specialty stores, off-price stores, boutiques and Internet businesses. The retail environment is rapidly evolving with 
customer shopping preferences continuing to shift online and we expect competition in the ecommerce market to intensify in the future as the 
Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping. We may lose market share to our competitors and our sales and profitability 
could suffer if we are unable to remain competitive. Our financial model is changing to match customer shopping preferences, but if we do 
not properly allocate our capital between the store and online environment, or adjust the effectiveness and efficiency of our stores and online 
channels, our overall sales and profitability could suffer.

Our Credit segment faces competition from other retailers who also offer credit card products with associated loyalty programs, large banks 
and other credit card companies, some of which have substantial financial resources. If we do not effectively anticipate or respond to the 
competitive banking and credit card environments, we could lose market share to our competitors.
Our sales and customer relationships may be negatively impacted if we do not anticipate and respond to consumer preferences 
and fashion trends appropriately.
Our ability to predict or respond to constantly changing fashion trends, consumer preferences and spending patterns significantly impacts our 
sales and operating results. If we do not identify and respond to emerging trends in consumer spending and preferences quickly enough, we 
may harm our ability to retain our existing customers or attract new customers. If we purchase too much inventory, we may be forced to sell 
our merchandise at lower average margins, which could harm our business. Conversely, if we fail to purchase enough merchandise, we may 
lose opportunities for additional sales and potentially harm relationships with our customers. 
The results of our Credit operations could be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. 
Our credit card revenues, net and profitability are subject in large part to economic and market conditions that are beyond our control, 
including, but not limited to, interest rates, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, unemployment trends and other factors. These 
economic and market conditions could impair our revenues and the profitability of our Credit segment due to factors such as lower demand 
for credit, unfavorable payment patterns and higher delinquency rates. Additionally, our results may be negatively impacted if there are 
changes to the credit card risk management policies implemented under our program agreement with TD.
Our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected by supply chain disruptions, port disruptions, severe 
weather patterns, natural disasters, widespread pandemics and other natural or man-made disruptions. 
We derive a significant amount of our total sales from stores located on the west and east coasts of the United States, particularly in 
California, which increases our exposure to market-disrupting conditions in these regions. These disruptions could cause, among other 
things, a decrease in consumer spending that would negatively impact our sales, staffing shortages in our stores, distribution centers or 
corporate offices, interruptions in the flow of merchandise to our stores, disruptions in the operations of our merchandise vendors or property 
developers, increased costs, and a negative impact on our reputation and long-term growth plans.

RISKS DUE TO LEGAL AND REGULATORY FACTORS
We are subject to certain laws, litigation, regulatory matters and ethical standards, and our failure to comply with or adequately 
address developments as they arise could adversely affect our reputation and operations. 
Our policies, procedures and practices and the technology we implement are designed to comply with federal, state, local and foreign laws, 
rules and regulations, including those imposed by the SEC and other regulatory agencies, the marketplace, the banking industry and foreign 
countries, as well as responsible business, social and environmental practices, all of which may change from time to time. Significant 
legislative changes, including those that relate to employment matters and health care reform, could impact our relationship with our 
workforce, which could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations. In addition, if we fail to comply with applicable laws and 
regulations or implement responsible business, social, environmental and supply chain practices, we could be subject to damage to our 
reputation, class action lawsuits, legal and settlement costs, civil and criminal liability, increased cost of regulatory compliance, restatements 
of our financial statements, disruption of our business and loss of customers. Any required changes to our employment practices could result 
in the loss of employees, reduced sales, increased employment costs, low employee morale and harm to our business and results of 
operations. In addition, political and economic factors could lead to unfavorable changes in federal, state and foreign tax laws, which may 
increase our tax liabilities. An increase in our tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations. We are also regularly involved in 
various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our 
business and financial condition.
We continue to face uncertainties due to financial services industry regulation and supervision that could have an adverse affect 
on our operations. 
Federal and state regulation and supervision of the financial industry has increased in recent years due to implementation of consumer 
protection and financial reform legislation such as the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (“CARD Act”) and 
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Financial Reform Act”). The Financial Reform Act significantly 
restructured regulatory oversight and other aspects of the financial industry, created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) to 
supervise and enforce consumer lending laws and regulations, and expanded state authority over consumer lending. The CARD Act included 
new and revised rules and restrictions on credit card pricing, finance charges and fees, customer billing practices and payment application. 
We anticipate more regulation and interpretations of the new rules to continue, and we may be required to make changes, or TD may be 
required to make changes in connection with the program agreement, to credit card practices and systems which could adversely impact the 
revenues and profitability of our Credit segment. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations could limit or restrict the activities of our 
business, whether conducted by us or TD, and any potential enforcement actions by those agencies for failure to comply could have an 
adverse impact on us.

owned land (Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania), all of which are utilized by our Retail segment. Trunk Club and Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook, 
which are included in our Retail segment, lease three administrative offices (Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California and New York City, 
New York) and one fulfillment center (San Bernardino, California). We lease two office buildings (Centennial, Colorado and Scottsdale, 
Arizona) for use by our Credit segment. Our administrative offices in Seattle, Washington are a combination of leased and owned space. We 
also lease a data center in Centennial, Colorado.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
We are subject from time to time to various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, including lawsuits alleging 
violations of state and/or federal wage and hour and other employment laws, privacy and other consumer-based claims. Some of these 
lawsuits include certified classes of litigants, or purport or may be determined to be class or collective actions and seek substantial damages 
or injunctive relief, or both, and some may remain unresolved for several years. We believe the recorded reserves in our Consolidated 
Financial Statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. As of the date of this report, we do not believe any 
currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, 
financial position or cash flows. Since these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, our view of them may change in the future.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Dollar, share and square footage amounts in millions except percentages, per share and per square foot amounts
OVERVIEW
Nordstrom is a leading fashion specialty retailer offering apparel, shoes, cosmetics and accessories for women, men, young adults and 
children. We offer an extensive selection of high-quality brand-name and private label merchandise through our various channels, including 
Nordstrom U.S. and Canada full-line stores, Nordstrom.com, Nordstrom Rack stores, Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook, Trunk Club clubhouses 
and TrunkClub.com, our Jeffrey boutiques and our Last Chance clearance store. As of January 30, 2016, our stores are located in 39 states 
throughout the United States and in three provinces in Canada. In addition, we offer our customers a Nordstrom Rewards™ loyalty program 
along with a variety of payment products and services, including credit and debit cards.

In 2015, we continued to grow our business despite a more challenging retail environment in the second half of the year. We added nearly $1 
billion to our top line, delivering total net sales growth of 7.5% and a comparable sales increase of 2.7%. During the year, we achieved the 
following milestones in executing our customer strategy:

•
•
•

•

opened our first international flagship store in Vancouver, British Columbia, the most successful opening in our Company history
grew Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook by 47%, reaching over $500 in sales
expanded our fulfillment network with our third fulfillment center in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, located within two-day delivery of
approximately half the U.S. population
returned $2.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends, of which $1.8 billion resulted from the sale of our
credit card receivables

From a merchandising perspective, we’re constantly pursuing newness and fashion to increase our relevance with customers. Brands like 
Topshop, Madewell, Brandy Melville and Charlotte Tilbury have contributed to the strength of our younger customer-focused departments 
and attracted new customers to Nordstrom. Additionally, we saw continued momentum in Beauty, which has been among our top-performing 
categories for the fourth straight year.

On October 1st, we completed the sale of our credit card portfolio to TD. Our mutual commitment to having Nordstrom employees serve our 
customers directly was paramount to this partnership. We are able to retain all aspects of customer-facing activities, aligning with our 
strategy of enhancing the customer experience while allowing for improvement in capital efficiency. 

In addition, we consider our loyalty program as an enabler of growth to increase our engagement with customers and attract new customers. 
With sales to Rewards members representing 40% of our sales volume, we look forward to expanding our program with a tender-neutral offer 
in 2016.

Over the past several years, we’ve made significant investments to enable customers to shop seamlessly across stores and online as well as 
to grow our business through new markets. Our investments in HauteLook, Canada and Trunk Club added over $400 to our top-line growth 
in 2015, while Nordstrom Rack’s expansion of 27 new stores contributed nearly $230 to our top-line growth. These investments have resulted 
in market share gains, but also represent an evolution of our business resulting in expenses growing faster than sales in recent years. 

As we look ahead to 2016, we continue to view 2015 as our peak investment year. While we have successfully increased market share, we 
are also committed to increasing efficiency, lowering costs while increasing effectiveness and gaining profitability. With our investments 
moderating, we expect 2016 to represent an inflection point of earnings growth improvement.

As our business evolves, our focus continues to be guided by customer expectations around speed, convenience and personalization. We 
believe that we are well positioned with the right strategies in place to successfully serve our customers, which will in turn lead to long-term 
profitable growth and top-quartile total shareholder return.

total Company basis.

RETAIL BUSINESS
Our Retail Business includes our Nordstrom-branded U.S. and Canada full-line stores and Nordstrom.com, Nordstrom Rack stores, 
Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook, Trunk Club, Jeffrey and our Last Chance clearance store. For purposes of discussion and analysis of our 
results of operations of our Retail Business, we combine our Retail segment results with revenues and expenses in the “Corporate/Other” 
column of Note 17: Segment Reporting in Item 8 (collectively, the “Retail Business”). 

Certain metrics we use to evaluate the Retail Business may not be calculated in a consistent manner among industry peers. Provided below 
are definitions of metrics we present within our analysis of the Retail Business: 
•

Comparable Sales – sales from stores that have been open at least one full year at the beginning of the year. Total Company
comparable sales include sales from our online channels (Nordstrom.com and Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook) because of the
integration with our stores.
Gross Profit – net sales less cost of sales and related buying and occupancy costs.
Inventory Turnover Rate – annual cost of sales and related buying and occupancy costs (for all segments) divided by the trailing 4-
quarter average inventory.
Total Sales Per Square Foot – net sales divided by weighted-average square footage.
4-wall Sales Per Square Foot – sales for Nordstrom U.S. and Canada full-line stores, Nordstrom Rack stores, Trunk Club clubhouses,
Jeffrey boutiques and our Last Chance store divided by their weighted-average square footage.

Retail Business Net Sales
In our ongoing effort to enhance the customer experience, we are focused on providing customers with a seamless experience across our 
channels. While our customers may engage with us through multiple channels, we know they value the overall Nordstrom brand experience 
and view us simply as Nordstrom, which is ultimately how we view our business. To provide additional transparency into our net sales by 
channel, we present the following information for our Retail Business:

Net Sales (2015 vs. 2014)
In 2015, total Company net sales increased 7.5%, while comparable sales increased 2.7%. During the year, we opened five Nordstrom full-
line stores, including two in Canada, and 27 Nordstrom Rack stores. These additions increased our square footage by 6.4% and represented 
2.8% of our total net sales for 2015. 

Our full-price net sales, which consist of the U.S. full-line and Nordstrom.com channels, increased 2.6% compared with 2014, with 
comparable sales up 2.3%. These increases reflected continued momentum in our Nordstrom.com channel, which increased 15%, while U.S. 
full-line store net sales decreased 0.6% in 2015 compared with 2014. On a comparable basis, we experienced an increased volume of 
transactions partially offset by a decrease in the average number of items sold per transaction. Category leaders included Beauty and 
Women’s Apparel.

U.S. full-line store comparable sales decreased by 1.1%. The Northwest and Southwest were the top-performing full-line geographic regions. 

Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries  19

Within our off-price offering, Nordstrom Rack net sales increased 9.9%, compared with 2014, reflecting the accelerated expansion of new 
stores. Comparable sales decreased 1.0% for the year. Shoes and Cosmetics were the top-performing categories, while the South was the 
top-performing geographic region. Nordstrom Rack experienced an increase in the average retail price per item sold offset by a decrease in 
the total number of items sold. Sales per square foot of Nordstrom Rack decreased due to store expansion. 

Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook experienced outsized growth, with a net sales increase of 47%.

Net Sales (2014 vs. 2013)
Total Company net sales for 2014 increased 7.8% compared with 2013, which was attributable to a comparable sales increase of 4.0%. 
During 2014, we opened three Nordstrom full-line stores, including our first store in Canada, 27 Nordstrom Rack stores and acquired Trunk 
Club. These additions represented 2.8% of our total net sales for 2014 and increased our square footage by 5.5%.

Full-price net sales for 2014 increased 3.8% compared with 2013, with comparable sales up 3.6%. These increases were largely due to the 
performance of our Nordstrom.com channel. Both the number of items sold and the average selling price increased on a comparable basis in 
2014 compared with 2013. Category leaders included Accessories, Cosmetics and Men’s Apparel. 

U.S. full-line store net sales for 2014 decreased 0.3% compared with 2013, which was primarily driven by a decrease in comparable sales. 
The top-performing geographic regions for 2014 were the Southeast and Southwest. 

Our Nordstrom.com and Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook channels experienced outsized growth, with a net sales increase of 23% at 
Nordstrom.com and 22% at Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook compared with 2013. These increases were driven by both expanded 
merchandise selection and ongoing technology investments to enhance the customer experience.

Nordstrom Rack net sales increased 17% compared with 2013, reflecting incremental volume from existing stores and the impact of new 
store openings. On a comparable basis, the average selling price of Nordstrom Rack merchandise increased while the number of items sold 
was flat. Shoes and Accessories were the strongest-performing categories for 2014.

Gross Profit (2015 vs. 2014)
Our Retail gross profit rate decreased 92 basis points compared with 2014 primarily due to higher cost of sales driven by increased 
markdowns from lower than planned sales and in response to an elevated promotional environment during the second half of the year. Retail 
gross profit increased $225 in 2015 due to an increase in net sales, partially offset by increased markdowns. 

Our inventory turnover rate decreased to 4.54 in 2015, from 4.67 in 2014, due to softer sales trends experienced during the second half of 
the year. Our ending inventory per square foot increased 6.1% in 2015, which outpaced our sales per square foot increase of 2.9%. As we 
continue to grow our online channels, we expect increases in inventory without corresponding increases in square footage. 

Gross Profit (2014 vs. 2013)
Our Retail gross profit rate decreased 52 basis points compared with 2013 primarily due to increased markdowns and Nordstrom Rack’s 
accelerated store expansion. Retail gross profit increased $275 in 2014 compared with 2013 due to an increase in net sales, partially offset 
by increased markdowns.

Our inventory turnover rate decreased in 2014 and our ending inventory per square foot increased 8.8%. This increase in ending inventory 
per square foot outpaced our increase in sales per square foot of 3.9% primarily due to planned inventory growth related to Nordstrom Rack 
and Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook. 
Retail Business Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (2015 vs. 2014)
Our Retail SG&A rate increased 112 basis points in 2015 compared with 2014 due to growth initiatives related to Trunk Club and Canada, 
higher fulfillment costs supporting online growth and asset impairment charges (see Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8). Our Retail SG&A increased $428 in 2015 due primarily to increased sales and growth initiatives 
related to Canada and Trunk Club. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (2014 vs. 2013) 
Our Retail SG&A rate increased 48 basis points in 2014 compared with 2013 due to expenses related to the acquisition of Trunk Club and 
ongoing fulfillment and technology investments. Our Retail SG&A expenses increased $316 in 2014 compared with 2013 due primarily to 
growth-related investments in fulfillment and technology.

CREDIT SEGMENT
The Nordstrom credit and debit card products are designed to strengthen customer relationships and grow retail sales by providing loyalty 
benefits, valuable services and payment products. We believe our credit business allows us to build deeper relationships with our customers 
by fully integrating the Nordstrom Rewards program with our retail stores and providing better service, which in turn fosters greater customer 
loyalty. Nordstrom cardholders tend to visit our stores more frequently and spend more with us than non-cardholders. Nordstrom private label 
credit and debit cards can be used only at our Nordstrom full-line stores in the U.S., Nordstrom Rack stores and online at Nordstrom.com and 
Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook (“inside volume”), while Nordstrom Visa credit cards also may be used for purchases outside of Nordstrom 
(“outside volume”). Cardholders participate in the Nordstrom Rewards program through which cardholders accumulate points based on their 
level of spending. Upon reaching a certain points threshold, cardholders receive Nordstrom Notes®, which can be redeemed for goods or 
services at Nordstrom full-line stores in the U.S. and Canada, Nordstrom Rack stores and at Nordstrom.com. Nordstrom Rewards customers 
receive reimbursements for alterations, get Personal Triple Points days and have early access to sales events. With increased spending, 
they can receive additional amounts of these benefits as well as access to exclusive fashion and shopping events.

On October 1, 2015, we completed the sale of a substantial majority of our U.S. Visa and private label credit card portfolio to TD (see Note 2: 
Credit Card Receivable Transaction in Item 8).
Summary
The table below provides a detailed view of the operational results of our Credit segment, consistent with Note 17: Segment Reporting in 
Item 8. In order to better reflect the economic contribution of our credit and debit card program, intercompany merchant fees are also 
included in the table below, which represent the estimated costs that would be incurred if cardholders used non-Nordstrom-branded cards 
instead of our cards in store and online.

Prior to October 1, 2015, interest expense at the Credit segment was equal to the amount of interest related to securitized debt plus an 
amount assigned to the Credit segment in proportion to the estimated debt and equity needed to fund our credit card receivables. Based on 
our research, debt as a percentage of credit card receivables for other credit card companies ranges from 70% to 90%. As such, we 
considered a mix of 80% debt and 20% equity to be appropriate, and therefore assigned interest expense to the Credit segment as if it 
carried debt of up to 80% of the credit card receivables. Subsequent to the sale, we no longer allocate interest expense to the Credit 
segment as we do not fund the accounts receivable now owned by TD.

Prior to the close of the credit card receivable transaction, credit card revenues included finance charges, interchange fees, late fees and 
other revenue, recorded net of estimated uncollectible finance charges and fees. Finance charges represent interest earned on unpaid 
balances while interchange fees are earned from the use of Nordstrom Visa credit cards at merchants outside of Nordstrom. Late fees are 
assessed when a credit card account becomes past due. We continue to recognize revenue in this manner for the credit card receivables 
retained subsequent to the close of the credit card receivable transaction.

Following the close of the transaction and pursuant to the program agreement with TD, we receive our portion of the ongoing credit card 
revenue, net of credit losses, from both the sold and newly generated credit card receivables, which is recorded in credit program revenues, 
net. Revenue earned under the program agreement is impacted by the credit quality of receivables, both owned and serviced, and factors 
such as deteriorating economic conditions, declining creditworthiness of cardholders and the success of account management and collection 
activities may heighten the risk of credit losses. 

Asset amortization and deferred revenue recognition associated with the assets and liabilities recorded as part of the transaction are also 
recorded in credit program revenues, net.

Credit Card Revenues, net (2015 vs. 2014)
Credit card revenues, net decreased $54 in 2015 compared with 2014 due to the credit card receivable transaction.

Credit Card Revenues, net (2014 vs. 2013)
Credit card revenues, net increased $22 in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to an increase in the average accounts receivable 
balance, slightly decreased payment rates and a 6.5% increase in total volume during 2014.

Credit Expenses (2015 vs. 2014)
Total credit expenses decreased $35 in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to the reversal of our allowance for credit losses, partially 
offset by costs related to the credit card receivable transaction, recorded in credit transaction, net.

Credit Expenses (2014 vs. 2013)
Total credit expenses increased $8 in 2014 compared with 2013, due to higher operational expenses resulting from increased volume in 2014 
and lower operational expenses in 2013 from the conversion of our Nordstrom Rewards travel benefits into Nordstrom Notes during that year.

Allowance for Credit Losses and Credit Trends
A substantial majority of our receivables were reclassified as “held for sale” during the second quarter of 2015, and resulted in the reversal of 
the allowance for credit losses of $64 on those receivables. 

For our owned credit card receivables, we consider a credit card account delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the payment 
due date. Our aging method is based on the number of completed billing cycles during which the customer failed to make a minimum 
payment. During the third quarter of 2014, we modified our write-off policy from 150 days past due to 180 days past due to better align with 
industry practice.

Activity in the allowance for credit losses is as follows:

Credit Trends
Net write-offs in 2015 were $36, compared with $46 in 2014 and $57 in 2013. Net write-offs decreased in 2015 from 2014 due to the credit 
card receivable transaction. In 2015 and 2014, we reduced our allowance for credit losses as delinquencies and net write-offs improved.

Intercompany Merchant Fees
Intercompany merchant fees represent the estimated costs that would be incurred if Nordstrom cardholders used non-Nordstrom-branded 
cards in our stores and online. In 2015, this estimate increased to $118 from $108 in 2014. This was primarily driven by the increased use of 
Nordstrom credit and debit cards in store and online.

Interest expense, net decreased $13 in 2015 compared with 2014 due to an increase in capitalized interest resulting from planned capital 
investments related to technology, our Manhattan store and Nordstrom Rack and Canada store openings in 2015.

Interest Expense, Net (2014 vs. 2013)
Interest expense, net decreased $23 in 2014 compared with 2013 due to a non-recurring charge of $14 in 2013 related to our debt 
refinancing, as well as lower average interest rates on our notes in 2014 driven by our fourth quarter 2013 debt transactions.

Income Tax Expense (2015 vs. 2014)
The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2015 compared with 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in non-deductible acquisition-related 
items and the benefit of income tax credits in 2015.

Income Tax Expense (2014 vs. 2013)
The increase in the effective tax rate for 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to tax adjustments associated with a reassessment of 
our deferred tax assets related to acquisitions.

Earnings Per Diluted Share (2015 vs. 2014)
The decrease in diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) for 2015 compared with 2014 was primarily due to lower Retail Business earnings before 
interest and income taxes. This decrease was partially offset by a decrease in weighted average shares outstanding resulting from an 
increase in share repurchases.

Earnings Per Diluted Share (2014 vs. 2013)
The slight increase in EPS for 2014 compared with 2013 is primarily due to a decrease in weighted average shares outstanding from 
increased share repurchase activity.

Net Sales
Total net sales increased in the fourth quarter by 5.2%, driven by a comparable sales increase of 1.0% and sales from 32 new stores opened 
in 2015.

Nordstrom net sales, which consist of U.S. full-line stores and Nordstrom.com, increased $21, or 0.7%, compared with 2014, while 
comparable sales increased 0.2%. These increases were primarily driven by an increase from Nordstrom.com of $77, or 11%, while U.S. full-
line net sales for the quarter decreased $56, or 2.5%. On a comparable basis, we experienced an increased volume of transactions partially 
offset by a decrease in the average number of items sold per transaction. Category leaders for the quarter were Beauty and Shoes. 

U.S. full-line comparable sales for the quarter decreased 3.2%. Southern California was the top-performing U.S. full-line geographic region. 

Nordstrom Rack net sales increased $61, or 7%, primarily driven by 27 Nordstrom Rack new store openings since the fourth quarter of 2014, 
while comparable sales decreased 3.0%. On a comparable basis, the average retail price per item sold increased, partially offset by a 
decrease in the total number of items sold. Shoes and Cosmetics were the category leaders, while the South was the top-performing 
geographic region.

Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook experienced outsized growth, with a net sales increase of $57, or 50%, compared with the same period in 
2014.

Credit Card Revenues, net
Credit card revenues, net decreased $54 for the quarter, compared with the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the impact of the 
program agreement with TD (see Note 2: Credit Card Receivable Transaction in Item 8) and amortization of the beneficial interest asset 
recorded as part of the credit card receivable transaction.

Gross Profit
Our total Company gross profit rate decreased 184 basis points compared with the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increased 
markdowns from lower than planned sales and in response to an elevated promotional environment during the holiday season.

Retail Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Our Retail SG&A rate increased 120 basis points primarily due to asset impairment charges related to our full-line store in San Juan, Puerto 
Rico, in addition to other retail and technology assets (see Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in 
Item 8), and higher fulfillment costs supporting online growth.

Credit Expenses
In the fourth quarter of 2015, total credit expenses decreased $18 compared with the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily driven by decreases in 
bad debt expense as a result of the credit card receivable transaction (see Note 2: Credit Card Receivable Transaction in Item 8). 

For further information on our quarterly results in 2015 and 2014, refer to Note 18: Selected Quarterly Data in Item 8.
2016 Outlook
Our expectations for 2016 are as follows:

Net sales increase (percent)
Comparable sales increase (percent)
Retail EBIT increase (percent)1
Credit EBIT
Earnings per diluted share (excluding the impact of any future share
repurchases)
1 Excluding impairment charges of $59 million in 2015, Retail EBIT is expected to have a decrease of 3 percent to an increase of 3 percent relative to last year. 

3.5 to 5.5
0 to 2
3 to 10
$70 to $80 million

$3.10 to $3.35

In the first half of fiscal 2016, the Company expects earnings per diluted share to decrease by approximately 30% relative to the same period 
last year due to the impact of the sale of the credit card receivables, growth initiatives and the shift of the Anniversary Sale event from the 
second quarter in 2015 to the second and third quarters in 2016.

Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries  25

Return on Invested Capital (“ROIC”) (Non-GAAP financial measure)
We believe that ROIC is a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital and 
believe ROIC is an important component of shareholders’ return over the long term. In addition, we incorporate ROIC in our executive 
incentive compensation measures. For the 12 fiscal months ended January 30, 2016, our ROIC decreased to 10.7% compared with 12.6% 
for the 12 fiscal months ended January 31, 2015. This decrease reflected reduced earnings in addition to increased investments supporting 
growth initiatives.

We define ROIC as our net operating profit after tax divided by our average invested capital using the trailing 12-month average. ROIC is not 
a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and should be considered in addition to, and 
not as a substitute for, return on assets, net earnings, total assets or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our 
method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies’ methods and therefore may not be comparable to 
those used by other companies. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to ROIC is return on 
assets. The following is a reconciliation of the components of ROIC and return on assets:

Return on assets
ROIC
1 Capitalized operating leases is our best estimate of the asset base we would record for our leases that are classified as operating if they had met the criteria for a capital lease 
or we had purchased the property. Asset base is calculated as described in footnote 2 below.
2 Based upon the trailing 12-month average of the monthly asset base. The asset base for each month is calculated as the trailing 12 months of rent expense multiplied by eight. 
The multiple of eight times rent expense is a commonly used method of estimating the asset base we would record for our capitalized operating leases described in footnote 1.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We strive to maintain a level of liquidity sufficient to allow us to cover our seasonal cash needs and to maintain appropriate levels of short-
term borrowings. We believe that our operating cash flows, available credit facilities and potential future borrowings are sufficient to finance 
our cash requirements for the next 12 months and beyond.

Over the long term, we manage our cash and capital structure to maximize shareholder return, maintain our financial position, manage 
refinancing risk and allow flexibility for strategic initiatives. We regularly assess our debt and leverage levels, capital expenditure 
requirements, debt service payments, dividend payouts, potential share repurchases and other future investments. We believe that as of 
January 30, 2016, our existing cash and cash equivalents on-hand of $595, available credit facilities of $800 and potential future operating 
cash flows and borrowings will be sufficient to fund these scheduled future payments and potential long-term initiatives. 
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $2,451 in 2015, $1,220 in 2014 and $1,320 in 2013. The majority of our operating cash inflows 
are derived from sales. We also receive cash payments for property incentives from developers. Our operating cash outflows generally 
consist of payments to our merchandise vendors (net of vendor allowances), payments to our employees for wages, salaries and other 
employee benefits and payments to our landlords for rent. Operating cash outflows also include payments for income taxes and interest 
payments on our short-term and long-term borrowings.

Cash provided by operating activities increased by $1,231 between 2015 and 2014, primarily due to $1,297 of net proceeds from the sale of 
our credit card receivables (see Note 2: Credit Card Receivable Transaction in Item 8). Also within operating activities, deferred income 
taxes, net and prepaid expenses and other assets were impacted by a change in an IRS rule regarding repairs of real property.

Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2014 compared with 2013, which was primarily due to higher state tax payments made in 
2014 compared with 2013, as well as changes in working capital in 2014.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $144 in 2015, $889 in 2014 and $822 in 2013. The decrease in cash used in 2015 compared with 
2014 is primarily due to $890 of net proceeds from the sale of our credit card receivables originated at third parties. 

Capital Expenditures
Our capital expenditures over the last three years totaled $2,746, with $1,082 in 2015, $861 in 2014 and $803 in 2013. Capital expenditures 
increased year over year primarily due to ongoing store expansion and increased technology investments.

We had one store relocation in 2015, compared with no relocations in 2014 and three relocations in 2013. Our 2015 new store openings 
increased our square footage by 6.4%.

To date in 2016, we have opened three Nordstrom Rack stores and plan to open an additional 18 Nordstrom Rack stores, two full-line stores 
in Canada and one full-line store in the U.S. during the remainder of 2016. Planned net store openings are expected to increase our retail 
square footage by approximately 4%.

We received property incentives from our developers of $156 in 2015, $110 in 2014 and $89 in 2013. These incentives are included in our 
cash provided by operations in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 8. However, operationally we view these as an offset to 
our capital expenditures. Our capital expenditure percentages, net of property incentives, by category are summarized as follows:

Other capital expenditures consist of ongoing improvements to our stores in the ordinary course of business and expenditures related to 
various growth initiatives.

Our capital expenditures, net of property incentives, over the next five years is expected to be approximately $4,000, compared with $3,300 
over the previous five years. We plan our spending in 2016 to be down slightly compared with 2015. Our capital expenditures, net of property 
incentives, over the next five years is primarily focused in the areas of continued expansion into new markets such as Canada and 
Manhattan, investment in new stores and remodels of existing full-line stores. Over these next five years, we expect that 60% of our net 
capital expenditures will be for new store openings, remodels and relocations, and 40% for ecommerce and information technology. We 
believe that we have the capacity for additional capital investments should opportunities arise.

Proceeds from the Sale of Credit Card Receivables Originated at Third Parties
The Nordstrom Visa credit cards allow our customers to make purchases at merchants outside of our stores and accumulate points for our 
Nordstrom Rewards program. In 2015, we completed the sale of a substantial majority of our credit card receivables resulting in $890 of 
proceeds related to the receivables sold which were originated at third parties. 
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $2,539 in 2015 compared with $698 in 2014 and $589 in 2013. Our financing activities include 
repurchases of common stock, our short-term and long-term borrowing activity, and payment of dividends.

Short-term and Long-term Borrowing Activity 
In 2015, as a condition of closing the credit card receivable transaction (see Note 2: Credit Card Receivable Transaction in Item 8), we 
defeased $325 in secured Series 2011-1 Class A Notes in order to provide the receivables to TD free and clear. 

In 2013, we exchanged $201 senior unsecured notes due in January 2038 for $265 senior unsecured notes due in January 2044. The $201 
of debt that was exchanged is reflected as a non-cash financing activity in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 8 while the 
$64 excess of outstanding principal was recorded as a discount to be amortized over the term of the notes due in 2044.

Dividends
In 2015, we paid dividends of $1,185, or $6.33 per share, compared with $251, or $1.32 per share, in 2014 and $234, or $1.20 per share, in 
2013. Dividends paid in 2015 included a special cash dividend of $905, or $4.85 per share of outstanding common stock, in addition to our 
recurring quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share. The special dividend was authorized by our Board of Directors on October 1, 2015 and was 
paid using proceeds from the sale of our credit card receivables (see Note 2: Credit Card Receivable Transaction in Item 8). During the first 
quarter of 2015, we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.33 per share to $0.37 per share. In determining the amount of dividends to pay, 
we analyze our dividend payout ratio and dividend yield, while taking into consideration our current and projected operating performance and 
liquidity. Our dividend payout ratio target range is 30% to 35% and is calculated as our dividend payments divided by net earnings.

In February 2016, subsequent to year end, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share, which will be paid on March 22, 2016.

Share Repurchases
In February 2013, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $800 of our outstanding common stock, through March 1, 
2015. There was $73 of unused capacity upon program expiration. In September 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a program to 
repurchase up to $1,000 of our outstanding common stock, through March 1, 2016. As of January 30, 2016, there is no capacity remaining 
on the September 2014 authorization. On October 1, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $1,000 of our 
outstanding common stock, through March 1, 2017. During 2015, we repurchased 19.1 shares of our common stock for an aggregate 
purchase price of $1,191 and had $811 remaining in share repurchase capacity as of January 30, 2016. The actual number, price, manner 
and timing of future share repurchases, if any, will be subject to market and economic conditions and applicable SEC rules.

Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP financial measure)
Free Cash Flow is one of our key liquidity measures, and when used in conjunction with GAAP measures, provides investors with a 
meaningful analysis of our ability to generate cash from our business. For the year ended January 30, 2016, Free Cash Flow increased to 
$1,131 compared with $96 for the year ended January 31, 2015, primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of our credit card 
receivables, partially offset by cash dividends paid.

Free Cash Flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, 
operating cash flows or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial 
measures may differ from other companies’ methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. The financial 
measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Free Cash Flow is net cash provided by operating activities. The 
following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow:

Credit Capacity and Commitments
As of January 30, 2016, we had total short-term borrowing capacity of $800, which is our five-year $800 senior unsecured revolving credit 
facility (“revolver”) that expires in April 2020, with an option to extend for an additional year. In April 2015, we terminated our previous 
$800 senior unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire March 2018. Under the terms of our revolver, we pay a variable 
rate of interest and a commitment fee based on our debt rating. The revolver is available for working capital, capital expenditures and general 
corporate purposes. We have the option to increase the revolving commitment by up to $200, to a total of $1,000, provided that we obtain 
written consent from the lenders. 

Our $800 commercial paper program allows us to use the proceeds to fund operating cash requirements. Under the terms of the commercial 
paper agreement, we pay a rate of interest based on, among other factors, the maturity of the issuance and market conditions. The issuance 
of commercial paper has the effect, while it is outstanding, of reducing available liquidity under the revolver by an amount equal to the 
principal amount of commercial paper. 

As of January 30, 2016, we had no issuances outstanding under our commercial paper program and no borrowings outstanding under our 
revolver.

Our wholly owned subsidiary in Puerto Rico maintains a $52 unsecured borrowing facility to support our expansion into that market. The 
facility expires in November 2018 and borrowings on this facility incur interest based upon the LIBOR plus 1.275% per annum and also incurs 
a fee based on our unused commitment. As of January 30, 2016, we had $52 outstanding on this facility.

We have a registration statement on file with the SEC using a “shelf” registration process. Under this shelf registration process, we may offer 
and sell, from time to time, any combination of the securities described in a prospectus to the registration statement, including registered 
debt, provided we maintain Well-known Seasoned Issuer (“WKSI”) status.

We maintain trade and standby letters of credit to facilitate international payments. As of January 30, 2016, we have $8 available under the 
trade letter of credit, with $1 outstanding, and $15 available under the standby letter of credit, with $2 outstanding.

Plans for our Manhattan full-line store, which we currently expect to open in 2019, ultimately include owning a condominium interest in a 
mixed-use tower and leasing certain nearby properties. As of January 30, 2016, we had approximately $176 of fee interest in land, which is 
expected to convert to the condominium interest once the store is constructed. We have committed to make future installment payments 
based on the developer meeting pre-established construction and development milestones. In the unlikely event that this project is not 
completed, the opening may be delayed and we may be subject to future losses or capital commitments in order to complete construction or 
to monetize our previous investments in the land.

Impact of Credit Ratings
Under the terms of our revolver, any borrowings we may enter into will accrue interest for Euro-Dollar Rate Loans at a floating base rate tied 
to LIBOR, for Canadian Dealer Offer Rate Loans at a floating rate tied to CDOR, and for Base Rate Loans at the highest of: (i) the Euro-
Dollar rate plus 100 basis points, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points and (iii) the prime rate.

The rate depends upon the type of borrowing incurred, plus in each case an applicable margin. This applicable margin varies depending 
upon the credit ratings assigned to our long-term unsecured debt. At the time of this report, our long-term unsecured debt ratings, outlook 
and resulting applicable margin were as follows:

Moody’s
Standard & Poor’s

Euro-Dollar Rate Loan

Should the ratings assigned to our long-term unsecured debt improve, the applicable margin associated with any such borrowings may 
decrease, resulting in a slightly lower borrowing cost under this facility. Should the ratings assigned to our long-term unsecured debt worsen, 
the applicable margin associated with our borrowings may increase, resulting in a slightly higher borrowing cost under this facility.
Debt Covenants
The revolver requires that we maintain an adjusted debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent 
(“EBITDAR”) leverage ratio of less than four times (see the following additional discussion of Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR). As of January 30, 
2016, we were in compliance with this covenant. 

30

Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR (Non-GAAP financial measure)
Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR is one of our key financial metrics, and we believe that our debt levels are best analyzed using this measure. Our 
goal is to manage debt levels to maintain an investment-grade credit rating and operate with an efficient capital structure. In evaluating our 
debt levels, this measure provides a reflection of our credit worthiness that could impact our credit rating and borrowing costs. We also have 
a debt covenant that requires an adjusted debt to EBITDAR leverage ratio of less than four times. As of January 30, 2016, our Adjusted Debt 
to EBITDAR was 2.2, compared with 2.1 as of January 31, 2015. This increase was primarily driven by a reduction in earnings before interest 
and income taxes.

Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a 
substitute for, debt to net earnings, net earnings, debt or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our method of 
determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies’ methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by 
other companies. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR is debt to 
net earnings. The following is a reconciliation of the components of Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR and debt to net earnings:

Less: fair value hedge adjustment included in long-term debt

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and the expected effect on our liquidity and cash flows as of January 30, 2016.

Included in the required debt repayments disclosed above are estimated total interest payments of $1,721 as of January 30, 2016, payable 
over the remaining life of the debt.

The capital and operating lease obligations in the table above do not include payments for operating expenses that are required by most of 
our lease agreements. Such expenses, which include common area charges, real estate taxes and other executory costs, totaled $97 in 
2015, $88 in 2014 and $81 in 2013. In addition, some of our leases require additional rental payments based on a percentage of our sales, 
referred to as “percentage rent.” Percentage rent, which is also excluded from the obligations in the table above, was $13 in 2015 and $14 in 
2014 and 2013.

Purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for unreceived goods or services and capital expenditure commitments, including 
our Manhattan store.

Other long-term liabilities consist of workers’ compensation and other liability insurance reserves and postretirement benefits. The payment 
amounts presented above were estimated based on historical payment trends and the amounts due within one year are omitted as these are 
included within current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Other long-term liabilities not requiring cash payments, such as deferred 
property incentives and deferred revenue, were excluded from the table above. Also excluded from the table above are unrecognized tax 
benefits of $13, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash payments, if any, for these liabilities.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
On October 1, 2015, we completed the sale of a substantial majority of our U.S. Visa and private label credit card portfolio to TD (see Note 2: 
Credit Card Receivable Transaction in Item 8). This transaction represents an off-balance sheet arrangement and credit card receivables 
serviced under this contract are $2,222 as of January 30, 2016. The unused credit card capacity available for the accounts retained 
represents an off-balance sheet commitment. As of January 30, 2016, this unfunded commitment was $97. 

Other than operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, the development of our Manhattan full-line store and our credit 
card receivable transaction, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements during 2015.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, 
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and 
other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The following 
discussion highlights the estimates we believe are critical and should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements in Item 8. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit 
Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures that follow.

32

Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue net of estimated sales returns and excluding sales taxes. Revenue from sales to customers shipped directly from our 
stores, website and catalog, which includes shipping revenue when applicable, is recognized upon estimated receipt by the customer. We 
estimate customer merchandise returns based on historical return patterns and reduce sales and cost of sales accordingly.

Although we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates of sales returns, there is a possibility 
that actual returns could differ from recorded amounts. In the past three years, there were no significant changes in customer return behavior 
and we have made no material changes to our estimates included in the calculations of our sales return reserve. A 10% change in the sales 
return reserve would have had a $10 impact on our net earnings for the year ended January 30, 2016.
Inventory
Our merchandise inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market value using the retail inventory method. Under the retail 
method, the valuation of inventories are determined by applying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of ending inventory. The 
value of our inventory on the balance sheet is then reduced by a charge to cost of sales for retail inventory markdowns taken on the selling 
floor. To determine if the retail value of our inventory should be marked down, we consider current and anticipated demand, customer 
preferences, age of the merchandise and fashion trends. Inherent in the retail inventory method are certain management judgments that may 
affect the ending inventory valuation as well as gross profit.

We reserve for obsolescence based on historical trends and specific identification. Our obsolescence reserve contains uncertainties as the 
calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors, including market conditions, 
the selling environment, historical results and current inventory trends.

We do not believe that the assumptions used in these estimates will change significantly based on prior experience. In the past three years, 
we have made no material changes to our estimates included in the calculations of the obsolescence reserve. A 10% change in the 
obsolescence reserve would have had a $2 impact on our net earnings for the year ended January 30, 2016.
Goodwill
We review our goodwill annually for impairment or when circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable. We perform this 
evaluation at the reporting unit level, comprised of the principal business units within our Retail segment, through the application of a two-
step fair value test. The first step compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value, which is based on the expected 
present value of future cash flows (income approach), comparable public companies and acquisitions (market approach) or a combination of 
both. If fair value is lower than the carrying value, then a second step is performed to quantify the amount of the impairment. 

As part of our impairment testing, we utilize certain assumptions and apply judgment regarding a number of factors. Significant estimates in 
the market approach include identifying similar companies and acquisitions with comparable business factors such as size, growth, 
profitability, risk and return of investment, and assessing comparable earnings or revenue multiples in estimating the fair value of the 
reporting unit. Assumptions in the income approach include future cash flows for the business, future growth rates and discount rates. 
Estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes to the business model 
or changes in operating performance. For Nordstrom.com, Jeffrey, Trunk Club and HauteLook, the fair values substantially exceeded 
carrying values and therefore we had no material goodwill impairment in 2015, 2014 or 2013. A 10% change in the fair value of any of these 
reporting units would not have had an impact on our net earnings for the year ended January 30, 2016. 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long-lived assets, including buildings, equipment and amortizable 
intangible assets, may be impaired, we perform an evaluation of recoverability by comparing the carrying values of the net assets to their 
related projected undiscounted future cash flows, in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses. 

Land, property and equipment are grouped at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash flows when assessing impairment. Cash 
flows for our retail store assets are identified at the individual store level, while our intangible assets associated with HauteLook and Trunk 
Club are identified at their respective reporting unit levels. The assets recorded in connection with the credit card receivable transaction are 
individually evaluated against the anticipated cash flows under the program agreement (see Note 2: Credit Card Receivable Transaction in 
Item 8). 

Our estimates are subject to uncertainties and may be impacted by various external factors such as economic conditions and market 
competition. While we believe the inputs and assumptions utilized in our analyses of future cash flows are reasonable, events or 
circumstances may change which could cause us to revise these estimates.

Stock-Based Compensation Expense
We grant stock-based awards under our 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (“2010 Plan”), 2002 Nonemployee Director Stock Incentive Plan (“2002 
Plan”) and Trunk Club Value Creation Plan (“VCP”), and employees may purchase our stock at a discount under our Employee Stock 
Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). We predominantly recognize stock-based compensation expense related to stock-based awards at their estimated 
grant date fair value, recorded on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Compensation expense for certain award holders is 
accelerated based upon achievement of age and years of service. The total compensation expense is reduced by estimated forfeitures 
expected to occur over the vesting period of the awards. 

We estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using the Binomial Lattice option valuation model. Stock-based compensation expense 
related to the VCP is based on the grant date fair value of the payout scenario we believe is probable using the Black-Scholes valuation 
model and is recognized on an accelerated basis due to performance criteria and graded vesting features of the plan. The fair value of 
restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant. 

Calculating the grant date fair value of stock-based awards is based on certain assumptions and requires judgment, including estimating 
stock price volatility, forfeiture rates, expected life and performance criteria. A 10% change in stock-based compensation expense would have 
a $4 impact on our net earnings for the year ended January 30, 2016.
Income Taxes
We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Using this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded 
based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. 
The deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the 
differences are expected to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a 
valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, it is determined that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized.

We regularly evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit for income tax positions we have taken in various federal, state and foreign filings 
by considering all relevant facts, circumstances and information available. If we believe it is more likely than not that our position will be 
sustained, we recognize a benefit at the largest amount that we believe is cumulatively greater than 50% likely to be realized. Our 
unrecognized tax benefit was $19 as of January 30, 2016 and $15 as of January 31, 2015. Interest and penalties related to income tax 
matters are classified as a component of income tax expense.

Income taxes require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various 
income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. Also, as audits are completed or statutes of limitations lapse, it may be 
necessary to record adjustments to our taxes payable, deferred taxes, tax reserves or income tax expense. Such adjustments did not 
materially impact our effective income tax rate in 2015 or 2014.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
See Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8 for a discussion of recent accounting 
pronouncements and the impact these standards are anticipated to have on our results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Dollars in millions
INTEREST RATE RISK
We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in short-term interest rates. On October 1, 2015, we completed the sale of a 
substantial majority of our U.S. Visa and private label credit card portfolio to TD (see Note 2: Credit Card Receivable Transaction in Item 8), 
and following the close, the interest rate risk on our retained receivables is insignificant.

For our long-term debt of $2,805, our exposure to interest rate risk is limited to changes in fair value. As our debt is primarily fixed-rate, 
changes in interest rates do not significantly impact our cash flows. However, changes in interest rates increase or decrease the fair value of 
our debt, depending on whether market rates are lower or higher than our fixed-rates. As of January 30, 2016, the fair value of our long-term 
debt was $3,077. See Note 9: Debt and Credit Facilities and Note 10: Fair Value Measurements in Item 8 for additional information.
FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK
The majority of our revenues, expenses and capital expenditures are transacted in U.S. Dollars. Our U.S. operation periodically enters into 
merchandise purchase orders denominated in British Pounds or Euros. From time to time, we may use forward contracts to hedge against 
fluctuations in foreign currency prices. As of January 30, 2016, our outstanding forward contracts did not have a material impact on our 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

We have three full-line stores in Canada and have announced plans to open four additional stores in Canada over the next few years. The 
functional currency of our Canadian operations is the Canadian Dollar. We translate assets and liabilities into U.S. Dollars using the 
exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date, while we translate revenues and expenses using a weighted-average exchange rate for 
the period. We record these translation adjustments as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheets in Item 8. Our Canadian operations enter into merchandise purchase orders denominated in U.S. Dollars for approximately half of its 
inventory. As sales in Canada are denominated in the Canadian Dollar, gross profit for our Canadian operations can be impacted by foreign 
currency fluctuations. 

In addition, our U.S. operations incur certain expenditures denominated in Canadian Dollars and our Canadian operations incur certain 
expenditures denominated in U.S. Dollars. This activity results in transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations and 
are recorded as gains or losses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Item 8. As of January 30, 2016, activities associated with 
foreign currency exchange risk have not had a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Nordstrom, Inc. 
Seattle, Washington

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 30, 
2016 and January 31, 2015, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, shareholders’ equity, and cash 
flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 30, 2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s 
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those 
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as 
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Nordstrom, Inc. and 
subsidiaries as of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years 
in the period ended January 30, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s 
internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2016, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 14, 2016 expressed 
an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Dollar and share amounts in millions except per share, per option and per unit amounts

NOTE 1:  NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company
Founded in 1901 as a shoe store in Seattle, Washington, Nordstrom, Inc. is now a leading fashion specialty retailer that offers customers a 
well-edited selection of high-quality fashion brands focused on apparel, shoes, cosmetics and accessories for women, men, young adults and 
children. This breadth of merchandise allows us to serve a wide range of customers who appreciate quality fashion and a superior shopping 
experience. We offer an extensive selection of high-quality brand-name and private label merchandise through multiple retail channels, 
including 118 Nordstrom U.S. full-line stores and at Nordstrom.com, three Canada full-line stores, 194 off-price Nordstrom Rack stores, 
Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook, five Trunk Club clubhouses and TrunkClub.com, two Jeffrey boutiques and one Last Chance clearance store. 
Our stores are located in 39 states throughout the U.S and in three provinces in Canada.

Through our Credit segment, our customers can access a variety of payment products and services, including a Nordstrom-branded private 
label card, two Nordstrom-branded Visa credit cards and a debit card for Nordstrom purchases. These credit and debit cards also allow our 
customers to participate in our loyalty program designed to increase customer visits and spending. Although the primary purposes of our 
Credit segment are to foster greater customer loyalty and drive more sales, through our program agreement with TD Bank, N.A. (“TD”) (see 
Note 2: Credit Card Receivable Transaction), we also receive credit card revenue, net in accordance with the program agreement. In 
addition, we save on interchange fees that the Retail segment would incur if our customers used non-Nordstrom-branded cards.
Fiscal Year
We operate on a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to January 31st. References to 2015 and all years within this 
document are based on a 52-week fiscal year, except 2012, which is based on a 53-week fiscal year.
Principles of Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the balances of Nordstrom, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and 
balances are eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets 
and liabilities during the reporting period. Uncertainties regarding such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial 
statements and actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. Our most significant accounting judgments and estimates 
include revenue recognition, inventory, long-lived assets, goodwill, stock-based compensation and income taxes.
Net Sales
We recognize revenue net of estimated returns and excluding sales taxes. Revenue from sales to customers shipped directly from our stores, 
website and catalog, which includes shipping revenue when applicable, is recognized upon estimated receipt by the customer. We estimate 
customer merchandise returns based on historical return patterns and reduce sales and cost of sales accordingly. Activity in the allowance for 
sales returns, net, for the past three fiscal years is as follows:

Fiscal year
Allowance at beginning of year
Additions
Returns, net1
Allowance at end of year

Credit Card Revenues, net
On October 1, 2015, we completed the sale of a substantial majority of our U.S. Visa and private label credit card portfolio to TD (see Note 2: 
Credit Card Receivable Transaction). Prior to the close of the credit card receivable transaction, credit card revenues included finance 
charges, late fees and other revenue generated by our combined Nordstrom private label card and Nordstrom Visa credit card programs, and 
interchange fees generated by the use of Nordstrom Visa credit cards at third-party merchants. Finance charges and late fees were assessed 
according to the terms of the related cardholder agreements and recognized as revenue when earned. Credit card revenues were recorded 
net of estimated uncollectible finance charges and fees.

Nordstrom, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Dollar and share amounts in millions except per share, per option and per unit amounts

Following the close of the transaction and pursuant to the program agreement with TD, credit card revenues, net includes our portion of the 
ongoing credit card revenue, net of credit losses, from both the sold and newly generated credit card receivables. Asset amortization and 
deferred revenue recognition associated with assets and liabilities recorded as part of the transaction are also recorded in credit card 
revenues, net.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales includes the purchase cost of inventory sold (net of vendor allowances), in-bound freight and certain costs of our loyalty 
program benefits.
Loyalty Program
Customers who use Nordstrom private label credit or debit cards or Nordstrom Visa credit cards can participate in the Nordstrom Rewards 
program through which customers accumulate points based on their level of spending. Upon reaching a certain points threshold, customers 
receive Nordstrom Notes, which can be redeemed for goods or services and can translate into benefits such as reimbursements for 
alterations. Other benefits include Personal Triple Points days and early access to sales events. 

We estimate the net cost of Nordstrom Notes that will be issued and redeemed and record this cost as rewards points are accumulated. 
These costs, as well as reimbursed alterations, are recorded in cost of sales given that we provide customers with products and services for 
these rewards. Other costs of the loyalty program, including shopping and fashion events, are recorded in selling, general and administrative 
expenses.
Buying and Occupancy Costs
Buying costs consist primarily of compensation and other costs incurred by our merchandising and product development groups. Occupancy 
costs include rent, depreciation, property taxes and facility operating costs of our retail, corporate center, fulfillment facilities and distribution 
operations.
Rent
We recognize minimum rent expense, net of landlord reimbursements, on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease term from the time 
that we control the leased property. For leases that contain predetermined, fixed escalations of the minimum rent, we recognize the rent 
expense on a straight-line basis and record the difference between the rent expense and the rent payable as a deferred credit. Contingent 
rental payments, typically based on a percentage of sales, are recognized in rent expense when payment of the contingent rent is probable.

We receive incentives from landlords to construct stores in certain developments. These property incentives are recorded as a deferred credit 
and recognized as a reduction of rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. At the end of 2015 and 2014, the deferred credit 
balance was $526 and $570.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit costs, advertising, shipping and handling costs, 
other miscellaneous expenses and, prior to our credit card receivable transaction in October 2015, bad debt expense related to our credit 
card operations.
Advertising
Advertising production costs for Internet, magazines, store events and other media are expensed the first time the advertisement is run. 
Online marketing costs are expensed when incurred. Total advertising expenses, net of vendor allowances, of $227, $195 and $167 in 2015, 
2014 and 2013 were included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

Vendor Allowances
We receive allowances from merchandise vendors for cosmetic expenses, purchase price adjustments, cooperative advertising programs 
and various other expenses. Allowances for cosmetic expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses as a reduction 
of the related costs when incurred. Purchase price adjustments are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales at the point they have been 
earned and the related merchandise has been marked down or sold. Allowances for cooperative advertising programs and other expenses 
are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses as a reduction of the related costs when incurred. Any allowances in excess of 
actual costs incurred that are included in selling, general and administrative expenses are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales. Vendor 
allowances earned are as follows:

Shipping and Handling Costs
Our shipping and handling costs include payments to third-party shippers and costs to hold, move and prepare merchandise for shipment. 
These costs do not include in-bound freight to our distribution centers, which we include in the cost of our inventory. Shipping and handling 
costs of $428, $348 and $267 in 2015, 2014 and 2013 were included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
Stock-Based Compensation
We grant stock-based awards under our 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (“2010 Plan”), 2002 Nonemployee Director Stock Incentive Plan (“2002 
Plan”) and Trunk Club Value Creation Plan (“VCP”), and employees may purchase our stock at a discount under our Employee Stock 
Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). We predominantly recognize stock-based compensation expense related to stock-based awards at their estimated 
grant date fair value, recorded on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Compensation expense for certain award holders is 
accelerated based upon achievement of age and years of service. The total compensation expense is reduced by estimated forfeitures 
expected to occur over the vesting period of the awards. 

We estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using the Binomial Lattice option valuation model. Stock-based compensation expense 
related to the VCP is based on the grant date fair value of the payout scenario we believe is probable using the Black-Scholes valuation 
model and is recognized on an accelerated basis due to performance criteria and graded vesting features of the plan. The fair value of 
restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant. 
New Store Opening Costs
Non-capital expenditures associated with opening new stores, including marketing expenses, relocation expenses and temporary occupancy 
costs, are charged to expense as incurred. These costs are included in both buying and occupancy costs and selling, general and 
administrative expenses according to their nature as disclosed above.
Gift Cards
We recognize revenue from the sale of gift cards when the gift card is redeemed by the customer, or we recognize breakage income when 
the likelihood of redemption, based on historical experience, is deemed to be remote. Based on an analysis of our program since its inception 
in 1999, we determined that balances remaining on cards issued beyond five years are unlikely to be redeemed and therefore is recognized 
as income. Breakage income was $11, $8 and $9 in 2015, 2014 and 2013. To date, our breakage rate is approximately 3% of the amount 
initially issued as gift cards. Gift card breakage income is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. We had outstanding gift 
card liabilities of $327 and $286 at the end of 2015 and 2014, which are included in other current liabilities.
Income Taxes
We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Using this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded 
based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. 
The deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the 
differences are expected to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a 
valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, it is determined that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized.

Dollar and share amounts in millions except per share, per option and per unit amounts

We regularly evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit for income tax positions we have taken in various federal, state and foreign filings 
by considering all relevant facts, circumstances and information available. If we believe it is more likely than not that our position will be 
sustained, we recognize a benefit at the largest amount that we believe is cumulatively greater than 50% likely to be realized. Interest and 
penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense.

Income taxes require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various 
income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. Also, as audits are completed or statutes of limitations lapse, it may be 
necessary to record adjustments to our taxes payable, deferred taxes, tax reserves or income tax expense. 
Comprehensive Net Earnings
Comprehensive net earnings consist of net earnings and other gains and losses affecting equity that are excluded from net earnings. These 
consist of postretirement plan adjustments, net of related income tax effects and foreign currency translation adjustments. 
Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents are short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase and are carried at amortized 
cost, which approximates fair value. Our cash management system provides for the reimbursement of all major bank disbursement accounts 
on a daily basis. Accounts payable at the end of 2015 and 2014 included $152 and $129 of checks not yet presented for payment drawn in 
excess of our bank deposit balances.
Accounts Receivable
Prior to the close of the credit card receivable transaction, accounts receivable included credit card receivables from our Nordstrom private 
label and U.S. Visa credit cards, as well as credit and debit card receivables due from third parties. Following the close of the credit card 
receivable transaction (see Note 2: Credit Card Receivable Transaction), our remaining accounts receivable, net includes employee credit 
card receivables and receivables from non-Nordstrom-branded cards.

We continue to record accounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, net of an allowance for credit losses. The allowance for 
credit losses reflects our best estimate of the losses inherent in our receivables as of the balance sheet date. 

Nordstrom private label credit and debit cards can be used only at our Nordstrom full-line stores in the U.S., Nordstrom Rack stores, 
Nordstrom.com and Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook, while Nordstrom Visa credit cards also may be used for purchases outside of 
Nordstrom. Cash flows from the use of both the private label and Nordstrom Visa credit cards for sales originating at our stores and our 
website are treated as an operating activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, as they relate to sales at Nordstrom. Prior to 
the credit card receivable transaction, we treated cash flows arising from the use of Nordstrom Visa credit cards outside of our stores as an 
investing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, as they represented loans made to our customers for purchases at third 
parties. 
Merchandise Inventories
Merchandise inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market value using the retail inventory method (weighted-average cost). 
Under the retail method, the valuation of inventories are determined by applying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of ending 
inventory. The value of our inventory on the balance sheet is then reduced by a charge to cost of sales for retail inventory markdowns taken 
on the selling floor. To determine if the retail value of our inventory should be marked down, we consider current and anticipated demand, 
customer preferences, age of the merchandise and fashion trends. We reserve for obsolescence based on historical trends and specific 
identification. 
Land, Property and Equipment
Land is recorded at historical cost, while property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. 
Capitalized software includes the costs of developing or obtaining internal-use software, including external direct costs of materials and 
services and internal payroll costs related to the software project.

We capitalize interest on construction in progress and software projects during the period in which expenditures have been made, activities 
are in progress to prepare the asset for its intended use and actual interest costs are being incurred. 

44

Nordstrom, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Dollar and share amounts in millions except per share, per option and per unit amounts

Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the asset’s estimated useful life, which is determined by 
asset category as follows:

Asset
Buildings and improvements
Store fixtures and equipment
Leasehold improvements
Capitalized software

Life (in years)
5 – 40
3 – 15
5 – 40
3 – 7

Leasehold improvements and leased property and equipment that are purchased at the inception of the lease, or during the lease term, are 
amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the asset life. Lease terms include the fixed, non-cancellable term of a lease, plus any renewal 
periods determined to be reasonably assured. 

We receive contributions from vendors for the construction of certain fixtures in our stores. These contributions offset the related capital 
expenditures. 
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the related net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. As 
of January 30, 2016, we had Trunk Club goodwill of $261, HauteLook goodwill of $121 and Nordstrom.com and Jeffrey goodwill of $53. We 
review our goodwill annually for impairment or when circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable. We perform this 
evaluation at the reporting unit level, comprised of the principal business units within our Retail segment, through the application of a two-step 
fair value test. The first step compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value, which is based on the expected 
present value of future cash flows (income approach), comparable public companies and acquisitions (market approach) or a combination of 
both. If fair value is lower than the carrying value, then a second step is performed to quantify the amount of the impairment. 
Long-Lived Assets
When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long-lived assets, including buildings, equipment and amortizable 
intangible assets, may be impaired, we perform an evaluation of recoverability by comparing the carrying values of the net assets to their 
related projected undiscounted future cash flows, in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses. 

Land, property and equipment are grouped at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash flows when assessing impairment. Cash 
flows for our retail store assets are identified at the individual store level, while our intangible assets associated with HauteLook and Trunk 
Club are identified at their respective reporting unit levels. The assets recorded in connection with the credit card receivable transaction are 
individually evaluated against the anticipated cash flows under the program agreement (see Note 2: Credit Card Receivable Transaction).

In 2015, our cash flow analyses resulted in retail store impairment charges of $24 and other various impairment losses of $23. The retail 
store impairment of $24 relates to our full-line store in Puerto Rico and was primarily driven by a challenging retail market in this territory. We 
did not record any material impairment losses for long-lived tangible or amortizable intangible assets in 2014 or 2013. 

Amortization expense for acquired intangibles was $16, $10 and $10 in 2015, 2014 and 2013. Future amortization expense of acquired 
intangible assets as of January 30, 2016 are expected to be $15 in 2016, $11 in 2017, $7 in 2018, $7 in 2019, and $7 in 2020.
Self-Insurance
We retain a portion of the risk for certain losses related to employee health and welfare, workers’ compensation and other liability claims. 
Liabilities associated with these losses include undiscounted estimates of both losses reported and losses incurred but not yet reported. We 
estimate our ultimate cost using an actuarially-based analysis of claims experience, regulatory changes and other relevant factors.
Foreign Currency
We have three full-line stores in Canada and have announced plans to open four additional stores in Canada over the next few years. The 
functional currency of our Canadian operations is the Canadian Dollar. We translate assets and liabilities into U.S. Dollars using the 
exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date, while we translate revenues and expenses using a weighted-average exchange rate for the 
period. We record these translation adjustments as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheets. In addition, our U.S. operations incur certain expenditures denominated in Canadian Dollars and our Canadian operations incur 
certain expenditures denominated in U.S. Dollars. This activity results in transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate 
fluctuations and are recorded as gains or losses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. As of January 30, 2016, activities associated 
with the foreign currency exchange risk have not had a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers, which was subsequently modified in August 2015 by ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: 
Deferral of the Effective Date. The core principle of ASU No. 2014-09 is that companies should recognize revenue when the transfer of 
promised goods or services to customers occurs in an amount that reflects what the company expects to receive. It requires additional 
disclosures to describe the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from contracts with customers. This guidance 
is now effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact the provisions would have on our 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This ASU requires 
deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as noncurrent in the statement of financial position. The change simplifies classification and 
reporting by eliminating the identification of net current and net noncurrent deferred tax assets or liabilities. We elected to early adopt this 
ASU resulting in a reclassification of our current deferred tax assets, net to long-term deferred tax assets, net, included within other non-
current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 30, 2016. We have implemented the guidance on a prospective basis, 
therefore prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. This ASU increases transparency and comparability by recognizing a lessee’s 
rights and obligations resulting from leases by recording them on the balance sheet as lease assets and lease liabilities. The new standard 
requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not 
the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an 
effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. This ASU is effective for us beginning with the first quarter of 
2019. Though we are currently evaluating the impact of these provisions, we expect it will have a material impact on our Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
NOTE 2:  CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLE TRANSACTION
On October 1, 2015, we completed the sale of a substantial majority of our U.S. Visa and private label credit card portfolio to TD. In 
connection with the sale, we entered into a long-term program agreement under which TD is the exclusive issuer of our U.S. consumer credit 
cards. The following events summarize our credit card receivable transaction:

•

•

•

•

Receivables Reclassification – In the second quarter of 2015, we reclassified substantially all of our U.S. Visa and private label
credit card receivables from “held for investment” to “held for sale” and, as such, recorded these receivables at the lower of cost
(par) or fair value, resulting in the reversal of an allowance for credit losses of $64.
Secured Notes Defeasance – In September 2015, we completed the defeasance of our $325 Series 2011-1 Class A Notes in order
to provide the credit card receivables to TD free and clear.
Transaction Close – At close we received $2.2 billion in cash consideration reflecting the par value of the receivables sold, and
incurred $32 in transaction-related expenses during the third quarter.
Program Agreement – Pursuant to the agreement, we are obligated to offer and administer our loyalty program and perform other
account servicing functions. In return, we receive a portion of the ongoing credit card revenue, net of credit losses, from both the
sold and newly generated credit card receivables.

Transaction Accounting
The Purchase and Sale and Program agreements constitute a multiple element arrangement. These agreements were accounted for in 
accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 605, Revenue Recognition and ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing. We allocated 
the upfront cash consideration to each of the contract elements, including but not limited to receivables, accounts and loyalty obligations 
based upon relative selling price or fair value. We then recognized revenue on each of the contract elements that were delivered or earned, 
including receivables sold and accounts delivered, and deferred revenue on each of the elements that remained undelivered or unearned, 
including loyalty obligations.

We recorded the following assets and liabilities associated with the arrangement: 

•
•

•

Beneficial interest asset of $62 – represents the present value of the expected profits on the receivables sold.
Deferred revenue of $289 – primarily related to our obligation to offer and administer our loyalty program over the term of the
agreement.
Investment in contract asset of $210 – represents the future economic benefit associated with the arrangement and is equal to the
difference between the carrying value of the delivered elements and the upfront cash consideration allocated to those elements.

• We did not record a servicing asset or liability as our servicing fee approximates that of a market participant and represents

adequate compensation.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The beneficial interest asset is carried at fair value (see Note 10: Fair Value Measurements) and is amortized over approximately four years 
based primarily on the payment rate of the associated receivables. The deferred revenue and investment in contract asset are recognized/
amortized over seven years on a straight line basis, following the delivery of the contract obligations and expected life of the agreement. We 
record each of these items in credit card revenue, net in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 
NOTE 3:  TRUNK CLUB ACQUISITION
On August 22, 2014, we acquired 100% of the outstanding equity of Trunk Club, a personalized clothing service for men and women. The 
purchase price of $357 was partially offset by $46 attributable to Trunk Club employee stock awards that are subject to ongoing vesting 
requirements and are recorded as compensation expense. Of the purchase price consideration, $35 represented an indemnity holdback 
related to representations, warranties and covenants. We allocated the net purchase price of $311 to the tangible and intangible assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date, with the remaining unallocated net purchase 
price recorded as goodwill. In connection with the acquisition, we recorded current assets of $21, intangible assets of $59, goodwill of $261, 
and other non-current assets of $2, offset by net liabilities of $32. 

On the acquisition date, $280 of the net purchase price was settled in Nordstrom common stock, and during the third quarter of 2015 we 
settled most of an indemnity holdback, $23 of which was settled in Nordstrom common stock.

We are self-insured for the majority of our employee health and welfare coverage and we do not use stop-loss coverage. Participants 
contribute to the cost of their coverage through both premiums and out-of-pocket expenses and are subject to certain plan limits and 
deductibles.

Our liability policies, encompassing employment practices liability and commercial general liability, have a retention per claim of $3 or less 
and a policy limit up to $30 and $150, respectively.
NOTE 7:  401(k) PLAN
We provide a 401(k) plan for our employees that allows for employee elective contributions and discretionary Company contributions. 
Employee elective contributions are funded through voluntary payroll deductions. Our discretionary Company contribution is funded in an 
amount determined by our Board of Directors each year. Our expense related to Company contributions totaled $62, $77 and $77 in 2015, 
2014 and 2013.
NOTE 8:  POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
We have an unfunded defined benefit Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”), which provides retirement benefits to certain 
officers and select employees. The SERP has different benefit levels depending on the participant’s role in the Company. At the end of 2015, 
we had 59 participants in the plan, including 26 officers and select employees eligible for SERP benefits, 32 retirees and one beneficiary. This 
plan is non-qualified and does not have a minimum funding requirement.

transaction, all of our Nordstrom private label card receivables and a 90% interest in our Nordstrom Visa credit card receivables served as 
collateral for our Series 2011-1 Class A Notes. 

Our mortgage payable is secured by an office building that had a net book value of $62 at the end of 2015. Other secured debt as of

facility (“revolver”) that expires in April 2020, with an option to extend for an additional year. In April 2015, we terminated our previous 
$800 senior unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire March 2018. Under the terms of our revolver, we pay a variable 
rate of interest and a commitment fee based on our debt rating. The revolver is available for working capital, capital expenditures and general 
corporate purposes. We have the option to increase the revolving commitment by up to $200, to a total of $1,000, provided that we obtain 
written consent from the lenders. 

The revolver requires that we maintain an adjusted debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent 
(“EBITDAR”) leverage ratio of less than four times. As of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, we were in compliance with this covenant. 

Our $800 commercial paper program allows us to use the proceeds to fund operating cash requirements. Under the terms of the commercial 
paper agreement, we pay a rate of interest based on, among other factors, the maturity of the issuance and market conditions. The issuance 
of commercial paper has the effect, while it is outstanding, of reducing available liquidity under the revolver by an amount equal to the 
principal amount of commercial paper. 

As of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, we had no issuances outstanding under our commercial paper program and no borrowings 
outstanding under our revolver.

Our wholly owned subsidiary in Puerto Rico maintains a $52 unsecured borrowing facility to support our expansion into that market. The 
facility expires in November 2018 and borrowings on this facility incur interest based upon the LIBOR plus 1.275% per annum and also incurs 
a fee based on our unused commitment. As of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, we had $52 and $37 outstanding on this facility which 
is included as a component in other unsecured debt.

NOTE 10:  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
We disclose our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets by level within the fair 
value hierarchy as defined by applicable accounting standards:

Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2: Other observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data
Level 3: Unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by market data that reflect the reporting entity’s own 

 assumptions

Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
We recorded a beneficial interest asset when we completed the sale of a substantial majority of our U.S. Visa and private label credit card 
portfolio (see Note 2: Credit Card Receivable Transaction). We determined the fair value of the beneficial interest asset based on a 
discounted cash flow model using Level 3 inputs of the fair value hierarchy. Inputs and assumptions include the discount rate, payment rate, 
credit loss rate and revenues and expenses associated with the program agreement. Given our review of market participant capital structures 
in the banking and credit card industries and our historical and expected portfolio performance, we used the following ranges of input 
assumptions to determine the fair value at year end:

Discount rate
Monthly payment rate
Annual credit loss rate
Annual revenues as a percent to credit card receivables
Annual expenses as a percent to credit card receivables

Minimum
12%
6%
2%
10%
4%

Maximum
12%
18%
4%
18%
9%

We recognized $25 of amortization expense in 2015 on the beneficial interest asset which had a fair value of $37 at January 30, 2016. 
Amortization primarily reflects payments received on the receivables sold and is recorded in credit card revenues, net. 

We did not have any financial assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of January 31, 2015. 
Financial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value
Financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts 
payable and approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. 

We estimate the fair value of long-term debt using quoted market prices of the same or similar issues and, as such, this is considered a Level 
2 fair value measurement. The following table summarizes the carrying value and fair value estimate of our long-term debt, including current 
maturities:

Carrying value of long-term debt
Fair value of long-term debt

January 30, 2016
$2,805
3,077

January 31, 2015
$3,131
3,693

Non-financial Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
We also measure certain non-financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, primarily goodwill, investment in contract asset and other 
long-lived tangible and intangible assets, in connection with periodic evaluations for potential impairment. In 2015, we recorded asset 
impairment charges of $59, which are included in our Retail Business selling, general and administrative expenses (see Note 17: Segment 
Reporting). For additional information related to goodwill, intangible assets, long-lived assets and impairments, see Note 1: Nature of 
Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We did not record any material impairment losses in 2014 and 2013. We 
estimate the fair value of goodwill and long-lived tangible and intangible assets using primarily unobservable inputs and, as such, these are 
considered Level 3 fair value measurements.

NOTE 11:  LEASES
We lease the land or the land and buildings at many of our stores. Additionally, we lease office facilities, warehouses and equipment. Most of 
these leases are classified as operating leases and they expire at various dates through 2080. The majority of our fixed, non-cancellable 
lease terms are 15 to 30 years for Nordstrom full-line stores and 10 to 15 years for Nordstrom Rack stores. Many of our leases include 
options that allow us to extend the lease term beyond the initial commitment period, subject to terms agreed to at lease inception. Most of our 
leases also provide for payment of operating expenses, such as common area charges, real estate taxes and other executory costs, and 
some leases require additional payments based on sales, referred to as “percentage rent.”

Future minimum lease payments as of January 30, 2016 are as follows:

2014 and $81 in 2013.
NOTE 12:  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Our estimated total purchase obligations, capital expenditure contractual commitments and inventory purchase orders were $2,010 as of 
January 30, 2016. In connection with the purchase of foreign merchandise, we have outstanding trade letters of credit totaling $1 as of 
January 30, 2016.

Plans for our Manhattan full-line store, which we currently expect to open in 2019, ultimately include owning a condominium interest in a 
mixed-use tower and leasing certain nearby properties. As of January 30, 2016, we had approximately $176 of fee interest in land, which is 
expected to convert to the condominium interest once the store is constructed. We have committed to make future installment payments 
based on the developer meeting pre-established construction and development milestones. In the unlikely event that this project is not 
completed, the opening may be delayed and we may be subject to future losses or capital commitments in order to complete construction or 
to monetize our previous investments in the land.

NOTE 13:  SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY
In February 2013, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $800 of our outstanding common stock, through March 1, 
2015. There was $73 of unused capacity upon program expiration. In September 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a program to 
repurchase up to $1,000 of our outstanding common stock, through March 1, 2016.  As of January 30, 2016, there is no capacity remaining 
on the September 2014 authorization. On October 1, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $1,000 of our 
outstanding common stock, through March 1, 2017. The following is a summary of the activity related to our share repurchase programs in

We paid dividends of $6.33 per share in 2015, $1.32 per share in 2014 and $1.20 per share in 2013. Dividends paid in 2015 included a 
special cash dividend of $905, or $4.85 per share of outstanding common stock, in addition to our recurring quarterly dividend of $0.37 per 
share. The special dividend was authorized by our Board of Directors on October 1, 2015 and was paid using proceeds from the sale of our 
credit card receivables (see Note 2: Credit Card Receivable Transaction). 

In February 2016, subsequent to year end, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share, which will be paid on March 22, 2016.
NOTE 14:  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
We currently grant stock-based awards under our 2010 Equity Incentive Plan, 2002 Nonemployee Director Stock Incentive Plan and Trunk 
Club Value Creation Plan, and employees may purchase our stock at a discount under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

In 2010, our shareholders approved the adoption of the 2010 Plan, which replaced the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (“2004 Plan”). The 2010 
Plan authorizes the grant of stock options, performance share units, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights and both restricted and 
unrestricted shares of common stock to employees. The aggregate number of shares to be issued under the 2010 Plan may not exceed 27.6 
plus any shares currently outstanding under the 2004 Plan that are forfeited or expire during the term of the 2010 Plan. No future grants will 
be made under the 2004 Plan. As of January 30, 2016, we have 70.4 shares authorized, 42.6 shares issued and outstanding and 13.5 shares 
remaining available for future grants under the 2010 Plan.

The 2002 Nonemployee Director Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of stock awards to our nonemployee directors. These awards may 
be deferred or issued in the form of restricted or unrestricted stock, non-qualified stock options or stock appreciation rights. As of January 30, 
2016, we had 0.9 shares authorized and 0.5 shares available for issuance under this plan. In 2015, total expense on deferred shares was 
less than $1.

Under the ESPP, employees may make payroll deductions of up to 10% of their base and bonus compensation. At the end of each six-month 
offering period, participants may apply their accumulated payroll deductions toward the purchase of shares of our common stock at 90% of 
the fair market value on the last day of the offer period. As of January 30, 2016, we had 12.6 shares authorized and 3.0 shares available for 
issuance under the ESPP.

and is reflected as excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Special Dividend Adjustment
In connection with the closing of our credit card receivable transaction on October 1, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a special cash 
dividend of $4.85 per share (see Note 13: Shareholders’ Equity). As required by our equity incentive plans, an adjustment was made to 
outstanding awards to prevent dilution of their value resulting from the special cash dividend. These adjustments did not result in incremental 
stock-based compensation expense as the anti-dilutive adjustments were required by our equity incentive plans. The adjustments to awards 
included increasing the number of outstanding restricted stock units, stock options and performance shares, as well as reducing the exercise 
prices of outstanding stock options. The impact of these adjustments are reflected in the disclosures below.
Stock Options
We used the following assumptions to estimate the fair value for stock options at grant date (excluding options granted in connection with the 
Trunk Club acquisition):
Fiscal year
Risk-free interest rate: Represents the yield on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon securities that 

2015
0.2% – 2.1%

2014
0.2% – 2.6%

2013
0.2% – 1.8%

mature over the 10-year life of the stock options.

Weighted-average volatility: Based on a combination of the historical volatility of our common 

stock and the implied volatility of exchange-traded options for our common stock.

Weighted-average expected dividend yield: Our forecasted dividend yield for the next 10 

years.

Expected life in years: Represents the estimated period of time until option exercise. The 

expected term of options granted was derived from the output of the Binomial Lattice option 
valuation model and was based on our historical exercise behavior, taking into consideration 
the contractual term of the option and our employees’ expected exercise and post-vesting 
employment termination behavior.

The weighted-average fair value per option at the grant date was $21, $16 and $14 in 2015, 2014 and 2013. As part of the Trunk Club 
acquisition in 2014, the weighted-average fair value per option at the grant date was $59. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, stock option awards to 
employees were approved by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors and their exercise price was set at $81, $61 and $54, 
the closing price of our common stock on February 24, 2015, March 3, 2014 and March 4, 2013 (the dates of grant). In 2015, we began 
granting additional stock options on a quarterly basis, which were insignificant in aggregate. The number of awards granted to an individual 
are determined based upon a percentage of the recipients’ base salaries and the fair value of the stock options. Options vest over four years, 
and expire 10 years after the date of grant. In 2015, we awarded stock options to 2,495 employees, compared with 1,799 and 1,625 
employees in 2014 and 2013.

expense related to nonvested stock options was $57, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 27 months. 
Restricted Stock Units
In 2014 and 2015, we granted our employees restricted stock units that were approved by the Compensation Committee of our Board of 
Directors, and determined based upon a percentage of the recipients’ base salaries and the fair value of the restricted stock units. Restricted 
stock units typically vest over four years.

compensation expense related to nonvested restricted stock units was $56, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average 
period of 29 months.
Performance Share Units
We generally grant performance share units to executive officers as one of the ways to align compensation with shareholder interests. 
Performance share units are earned after a three-year performance cycle only when our total shareholder return (reflecting daily stock price 
appreciation and compounded reinvestment of dividends) outperforms companies in a defined group of competitors determined by the 
Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Performance share units granted in 2013 also require the total shareholder return to be 
positive for any payout. The percentage of units that are earned depends on our relative position at the end of the performance cycle and can 
range from 0% to 175% of the number of units granted.Because performance share units are payable in either cash or stock as elected by 
the employee, they are classified as a liability award. The liability is remeasured, with a corresponding adjustment to earnings, at each fiscal 
quarter-end during the performance cycle. The performance share unit liability is remeasured using the estimated percentage of units earned 
multiplied by the closing market price of our common stock on the current period-end date and is pro-rated based on the amount of time that 
has passed in the vesting period. The price used to determine the amount of cash or stock settled for the performance share units upon 
vesting is the closing market price of our common stock on the last day of the performance cycle.

As of January 30, 2016, our current and non-current other liabilities included a total of $3 for performance share units, and there was no 
remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense for unvested performance share units.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
We issued 0.3 shares under the ESPP during 2015 and 2014. At the end of 2015 we had current liabilities of $7 for future purchases of 
shares under the ESPP compared with $6 at the end of 2014.
Trunk Club Value Creation Plan
As part of the acquisition, we created a Value Creation Plan (“VCP”) to incentivize Trunk Club employees to increase the value of the Trunk 
Club business. The VCP has three payout scenarios that are determined based on the Trunk Club business meeting minimum or exceeding 
maximum 2018 sales and earnings metrics. If the minimum is not met, the payout is $0 (“Outcome A”); if the maximum is met, the payout is 
$100 (“Outcome B”). If the sales and earnings metrics surpass the minimum but do not reach the maximum, the payout is based on the 
incremental value growth of the Trunk Club business since acquisition, and will be between $0 and $100 (“Outcome C”). 

We estimate the grant date fair value for each outcome and recognize expense based upon Outcome C, deemed most probable. If at any 
time it becomes probable that another outcome will be achieved, compensation expense will be cumulatively adjusted based on the grant 
date fair value associated with that outcome. The final payout amount will be determined at the end of 2018 and settled in 2019 at our 
discretion in either cash or stock. We intend to settle the VCP in stock.

As of the year ended January 30, 2016, based on the payout scenario we believe is probable, we estimated the grant date fair value of $10 
per unit using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on an accelerated basis due to the 
performance criteria and graded vesting features of the VCP. In 2015, we recognized $3 in stock-based compensation expense associated 
with the VCP. 

As of January 30, 2016, we granted 0.9 of the 1.0 units available for grant. Total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to 
nonvested VCP units was $4, which we expect to recognize over the next 31 months.

As of January 30, 2016, our state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $12 and $23, 
respectively. As of January 31, 2015, our state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $3 
and $11, respectively. The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to certain statutory limitations of the Internal Revenue Code, 
applicable state laws and applicable foreign laws. If not utilized, a portion of our state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin 
to expire in 2031 and 2033, respectively. Management believes it is more likely than not that certain state and foreign net operating loss 
carryforwards will not be used in the foreseeable future. As such, a valuation allowance of $1 has been recorded on the deferred tax assets

liability for interest and penalties was $2. 

We file income tax returns in the U.S. and a limited number of foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to federal, 
state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2011. Unrecognized tax benefits related to federal, state and local tax 
positions may decrease by $7 by January 28, 2017, due to the completion of examinations and the expiration of various statutes of 
limitations.
NOTE 16:  EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per basic share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Earnings per 
diluted share uses the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year plus dilutive common stock equivalents, 
primarily stock options. Dilutive common stock reflects the issuance of stock for all outstanding options that could be exercised and would 
also reduce the amount of earnings for which each share is entitled. Anti-dilutive shares (including stock options and other shares) are 
excluded from the calculation of diluted shares and earnings per diluted share because their impact could increase earnings per diluted 
share.

The computation of earnings per share is as follows:

Basic shares
Dilutive effect of stock options and other
Diluted shares

NOTE 17:  SEGMENT REPORTING
Segments
We have two reportable segments, which include Retail and Credit. 
Our Retail segment includes our Nordstrom operating segment, which is composed of our Nordstrom U.S. full-line stores and 
Nordstrom.com. Both of these divisions earn revenue by offering customers a wide range of apparel, shoes, cosmetics and accessories for 
women, men, young adults and children. Through our multi-channel initiatives, we have integrated the operations, merchandising and 
technology of our Nordstrom full-line and online stores, consistent with our customers’ expectations of a seamless shopping experience 
regardless of channel. Our internal reporting to our principal executive officer, who is our chief operating decision maker, is consistent with 
these multi-channel initiatives. Our Nordstrom Rack, Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook, Jeffrey, Canadian operations and Trunk Club operating 
segments have similar economic and qualitative characteristics, including nature of products, method of distribution and type of customer or 
the segment results are not significant to the operating results of Nordstrom. Therefore, the results of these operating segments have been 
aggregated with our Nordstrom operating segment into the Retail reportable segment.
Through our Credit segment, our customers can access a variety of payment products and services, including a Nordstrom private label 
card, two Nordstrom Visa credit cards and a debit card for Nordstrom purchases. These credit and debit cards also allow our customers to 
participate in our loyalty program which provides benefits to cardholders based on their level of spending.
Amounts in the Corporate/Other column include unallocated corporate expenses and assets (including unallocated assets in corporate 
headquarters, consisting primarily of cash, land, buildings and equipment and deferred tax assets), sales return reserve, inter-segment 
eliminations and other adjustments to segment results necessary for the presentation of consolidated financial results in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. 

Total Retail Business represents a subtotal of the Retail segment and Corporate/Other, and is consistent with our presentation in Item 7: 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Total Retail Business is not a reportable segment.
Accounting Policy
In general, we use the same measurements to compute earnings before income taxes for reportable segments as we do for the consolidated 
Company. However, redemptions of our Nordstrom Notes are included in net sales for our Retail segment. The sales amount in our 
Corporate/Other column includes an entry to eliminate these transactions from our consolidated net sales. The related Nordstrom Notes 
expenses are included in our Retail segment at face value. Our Corporate/Other column includes an adjustment to reduce the Nordstrom 
Notes expense from face value to their estimated cost. In addition, our sales return reserve and other corporate adjustments are recorded in 
the Corporate/Other column. Other than as described above, the accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those 
described in Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
Reclassification
Reclassifications were made to our segment reporting to better reflect the way we view and measure our business. We reclassified certain 
expenses related to our entry into Canada from our Corporate/Other column to our Retail segment. Historical results were also reclassified to 
reflect the current period presentation.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
On May 4, 2015, the Company filed a Form 8-K announcing the appointment of Blake Nordstrom, Pete Nordstrom and Erik Nordstrom as co-
presidents of Nordstrom, Inc. The three executives retained their current roles and responsibilities following that appointment. In light of those 
individual responsibilities, Blake Nordstrom continues to serve as the Company’s principal executive officer for purposes of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer is the 
Company’s principal financial officer for purposes of the Exchange Act.

As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company performed an evaluation under the supervision and 
with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the design and effectiveness of 
our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
“Exchange Act”)). Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the 
period covered by this Annual Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in the timely and accurate recording, processing, 
summarizing and reporting of material financial and non-financial information within the time periods specified within the Commission’s rules 
and forms. Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were 
effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and 
communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding 
required disclosure.
CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) 
during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal 
control over financial reporting.
MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as is defined in the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the reported financial 
information is presented fairly, that disclosures are adequate and that the judgments inherent in the preparation of financial statements are 
reasonable. There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control, including the possibility of human error and 
overriding of controls. Consequently, an effective internal control system can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance with respect 
to reporting financial information.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria 
established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as 
of January 30, 2016.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, is retained to audit Nordstrom’s Consolidated Financial Statements 
and the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. They have issued an attestation report on the Company’s 
internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2016, which is included herein.

Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries  65

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Nordstrom, Inc.
Seattle, Washington

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 30, 2016, 
based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for 
its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on 
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial 
reporting based on our audit. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those 
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial 
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on 
the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit 
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive 
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and 
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes 
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to 
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of 
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that 
could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may 
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2016, 
based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of 
the Treadway Commission. 

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended January 30, 2016 of the Company and our report dated March 14, 2016 
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
