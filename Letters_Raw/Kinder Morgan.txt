LETTER TO UNITHOLDERS FOR 2013

We had a very successful 2013 at Kinder Morgan 

Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: KMP). KMP declared 
distributions of $5.33 per unit, up 7 percent from 
2012, and exceeded our annual budget of $5.28 per 
unit. Growth was led by dropdowns from Kinder 
Morgan, Inc. associated with its acquisition of El Paso 
Corporation in 2012, contributions from the midstream 
assets KMP acquired in the Copano Energy transaction 
in May of 2013, increased oil production in our CO2 
segment and good results at our Products Pipelines and 
Terminals businesses. KMP also reported distributable 
cash flow before certain items of $2.244 billion ($5.39 
per unit), up 26 percent from 2012. This means we had 
coverage in excess of our distributions of $22 million.

dividends/distributions reinvested in index/stock/unit. 

KMP’s 2013 highlights:   
•  We made $10 billion in capital investments, including 

the Copano acquisition, which gave us access to 
significant natural gas gathering, processing, treating 
and fractionation assets, particularly in the Eagle Ford 
Shale play in south Texas.  

•  We completed and placed in service $2 billion 
in growth projects, including the $500 million 
Northeast Upgrade to move more natural gas 
on our Tennessee Gas Pipeline, the $260 million 
Parkway Pipeline (a joint venture with Valero) 
to move more refined products in Louisiana and 
Mississippi, the $255 million Doe Canyon expansion 
to increase CO2 supplies in southwestern Colorado 
for use in enhanced oil recovery in West Texas, and 
approximately $88 million in upgrades at our IMT 
facility in Louisiana to export additional coal. 

•  We announced a definitive agreement (and closed 
the transaction in January of 2014) to acquire Jones 

Act marine transportation tankers for $962 million 
to move crude oil, condensate and refined products 
around the United States. We believe this is a strategic 
and complementary extension of our existing crude 
oil and refined products transportation business, as 
the United States is producing significantly more 
fossil fuels as a result of numerous shale plays.    

Although our financial and operational results 
were strong in 2013, our performance wasn’t fully 
recognized in the marketplace and KMP’s returns were 
lower than the Alerian MLP Index. While disappointing, 
we have always believed that markets respond 
rationally in the long-term. We are going to continue 
to manage KMP the right way, with the objective of 
creating real long-term value. For 2014, we expect KMP 
to distribute $5.58 per unit, which is 5 percent growth 
over 2013, and we anticipate KMP will distribute 
$2.5 billion to its limited partners. 

While past performance doesn’t guarantee future 
results, KMP and its management team have a superior 
track record with proven execution.

•  Produced compound average total returns of 

23 percent for unitholders since 1996.

•  Increased the distribution 50 times since current 

management took over in February 1997.

•  Met or exceeded our annual budget every year except 

one, in all types of market conditions.

Looking Ahead

Looking ahead, KMP is extremely well positioned 

for future growth, as revolutionary changes in oil 
and gas supply and demand across North America 
are creating the need for additional midstream 
infrastructure to move and store energy products.  
As the largest midstream energy company in North 
America, this fits right into our wheel house. We will 
continue to work closely with our customers to expand 
and extend our existing assets to help them move 
energy from where it’s produced into the marketplace. 
We began 2014 with $13.5 billion in expansion and joint 
venture investments in our five-year project backlog 
that we are confident will come to fruition and drive 
future growth at KMP, and we are pursuing customer 
commitments for many more projects.

At KMP:       
•  We own and operate an unmatched and diversified 
group of assets (about 52,000 miles of pipelines and 
180 terminals) which provide us with tremendous 
opportunities for future growth.

•  We are a market leader in all five of our business 

segments and produce substantial, stable, primarily 
fee-based cash flow.  For 2014, we project $6.4 billion 
in segment earnings before DD&A and certain items.

•  We are a safe and efficient asset operator, and we 
continue to outperform the industry averages in 
almost all environmental, health and safety measures.  
In 2014, we plan to spend approximately $438 million 
in sustaining capital expenditures to maintain our 
assets.

•  We are connected to nearly every prolific shale play 

in the United States and we have key pipeline and 
terminal assets in Alberta and British Columbia 
serving the oilsands.  

•  We operate like a giant toll road and focus primarily 

on stable, fee-based assets.

Double Eagle, a joint venture, includes pipelines and storage facilities

We believe we have the management expertise, the 

size and scope of assets, and the financial wherewithal 
necessary to produce consistent cash flow growth and 
an attractive yield year in and year out. Historically, 
we have delivered consistent growth through precise 
execution, and we are confident that continued growth 
is sustainable for many years to come.  

In closing, we pledge to continue our pursuit 
of financial and operational excellence and to meet 
our customers’ needs.  Our focus will continue to 
be on producing incremental cash and distributing 
that cash to you, our unitholders.  We plan to invest 
approximately $3.6 billion in expansions (including 
contributions to joint ventures) and small acquisitions 
in 2014. 

Thanks for your ongoing support.  We truly believe 

the best is yet to come!

Sincerely, 

Richard D. Kinder 
Chairman and CEO

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

KMP’s Natural Gas Pipelines produced 2013 

segment earnings before DD&A and certain items of 
$2.336 billion, up 70 percent from 2012. Growth in the 
segment was driven by the midstream assets KMP 
acquired from Copano in May of 2013, dropdowns 
from KMI (Tennessee Gas Pipeline and El Paso Natural 
Gas) following the El Paso acquisition in March of 2012, 
and strong results from TGP. TGP benefited from a 
number of completed expansion projects, including the 
$500 million Northeast Upgrade Project.   

Our Copano acquisition significantly increased 

KMP’s midstream footprint. It expanded our reach into 
the Eagle Ford Shale in south Texas, gave us entry into 
other rich gas plays and significantly expanded our 
midstream services in areas such as gas processing. 

We believe natural gas is the future play for 

America because it’s domestic, clean, abundant and 
reasonably priced, and our extensive pipeline network 
sources gas from nearly all of the important resource 
plays across the country. Future growth in our Natural 
Gas Pipelines business segment will be driven by shale 
expansions and extensions, gas demand for power 
generation and exports to Mexico. 

We anticipate approximately 43 percent of KMP’s 
projected cash flow for 2014 will come from our Natural 
Gas Pipelines business segment. Our budget projects 
$2.673 billion in segment earnings before DD&A and 
certain items for this segment in 2014, which would 
be a 14 percent increase over 2013. This growth will be 
driven by a full year of contributions from the Copano 
transaction, TGP expansions, improved midstream 
volumes and EPNG contract extensions. 

TGP’s approximately $500 million Northeast Upgrade Project

TGP is uniquely positioned in the growing 

Marcellus and Utica shale plays to provide region-wide 
access to both the Gulf Coast and Northeast markets. 
We have three TGP expansions expected to be in service 
in 2014, including the approximately $155 million Utica 
Backhaul Transportation project, which will move 
capacity southbound from the Utica Shale to Gulf Coast 
markets. 

In our West Region, the Sierrita Pipeline is 

expected to begin service in 2014. KMP’s share of this 
joint venture, which will move gas from west of Tucson 
to the border of Mexico near Sasabe, is approximately 
$72 million. We also have many other projects in both 
the East Region and the West Region in various stages 
of development.        

Additionally, we are investing approximately 
$650 million in our Midstream assets on natural gas 
liquids (NGL) initiatives, connectivity to Mexico, 
and expansions of gathering, processing and storage 
facilities projects that will be completed in 2014 and 
2015. Our Natural Gas Pipelines segment at KMP 
currently has approximately $1.4 billion of investments 
in our project backlog.

The CO2 business produced 2013 segment earnings 

before DD&A and certain items of $1.432 billion, up 
8 percent from 2012. Growth in this segment was led by 
increased oil and NGL production and higher prices. 
Combined gross oil production volumes averaged over 
57 thousand barrels per day (MBbl/d) for the fourth 
quarter of 2013, up 7 percent from the same period in 
2012. The uptick in oil production volumes was led by 
significantly increased production at our large SACROC 
Unit, and also included 1.3 MBbl/d from the Goldsmith 
Unit that we acquired in June of 2013. Our Snyder Gas 
Plant also produced superb results and set a record for 
NGL production with an average of 19.5 MBbl/d for the 
full year. 

Approximately 24 percent of KMP’s projected 

2014 cash flow is expected to be produced by our 
CO2 segment—17 percent from oil production and 
7 percent from our sales and transport business. Our 

KMP’s planned investments related to Eagle Ford Shale 
crude and condensate opportunities currently total 
approximately $1 billion.

Approximately 15 percent of KMP’s projected 2014 

cash flow is expected to be produced by our Products 
Pipelines segment. Our budget projects $928 million in 
segment earnings before DD&A and certain items for 
Products Pipelines in 2014, which would be 18 percent 
growth over 2013. The growth is expected to be driven 
by building and expanding infrastructure to transport 
and process liquids from the shale plays, repurposing 
portions of existing pipelines for different product uses, 
and ongoing recovery in refined products volumes.
Our Products Pipelines business currently has 

$1.1 billion of investments in the project backlog, 
including the approximately $310 million Cochin 
Reversal project which will move light condensate from 
Kankakee County, Ill., to existing terminal facilities 
near Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta. We continue to make 
progress on the reversal project and the 1 million barrel 
storage capacity Kankakee tank farm, where Cochin 
will interconnect with two other interstate pipelines. 
This project is expected to be in service the second 
quarter of 2014. Construction also continues on our 
approximately $360 million petroleum condensate 
processing facility near the Galena Park terminal on 
the Houston Ship Channel. Supported by a long-term, 
fee-based agreement with BP North America for all 
100,000 barrels per day (bpd) of throughput capacity at 
the facility, the project includes building two separate 
units to split condensate into its various components 
and the construction of storage tanks for the almost 
2 million barrels of product that will be split at the 
facility. The first phase of the splitter is scheduled to 
be commissioned in the third quarter of 2014 and the 
second phase is expected to come online in the second 
quarter of 2015.

The Terminals business produced segment 

earnings before DD&A and certain items of 
$798 million, up 6 percent from 2012. Growth in this 

Acquired tankers provide marine transportation for U.S. domestic trade

CO2  injection is used for enhanced oil recovery projects

budget projects $1.547 billion in segment earnings 
before DD&A and certain items for CO2 in 2014, which 
would be an 8 percent increase over 2013. This growth 
is expected to be driven by strong demand for CO2 and 
increased oil production. Of significant importance, we 
have pushed out the expected oil production decline 
in this segment to 2020 from 2017. As a reminder, we 
use a long-term hedging strategy to mitigate risk and 
generate more stable prices from our oil production.  

To grow our business, we are constructing 

expansion projects and pursuing additional 
opportunities to increase both the production and 
transportation of CO2 for use in enhanced oil recovery 
projects in the Permian Basin of West Texas. In 
southwestern Colorado, our $255 million Doe Canyon 
CO2 source field expansion was completed in 2013 and 
the first of four expansions at our Yellow Jacket Facility 
at McElmo Dome is expected to come online in the 
fourth quarter of 2014. We currently have $1.8 billion 
of investments in our project backlog to grow our sales 
and transport business.

Additionally, we currently have $1.5 billion of 

investments in our project backlog to increase oil 
production through our enhanced oil recovery efforts. 
Long term, there are billions of barrels of domestic oil 
still in place to be recovered at our SACROC, Yates, 
Katz and Goldsmith fields, as well as Residual Oil Zone 
opportunities.   

The Products Pipelines business produced 

segment earnings before DD&A and certain items of 
$784 million, up 12 percent from 2012. The increase 
was due in part to higher NGL volumes on the 
Cochin and Cypress pipelines, an increase in refined 
products volumes, higher transmix volumes and a 
full year of operations on the Kinder Morgan Crude 
and Condensate Pipeline. Incremental earnings for 
this segment came from placing the Parkway Pipeline 
in service in September and contributions from crude 
and condensate assets we obtained in the Copano 
transaction. Including joint ventures and other projects, 

Our Terminals segment currently has $2.3 billion 

of investments in our project backlog. Construction 
continues on the approximately $500 million BOSTCO 
Terminal on the Houston Ship Channel, which began 
service in 2013. When fully completed in the third 
quarter of 2014, this joint venture and fully subscribed 
project will have a total storage capacity of 7.1 million 
barrels for ultra-low sulfur diesel, residual fuels and 
other black oil terminal services. Another project 
expected to be completed in 2014 is our approximately 
$438 million Edmonton Terminal expansion in Alberta. 
When completed, the project will add 4.6 million barrels 
of storage capacity at the terminal, which is supported 
by long-term contracts with major producers and 
refiners.   

Kinder Morgan Canada produced segment 

earnings before DD&A and certain items of 
$200 million, down from $229 million in 2012. Earnings 
were impacted by the sale of the Express-Platte pipeline 
system, which occurred in the second quarter of 2013, 
and unfavorable book taxes. Overall, the sale of Express-
Platte was modestly accretive at KMP.

For 2014, Kinder Morgan Canada’s budget calls 

for $193 million in segment earnings before DD&A 
and certain items, which would be a 4 percent decline 
compared to 2013. This reflects the sale of our one-third 
interest in Express-Platte.  

The largest single investment currently in our 
project backlog is the $5.4 billion Trans Mountain 
expansion, which will increase capacity on the pipeline 
from 300,000 bpd to 890,000 bpd. Thirteen companies 
in the Canadian producing and oil marketing 
business have signed firm contracts for approximately 
708,000 bpd. We have filed a Facilities Application with 
the National Energy Board requesting authorization 
to build and operate the pipeline, which will result in 
a comprehensive public regulatory review. Subject to 
approvals, the expansion is expected to be operational 
by the end of 2017. Trans Mountain moves crude 
from the oilsands in Alberta to British Columbia and 
Washington state on the West Coast. 

BOSTCO will have 7.1 million barrels of storage capacity

segment was almost all organic and driven by higher 
earnings from our liquids facilities along the Houston 
Ship Channel (reflecting new and restructured contracts 
with higher rates and expansion projects coming 
online), an increase in export coal revenue (primarily 
from expansions at our IMT terminal in Louisiana) 
and incremental earnings from our BP Whiting and 
Edmonton Terminal expansions. We also continued to 
handle approximately 30 percent of the ethanol used 
in the United States. Combined, our Terminals and 
Products Pipelines segments handled 100.2 million 
barrels of ethanol for 2013, up 5 percent from 2012.

Approximately 15 percent of KMP’s 2014 projected 
cash flow is expected to be produced by our Terminals 
segment. Our budget anticipates $969 million in 
segment earnings before DD&A and certain items for 
our Terminals business in 2014, which would be a 
21 percent increase over 2013. This growth is expected 
to be driven by building and expanding infrastructure 
that will facilitate liquids exports from the Gulf Coast, 
export coal, crude deliveries by rail and incremental 
crude oil storage capacity. Additionally, our January 
2014 acquisition of Jones Act tankers – which are 
engaged in U.S. domestic trade – will provide marine 
transportation of crude oil, condensate and refined 
products and will contribute to this segment’s earnings 
in 2014.
