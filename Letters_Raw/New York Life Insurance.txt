A MESSAGE FROM TED MATHAS

I’m pleased to report that New 
York Life had another year of 
healthy growth, adding to our long 
track record of strong financial 
performance. Our financial strength, 
in fact, stands at an all-time high.

AND THIS YEAR, WE WILL BE PAYING THE LARGEST 
DIVIDEND IN OUR HISTORY TO ELIGIBLE POLICY 
OWNERS—OUR 164TH CONSECUTIVE YEAR OF 
PAYING A DIVIDEND.

Our performance during 2017 reinforces our 
commitment to our clients. As a mutual company, 
with no shareholders or outside owners, our main 
objective is to serve the needs of all our current 
and future policy owners. We deeply appreciate the 
difference we can make in the lives of individuals 
and families. We act with integrity, we embrace our 
humanity, and we strive to be there whenever they 
need us. During the past year, this was particularly 
evident when our employees and agents answered 
the call for help in communities affected by 
hurricanes and wildfires.

As proud as I am of our response in times of crisis, 
I am equally proud of what I see in our offices every 
day. It is not just what we do for individuals and 
families—it’s why and how we do it that defines 
and differentiates us. Our people come together 
and work in a way that fosters respect, trust, and 
inclusiveness. We act with both confidence and 
humility. Confidence born from our track record 

of delivering on all our promises through the Civil 
War, two world wars, the Great Depression, the 
influenza pandemic of 1918, and numerous other 
natural and man-made catastrophes. Humility, 
because no one can predict the future; we can only 
do our best to prepare for whatever challenges or 
opportunities it may bring.

Our mission is to provide financial security and 
peace of mind. We do so through the expert 
guidance of New York Life agents—men and 
women committed and trained to help people 
achieve their goals. As we continue to make 
investments in our digital capabilities to better 
meet the evolving expectations and needs of 
today’s world, our policy owners’ long-term 
interests remain our number one priority. 

Thank you for your interest in New York Life.

NEW YORK LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY     

For definitions of the company’s performance measures, see Glossary of Terms on page 22.

NEW YORK LIFE PUTS ITS FINANCIAL 
STRENGTH TO WORK ON BEHALF OF 
ITS POLICY OWNERS. 

OUR LONG TRACK 
RECORD REFLECTS 
OUR COMMITMENT 
TO PAYING THE 
STRONGEST DIVIDEND 
POSSIBLE EACH YEAR.

Our priority is always aligned with our policy owners: 
Backing the guarantees of the insurance and annuity 
products they are counting on for a secure financial 
future. But as a company that does not have to 
answer to Wall Street or shareholders, we are also 
able to share our success with them today. For many 
of our clients, this shared success is received in an 
annual dividend—something we’ve been paying 
consistently since 1854.

Dividends can be used in a few different ways. 
Some simply take it as cash to spend on other 

current needs. Others apply the money towards 
their premium payment to reduce out-of-pocket 
expenses. Many, however, use their dividend to 
conveniently purchase more insurance.

Our long track record reflects our commitment to 
paying the strongest dividend possible each year, 
while maintaining unquestioned financial strength. 
And that is something we are uniquely positioned to 
continue to do.

HOW ARE WE ABLE TO 
CONSISTENTLY  
DELIVER A STRONG 
DIVIDEND PAYOUT?

Despite low interest rates over the past several 
years, since 2012 we’ve increased our dividend 
payout by 36 percent. This sets us apart from 
many other life insurers. Why? There are only a 
few options for companies to offset the impact of 
smaller investment returns in a low interest rate 
environment. They can access surplus, which is 
the capital above and beyond the funds already set 
aside to pay benefits. They can seek larger returns by 
taking on more investment risk. Or they can operate 
other businesses to generate additional earnings.

For publicly traded life insurers, exercising these 
options for the benefit of their policy owners is 
challenging because their priority is to share their 
success with shareholders. But even for other 
life insurers that do not answer to shareholders, 
these options can be just as challenging if they do 
not have the cushion of robust surplus or other 
diversified successful businesses.

OUR DIVERSE BUSINESS 
STRATEGY AND SUPERIOR  
FINANCIAL STRENGTH 
ARE PUT TO WORK FOR 
POLICY OWNERS AND 
HELP PAY DIVIDENDS.

New York Life policy owners benefit from our 
diversified business portfolio. These businesses 
generate additional earnings that help keep the 
company growing. Our whole life policy owners also 
enjoy a distinct advantage from a diversified business 
strategy: A portion of those earnings can contribute 

to the dividend payout without the company taking 
on additional investment risk. And we are able to do 
this while continuing to hold the highest ratings for 
financial strength currently awarded to any life insurer 
by the four major rating agencies.* Said another way, 
our focus on policy owners pays dividends.

*  The “highest ratings currently awarded” refers to the highest ratings currently awarded to any life insurer, 
specifically: A.M. Best A++ (as of 7/20/17), Fitch Ratings AAA (as of 6/27/17), Moody’s Aaa (as of 7/27/17), 
and Standard & Poor’s AA+ (as of 7/14/17). Source: third-party reports.

New York Life’s 
community of 
customers.

Life insurance is a product that has withstood the 
test of time. Regardless of the economic cycle or 
whatever else may be going on in the world around 
us, it continues to have a place when planning for a 
secure financial future.

People who own one of our individual life insurance 
products are part of a community of millions  
who collectively own nearly $1 trillion in protection 

for their families and businesses. That’s money  
that can help pay for an education, secure a 
retirement, or protect the assets you’ve worked  
hard to accumulate.

The premiums and fees we collect on life insurance 
and annuity products are prudently invested and 
managed for the long term to ensure we fulfill the 
promises we make to our clients.

Financial 
strength that 
belongs to our 
policy owners.

As a life insurer with no shareholders, our interests 
are aligned with our policy owners.

New York Life does not need to meet the quarterly 
demands of Wall Street. That’s why every dollar of 
value we create is put to work with our policy owners’ 
interests in mind. This includes paying dividends or 
enhancing our financial strength by growing surplus.

Surplus is one of the most important measures of 
an insurer’s financial strength, since it shows the 
company’s ability to help secure your future. This is 
capital above and beyond the funds already set aside 
to pay the benefits we promise. It is a cushion against 
potential future adverse economic events—money 
that further ensures we can continue to meet our 
obligations to our clients whenever they need us.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

OUR PHILOSOPHY: 
TAKE A LONG-TERM 
VIEW AND ALWAYS 
MAINTAIN SAFETY 
WHILE DELIVERING 
SUPERIOR RETURNS.

We invest for the long term because we make 
long-term commitments to our clients, and we are 
not focused on short-term results. Our investment 
objective is to preserve capital and deliver 
predictable investment results while generating 
above market returns.

 
 

In line with our long-term investment philosophy,  
sound principles and strict standards guide the 
management of the company’s investment portfolio. 

We maintain disciplined diversification standards by 
asset classes, sectors, and issuers, while continuing 
to hold ample liquidity in our investment portfolio. 
We make investment decisions based on our own 
research and never simply follow the crowd.

OUR DEEP 
INVESTMENT 
EXPERIENCE IS  
PUT TO WORK  
FOR OUR CLIENTS.

At New York Life, we utilize our investment capabilities 
to create value for our clients. The large size of our 
investment portfolio allows us to access and select 
from all asset classes, which provide a broad universe 
of attractive investment opportunities. Additionally, 
we are able to invest in asset classes that require 
significant expertise and capital, but provide higher 
return potential in the long term.

As of December 31, 2017, New York Life had $242.5 
billion in cash and invested assets. The portfolio is 
predominantly invested in fixed income assets, which 
are primarily investment grade bonds and mortgage 
loans. We also maintain a relatively small allocation to

OUR AGENTS

It’s a matter 
of trust.

WHEN IT COMES TO PLANNING A FINANCIAL FUTURE, PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW 
THAT THOSE THEY ARE WORKING WITH UNDERSTAND THEIR PRIORITIES AND 
GOALS AND HAVE A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF FOLLOWING THROUGH ON 
WHAT THEY SAY THEY WILL DO. IT COMES DOWN TO ONE WORD: TRUST.

And for more than 170 years, millions 
of Americans have placed their 
financial security, peace of mind—and 
trust—with a New York Life agent.

who will continue to be there. He or 
she is there to work with clients in the 
years to come to help them keep on 
track with their evolving needs.

Our agents do more than simply  
sell life insurance and annuity 
products—they offer a service.  
They are professional problem solvers.  
They are there to listen; to learn about 
an individual’s concerns, dreams,  
and goals; and to provide expert 
guidance to help them make the  
best financial decisions.

Working with us is also not a one-shot 
deal. A New York Life agent is a partner 

WHETHER IT’S A BIG CITY OR A SMALL 
TOWN, A NEW YORK LIFE AGENT IS 
MORE THAN JUST A HIGHLY TRAINED 
FINANCIAL PROFESSIONAL.

He or she is likely a local business 
leader, PTA member, coach, 
volunteer—and most certainly, a 
neighbor. Along with bringing financial 
guidance and resources, they have  
a long track record of giving back to 
their communities.

12 NEW YORK LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY     

IN 2017 ALONE, NEW YORK LIFE  
AGENTS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR:

$1.9 MILLION in donations—of which 
$1.2 MILLION was matched by the 
New York Life Foundation—to schools, 
childhood bereavement organizations, 
other nonprofits focused on educational 
enhancement, and disaster relief efforts in 
response to hurricanes and wildfires.

NEW YORK LIFE FOUNDATION

The work of the Foundation  
is a natural extension of 
New York Life’s enduring 
commitment to being there  
for people when we are needed.

SINCE ITS FOUNDING IN 1979, IT HAS GROWN AS A PHILANTHROPIC LEADER, 
INVESTING MORE THAN $258 MILLION IN NATIONAL AND LOCAL NONPROFIT 
ORGANIZATIONS. TODAY, THE NEW YORK LIFE FOUNDATION HAS TWO 
PRIMARY GRANTMAKING FOCUS AREAS: CHILDHOOD BEREAVEMENT AND 
EDUCATIONAL ENHANCEMENT FOR MIDDLE SCHOOLERS.   

ROOM AND BOARD

At the time Hurricane Harvey was 
approaching the coast of Texas, New York 
Life was preparing to hold a conference in 
Austin. The company cancelled the meeting 
and donated the convention space it had 
rented, as well as hundreds of hotel rooms 
and thousands of pounds of food, to the 
volunteer relief workers arriving in the city.

14 NEW YORK LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY     

New York Life’s 
business and 
childhood 
bereavement.

In alignment with the financial support New York 
Life’s products can provide children and their 
families following the death of a loved one, the 
Foundation strives to help bring them a measure of 
emotional support through its work in the childhood 
bereavement field.

As we enter our 10th year of funding in 2018, to 
date we have invested more than $36 million in this 
critical area. This money has been used to fund direct 
services to young people who need help, as well as 
staff training and other operational improvements 
for our nonprofit partners providing these services. 

To better understand and further illuminate the 
challenge of childhood grief in America, for the 
past two years we have also incorporated research 
and data collection into our investments. We 
also recently sponsored a survey to measure the 
effects of grief on children and gauge the public’s 
understanding of this issue. Going forward, the 
insights we’ve obtained from the results will help us 
more effectively communicate and raise awareness 
about childhood bereavement, and guide our 
resources and support to where they can do the 
most good.

A solid foundation 
leads to positive 
transitions—in 
school and in life.

Being prepared, feeling confident, and having a 
network of support are the building blocks for a 
solid foundation that leads to positive transitions 
throughout life. This is particularly true for middle 
school students working their way into high school. 
Moreover, research has shown that, for students, 
more learning time—in the form of high-quality 
afterschool, expanded-day, and summer programs—
leads to greater academic achievement, better school 
attendance, and more engaged students. Since 
2013, the New York Life Foundation has invested 

more than $32 million in organizations that provide 
nearly 500,000 disadvantaged middle school youth 
with afterschool and summer programming, with an 
emphasis on those programs supporting the critical 
transition between eighth and ninth grades.

Our national partnerships provide large-scale 
attention to this important period in the development 
of young people. In 2017, we grew our support to 
local afterschool, summer, and expanded learning 
programs in cities and towns across the country with 
the launch of a new grant program, Aim High.

Rallying 
together.

This year, our country faced an unprecedented 
number of natural disasters—from hurricanes to 
wildfires. We responded by providing immediate 
disaster funding for relief efforts, as well as matching 
donations from our employees and agents. To 
complement our financial support, our people took 
action by volunteering with Save the Children, the 
American Red Cross, Feeding Tampa Bay, the North 
Texas Food Bank, and the CARE animal rescue center 
in San Antonio, among others. Together with our 
employees and agents, we provided $2.2 million 
toward disaster relief efforts.

Following the deadly violence in Las Vegas, our local 
New York Life office partnered with the Foundation 
and our grief partners, the Dougy Center and the 
Solace Tree, to host community events to openly 
discuss ways to support children, colleagues, and 
oneself when confronted by stressful times.

The aftermath of these events is heartbreaking and 
ongoing. We continue to work with our partners 
in these communities to determine how we can 
continue to offer support in the future.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

Management is responsible for 
the preparation and integrity 
of the financial information 
presented in the Annual Report.

THE COMPANY HAS 
COMPLIED WITH THE 
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER 
FINANCIAL REPORTING 
REQUIREMENTS OF THE 
NAIC MODEL AUDIT RULE. 

The requirements are similar to those required 
by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, in that they 
identify management’s responsibilities over its 
financial statements and require management 
to certify as to the integrity of the financial 
statements and the effectiveness of internal 
control over financial reporting. Our statement 
to that effect can be viewed on the company’s 
website, www.newyorklife.com.

Certain financial information contained in this 
Annual Report has been derived from financial 
statements that have been audited by the 
company’s independent auditors, in accordance 
with auditing standards generally accepted in the 
United States of America.

We support strong and effective corporate 
governance from our Board of Directors, 
continuously review our business results 
and strategic choices, and focus on financial 
stewardship. The Audit Committee of the Board 
of Directors of New York Life Insurance Company, 
which is comprised exclusively of directors who 
are not officers or employees of the company, 
meets regularly with management, the internal 
auditors, and the independent auditors to provide 
oversight of management’s fulfillment of its 
responsibilities for accounting controls and 
preparation of financial statements.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS

Policy Owner Benefits and Dividends1– reflect the consolidated results of 
NYLIC and its domestic insurance subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions 
have been eliminated in consolidation. Benefits primarily include death claims 
paid to beneficiaries and annuity payments. Dividends are payments made to 
eligible policy owners from divisible surplus. Divisible surplus is the portion of the 
company’s total surplus that is available, following each year’s operations, for 
distribution in the form of dividends. Dividends are not guaranteed. Each year the 
board of directors votes on the amount and allocation of the divisible surplus.

Individual Life Insurance In Force2 – represents the total face amount of 
individual life insurance contracts (term, whole life and universal life) outstanding 
for NYLIC and its domestic insurance subsidiaries at a given time.

Assets Under Management – consists of cash and invested assets and  
separate account assets of the company’s domestic and international  
insurance operations, and assets the company manages for third-party 
investors, including mutual funds, separately managed accounts, retirement 
plans and assets under administration. 

Operating Earnings3 – is the measure used for management purposes to track 
the company’s results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability 
of the business. This metric is based on accounting principles generally accepted 
in the United States of America (GAAP) with certain adjustments we believe are 
more appropriate as a measurement approach (non-GAAP). Operating earnings 
equal GAAP net income adjusted for, primarily, the removal of gains and losses 
from investments and related adjustments. 

Surplus and Asset Valuation Reserve – Total surplus, which includes the Asset 
Valuation Reserve, is one of the key indicators of the company’s long-term financial 
strength and stability and is presented on a consolidated basis of the company.

Insurance Sales4 – represent annualized first-year premium on participating 
issued whole life insurance, term life insurance, universal life insurance, long-
term care insurance and other health insurance products. A sale is generally 
counted when the initial premium is paid and the policy is issued.  

Annuity Sales – represent premium income on our deferred annuities (both 
fixed and variable) and on our guaranteed income annuities. Sales are generally 
recognized when premiums are received. Annuities are primarily issued by NYLIAC.

Mutual Fund Sales – represent total cash deposited to new and existing 
accounts of the MainStay Funds, New York Life’s proprietary mutual funds. 
MainStay Funds are managed by New York Life Investment Management LLC  
and distributed through NYLIFE Distributors LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of 
New York Life Insurance Company.

1      NYLIC’s policy owner benefits and dividends were $7.38 billion and $7.23 billion 

for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. NYLIAC 
policy owner benefits were $3.26 billion and $2.95 billion for the 12 months 
ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The 36% growth over 2012 
is based on $1.78 billion of dividends declared as payable in 2018 compared to 
$1.31 billion of dividends paid in 2012.  

2      The company’s individual life insurance in force totaled $992.8 billion at 

December 31, 2017 (including $175.7 billion for NYLIAC).

3      The GAAP-basis consolidated financial statements and a detailed 

reconciliation of operating earnings to the Company’s consolidated GAAP net 
income is available on the company’s website (www.newyorklife.com). 

4      Adjustments are made to normalize non recurring premiums to align with 
our annualized recurring premium methodology for insurance sales. Some 
examples are: single premium products sold through our agents and Advanced 
Markets Network (AMN) retail and COLI distribution channel, our network 
of independent agents and brokers, are counted at 10 percent. Sales are 
generated from both domestic and Mexican operations.

Where applicable, prior period numbers have been restated to conform to 
current year definition. In addition, non-U.S. denominated results are generally 
valued using applicable year end exchange rates.

MainStay Funds are managed by New York Life Investment Management, LLC, 
an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of New York Life Insurance Company, and 
distributed through NYLIFE Distributors LLC, 30 Hudson Street, Jersey City, 
NJ 07302, a wholly owned subsidiary of New York Life Insurance Company,
