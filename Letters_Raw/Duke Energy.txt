2017 DUKE ENERGY ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K/A

Lynn J. Good  /  Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

2017: A Year of Achievement
Dear Shareholder:

In a year with record-setting storms, policy shifts and a dynamic regulatory environment, our ability  
to deliver on our promises was tested repeatedly. Time after time, we delivered for our customers  
and shareholders.

Today’s Duke Energy is built to execute in years like these – proving our agility and commitment to our 
strategic vision.

With our portfolio transition complete, we operated in 2017 as a domestic, regulated energy infrastructure 
business with a clear growth plan. We shared our long-term aspirations on how we will invest in our grid, 
in cleaner energy and natural gas infrastructure while improving customer satisfaction and modernizing 
regulatory constructs.

Over the course of the year, we made strong progress and built momentum for the future.

We announced our Power/Forward Carolinas grid modernization initiative and received approvals for 
the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Our nuclear fleet continued to provide carbon-free, 24/7 power and, when 
combined with our renewable and natural gas investments, helped deliver affordable, clean energy to 
customers. And, we worked with stakeholders to create more modern regulatory constructs.

Meanwhile, our plants set performance records while our workforce continued to set the industry standard 
for safety and operational excellence. We also implemented innovative ways to run our company more 
efficiently, helping us deliver strong financial results while continuing to grow our dividend.

Progress like this was driven, as always, by our sense of responsibility to customers. That was especially 
true during Hurricane Irma – a historic storm that left millions without power in Florida and the Carolinas.

2017 was a strong year for Duke Energy. In this letter, you’ll read more about our results. It’s a story of 
resilience, determination and customer focus as our 29,000 employees continue to create a smarter  
energy future.

Meeting Our Financial Commitments 

We entered 2017 with financial strength and 
continued to deliver positive results.

Our adjusted diluted earnings per share were 
$4.57 – near the midpoint of our full-year 
guidance range. This result was supported by 
growth from our investments in our electric and 
natural gas businesses, including the full-year 
earnings contribution from Piedmont Natural Gas.

We reduced operation and maintenance costs in 
response to unfavorable weather early in the year 
and plan to keep these costs flat through 2022. 
Our efforts to instill cost agility and use new 
technology, without impacting operations, remain 
critical to our plans to grow and deliver strong 
financial results.

And 2018 marks the 92nd consecutive year we 
have paid a quarterly dividend – a hallmark pledge 
to our investors – and we remain committed to 
maintaining our annual dividend growth in line 
with earnings growth.

Last year, total shareholder return was 13.0 
percent compared to 12.8 percent for the 
Philadelphia Utility Index. Utility share prices 
came under pressure in late 2017, and that 
continued in early 2018 due to rising interest rates 
and the impact of federal tax reform.

Tax reform provides our company a unique 
opportunity. It will allow us to reduce customer 
bills in the near term while also helping offset 
the cost of future investments. This ensures our 
customers receive the full benefit of the new law, 
which we support.

However, those customer benefits initially put 
pressure on our balance sheet. Therefore, across 
our states, we are working with regulators to 
propose a variety of solutions that balance 
returning savings to customers while preserving 
the financial strength of our utilities, which also 
benefits customers. Additionally, we took steps to 
support our balance sheet and fund our capital 
program given that the positive effects of tax 
reform on our business will take time to manifest.

This February, we announced our 2018 adjusted 
diluted earnings guidance range of $4.55 to $4.85 
per share. Our long-term growth rate remains at 
4 to 6 percent, underpinned by our commitment 
to deliver strong results on our $37 billion growth 
capital plan over the next five years.

Duke Energy remains a premier, long-term 
investment due to our attractive dividend yield and 
low-risk earnings growth. Last year proved that 
we can respond to challenges and deliver on our 
strategy to continue returning value to  
our investors. 

Executing Our Strategy

In 2017, we unveiled our 10-year vision to 
modernize the grid, generate cleaner energy 
and expand our natural gas infrastructure while 
improving customer satisfaction and modernizing 
regulatory constructs through stakeholder 
engagement. And we spent the past year  
executing on it.

Tax reform provides our company a unique opportunity.  
It will allow us to reduce customer bills in the near term 
while also helping offset the cost of future investments.

Modernizing the Energy Grid 
The energy grid powers nearly 
every part of our society. It powers 
lives and livelihoods, and serves 
as the foundation for transforming 
our customers’ experience.

However, in some respects, the 
grid operates nearly the same 
as it did a century ago – as a 
one-way road sending electricity 
from power plants to customers. 
We are now at a turning point. 
With the right investments in 
technology, the grid can deliver 
more flexibility and functionality to 
our customers.

Last year, we announced a $25 
billion investment to make our 
grid smarter, greener and more 
capable. So far, we’ve deployed 
smart meters to more customers, 
installed grid optimization 
technology and used data 
analytics to identify power lines  
to move underground.

Forty percent of our customers 
have smart meters – a key 
technology that enables more 
control for our customers. In 
2017, we installed 1.2 million 

meters and plan to install an 
additional 1.4 million meters in 
2018, focusing deployments  
in the Carolinas and the Midwest.

Last year, we hardened the grid, 
making it more resilient to storms 
and security threats. Already,  
we have made significant strides 
in Indiana and our Duke Energy 
Carolinas service territory. In 
2018, we will begin major 
hardening and resiliency  
activities in Florida, Kentucky  
and our Duke Energy Progress 
service territory.

Our self-healing technology 
investments help improve 
reliability by detecting and 
rerouting power when a problem 
occurs. We have avoided 
more than 1.2 million power 
interruptions and saved customers 
162 million outage minutes.  
As we continue to self-optimize 
our grid, we’ll reduce more 
outages as intelligent systems and 
grid automation work together to 
reconfigure our system.

Forty percent of our 
customers have 
smart meters – a 
key technology that 
enables more control 
for our customers.

\ 3 \ 

2017 DUKE ENERGY ANNUAL REPORT

Our goal is to have 80 percent of customers 
serviced by a self-optimizing grid in the  
next decade.

In 2017, we used analytics to identify power 
lines that experience excessive power outages 
and require significant resources to maintain. 
We plan to move these lines underground to 
improve customers’ experiences and make power 
restoration activities more efficient. The program 
will launch in Ohio, the Carolinas and Florida in 
2018, with plans to deploy in Kentucky in 2019.

We have a call to action to deliver more reliable 
electricity and new services. Our investments in a 
more intelligent, resilient grid underpin our plans 
to meet customers’ evolving needs.

Transforming the Customer Experience
In today’s economy, customer expectations are set 
by innovators who create a personal connection, 
often through seamless digital and mobile 
capabilities. They make it easy to do business, 
giving customers the information they want –  
when and how they want it.

To meet these new expectations, we’re building 
on our grid modernization efforts to transform the 
customer experience.

In 2017, we focused on providing our customers 
more information and options – including usage 
and outage alerts, along with pick your own due 
date features. Many of these options were enabled 
by smart meters.

We’ve also invested in a new customer information 
system – the backbone that allows us to tailor 
services for customers – and we look forward to 
advancing this project in 2018. And we began 
developing a mobile app to give customers 
personalized updates, more control and new ways 
to communicate with us.

the company into the top quartile, and our 2017 
results show we are on the right track.

Customers want an experience that is consistent, 
individualized and responsive, and that’s what we 
are focused on delivering.

Generating Cleaner Energy
We have a long-standing commitment to the 
environment and to lowering our carbon emissions 
– with results that prove it.

In April, we announced a new carbon emissions 
target. By 2030, we plan to reduce our carbon 
emissions by 40 percent from our 2005 levels.

To help us meet this goal, we’re targeting $11 
billion in investments in natural gas generation  
and expanding our renewables portfolio. 

Construction of our combined-cycle, natural gas-
fired generation projects – W.S. Lee, Citrus County 
and Western Carolinas – continues to progress. 
The W.S. Lee project is near final commissioning 
and our Citrus County and Western Carolinas 
projects remain on track to begin commercial 
operation in 2018 and 2019, respectively.

Our natural gas generation complements our 
expanding renewables portfolio. More and  
more, customers are looking at renewable energy 
to meet sustainability goals and provide cost-
effective power.

Duke Energy is one of the nation’s top renewable 
energy investors. We own more than 800 
megawatts of solar power capacity and plan  
to procure more than 3,000 megawatts over  
the next five years. We also own and operate 
2,300 megawatts of wind power and operate 
about 1,700 megawatts of wind facilities for  
third parties, including the first U.S. offshore  
wind project.

Our customer-centric focus resulted in improved 
customer satisfaction. Our J.D. Power residential 
customer satisfaction scores improved compared 
to 2016 in all jurisdictions. Our goal is to move 

In 2017, we connected 500 megawatts of new 
solar energy in North Carolina, helping the state 
remain second in the nation for solar capacity.In 
addition, Duke Energy Kentucky entered the solar

market in 2017 as we announced 
three projects to bring customers 
6.8 megawatts of solar energy.

In August, our commercial 
renewables business acquired 
the Shoreham Solar Commons 
project in New York, one of the 
state’s largest solar projects. We 
announced our partnership with 
the Indiana National Guard to 
install battery storage and solar 
panels at Camp Atterbury. We 
also announced a $30 million 
investment to install the two 
largest battery energy storage 
systems in North Carolina.

Moving forward, we see new 
growth opportunities. In North 
Carolina, new legislation will lead 
to an additional 2,600 megawatts 
of competitively priced solar for 
the state. In Florida, we plan to 
add 700 megawatts of utility-
scale solar as well as up to 50 
megawatts of energy storage.

We are committed to a cleaner 
energy future, and we will 
continue our investments to 
deliver on it.

Building Our Natural Gas 
Infrastructure

October 2017 was the one-year 
anniversary of our Piedmont 
Natural Gas acquisition – one  
of the country’s most trusted 
utility brands. Already, we’ve  
seen the strength of our  
combined company.

We will continue to leverage 
Piedmont’s expertise as 
we expand our natural gas 
infrastructure, doubling this 
segment’s earnings contribution  
to 15 percent in the next decade.

We are using overlap between 
our electric and natural gas 
businesses to better serve 
customers. In the past year, we 
announced dual-fuel projects at 
our Rogers, Belews Creek and 
Marshall Steam stations – a $500 
million investment that will reduce 
our carbon emissions and increase 
our flexibility to manage fuel costs.

Our midstream pipeline business 
is critical to serving customers, 
and we made significant progress 
in 2017.

Duke Energy is one 
of the nation’s top 
renewable energy 
investors. We own 
more than 800 
megawatts of solar 
power capacity and 
plan to procure  
more than 3,000 
megawatts over the 
next five years.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) 
issued the final Environmental Impact Statement 
(EIS) in July for our Atlantic Coast Pipeline project, 
followed by the final project certificate in October. 
In addition, we obtained water and air permits 
from West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina. 
We began construction of this 600-mile pipeline 
in January 2018, staying on track for a late 2019 
in-service date. 

The Sabal Trail pipeline achieved commercial 
operation in July 2017, and it will serve our 
Citrus County combined-cycle natural gas plant in 
Florida when it comes online. A federal appeals 
court ordered FERC to review the project’s EIS 
and in September, FERC issued a supplemental 
EIS, which is now final. In March 2018, FERC 
requested and the federal appeals court approved 
additional time to issue a new FERC order for the 
project. Sabal Trail anticipates normal pipeline 
operations will continue as it monitors any impact 
from this process.

Despite permitting challenges with our Constitution 
pipeline in New York, we remain committed to this 
project and the affordable natural gas it can bring 
to customers in the Northeast.

Natural gas is an important resource for 
the United States and one of the industry’s 
greatest disrupters. Our expanding natural gas 
infrastructure will help us bring this lower-carbon 
fuel to more customers.

Engaging Stakeholders
2017 highlighted the value of stakeholder 
engagement in providing the best possible service 
to our customers and communities.

One of our long-term goals remains to modernize 
regulatory constructs in all of our jurisdictions, 
ensuring our ability to recover investments 
matches how we’re investing in smarter  
energy solutions.

In Florida, the Public Service Commission 
unanimously approved a settlement agreement 
that extends our current multiyear rate plan to 
2021. It includes nearly $6 billion of investments, 
including solar energy, smart meters and grid 
modernization projects. In addition, the agreement 
provides for modern investment recovery while 
minimizing affects to customer bills.

We also worked with the Public Service 
Commission to apply federal tax reform savings 
toward storm costs from Hurricane Irma, helping 
avoid customer rate increases.

In North Carolina, we worked with stakeholders 
and legislators to support legislation, as mentioned 
earlier, that better positions the state for solar 
growth. The outcome was the product of years of 
work, and it sets a model for how we can pursue 
constructive outcomes.

\ 6 \ 

2017 DUKE ENERGY ANNUAL REPORT

We made progress working with our state 
commissions as we pursued traditional rate 
cases to recover investments while keeping rates 
affordable. And we established jurisdictional 
advisory councils to create dialogue that informs 
our business strategies.

To succeed, we need support from stakeholders 
who are willing to work together. In 2018 and 
beyond, we will continue to pursue solutions  
that make sense for customers and investors.

Constant Focus on  
Operational Excellence

Excellent operational performance is the linchpin 
for delivering on our financial, safety and 
environmental goals.

The ability to maintain the reliability of our fleet 
and grid in a safe and sustainable manner, while 
also preparing for emerging threats, directly 
influences relationships with customers and 
regulators, credibility with investors, and our 
reputation with stakeholders.

We continued to demonstrate our commitment 
to safety as a core principle. We improved our 
industry-leading performance from 2016, further 
reducing our total incident case rate and OSHA-
reportable employee safety incidents. As we 
integrated Piedmont Natural Gas, we’ve seen 
strong improvement in their safety performance, 
reducing incidents by 60 percent in the past year.

Safety is critical to maintaining reliable operations. 
Once again, our generation fleet delivered strong 
reliability metrics. Our nuclear fleet’s capacity 
factor was 95.6 percent – nearly breaking 

the company record set in 2016. With this 
performance, 2017 was the 19th consecutive year 
our capacity factor has been above 90 percent.

Our McGuire, Oconee and Brunswick  
nuclear stations achieved records for days of 
consecutive operations – with Oconee setting 
a new company record at 716 days. We also 
delivered strong refueling outage results, 
completing six outages almost 17 days ahead  
of our planned outage duration.

Our fossil/hydro organization continued to 
find flexible solutions while delivering reliable 
operations. In June, we announced an expansion 
at our Lincoln Combustion Turbine Station, 
installing highly efficient natural gas turbines that 
deliver approximately 400 megawatts of peaking 
energy. This project offers significant cost savings  
to our customers and complements our renewable 
resources while lowering carbon emissions.  
In addition, our Edwardsport gasified-coal plant  
set continuous operation records and improved 
gasifier availability.

We delivered this performance while responding 
to record weather. In September, Hurricane Irma 
caused widespread damage across the Southeast. 
Our employees worked tirelessly to rebuild our 
system and restored power to 99 percent of 
affected customers in eight days.

But we also pride ourselves on identifying 
opportunities to improve. We were disappointed 
with aspects of our storm response, including 
communications on estimated times of restoration 
and the performance of certain outage-related 
systems. We have already taken steps to  
address these issues to serve customers better  
in the future.

We improved our industry-leading performance from 2016, 
further reducing our total incident case rate and OSHA-
reportable employee safety incidents.

2017 DUKE ENERGY ANNUAL REPORT

Last year, the Duke Energy Foundation donated more than 
$33 million in charitable gifts to local organizations, and our 
employees and retirees volunteered over 115,000 hours.

To help those affected by hurricanes Irma, Harvey 
and Maria, our company matched employee and 
retiree donations for relief efforts, totaling more 
than $225,000. And in early 2018, more than 
200 employees volunteered to restore power  
to Puerto Rico following the devastation of 
Hurricane Maria.

In 2017, we showed our ongoing commitment 
to environmental stewardship as we reduced 
reportable events for the third straight year. We 
also made progress in closing coal ash basins. 
Our basin excavation projects remained on track 
with over 7 million tons of ash removed last year, 
exceeding our goal. Across the system, scientific 
and engineering work continues to guide closure 
solutions. In addition, we announced a third coal 
ash reprocessing location, which will make ash 
suitable for use in concrete.

Our commitment to a cleaner, more sustainable 
energy future is evident by Duke Energy being 
named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index 
for the 12th consecutive year. This continued 
recognition is underpinned by our unwavering 
focus on safety and operational excellence.

Engaging Employees and Creating  
Stronger Communities 

We’re also doing our part to support the 
communities we serve – and the places our 
29,000 employees call home.

We’re proud to work with communities and 
leaders to attract jobs and economic development, 
continuing to strengthen our states. Last year, 
Duke Energy attracted $5.9 billion in capital 
investment, helping create over 12,000 jobs.  

For the 13th consecutive year, we were named 
to Site Selection magazine’s annual list of Top 10 
Utilities in Economic Development.

But as we focus on creating jobs and attracting 
investments, we’re just as focused on building and 
nurturing a diverse workforce that’s ready to power 
our communities.

Last year, the Duke Energy Foundation donated 
more than $33 million in charitable gifts to 
local organizations, and our employees and 
retirees volunteered over 115,000 hours. Our 
philanthropic investments continue to focus on 
STEM education and workforce development, the 
environment and community impact.

We believe workforce development starts as early 
as possible, and that’s why our investments span 
kindergarten through career.

In Florida, we invested in Lake-Sumter State 
College’s energy technology programs, which  
train workers for in-demand energy industry jobs. 
In North Carolina, we worked with the Urban 
League of Central Carolinas to develop an eight-
week course for students interested in entry-level 
utility positions.

As we develop the next generation of leaders, 
we need to be prepared for what’s next. Our 
employees provide a competitive advantage as we 
transform to meet tomorrow’s challenges. But like 
our business, our workforce must evolve. This will 
require us to attract and retain diverse viewpoints.

Diversity is more than just race and gender. It’s 
a mix of different points of view, work and life 
experiences, perspectives and cultures.

Joel Gonzalez  /  Distribution Line Technician

Last year, I signed the CEO Action Pledge for 
Diversity and Inclusion, the largest CEO-driven 
business commitment to advance diversity and 
inclusion. We’ve launched unconscious bias 
training and created platforms for employees  
to have difficult conversations on issues impacting 
our communities. Duke Energy also received  
a perfect score from the Human Rights  
Campaign for our LGBT-friendly corporate  
practices and policies.

In the year ahead, we want to attract more  
diverse candidates. In particular, we’re committed 
to hiring veterans – who possess the training and 
leadership qualities that transfer to our business. 
Last year, we hired 400 veterans and plan to fill 
12 percent of our open positions with veterans 
moving forward.

The vitality of our communities and workforce is 
at the heart of our mission. Their strength will 
continue to be a priority for Duke Energy, as it has 
been for the past 114 years.

Building A Smarter Energy FutureSM

This year’s annual report is my fifth as CEO. I’m 
proud of how far we’ve come in transforming our 
company and how we have responded to our 
customers’ needs. And others see this progress too 
as Duke Energy was named to Fortune magazine’s 
2018 list of the World’s Most Admired Companies. 

Awards like this are gratifying, but we know our 
work continues. That’s why we’re embracing 
change to continue delivering on our purpose: to 
power the lives of our customers and vitality of  
our communities.

Few companies are more closely aligned with 
making a positive contribution to the economy 
and society. Our company is engaged on so many 
important policy issues – from the environment 
to tax reform, renewable energy, corporate 
philanthropy, diversity and more – and we’re 
pushing forward to find the right solutions.

The success of our company is inextricably linked 
with the communities we serve. It’s this spirit of 
engagement, collaboration and responsibility that 
has defined our success – and will continue to in 
the future.

As I look back on 2017, I remain as confident as 
ever in our vision for a smarter energy future and 
the strategy we’re executing to get there.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

This document includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of 

the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking 
statements are based on management’s beliefs and assumptions and can often be identified by 
terms and phrases that include “anticipate,” “believe,” “intend,” “estimate,” “expect,” “continue,” 
“should,” “could,” “may,” “plan,” “project,” “predict,” “will,” “potential,” “forecast,” “target,” 
“guidance,” “outlook” or other similar terminology. Various factors may cause actual results to be 
materially different than the suggested outcomes within forward-looking statements; accordingly, 
there is no assurance that such results will be realized. These factors include, but are not limited to:

•	State, federal and foreign legislative and regulatory initiatives, including costs of 

compliance with existing and future environmental requirements, including those related 
to climate change, as well as rulings that affect cost and investment recovery or have an 
impact on rate structures or market prices;

•	The extent and timing of costs and liabilities to comply with federal and state laws, 

regulations and legal requirements related to coal ash remediation, including amounts for 
required closure of certain ash impoundments, are uncertain and difficult to estimate;

•	The ability to recover eligible costs, including amounts associated with coal ash impoundment 

retirement obligations and costs related to significant weather events, and to earn an 
adequate return on investment through rate case proceedings and the regulatory process;

•	The costs of decommissioning Crystal River Unit 3 and other nuclear facilities could prove to 
be more extensive than amounts estimated and all costs may not be fully recoverable through 
the regulatory process;

•	Costs and effects of legal and administrative proceedings, settlements, investigations and 

claims;

•	Industrial, commercial and residential growth or decline in service territories or customer 

bases resulting from sustained downturns of the economy and the economic health 
of our service territories or variations in customer usage patterns, including energy 
efficiency efforts and use of alternative energy sources, such as self-generation and 
distributed generation technologies;

•	Federal and state regulations, laws and other efforts designed to promote and expand the use 
of energy efficiency measures and distributed generation technologies, such as private solar 
and battery storage, in Duke Energy service territories could result in customers leaving the 
electric distribution system, excess generation resources as well as stranded costs;

•	Advancements in technology;
•	Additional competition in electric and natural gas markets and continued industry consolidation;
•	The influence of weather and other natural phenomena on operations, including the economic, 

operational and other effects of severe storms, hurricanes, droughts, earthquakes and 
tornadoes, including extreme weather associated with climate change;

•	The ability to successfully operate electric generating facilities and deliver electricity to 

customers including direct or indirect effects to the company resulting from an incident that 
affects the U.S. electric grid or generating resources;

•	The ability to complete necessary or desirable pipeline expansion or infrastructure projects in 

our natural gas business; 

•	Operational interruptions to our natural gas distribution and transmission activities;
•	The availability of adequate interstate pipeline transportation capacity and natural gas supply;
•	The impact on facilities and business from a terrorist attack, cybersecurity threats, data 

security breaches and other catastrophic events, such as fires, explosions, pandemic health 
events or other similar occurrences;

•	The inherent risks associated with the operation of nuclear facilities, including environmental, 

health, safety, regulatory and financial risks, including the financial stability of third-party 
service providers;

•	The timing and extent of changes in commodity prices and interest rates and the ability to 
recover such costs through the regulatory process, where appropriate, and their impact on 
liquidity positions and the value of underlying assets;

•	The results of financing efforts, including the ability to obtain financing on favorable 
terms, which can be affected by various factors, including credit ratings, interest rate 
fluctuations, compliance with debt covenants and conditions and general market and 
economic conditions;

•	Credit ratings of the Duke Energy Registrants may be different from what is expected;
•	Declines in the market prices of equity and fixed-income securities and resultant cash funding 

requirements for defined benefit pension plans, other post-retirement benefit plans and 
nuclear decommissioning trust funds;

•	Construction and development risks associated with the completion of the Duke Energy 
Registrants’ capital investment projects, including risks related to financing, obtaining 
and complying with terms of permits, meeting construction budgets and schedules and 
satisfying operating and environmental performance standards, as well as the ability to 
recover costs from customers in a timely manner, or at all;

•	Changes in rules for regional transmission organizations, including changes in rate designs 

and new and evolving capacity markets, and risks related to obligations created by the 
default of other participants;

•	The ability to control operation and maintenance costs;
•	The level of creditworthiness of counterparties to transactions;
•	Employee workforce factors, including the potential inability to attract and retain key 

•	The ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions to Duke Energy Corporation holding 

•	The performance of projects undertaken by our nonregulated businesses and the 

success of efforts to invest in and develop new opportunities;

•	The effect of accounting pronouncements issued periodically by accounting standard-

•	The impact of new U.S. tax legislation to our financial condition, results of operations or 

cash flows and our credit ratings;

•	The impacts from potential impairments of goodwill or equity method investment 

personnel;

company (the Parent);

setting bodies;

carrying values; 

•	The ability to successfully complete future merger, acquisition or divestiture plans; and
•	The ability to implement our business strategy.

Additional risks and uncertainties are identified and discussed in the Duke Energy 

Registrants’ reports filed with the SEC and available at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. In 
light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events described in the forward-looking 
statements might not occur or might occur to a different extent or at a different time than 
described. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the Duke 
Energy Registrants expressly disclaim an obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-
looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

General

Duke Energy Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, Duke Energy) 
was incorporated on May 3, 2005, and is an energy company headquartered in 
Charlotte, North Carolina, subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (FERC). Duke Energy operates in the United States (U.S.) primarily 
through its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Certain Duke Energy subsidiaries are

Carolinas); Progress Energy, Inc. (Progress Energy); Duke Energy Progress, LLC 
(Duke Energy Progress); Duke Energy Florida, LLC (Duke Energy Florida); Duke 
Energy Ohio, Inc. (Duke Energy Ohio); Duke Energy Indiana, LLC (Duke Energy

In December 2016, Duke Energy completed an exit of the Latin American 
market to focus on its domestic regulated business, which was further bolstered 
by the acquisition of Piedmont. The sale of the International Energy business 
segment, excluding an equity method investment in National Methanol Company 
(NMC), was completed through two transactions including a sale of assets 
in Brazil to China Three Gorges (Luxembourg) Energy S.à.r.l. (CTG) and a sale 
of Duke Energy’s remaining Latin American assets in Peru, Chile, Ecuador, 
Guatemala, El Salvador and Argentina to ISQ Enerlam Aggregator, L.P. and 
Enerlam (UK) Holding Ltd. (I Squared) (collectively, the International Disposal 
Group). See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Acquisitions and 
Dispositions,” for additional information on the sale of International Energy.

Business Segments

Duke Energy’s segment structure includes three reportable operating 

segments (business segments); Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, Gas 
Utilities and Infrastructure and Commercial Renewables. The remainder of 
Duke Energy’s operations is presented as Other. Duke Energy’s chief operating 
decision-maker routinely reviews financial information about each of these 
business segments in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate the 
performance of the business. For additional information on each of these 
business segments, including financial and geographic information, see Note 3 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Business Segments.” The following 
sections describe the business and operations of each of Duke Energy’s 
business segments, as well as Other.

ELECTRIC UTILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE

Electric Utilities and Infrastructure conducts operations primarily 

through the regulated public utilities of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy 
Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Ohio. 
Electric Utilities and Infrastructure provides retail electric service through the 
generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 
7.6 million customers within the Southeast and Midwest regions of the U.S. The 
service territory is approximately 95,000 square miles across six states with a 
total estimated population of 24 million people. The operations include electricity 
sold wholesale to municipalities, electric cooperative utilities and other 
load-serving entities. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure is also a joint owner 
in certain electric transmission projects. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure 
has a 50 percent ownership interest in Duke-American Transmission Co. 
(DATC), a partnership with American Transmission Company, formed to design, 
build and operate transmission infrastructure. DATC owns 72 percent of the 
transmission service rights to Path 15, an 84-mile transmission line in central 
California. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure also has a 50 percent ownership 
interest in Pioneer Transmission, LLC, which builds, owns and operates electric 
transmission facilities in North America.

The electric operations and investments in projects are subject to the 
rules and regulations of the FERC, the North Carolina Utilities Commission 
(NCUC), the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSCSC), the Florida 
Public Service Commission (FPSC), the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission 
(IURC), the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) and the Kentucky Public 
Service Commission (KPSC).

PART IThe number of residential and general service customers within the 
Electric Utilities and Infrastructure service territory is expected to increase 
over time. While economic conditions within the service territory continue to 
improve, sales growth has been hampered by continued adoption of energy 
efficiencies and self-generation. The continued adoption of more efficient 
housing and appliances is expected to have a negative impact on average usage 
per residential customer over time. While residential sales increased in 2017 
compared to 2016, the growth rate was modest when compared to historical 
periods.

Seasonality and the Impact of Weather

Revenues and costs are influenced by seasonal weather patterns. Peak 
sales of electricity occur during the summer and winter months, which results 
in higher revenue and cash flows during these periods. By contrast, lower sales 
of electricity occur during the spring and fall, allowing for scheduled plant 
maintenance. Residential and general service customers are more impacted by 
weather than industrial customers. Estimated weather impacts are based on 
actual current period weather compared to normal weather conditions. Normal 
weather conditions are defined as the long-term average of actual historical 
weather conditions.

The estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the temperature 

variances from a normal condition and customers’ historic usage patterns. 
The methodology used to estimate the impact of weather does not consider all 
variables that may impact customer response to weather conditions such as 
humidity in the summer or wind chill in the winter. The precision of this estimate 
may also be impacted by applying long-term weather trends to shorter-term 
periods.

Heating-degree days measure the variation in weather based on 

the extent the average daily temperature falls below a base temperature. 
Cooling-degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent the 
average daily temperature rises above the base temperature. Each degree of 
temperature below the base temperature counts as one heating-degree day 
and each degree of temperature above the base temperature counts as one 
cooling-degree day.

Competition

Retail

Electric Utilities and Infrastructure’s businesses operate as the sole 

supplier of electricity within their service territories, with the exception of Ohio, 
which has a competitive electricity supply market for generation service. Electric 
Utilities and Infrastructure owns and operates facilities necessary to transmit 
and distribute electricity and, except in Ohio, to generate electricity. Services 
are priced by state commission approved rates designed to include the costs 
of providing these services and a reasonable return on invested capital. This 
regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable electricity at fair prices.

Competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily 

from the development and deployment of alternative energy sources including 
on-site generation from industrial customers and distributed generation, such 
as private solar, at residential, general service and/or industrial customer sites.

Duke Energy is not aware of any proposed legislation within any of its 

jurisdictions that would provide retail customers the right to choose their 
electricity provider or otherwise restructure or deregulate the electric industry, 
including broadly subsidizing distributed generation such as private solar.

Although there is no pending legislation at this time, if the retail 

jurisdictions served by Electric Utilities and Infrastructure become subject 
to deregulation, the recovery of stranded costs could become a significant 
consideration. Stranded costs primarily include the generation assets of Electric 
Utilities and Infrastructure whose value in a competitive marketplace may be 
less than their current book value, as well as above-market purchased power 
commitments from qualifying facilities (QFs). The Public Utility Regulatory 
Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) established a new class of generating facilities 

as QFs, typically small power production facilities that generate power within 
a utility company’s service territory for which the utility companies are legally 
obligated to purchase the energy at an avoided cost rate. Thus far, all states 
that have passed restructuring legislation have provided for the opportunity to 
recover a substantial portion of stranded costs.

Electric Utilities and Infrastructure’s largest stranded cost exposure is 

primarily related to Duke Energy Florida’s purchased power commitments with 
QFs, under which it has future minimum expected capacity payments through 
2043 of $2.4 billion. Duke Energy Florida was obligated to enter into these 
contracts under provisions of PURPA. Duke Energy Florida continues to seek 
ways to address the impact of escalating payments under these contracts. 
However, the FPSC allows full recovery of the retail portion of the cost of power 
purchased from QFs. For additional information related to these purchased 
power commitments, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
“Commitments and Contingencies.” 

In Ohio, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure conducts competitive auctions 

for electricity supply. The cost of energy purchased through these auctions is 
recovered from retail customers. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure earns retail 
margin in Ohio on the transmission and distribution of electricity and not on the 
cost of the underlying energy.

Wholesale

Duke Energy competes with other utilities and merchant generators for 

bulk power sales, sales to municipalities and cooperatives and wholesale 
transactions under primarily cost-based contracts approved by FERC. The 
principal factors in competing for these sales are price, availability of capacity 
and power and reliability of service. Prices are influenced primarily by market 
conditions and fuel costs.

Increased competition in the wholesale electric utility industry and 
the availability of transmission access could affect Electric Utilities and 
Infrastructure’s load forecasts, plans for power supply and wholesale energy 
sales and related revenues. Wholesale energy sales will be impacted by the 
extent to which additional generation is available to sell to the wholesale market 
and the ability of Electric Utilities and Infrastructure to attract new customers 
and to retain existing customers.

Energy Capacity and Resources

Electric Utilities and Infrastructure owns approximately 49,506 megawatts 

(MW) of generation capacity. For additional information on owned generation 
facilities, see Item 2, “Properties.”

Energy and capacity are also supplied through contracts with other 
generators and purchased on the open market. Factors that could cause 
Electric Utilities and Infrastructure to purchase power for its customers may 
include, but are not limited to, generating plant outages, extreme weather 
conditions, generation reliability, demand growth and price. Electric Utilities 
and Infrastructure has interconnections and arrangements with its neighboring 
utilities to facilitate planning, emergency assistance, sale and purchase of 
capacity and energy and reliability of power supply.

Electric Utilities and Infrastructure’s generation portfolio is a balanced mix 

of energy resources having different operating characteristics and fuel sources 
designed to provide energy at the lowest possible cost to meet its obligation to 
serve retail customers. All options, including owned generation resources and 
purchased power opportunities, are continually evaluated on a real-time basis 
to select and dispatch the lowest-cost resources available to meet system load 
requirements.

Potential Plant Retirements

The Subsidiary Registrants periodically file Integrated Resource Plans 

(IRP) with state regulatory commissions. The IRPs provide a view of forecasted 
energy needs over a long term (10 to 20 years) and options being considered 
to meet those needs. Recent IRPs filed by the Subsidiary Registrants included 

7

PART Iplanning assumptions to potentially retire certain coal-fired generating facilities 
earlier than their current estimated useful lives, primarily because these 
facilities do not have the requisite emission control equipment to meet United 
States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations recently approved or 
proposed. Duke Energy continues to evaluate the potential need to retire these 
coal-fired generating facilities earlier than the current estimated useful lives 
and plans to seek regulatory recovery for amounts that would not be otherwise 
recovered when any of these assets are retired. For additional information 
related to potential plant retirements, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, “Regulatory Matters.”

On October 23, 2015, the EPA published in the Federal Register the final 
Clean Power Plan (CPP) rule that regulates carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from 
existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units (EGUs). The CPP establishes 
CO2 emission rates and mass cap goals that apply to existing fossil fuel-fired  
EGUs. Petitions challenging the rule were filed by several groups and on 
February 9, 2016, the Supreme Court issued a stay of the final CPP rule, halting 
implementation of the CPP until legal challenges are resolved. States in which 
the Duke Energy Registrants operate have suspended work on the CPP in 
response to the stay. Oral arguments before 10 of the 11 judges on D.C. Circuit 
Court were heard on September 27, 2016. The court has not issued its opinion 
in the case.

On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing 

EPA to review the CPP and determine whether to suspend, revise or rescind 
the rule. On the same day, the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a motion with 
the D.C. Circuit Court requesting that the court stay the litigation of the rule 

while it is reviewed by EPA. On April 28, 2017, the court issued an order to 
suspend the litigation for 60 days. On August 8, 2017, the court, on its own 
motion, extended the suspension of the litigation for an additional 60 days. On 
October 16, 2017, EPA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) to repeal 
the CPP based on a change to EPA’s legal interpretation of the section of the 
Clean Air Act (CAA) on which the CPP was based. In the proposal, EPA indicates 
that it has not determined whether it will issue a rule to replace the CPP, and 
if it will do so, when and what form that rule will take. The comment period on 
EPA’s NPR ends April 26, 2018. On December 28, 2017 EPA issued an Advance 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) in which it seeks public comment on 
various aspects of a potential CPP replacement rule. The comment period on 
the ANPRM ends February 26, 2018. If EPA decides to move forward with a CPP 
replacement rule, it will need to issue a formal proposal for public comment. 
Litigation of the CPP remains on hold in the D.C. Circuit and the February 2016 
U.S. Supreme Court stay of the CPP remains in effect.

Should the CPP be upheld, compliance could cause the industry to 

replace coal-fired generation with natural gas and renewables. Costs to operate 
coal-fired generation plants continue to grow due to increasing environmental 
compliance requirements, including ash management costs unrelated to 
CPP, which may result in the retirement of coal-fired generation plants earlier 
than the current end of useful lives. The Duke Energy Registrants could incur 
increased fuel, purchased power, operation and maintenance and other costs for 
replacement generation as a result of this rule. Due to the uncertainties related 
to the implementation of the CPP, the Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the 
outcome of these matters.

Sources of Electricity

Coal

Electric Utilities and Infrastructure meets its coal demand through 
a portfolio of long-term purchase contracts and short-term spot market 
purchase agreements. Large amounts of coal are purchased under long-term 
contracts with mining operators who mine both underground and at the 
surface. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure uses spot market purchases to 
meet coal requirements not met by long-term contracts. Expiration dates 
for its long-term contracts, which have various price adjustment provisions 
and market re-openers, range from 2018 to 2020 for Duke Energy Carolinas, 
2018 to 2020 for Duke Energy Progress, 2018 to 2020 for Duke Energy Florida, 
2018 to 2020 for Duke Energy Ohio and 2018 to 2025 for Duke Energy Indiana. 
Electric Utilities and Infrastructure expects to renew these contracts or enter 
into similar contracts with other suppliers as existing contracts expire, though 
prices will fluctuate over time as coal markets change. Electric Utilities and 
Infrastructure has an adequate supply of coal under contract to meet its hedging 
guidelines regarding projected future consumption. As a result of volatility in 
natural gas prices and the associated impacts on coal-fired dispatch within the 

8

generation fleet, coal inventories will continue to fluctuate. Electric Utilities and 
Infrastructure continues to actively manage its portfolio and has worked with 
suppliers to obtain increased flexibility in its coal contracts. 

Coal purchased for the Carolinas is primarily produced from mines in 

Central Appalachia, Northern Appalachia and the Illinois Basin. Coal purchased 
for Florida is primarily produced from mines in Colorado and the Illinois Basin. 
Coal purchased for Kentucky is delivered by barge and is produced from mines 
along the Ohio River in Illinois, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Coal 
purchased for Indiana is primarily produced in Indiana and Illinois. The current 
average sulfur content of coal purchased by Electric Utilities and Infrastructure 
is between 1.5 percent and 2 percent for Duke Energy Carolinas, between 
1.5 percent and 2 percent for Duke Energy Progress, between 1 percent and 
3 percent for Duke Energy Florida, between 3 percent and 3.5 percent for Duke 
Energy Ohio and between 2.5 percent and 3 percent for Duke Energy Indiana. 
Electric Utilities and Infrastructure’s environmental controls, in combination 
with the use of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission allowances, enable Electric Utilities 
and Infrastructure to satisfy current SO2 emission limitations for its existing 
facilities.

PART INuclear

The industrial processes for producing nuclear generating fuel generally 
involve the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates 
and services to convert, enrich and fabricate fuel assemblies.

Electric Utilities and Infrastructure has contracted for uranium materials 

and services to fuel its nuclear reactors. Uranium concentrates, conversion 
services and enrichment services are primarily met through a diversified 
portfolio of long-term supply contracts. The contracts are diversified by supplier, 
country of origin and pricing. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure staggers its 
contracting so that its portfolio of long-term contracts covers the majority 
of its fuel requirements in the near term and decreasing portions of its fuel 
requirements over time thereafter. Near-term requirements not met by long-term 
supply contracts have been and are expected to be fulfilled with spot market 
purchases. Due to the technical complexities of changing suppliers of fuel 
fabrication services, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure generally sources these 
services to a single domestic supplier on a plant-by-plant basis using multiyear 
contracts.

Electric Utilities and Infrastructure has entered into fuel contracts that 

cover 100 percent of its uranium concentrates, conversion services and 
enrichment services requirements through at least 2018 and cover fabrication 
services requirements for these plants through at least 2027. For future 
requirements not already covered under long-term contracts, Electric Utilities 
and Infrastructure believes it will be able to renew contracts as they expire or 
enter into similar contractual arrangements with other suppliers of nuclear fuel 
materials and services.

Natural Gas and Fuel Oil

Natural gas and fuel oil supply, transportation and storage for Electric 

Utilities and Infrastructure’s generation fleet is purchased under standard 

The following table summarizes purchased power for the previous three years:

industry agreements from various suppliers, including Piedmont. Natural gas 
supply agreements typically provide for a percentage of forecasted burns 
being procured over time, with varied expiration dates. Electric Utilities and 
Infrastructure believes it has access to an adequate supply of natural gas and 
fuel oil for the reasonably foreseeable future.

Electric Utilities and Infrastructure has certain dual-fuel generating 
facilities that can operate utilizing both natural gas and fuel oil. The cost of 
Electric Utilities and Infrastructure’s natural gas and fuel oil is fixed price 
or determined by published market prices as reported in certain industry 
publications, plus any transportation and freight costs. Duke Energy 
Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy 
Indiana use derivative instruments to manage a portion of their exposure to 
price fluctuations for natural gas. For Duke Energy Florida, there is currently 
an agreed to moratorium on future hedging with the Florida Public Service 
Commission.

Electric Utilities and Infrastructure has firm interstate and intrastate 

natural gas transportation agreements and storage agreements in place 
to support generation needed for load requirements. Electric Utilities and 
Infrastructure may purchase additional shorter-term natural gas transportation 
and utilize natural gas interruptible transportation agreements to support 
generation needed for load requirements. The Electric Utilities and Infrastructure 
natural gas plants are served by various supply zones and multiple pipelines.

Purchased Power

Electric Utilities and Infrastructure purchases a portion of its capacity 
and system requirements through purchase obligations, leases and purchase 
capacity contracts. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure believes it can obtain 
adequate purchased power capacity to meet future system load needs. However, 
during periods of high demand, the price and availability of purchased power 
may be significantly affected.

Purchase obligations and leases (in millions of megawatt-hours (MWh))(a)

Purchase capacity under contract (in MW)(b)

(a)  Represents approximately 7 percent of total system requirements for 2017 and 2016 and 6 percent for 2015.

Inventory

Generation of electricity is capital intensive. Electric Utilities and 

Infrastructure must maintain an adequate stock of fuel and materials and 
supplies in order to ensure continuous operation of generating facilities and 
reliable delivery to customers. As of December 31, 2017, the inventory balance 
for Electric Utilities and Infrastructure was approximately $3.1 billion. For 
additional information on inventory, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”

Ash Basin Management

The North Carolina Coal Ash Management Act of 2014 (Coal Ash Act) 

regulates the handling of coal ash within the state and requires closure 
of ash impoundments by no later than December 31, 2029, based on risk 
rankings, among other detailed requirements. The Coal Ash Act leaves the 
decision on cost recovery determinations related to closure of coal ash surface 
impoundments (ash basins or impoundments) to the normal ratemaking 
processes before utility regulatory commissions. Duke Energy has and will 
periodically submit to applicable authorities required site-specific coal ash 
impoundment remediation or closure plans. These plans and all associated 
permits must be approved before any work can begin.

On April 17, 2015, the EPA published in the Federal Register a rule to 

regulate the disposal of coal combustion residuals (CCR) from electric utilities 

9

as solid waste. The rule classifies CCR as nonhazardous under Subtitle D of the 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The EPA CCR rule has certain 
requirements, which if not met could initiate impoundment closure and require 
closure completion within five years. The EPA CCR rule includes extension 
requirements, which if met could allow the extension of closure completion by 
up to 10 years. The RCRA and the Coal Ash Act finalized the legal framework 
related to coal ash management practices and ash basin closure.

Duke Energy has advanced the strategy and implementation for the 

remediation or closure of coal ash basins. In 2015, Duke Energy began activities 
at certain North Carolina sites specified as high priority by the Coal Ash Act, 
including moving coal ash off-site for use in structural fill or to lined landfills. 
Additional modifications to operating coal plants are underway to comply with 
the Coal Ash Act and RCRA.

Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have included 

compliance costs associated with the EPA CCR rule and the Coal Ash Act in 
their respective rate case filings. During 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas’ and Duke 
Energy Progress’ wholesale contracts were amended to include the recovery of 
expenditures related to asset retirement obligations for the closure of coal ash 
basins. The amended contracts have retail disallowance parity or provisions 
limiting challenges to CCR cost recovery actions at FERC. FERC approved the 
amended wholesale rate schedules in 2017. For additional information on the 
ash basins and recovery, see Notes 4, 5 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, “Regulatory Matters,” “Commitments and Contingencies” and 
“Asset Retirement Obligations,” respectively. 

PART INuclear Matters

Duke Energy owns, wholly or partially, 11 operating nuclear reactors 
located at six stations. The Crystal River Unit 3 Nuclear Plant (Crystal River 
Unit 3) permanently ceased operation in February 2013. Nuclear insurance 
includes: nuclear liability coverage; property damage coverage; nuclear accident 
decontamination and premature decommissioning coverage; and accidental 
outage coverage for losses in the event of a major accidental outage. Joint 
owners reimburse Duke Energy for certain expenses associated with nuclear 
insurance in accordance with joint owner agreements. The Price-Anderson Act 

requires plant owners to provide for public nuclear liability claims resulting 
from nuclear incidents to the maximum total financial protection liability, which 
is approximately $13.4 billion. For additional information on nuclear insurance 
see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Commitments and 
Contingencies.”

Duke Energy has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of 
spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate each plant safely. The 
NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC require Duke Energy to update their cost estimates for 
decommissioning their nuclear plants every five years.

The following table summarizes the fair value of nuclear decommissioning trust fund (NDTF) balances and cost study results for Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke 

Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida. Decommissioning costs in the table below are stated in 2013 or 2014 dollars, depending the year of the cost study, and 
include costs to decommission plant components not subject to radioactive contamination.

The NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC and FERC have allowed Electric Utilities and 
Infrastructure to recover estimated decommissioning costs through retail and 
wholesale rates over the expected remaining service periods of their nuclear 
stations. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure believes the decommissioning costs 
being recovered through rates, when coupled with the existing fund balances 
and expected fund earnings, will be sufficient to provide for the cost of future 
decommissioning. For additional information, see Note 9 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, “Asset Retirement Obligations.”

The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (as amended) (NWPA) provides the 

framework for development by the federal government of interim storage and 
permanent disposal facilities for high-level radioactive waste materials. The 
government has not yet developed a storage facility or disposal capacity, so 
Electric Utilities and Infrastructure will continue to store spent fuel on its reactor 
sites.

Under federal law, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for 
the selection and construction of a facility for the permanent disposal of spent 
nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. The DOE terminated the project to 
license and develop a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada in 2010, and 
is currently taking no action to fulfill its responsibilities to dispose of spent fuel.

Until the DOE begins to accept the spent nuclear fuel, Duke Energy 
Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida will continue to 
safely manage their spent nuclear fuel. Under current regulatory guidelines, 
Shearon Harris Nuclear Plant (Harris) has sufficient storage capacity in its 
spent fuel pools through the expiration of its renewed operating license. Crystal 
River Unit 3 ceased operation in 2013 and was placed in a SAFSTOR condition 
in January 2018. As of January 2018, all spent fuel at Crystal River Unit 3 
has been transferred from the spent fuel pool to dry storage at an on-site 
independent spent fuel storage installation where it will be stored until the 
DOE removes it. With certain modifications and approvals by the U.S. Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission (NRC) to expand the on-site dry cask storage facilities, 
spent nuclear fuel dry storage facilities will be sufficient to provide storage 
space of spent fuel through the expiration of the operating licenses, including 
any license renewals, for the Brunswick Nuclear Plant (Brunswick), Catawba 
Nuclear Station (Catawba), McGuire Nuclear Station (McGuire), Oconee Nuclear 
Station (Oconee) and Robinson Nuclear Plant (Robinson).

The nuclear power industry faces uncertainties with respect to the cost 

and long-term availability of disposal sites for spent nuclear fuel and other 

radioactive waste, compliance with changing regulatory requirements, capital 
outlays for modifications and new plant construction.

Electric Utilities and Infrastructure is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC

The NRC has acknowledged permanent cessation of operation and 
permanent removal of fuel from the reactor vessel at Crystal River Unit 3. 
Therefore, the license no longer authorizes operation of the reactor. For 
additional information on decommissioning activity, see Note 4 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters.”

On October 27, 2016, and December 15, 2016, the NRC issued combined 

operating licenses for Duke Energy Florida’s proposed Levy Nuclear Plant 
Units 1 and 2 (Levy) and Duke Energy Carolinas’ William States Lee III Nuclear 
Station Units 1 and 2, respectively. On August 25, 2017, as part of Duke Energy 
Carolinas rate case filing, Duke Energy Carolinas requested NCUC approval to 
cancel the development of the Lee Nuclear Station project with the intent to 
maintain the combined operating licenses. On August 29, 2017, Duke Energy 
announced the complete abandonment of the Levy project with the intent to 
terminate the combined operating licenses. For additional information on these

PART IRegulation

State

The NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC, PUCO, IURC and KPSC (collectively, the state 

electric utility commissions) approve rates for Duke Energy’s retail electric 
service within their respective states. The state electric utility commissions, 
to varying degrees, have authority over the construction and operation of 
Electric Utilities and Infrastructure’s generating facilities. Certificates of Public 
Convenience and Necessity issued by the state electric utility commissions, 
as applicable, authorize Electric Utilities and Infrastructure to construct and 
operate its electric facilities and to sell electricity to retail and wholesale 
customers. Prior approval from the relevant state electric utility commission 
is required for the entities within Electric Utilities and Infrastructure to issue 
securities. The underlying concept of utility ratemaking is to set rates at a level 
that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of providing service 
plus earn a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital, including equity.

In addition to rates approved in base rate cases, each of the state 

electric utility commissions allow recovery of certain costs through various 
cost-recovery clauses to the extent the respective commission determines in 
periodic hearings that such costs, including any past over or under-recovered 
costs, are prudent.

Fuel, fuel-related costs and certain purchased power costs are eligible 

for recovery by Electric Utilities and Infrastructure. Electric Utilities and 
Infrastructure uses coal, hydroelectric, natural gas, oil, renewable generation 
and nuclear fuel to generate electricity, thereby maintaining a diverse fuel mix 
that helps mitigate the impact of cost increases in any one fuel. Due to the 
associated regulatory treatment and the method allowed for recovery, changes 
in fuel costs from year to year have no material impact on operating results of 
Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, unless a commission finds a portion of such 
costs to have been imprudent. However, delays between the expenditure for fuel 
costs and recovery from customers can adversely impact the timing of cash 
flows of Electric Utilities and Infrastructure.

The table below reflects significant electric rate case applications approved and effective in the past three years or applications currently pending approval.

Federal

The FERC approves Electric Utilities and Infrastructure’s cost-based 

rates for electric sales to certain power and transmission wholesale customers. 
Regulations of FERC and the state electric utility commissions govern access to 
regulated electric and other data by nonregulated entities and services provided 
between regulated and nonregulated energy affiliates. These regulations affect 
the activities of nonregulated affiliates with Electric Utilities and Infrastructure.

Regional Transmission Organizations (RTO). PJM Interconnection, 
LLC (PJM) and Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO) are 
the Independent System Operators (ISO) and FERC-approved RTOs for the 
regions in which Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana operate. PJM and 
MISO operate energy, capacity and other markets, and control the day-to-day 
operations of bulk power systems through central dispatch.

Duke Energy Ohio is a member of PJM and Duke Energy Indiana is a 

member of MISO. Transmission owners in these RTOs have turned over control 
of their transmission facilities and their transmission systems are currently 
under the dispatch control of the RTOs. Transmission service is provided on 
a regionwide, open-access basis using the transmission facilities of the RTO 
members at rates based on the costs of transmission service.

Environmental. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure is subject to the 

jurisdiction of the EPA and state and local environmental agencies. For a 
discussion of environmental regulation, see “Environmental Matters” in this 

section. See “Other Matters” section of MD&A for a discussion about potential 
Global Climate Change legislation and other EPA regulations under development 
and the potential impacts such legislation and regulation could have on Duke 
Energy’s operations.

GAS UTILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE

Gas Utilities and Infrastructure conducts natural gas operations primarily 

through the regulated public utilities of Piedmont and Duke Energy Ohio. The 
natural gas operations are subject to the rules and regulations of the NCUC, 
PSCSC, PUCO, KPSC, Tennessee Public Utility Commission (TPUC), Pipeline 
and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) and the FERC. Gas 
Utilities and Infrastructure serves residential, commercial, industrial and power 
generation natural gas customers. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure has over 
1.5 million customers, including more than 1 million customers located in North 
Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, and an additional 526,000 customers 
located within southwestern Ohio and northern Kentucky. In the Carolinas, 
Ohio and Kentucky, the service areas are comprised of numerous cities, towns 
and communities. In Tennessee, the service area is the metropolitan area of 
Nashville. 

The number of residential, commercial and industrial customers within 

the Gas Utilities and Infrastructure service territory is expected to increase 
over time. Average usage per residential customer is expected to remain flat or 
decline for the foreseeable future, however decoupled rates in North Carolina 
and various rate design mechanisms in other jurisdictions partially mitigate the 
impact of the declining usage per customer on overall profitability. While total 

11

PART Iindustrial and general service sales increased in 2017 when compared to 2016, 
the growth rate was modest when compared to historical periods.

Gas Utilities and Infrastructure also owns, operates and has investments 

in various pipeline transmission and natural gas storage facilities.

Natural Gas for Retail Distribution

Gas Utilities and Infrastructure is responsible for the distribution of 

natural gas to retail customers in its North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, 
Ohio and Kentucky service territories. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure’s natural 
gas procurement strategy is to contract primarily with major and independent 
producers and marketers for natural gas supply. It also purchases a diverse 
portfolio of transportation and storage service from interstate pipelines. This 
strategy allows Gas Utilities and Infrastructure to assure reliable natural gas 
supply and transportation for its firm customers during peak winter conditions. 
When firm pipeline services or contracted natural gas supplies are temporarily 
not needed due to market demand fluctuations, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure 
may release these services and supplies in the secondary market under 
FERC-approved capacity release provisions or make wholesale secondary 
market sales. In 2017, firm supply purchase commitment agreements provided 
100 percent of the natural gas supply for Piedmont and 100 percent for Duke 
Energy Ohio.

Seasonality and the Impact of Weather

Gas Utilities and Infrastructure’s costs and revenues are influenced by 
seasonal patterns due to peak natural gas sales occurring during the winter 
months. Residential customers are the most impacted by weather. There are 
certain regulatory mechanisms for the North Carolina, South Carolina and 
Tennessee service territories that normalize the margins collected from certain 
customer classes during the winter, providing for an adjustment either up or 
down. In North Carolina, rate design provides protection from both weather and 
other usage variations such as conservation. In South Carolina and Tennessee, 
revenues are adjusted solely based on weather during the periods of November 
through March and October through April, respectively. Rate design for the 
Ohio service territory also mitigates the impacts of weather on customer 
bills. Estimated weather impacts are based on actual current period weather 
compared to normal weather conditions. Normal weather conditions are defined 
as the long-term average of actual historical weather conditions.

Degree-day data are used to estimate energy required to maintain 

comfortable indoor temperatures based on each day’s average temperature. 
Heating-degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent the 
average daily temperature falls below a base temperature. The methodology 
used to estimate the applicable impact of weather does not consider all 
variables that may impact customer response to weather conditions, such as 
wind chill. The precision of this estimate may also be impacted by applying 
long-term weather trends to shorter-term periods.

Competition

Gas Utilities and Infrastructure’s businesses operate as the sole supplier 
of natural gas within their retail service territories, with the exception of Ohio, 
which has a competitive natural gas supply market for distribution service. Gas 
Utilities and Infrastructure owns and operates facilities necessary to transport 
and distribute natural gas. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure earns retail margin 
on the transmission and distribution of natural gas and not on the cost of the 
underlying commodity. Services are priced by state commission approved rates 
designed to include the costs of providing these services and a reasonable 
return on invested capital. This regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and 
reliable natural gas service at fair prices.

In residential, commercial and industrial customer markets, natural 

gas distribution operations compete with other companies that supply energy, 
primarily electric companies, propane and fuel oil dealers, renewable energy 
providers and coal companies in relation to sources of energy for electric 
power plants, as well as nuclear energy. A significant competitive factor is 

12

price. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure’s primary product competition is with 
electricity for heating, water heating and cooking. Increases in the price of 
natural gas or decreases in the price of other energy sources could negatively 
impact competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas 
to the consumer. In the case of industrial customers, such as manufacturing 
plants, adverse economic or market conditions, including higher natural gas 
costs, could cause these customers to suspend business operations or to use 
alternative sources of energy in favor of energy sources with lower per-unit 
costs.

Higher natural gas costs or decreases in the price of other energy sources 

may allow competition from alternative energy sources for applications that 
have traditionally used natural gas, encouraging some customers to move 
away from natural gas-fired equipment to equipment fueled by other energy 
sources. Competition between natural gas and other forms of energy is also 
based on efficiency, performance, reliability, safety and other non-price factors. 
Technological improvements in other energy sources and events that impair 
the public perception of the non-price attributes of natural gas could erode 
our competitive advantage. These factors in turn could decrease the demand 
for natural gas, impair our ability to attract new customers and cause existing 
customers to switch to other forms of energy or to bypass our systems in favor 
of alternative competitive sources. This could result in slow or no customer 
growth and could cause customers to reduce or cease using our product, 
thereby reducing our ability to make capital expenditures and otherwise grow 
our business, adversely affecting our earnings.

Pipeline and Storage Investments

Duke Energy, through its Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment, is a 
47 percent equity member of Atlantic Coast Pipeline, LLC (ACP) that plans 
to build and own the proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline (ACP Pipeline), an 
approximately 600-mile interstate natural gas pipeline, regulated by FERC. Prior 
to the Piedmont acquisition, Duke Energy owned a 40 percent equity ownership 
in ACP. The ACP pipeline is intended to transport diverse natural gas supplies 
into southeastern markets. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and 
Piedmont, among others, will be customers of the ACP pipeline. The targeted 
in-service date of the pipeline is late 2019. 

Gas Utilities and Infrastructure also has a 7.5 percent equity ownership 

interest in Sabal Trail Transmission, LLC (Sabal Trail). Sabal Trail is a joint 
venture that owns a 515-mile natural gas pipeline (Sabal Trail pipeline) to 
transport natural gas to Florida, regulated by FERC. The Sabal Trail phase one 
mainline was placed into service in July 2017 and traverses Alabama, Georgia 
and Florida. A request to place in-service a lateral line to the Duke Energy 
Florida’s Citrus County Combined Cycle facility is pending with FERC. Current 
legal challenges to the Sabal Trail pipeline are ongoing, which may have an 
impact on continuing operations of the pipeline. 

Gas Utilities and Infrastructure has a 24 percent equity ownership 

interest in Constitution Pipeline Company, LLC (Constitution), an interstate 
pipeline development company formed to develop, construct, own and operate 
a 124-mile natural gas pipeline and related facilities connecting shale natural 
gas supplies and gathering systems in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, to 
Iroquois Gas Transmission and Tennessee Gas Pipeline systems in New York, 
regulated by FERC. As a result of permitting delays and project uncertainty, 
Constitution is unable to approximate an in-service date.

As a result of the Piedmont acquisition, Duke Energy, through its Gas 
Utilities and Infrastructure segment, has a 21.49 percent equity ownership 
interest in Cardinal Pipeline Company, LLC (Cardinal), an intrastate pipeline 
located in North Carolina regulated by the NCUC, a 45 percent equity ownership 
in Pine Needle LNG Company, LLC (Pine Needle), an interstate liquefied natural 
gas storage facility located in North Carolina and a 50 percent equity ownership 
interest in Hardy Storage Company, LLC (Hardy Storage), an underground 
interstate natural gas storage facility located in Hardy and Hampshire counties 
in West Virginia. Pine Needle and Hardy Storage are regulated by FERC.

KO Transmission Company (KO Transmission), a wholly owned subsidiary 
of Duke Energy Ohio, is an interstate pipeline company engaged in the business 

PART Iof transporting natural gas and is subject to the rules and regulations of FERC. 
KO Transmission’s 90-mile pipeline supplies natural gas to Duke Energy Ohio 
and interconnects with the Columbia Gulf Transmission pipeline and Tennessee 
Gas Pipeline. An approximately 70-mile portion of KO Transmission’s pipeline 
facilities is co-owned by Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation.

See Notes 4, 12 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 

“Regulatory Matters,” “Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates” and “Variable 
Interest Entities,” respectively, for further information on Duke Energy’s pipeline 
investments. 

Inventory

Gas Utilities and Infrastructure must maintain adequate natural gas 

inventory in order to provide reliable delivery to customers. As of December 31, 
2017, the inventory balance for Gas Utilities and Infrastructure was $106 
million. For more information on inventory, see Note 1 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”

Regulation

State

The NCUC, PSCSC, PUCO, TPUC and KPSC (collectively, the state gas 

utility commissions) approve rates for Duke Energy’s retail natural gas service 

within their respective states. The state gas utility commissions, to varying 
degrees, have authority over the construction and operation of Gas Utilities 
and Infrastructure’s natural gas distribution facilities. Certificates of Public 
Convenience and Necessity or Certificates of Environmental Compatibility 
and Public Necessity issued by the state gas utility commissions or other 
government agencies, as applicable, authorize Gas Utilities and Infrastructure 
to construct and operate its natural gas distribution facilities and to sell natural 
gas to retail and wholesale customers. Prior approval from the relevant state 
gas utility commission is required for Gas Utilities and Infrastructure to issue 
securities. The underlying concept of utility ratemaking is to set rates at a level 
that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of providing service 
plus a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital, including equity.

In addition to amounts collected from customers though approved base 
rates, each of the state gas utility commissions allow recovery of certain costs 
through various cost-recovery clauses to the extent the respective commission 
determines in periodic hearings that such costs, including any past over- or 
under-recovered costs, are prudent.

Natural gas costs are eligible for recovery by Gas Utilities and 

Infrastructure. Due to the associated regulatory treatment and the method 
allowed for recovery, changes in natural gas costs from year to year have no 
material impact on operating results of Gas Utilities and Infrastructure, unless 
a commission finds a portion of such costs to have not been prudent. However, 
delays between the expenditure for natural gas and recovery from customers 
can adversely impact the timing of cash flows of Gas Utilities and Infrastructure.

PART IRegulations of FERC and the state gas utility commissions govern 

access to regulated natural gas and other data by nonregulated entities and 
services provided between regulated and nonregulated energy affiliates. These 
regulations affect the activities of nonregulated affiliates with Gas Utilities and 
Infrastructure.

Market Environment and Competition

The market price of commodities and services, along with the quality 

and reliability of services provided, drive competition in the wholesale 
energy business. Commercial Renewables’ main competitors include other 
nonregulated generators and wholesale power providers.

COMMERCIAL RENEWABLES

Commercial Renewables primarily acquires, builds, develops and 
operates wind and solar renewable generation throughout the continental 
U.S. The portfolio includes nonregulated renewable energy and energy storage 
businesses.

Commercial Renewables’ renewable energy includes utility-scale wind 

and solar generation assets, which total 2,907 MW across 14 states from 
21 wind facilities and 63 solar facilities. Revenues are primarily generated 
by selling the power produced from renewable generation through long-term 
contracts to utilities, electric cooperatives, municipalities and commercial and 
industrial customers. In most instances, these customers have obligations 
under state-mandated renewable energy portfolio standards or similar state or 
local renewable energy goals. Energy and renewable energy credits generated by 
wind and solar projects are generally sold at contractual prices. In addition, as 
eligible wind and solar projects are placed in service, Commercial Renewables 
recognizes either investment tax credits (ITCs) when the renewable solar or 
wind project achieves commercial availability or production tax credits (PTC) 
as power is generated by wind projects over 10 years. Renewable ITCs are 
recognized over the useful life of the asset as a reduction to depreciation 
expense with the benefit of the tax basis adjustment due to the ITC recognized in 
income in the year of commercial availability.

As part of its growth strategy, Commercial Renewables has expanded 
its investment portfolio through the addition of distributed solar companies 
and projects, energy storage systems and energy management solutions 
specifically tailored to commercial businesses. These investments include the 
2015 acquisition of a controlling interest in REC Solar Corp., a California-based 
provider of solar installations for retail, manufacturing, agriculture, technology, 
government and nonprofit customers across the U.S. and Phoenix Energy 
Technologies Inc., a California-based provider of enterprise energy management 
and information software to commercial businesses. In 2017, Duke Energy 
acquired the remaining interest in REC Solar.

For additional information on Commercial Renewables’ generation 

facilities, see Item 2, “Properties.”

Regulation

Commercial Renewables is subject to regulation at the federal level, 

primarily from the FERC. Regulations of the FERC govern access to regulated 
market information by nonregulated entities and services provided between 
regulated and nonregulated utilities.

Sources of Electricity

Commercial Renewables relies on wind and solar resources for its 

generation of electric energy.

OTHER

The remainder of Duke Energy’s operations is presented as Other. While 

it is not an operating segment, Other primarily includes interest expense on 
holding company debt, unallocated corporate costs including costs to achieve 
strategic acquisitions, amounts related to certain companywide initiatives and 
contributions made to the Duke Energy Foundation. Other also includes Bison 
Insurance Company Limited (Bison) and an investment in NMC.

The Duke Energy Foundation is a nonprofit organization funded by Duke 
Energy shareholders that makes charitable contributions to selected nonprofits 
and government subdivisions.

Bison, a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy, is a captive insurance 
company with the principal activity of providing Duke Energy subsidiaries with 
indemnification for financial losses primarily related to property, workers’ 
compensation and general liability.

NMC is a joint venture that operates in Jubail, Saudi Arabia, as a large 

regional producer of methanol and methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), an 
additive to gasoline. In 2017, NMC produced approximately 934,000 metric tons 
of methanol and approximately 1,087,000 metric tons of MTBE. Approximately 
40 percent of methanol is normally used in MTBE production. Upon the 
successful startup of NMC’s polyacetal production facility during the fourth 
quarter of 2017, Duke Energy’s ownership interest in NMC decreased from 
25 percent to 17.5 percent. Duke Energy records the investment activity of NMC 
using the equity method of accounting and retains 25 percent of NMC’s board of 
directors representation and voting rights.

Regulation

Certain entities within Other are subject to the jurisdiction of federal, state 

and local agencies.

Employees

On December 31, 2017, Duke Energy had a total of 29,060 employees 

on its payroll. The total includes 5,483 employees who are represented by 
labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements that generally 
cover wages, benefits, working practices, and other terms and conditions of 
employment.

capital expenditures required to comply with environmental regulations and a 
discussion of Global Climate Change including the potential impact of current 
and future legislation related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on the 
Duke Energy Registrants’ operations. Recently passed and potential future 
environmental statutes and regulations could have a significant impact on the 
Duke Energy Registrants’ results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 
However, if and when such statutes and regulations become effective, the Duke 
Energy Registrants will seek appropriate regulatory recovery of costs to comply 
within its regulated operations.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

In addition to other disclosures within this Form 10-K, including 

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results 
of Operations – Matters Impacting Future Results” for each registrant in Item 7,  
and other documents filed with the SEC from time to time, the following 
factors should be considered in evaluating Duke Energy and its subsidiaries. 
Such factors could affect actual results of operations and cause results to 
differ substantially from those currently expected or sought. Unless otherwise 
indicated, risk factors discussed below generally relate to risks associated with 
all of the Duke Energy Registrants. Risks identified at the Subsidiary Registrant 
level are generally applicable to Duke Energy.

BUSINESS STRATEGY RISKS

Duke Energy’s future results could be adversely affected if it is unable to 
implement its business strategy.

Duke Energy’s future results of operations depend, in significant part, 
on the extent to which it can implement its business strategy successfully. 
Duke Energy’s strategy, including transforming the customer experience, 
modernizing the energy grid, generating cleaner energy, expansion of natural gas 
infrastructure, modernizing the regulatory construct and engaging employees 
and stakeholders to accomplish these priorities, is subject to business, 
economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are 
beyond its control. As a consequence, Duke Energy may not be able to fully 
implement or realize the anticipated results of its strategy.

REGULATORY, LEGISLATIVE AND LEGAL RISKS

The Duke Energy Registrants’ regulated utility revenues, earnings and 
results are dependent on state legislation and regulation that affect 
electric generation, electric and natural gas transmission, distribution and 
related activities, which may limit their ability to recover costs.

The Duke Energy Registrants’ regulated electric and natural gas utility 
businesses are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to 
statutes and regulatory commission rules and procedures of North Carolina, 
South Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Tennessee, Indiana and Kentucky. If the Duke 

Energy Registrants’ regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established 
by the state utility commissions, retail electric and natural gas rates may 
be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions, which may 
decrease the Duke Energy Registrants’ future earnings. Additionally, if regulatory 
bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely 
basis, the Duke Energy Registrants’ future earnings could be negatively 
impacted.

If legislative and regulatory structures were to evolve in such a way that 
the Duke Energy Registrants’ exclusive rights to serve their regulated customers 
were eroded, their future earnings could be negatively impacted. Federal and 
state regulations, laws and other efforts designed to promote and expand the 
use of energy efficiency measures and distributed generation technologies, such 
as private solar and battery storage, in Duke Energy service territories could 
result in customers leaving the electric distribution system and an increase 
in customer net energy metering, which allows customers with private solar 
to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail amount. Over time, 
customer adoption of these technologies and increased energy efficiency could 
result in excess generation resources as well as stranded costs if Duke Energy is 
not able to fully recover the costs and investment in generation.

State regulators have approved various mechanisms to stabilize natural 

gas utility margins, including margin decoupling in North Carolina, rate 
stabilization in South Carolina and uncollectible natural gas cost recovery in all 
states. State regulators have approved other margin stabilizing mechanisms 
that, for example, allow for recovery of margin losses associated with 
negotiated transactions designed to retain large volume customers that could 
use alternative fuels or that may otherwise directly access natural gas supply 
through their own connection to an interstate pipeline. If regulators decided to 
discontinue the Duke Energy Registrants’ use of tariff mechanisms, it would 
negatively impact results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
In addition, regulatory authorities also review whether natural gas costs are 
prudent and can disallow the recovery of a portion of natural gas costs that the 
Duke Energy Registrants seek to recover from customers, which would adversely 
impact earnings.

The rates that the Duke Energy Registrants’ regulated utility businesses 
are allowed to charge are established by state utility commissions in rate 
case proceedings, which may limit their ability to recover costs and earn 
an appropriate return on investment.

The rates that the Duke Energy Registrants’ regulated utility business are 

allowed to charge significantly influences the results of operations, financial 
position and liquidity of the Duke Energy Registrants. The regulation of the 
rates that the regulated utility businesses charge customers is determined, 
in large part, by state utility commissions in rate case proceedings. Negative 
decisions made by these regulators could have a material adverse effect on 
the Duke Energy Registrants’ results of operations, financial position or liquidity 
and affect the ability of the Duke Energy Registrants to recover costs and an 
appropriate return on the significant infrastructure investments being made. 
Duke Energy cannot predict the outcome of these rate case proceedings.

Deregulation or restructuring in the electric industry may result in 
increased competition and unrecovered costs that could adversely affect 
the Duke Energy Registrants’ financial position, results of operations or 
cash flows and their utility businesses.

Increased competition resulting from deregulation or restructuring 
legislation could have a significant adverse impact on the Duke Energy 
Registrants’ results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Retail 
competition and the unbundling of regulated electric service could have a 
significant adverse financial impact on the Duke Energy Registrants due to 
an impairment of assets, a loss of retail customers, lower profit margins or 
increased costs of capital. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the 

17

PART Iextent and timing of entry by additional competitors into the electric markets. 
The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict if or when they will be subject to 
changes in legislation or regulation, nor can they predict the impact of these 
changes on their financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The Duke Energy Registrants’ businesses are subject to extensive federal 
regulation and a wide variety of laws and governmental policies, including 
taxes, that may change over time in ways that affect operations and costs.

Duke Energy is subject to regulations under a wide variety of U.S. federal 

and state regulations and policies. There can be no assurance that laws, 
regulations and policies will not be changed in ways that result in material 
modifications of business models and objectives or affect returns on investment 
by restricting activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs or 
prohibiting them outright.

On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and 

Jobs Acts (the Tax Act) into law which, among other provisions, reduces the 
maximum federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent 
and limits interest deductions outside of regulated utility operations effective 
January 1, 2018. The resulting revaluation of existing deferred tax assets 
and liabilities to the lower federal corporate tax rate were recognized in Duke 
Energy’s December 31, 2017, financial statements. Guidance issued by the 
SEC indicates that additional adjustments for items that were estimated may 
be recorded during 2018 if new information becomes available. The Tax Act also 
could be amended or subject to technical correction, which could change the 
financial impacts that were recorded at December 31, 2017, or are expected 
to be recorded in future periods. The FERC and state utility commissions 
will determine the regulatory treatment of the impacts of the Tax Act. Duke 
Energy’s future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could 
be adversely impacted by the Tax Act, subsequent amendments or corrections, 
or the actions of the FERC, state utility commissions or credit rating agencies 
related to the Tax Act.

The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to regulation by FERC, NRC, 

EPA and various other federal agencies as well as the North American Electric 
Reliability Corporation. Regulation affects almost every aspect of the Duke 
Energy Registrants’ businesses, including, among other things, their ability 
to: take fundamental business management actions; determine the terms 
and rates of transmission and distribution services; make acquisitions; issue 
equity or debt securities; engage in transactions with other subsidiaries and 
affiliates; and pay dividends upstream to the Duke Energy Registrants. Changes 
to federal regulations are continuous and ongoing. The Duke Energy Registrants 
cannot predict the future course of regulatory changes or the ultimate effect 
those changes will have on their businesses. However, changes in regulation 
can cause delays in or affect business planning and transactions and can 
substantially increase the Duke Energy Registrants’ costs.

The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to numerous environmental 
laws and regulations requiring significant capital expenditures that can 
increase the cost of operations, and which may impact or limit business 
plans, or cause exposure to environmental liabilities.

The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws 
and regulations affecting many aspects of their present and future operations, 
including CCRs, air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid 
waste and hazardous waste. These laws and regulations can result in 
increased capital, operating and other costs. These laws and regulations 
generally require the Duke Energy Registrants to obtain and comply with a wide 
variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. 
Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant 
expenditures, including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising 
from contaminated properties. Failure to comply with environmental regulations 
may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive measures 

18

affecting operating assets. The steps the Duke Energy Registrants could be 
required to take to ensure their facilities are in compliance could be prohibitively 
expensive. As a result, the Duke Energy Registrants may be required to shut 
down or alter the operation of their facilities, which may cause the Duke Energy 
Registrants to incur losses. Further, the Duke Energy Registrants may not be 
successful in recovering capital and operating costs incurred to comply with 
new environmental regulations through existing regulatory rate structures 
and their contracts with customers. Also, the Duke Energy Registrants may 
not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental 
regulatory approvals for their operating assets or development projects. Delays 
in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, failure to obtain 
and comply with them or changes in environmental laws or regulations to more 
stringent compliance levels could result in additional costs of operation for 
existing facilities or development of new facilities being prevented, delayed or 
subject to additional costs. Although it is not expected that the costs to comply 
with current environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on 
the Duke Energy Registrants’ financial position, results of operations or cash 
flows due to regulatory cost recovery, the Duke Energy Registrants are at risk 
that the costs of complying with environmental regulations in the future will 
have such an effect.

The EPA has recently enacted or proposed new federal regulations 

governing the management of cooling water intake structures, wastewater and 
CO2 emissions. These regulations may require the Duke Energy Registrants to 
make additional capital expenditures and increase operating and maintenance 
costs.

The Duke Energy Registrants’ operations, capital expenditures and 
financial results may be affected by regulatory changes related to the 
impacts of global climate change.

There is continued concern, both nationally and internationally, about 
climate change. The EPA may adopt and implement regulations to restrict 
emissions of GHGs. Increased regulation of GHG emissions could impose 
significant additional costs on the Duke Energy Registrants’ operations, their 
suppliers and customers. Regulatory changes could also result in generation 
facilities to be retired early and result in stranded costs if Duke Energy is not 
able to fully recover the costs and investment in generation. At this time, the 
effect that climate change regulation may have in the future on Duke Energy’s 
business, financial condition or results of operations is not able to be predicted.

OPERATIONAL RISKS

The Duke Energy Registrants’ results of operations may be negatively 
affected by overall market, economic and other conditions that are beyond 
their control.

Sustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy generally affect the 
markets in which the Duke Energy Registrants operate and negatively influence 
operations. Declines in demand for electricity or natural gas as a result of 
economic downturns in the Duke Energy Registrants’ regulated service territories 
will reduce overall sales and lessen cash flows, especially as industrial 
customers reduce production and, therefore, consumption of electricity and the 
use of natural gas. Although the Duke Energy Registrants’ regulated electric 
and natural gas businesses are subject to regulated allowable rates of return 
and recovery of certain costs, such as fuel and purchased natural gas costs, 
under periodic adjustment clauses, overall declines in electricity or natural gas 
sold as a result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and 
cash flows, thereby diminishing results of operations. Additionally, prolonged 
economic downturns that negatively impact the Duke Energy Registrants’ results 
of operations and cash flows could result in future material impairment charges 
to write-down the carrying value of certain assets, including goodwill, to their 
respective fair values.

PART IThe Duke Energy Registrants also sell electricity into the spot market or 
other competitive power markets on a contractual basis. With respect to such 
transactions, the Duke Energy Registrants are not guaranteed any rate of return 
on their capital investments through mandated rates, and revenues and results 
of operations are likely to depend, in large part, upon prevailing market prices. 
These market prices may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods 
of time and could reduce the Duke Energy Registrants’ revenues and margins, 
thereby diminishing results of operations.

Factors that could impact sales volumes, generation of electricity and 
market prices at which the Duke Energy Registrants are able to sell electricity 
and natural gas are as follows:

•	weather conditions, including abnormally mild winter or summer 
weather that cause lower energy or natural gas usage for heating 
or cooling purposes, as applicable, and periods of low rainfall that 
decrease the ability to operate facilities in an economical manner;

•	supply of and demand for energy commodities;

•	transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies that impact 

nonregulated energy operations;

•	availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources, which 
are preferred by some customers over electricity produced from coal, 
nuclear or natural gas plants, and customer usage of energy-efficient 
equipment that reduces energy demand;

•	natural gas, crude oil and refined products production levels and prices;

•	ability to procure satisfactory levels of inventory, such as coal, natural 

gas and uranium; and

•	capacity and transmission service into, or out of, the Duke Energy 

Registrants’ markets.

Natural disasters or operational accidents may adversely affect the Duke 
Energy Registrants’ operating results.

Natural disasters (such as electromagnetic events or the 2011 earthquake 

and tsunami in Japan) or other operational accidents within the company or 
industry (such as the San Bruno, California natural gas transmission pipeline 
failure) could have direct significant impacts on the Duke Energy Registrants as 
well as on key contractors and suppliers. Such events could indirectly impact 
the Duke Energy Registrants through changes to policies, laws and regulations 
whose compliance costs have a significant impact on the Duke Energy 
Registrants’ financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

The reputation and financial condition of the Duke Energy Registrants 
could be negatively impacted due to their obligations to comply with 
federal and state regulations, laws, and other legal requirements that 
govern the operations, assessments, storage, closure, remediation, 
disposal and monitoring relating to CCR, the high costs and new 
rate impacts associated with implementing these new CCR-related 
requirements and the strategies and methods necessary to implement 
these requirements in compliance with these legal obligations.

As a result of electricity produced for decades at coal-fired power plants, 

the Duke Energy Registrants manage large amounts of CCR that are primarily 
stored in dry storage within landfills or combined with water in other surface 
impoundments, all in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. 
However, the potential exists for another CCR-related incident, such as the one 
that occurred during the 2014 Dan River Steam Station ash basin release, that 
could raise environmental or general public health concerns. Such a CCR-
related incident could have a material adverse impact on the reputation and 
financial condition of the Duke Energy Registrants.

19

During 2015, EPA regulations were enacted related to the management of 
CCR from power plants. These regulations classify CCR as nonhazardous waste 
under the RCRA and apply to electric generating sites with new and existing 
landfills, new and existing surface impoundments, structural fills and CCR 
piles, and establishes requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity 
design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater 
monitoring, protection and remedial procedures and other operational and 
reporting procedures for the disposal and management of CCR. In addition to 
the federal regulations, CCR landfills and surface impoundments will continue 
to be independently regulated by existing state laws, regulations and permits, as 
well as additional legal requirements that may be imposed in the future. These 
federal and state laws, regulations and other legal requirements may require 
or result in additional expenditures, increased operating and maintenance 
costs and/or result in closure of certain power generating facilities, which 
could affect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the 
Duke Energy Registrants. The Duke Energy Registrants intend to seek full cost 
recovery for expenditures through the normal ratemaking process with state 
and federal utility commissions, who permit recovery in rates of necessary and 
prudently incurred costs associated with the Duke Energy Registrants’ regulated 
operations, and through other wholesale contracts with terms that contemplate 
recovery of such costs, although there is no guarantee of full cost recovery. In 
addition, the timing for recovery of such costs could have a material adverse 
impact on Duke Energy’s cash flows.

The Duke Energy Registrants have recognized significant asset retirement 

obligations related to these CCR-related requirements. Closure activities 
began in 2015 at the four sites specified as high priority by the Coal Ash Act 
and at the W.S. Lee Steam Station site in South Carolina in connection with 
other legal requirements. Excavation at these sites involves movement of 
large amounts of CCR materials to off-site locations for use as structural fill, 
to appropriate engineered off-site or on-site lined landfills or conversion of 
the ash for beneficial use. At other sites, preliminary planning and closure 
methods have been studied and factored into the estimated retirement and 
management costs. The Coal Ash Act requires CCR surface impoundments in 
North Carolina to be closed, with the closure method and timing based on a risk 
ranking classification determined by legislation or state regulators. Additionally, 
the RCRA required closure timing depends upon meeting or continuing to meet 
certain criteria. As the closure and CCR management work progresses and final 
closure plans and corrective action measures are developed and approved at 
each site, the scope and complexity of work and the amount of CCR material 
could be greater than estimates and could, therefore, materially increase 
compliance expenditures and rate impacts.

The Duke Energy Registrants’ financial position, results of operations and 
cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth 
in the number of customers, or decline in customer demand or number of 
customers.

Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly 

influence demand for electricity and natural gas and the need for additional 
power generation and delivery facilities. Customer growth and customer usage 
are affected by a number of factors outside the control of the Duke Energy 
Registrants, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand-side 
management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and 
demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, 
housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic 
activity.

Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are 

considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption 
by certain dates. Additionally, technological advances driven by federal laws 
mandating new levels of energy efficiency in end-use electric devices or other 
improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per 
capita energy consumption.

PART IAdvances in distributed generation technologies that produce power, 

including fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines and solar cells, may reduce 
the cost of alternative methods of producing power to a level competitive with 
central power station electric production utilized by the Duke Energy Registrants.

Some or all of these factors could result in a lack of growth or decline in 

customer demand for electricity or number of customers and may cause the 
failure of the Duke Energy Registrants to fully realize anticipated benefits from 
significant capital investments and expenditures, which could have a material 
adverse effect on their financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Furthermore, the Duke Energy Registrants currently have energy efficiency 

riders in place to recover the cost of energy efficiency programs in North 
Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. Should the Duke 
Energy Registrants be required to invest in conservation measures that result in 
reduced sales from effective conservation, regulatory lag in adjusting rates for 
the impact of these measures could have a negative financial impact.

The Duke Energy Registrants’ operating results may fluctuate on a 
seasonal and quarterly basis and can be negatively affected by changes 
in weather conditions and severe weather, including extreme weather 
conditions associated with climate change.

Electric power generation and natural gas distribution are generally 

seasonal businesses. In most parts of the U.S., the demand for power peaks 
during the warmer summer months, with market prices also typically peaking at 
that time. In other areas, demand for power peaks during the winter. Demand for 
natural gas peaks during the winter months. Further, extreme weather conditions 
such as heat waves, winter storms and severe weather associated with climate 
change could cause these seasonal fluctuations to be more pronounced. As a 
result, the overall operating results of the Duke Energy Registrants’ businesses 
may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal and quarterly basis and thus make 
period-to-period comparison less relevant.

Sustained severe drought conditions could impact generation by 

hydroelectric plants, as well as fossil and nuclear plant operations, as these 
facilities use water for cooling purposes and for the operation of environmental 
compliance equipment. Furthermore, destruction caused by severe weather 
events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, snow and ice 
storms, can result in lost operating revenues due to outages, property damage, 
including downed transmission and distribution lines, and additional and 
unexpected expenses to mitigate storm damage. The cost of storm restoration 
efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process.

The Duke Energy Registrants’ sales may decrease if they are unable to gain 
adequate, reliable and affordable access to transmission assets.

The Duke Energy Registrants depend on transmission and distribution 

facilities owned and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver 
electricity sold to the wholesale market. The FERC’s power transmission 
regulations require wholesale electric transmission services to be offered on 
an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. If transmission is disrupted, or if 
transmission capacity is inadequate, the Duke Energy Registrants’ ability to sell 
and deliver products may be hindered.

The different regional power markets have changing regulatory structures, 

which could affect growth and performance in these regions. In addition, the 
ISOs who oversee the transmission systems in regional power markets have 
imposed in the past, and may impose in the future, price limitations and other 
mechanisms to address volatility in the power markets. These types of price 
limitations and other mechanisms may adversely impact the profitability of the 
Duke Energy Registrants’ wholesale power marketing business.

Duke Energy may be unable to complete necessary or desirable pipeline 
expansion or infrastructure development or maintenance projects, which 

20

may delay or prevent the Duke Energy Registrants from serving natural gas 
customers or expanding the natural gas business.

In order to serve current or new natural gas customers or expand the 
service to existing customers, the Duke Energy Registrants need to maintain, 
expand or upgrade distribution, transmission and/or storage infrastructure, 
including laying new pipeline and building compressor stations. Duke Energy 
Registrants have made significant investments in a number of pipeline 
development projects, which are being operated and constructed by third party 
joint venture partners. Various factors, such as the inability to obtain required 
approval from local, state and/or federal regulatory and governmental bodies, 
public opposition to projects, inability to obtain adequate financing, competition 
for labor and materials, construction delays, cost overruns and the inability 
to negotiate acceptable agreements relating to rights of way, construction or 
other material development components, may prevent or delay the completion 
of projects or increase costs. As a result, the Duke Energy Registrants may be 
unable to adequately serve existing natural gas customers or support customer 
growth or could incur higher than anticipated costs, which could have a negative 
financial impact.

The availability of adequate interstate pipeline transportation capacity and 
natural gas supply may decrease.

The Duke Energy Registrants purchase almost all of their natural gas 
supply from interstate sources that must be transported to the applicable 
service territories. Interstate pipeline companies transport the natural gas to 
the Duke Energy Registrants’ systems under firm service agreements that are 
designed to meet the requirements of their core markets. A significant disruption 
to interstate pipelines capacity or reduction in natural gas supply due to events 
including, but not limited to, operational failures or disruptions, hurricanes, 
tornadoes, floods, freeze off of natural gas wells, terrorist or cyberattacks or 
other acts of war or legislative or regulatory actions or requirements, including 
remediation related to integrity inspections, could reduce the normal interstate 
supply of natural gas and thereby reduce earnings. Moreover, if additional 
natural gas infrastructure, including, but not limited to, exploration and drilling 
rigs and platforms, processing and gathering systems, off-shore pipelines, 
interstate pipelines and storage, cannot be built at a pace that meets demand, 
then growth opportunities could be limited and earnings negatively impacted.

Fluctuations in commodity prices or availability may adversely affect 
various aspects of the Duke Energy Registrants’ operations as well as their 
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to the effects of market 

fluctuations in the price of natural gas, coal, fuel oil, nuclear fuel, electricity 
and other energy-related commodities as a result of their ownership of 
energy-related assets. Fuel costs are recovered primarily through cost-recovery 
clauses, subject to the approval of state utility commissions.

Additionally, the Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to risk that 

counterparties will not be able to fulfill their obligations. Disruption in the 
delivery of fuel, including disruptions as a result of, among other things, 
transportation delays, weather, labor relations, force majeure events or 
environmental regulations affecting any of these fuel suppliers, could limit the 
Duke Energy Registrants’ ability to operate their facilities. Should counterparties 
fail to perform, the Duke Energy Registrants might be forced to replace the 
underlying commitment at prevailing market prices possibly resulting in losses 
in addition to the amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties.

Certain of the Duke Energy Registrants’ hedge agreements may result 

in the receipt of, or posting of, derivative collateral with counterparties, 
depending on the daily derivative position. Fluctuations in commodity prices 
that lead to the return of collateral received and/or the posting of collateral 
with counterparties negatively impact liquidity. Downgrades in the Duke 

PART IEnergy Registrants’ credit ratings could lead to additional collateral posting 
requirements. The Duke Energy Registrants continually monitor derivative 
positions in relation to market price activity.

Potential terrorist activities, or military or other actions, could adversely 
affect the Duke Energy Registrants’ businesses.

The continued threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military 

and other action by the U.S. and its allies may lead to increased political, 
economic and financial market instability and volatility in prices for natural 
gas and oil, which may have material adverse effects in ways the Duke Energy 
Registrants cannot predict at this time. In addition, future acts of terrorism and 
possible reprisals as a consequence of action by the U.S. and its allies could 
be directed against companies operating in the U.S. Information technology 
systems, transmission and distribution and generation facilities such as nuclear 
plants could be potential targets of terrorist activities or harmful activities 
by individuals or groups. The potential for terrorism has subjected the Duke 
Energy Registrants’ operations to increased risks and could have a material 
adverse effect on their businesses. In particular, the Duke Energy Registrants 
may experience increased capital and operating costs to implement increased 
security for their information technology systems, transmission and distribution 
and generation facilities, including nuclear power plants under the NRC’s design 
basis threat requirements. These increased costs could include additional 
physical plant security and security personnel or additional capability following 
a terrorist incident.

Cyberattacks and data security breaches could adversely affect the Duke 
Energy Registrants’ businesses.

Information security risks have generally increased in recent years as a 
result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication 
and frequency of cyberattacks and data security breaches. The utility industry 
requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology 
systems and network infrastructure, which are part of an interconnected 
regional grid. Additionally, connectivity to the internet continues to increase 
through smart grid and other initiatives. Because of the critical nature of the 
infrastructure, increased connectivity to the internet and technology systems’ 
inherent vulnerability to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of 
war or terrorism or other types of data security breaches, the Duke Energy 
Registrants face a heightened risk of cyberattack. In the event of such an attack, 
the Duke Energy Registrants could (i) have business operations disrupted, 
property damaged, customer information stolen and other private information 
accessed, (ii) experience substantial loss of revenues, repair and restoration 
costs, implementation costs for additional security measures to avert future 
cyberattacks and other financial loss and (iii) be subject to increased regulation, 
litigation and reputational damage.

Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could 
unfavorably impact the Duke Energy Registrants’ results of operations.

Certain events, such as an aging workforce, mismatch of skill set or 

complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead 
to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include lack 
of resources, loss of knowledge base and the lengthy time required for skill 
development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace 
employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may increase. Failure to 
hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of 
significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employees, or 
future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to 

manage and operate the business, especially considering the workforce needs 
associated with nuclear generation facilities and new skills required to operate a 
modernized, technology-enabled power grid. If the Duke Energy Registrants are 
unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, 
their financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be negatively 
affected.

The costs of retiring Duke Energy Florida’s Crystal River Unit 3 could prove 
to be more extensive than is currently identified.

Costs to retire and decommission the plant could exceed estimates and, 
if not recoverable through the regulatory process, could adversely affect Duke 
Energy’s, Progress Energy’s and Duke Energy Florida’s financial condition, 
results of operations and cash flows.

Duke Energy Ohio’s and Duke Energy Indiana’s membership in an RTO 
presents risks that could have a material adverse effect on their results of 
operations, financial condition and cash flows.

The rules governing the various regional power markets may change, 

which could affect Duke Energy Ohio’s and Duke Energy Indiana’s costs and/or 
revenues. To the degree Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana incur 
significant additional fees and increased costs to participate in an RTO, their 
results of operations may be impacted. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy 
Indiana may be allocated a portion of the cost of transmission facilities built 
by others due to changes in RTO transmission rate design. Duke Energy Ohio 
and Duke Energy Indiana may be required to expand their transmission system 
according to decisions made by an RTO rather than their own internal planning 
process. While RTO transmission rates were initially designed to be revenue 
neutral, various proposals and proceedings currently taking place by the FERC 
may cause transmission rates to change from time to time. In addition, RTOs 
have been developing rules associated with the allocation and methodology 
of assigning costs associated with improved transmission reliability, reduced 
transmission congestion and firm transmission rights that may have a financial 
impact on Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana.

As members of an RTO, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana are 

subject to certain additional risks, including those associated with the allocation 
among RTO members, of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other 
participants in the RTO markets and those associated with complaint cases filed 
against an RTO that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by RTO 
members.

The Duke Energy Registrants may not recover costs incurred to begin 
construction on projects that are canceled.

Duke Energy’s long-term strategy requires the construction of new 

projects, either wholly owned or partially owned, which involve a number of 
risks, including construction delays, nonperformance by equipment and other 
third party suppliers, and increases in equipment and labor costs. To limit the 
risks of these construction projects, the Duke Energy Registrants enter into 
equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering 
and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals 
and/or siting or environmental permits. If any of these projects are canceled 
for any reason, including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals and/
or siting or environmental permits, significant cancellation penalties under the 
equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur.  In addition, 
if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset, an 
impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled.

21

PART INUCLEAR GENERATION RISKS

Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida 
may incur substantial costs and liabilities due to their ownership and 
operation of nuclear generating facilities.

Ownership interest in and operation of nuclear stations by Duke Energy 

Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida subject them to various 
risks. These risks include, among other things: the potential harmful effects on 
the environment and human health resulting from the current or past operation 
of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive 
materials; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially 
available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; 
and uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of 
decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives.

Ownership and operation of nuclear generation facilities requires 

compliance with licensing and safety-related requirements imposed by the NRC. 
In the event of non-compliance, the NRC may increase regulatory oversight, 
impose fines or shut down a unit depending upon its assessment of the severity 
of the situation. Revised security and safety requirements promulgated by 
the NRC, which could be prompted by, among other things, events within or 
outside of the control of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke 
Energy Florida, such as a serious nuclear incident at a facility owned by a third 
party, could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures, as well 
as assessments to cover third-party losses. In addition, if a serious nuclear 
incident were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the results of 
operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation of the Duke Energy 
Registrants.

LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND COMMON STOCK RISKS

The Duke Energy Registrants rely on access to short-term borrowings and 
longer-term debt and equity markets to finance their capital requirements 
and support their liquidity needs. Access to those markets can be 
adversely affected by a number of conditions, many of which are beyond 
the Duke Energy Registrants’ control.

The Duke Energy Registrants’ businesses are significantly financed 

through issuances of debt and equity. The maturity and repayment profile of 
debt used to finance investments often does not correlate to cash flows from 
their assets. Accordingly, as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not 
satisfied by the cash flows from their operations and to fund investments 
originally financed through debt instruments with disparate maturities, the 
Duke Energy Registrants rely on access to short-term money markets as well as 
longer-term capital markets. The Subsidiary Registrants also rely on access to 
short-term intercompany borrowings. If the Duke Energy Registrants are not able 
to access debt or equity at competitive rates or at all, the ability to finance their 
operations and implement their strategy and business plan as scheduled could 
be adversely affected. An inability to access debt and equity may limit the Duke 
Energy Registrants’ ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions that they 
may otherwise rely on for future growth.

Market disruptions may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect 

the ability to access one or more financial markets. Such disruptions could 
include: economic downturns, the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company, 
unfavorable capital market conditions, market prices for electricity and natural 
gas, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, or the overall health of the energy 
industry. The availability of credit under Duke Energy’s Master Credit Facility 
depends upon the ability of the banks providing commitments under the facility 
to provide funds when their obligations to do so arise. Systematic risk of the 
banking system and the financial markets could prevent a bank from meeting its 
obligations under the facility agreement.

Duke Energy maintains a revolving credit facility to provide backup for its 
commercial paper program and letters of credit to support variable rate demand 
tax-exempt bonds that may be put to the Duke Energy Registrant issuer at 
the option of the holder. The facility includes borrowing sublimits for the Duke 
Energy Registrants, each of whom is a party to the credit facility, and financial 
covenants that limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage 
of the total capital for the specific entity. Failure to maintain these covenants at 
a particular entity could preclude Duke Energy from issuing commercial paper or 
the Duke Energy Registrants from issuing letters of credit or borrowing under the 
Master Credit Facility.

The Duke Energy Registrants must meet credit quality standards and 
there is no assurance they will maintain investment grade credit ratings. 
If the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to maintain investment grade 
credit ratings, they would be required under credit agreements to provide 
collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash, which may materially 
adversely affect their liquidity.

Each of the Duke Energy Registrants’ senior long-term debt issuances is 
currently rated investment grade by various rating agencies. The Duke Energy 
Registrants cannot ensure their senior long-term debt will be rated investment 
grade in the future.

If the rating agencies were to rate the Duke Energy Registrants below 

investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, perhaps significantly. 
In addition, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely 
decrease. Further, if the short-term debt rating were to fall, access to the 
commercial paper market could be significantly limited.

A downgrade below investment grade could also require the posting of 

additional collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash under various credit, 
commodity and capacity agreements and trigger termination clauses in some 
interest rate derivative agreements, which would require cash payments. All 
of these events would likely reduce the Duke Energy Registrants’ liquidity and 
profitability and could have a material effect on their financial position, results 
of operations or cash flows.

Non-compliance with debt covenants or conditions could adversely affect 
the Duke Energy Registrants’ ability to execute future borrowings.

The Duke Energy Registrants’ debt and credit agreements contain 
various financial and other covenants. Failure to meet those covenants 
beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or 
termination of the agreements.

Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of the 
NDTF investments of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and 
Duke Energy Florida, which then could require significant additional 
funding.

Ownership and operation of nuclear generation facilities also requires the 
maintenance of funded trusts that are intended to pay for the decommissioning 
costs of the respective nuclear power plants. The performance of the capital 
markets affects the values of the assets held in trust to satisfy these future 
obligations. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy 
Florida have significant obligations in this area and hold significant assets in 
these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield 
uncertain returns, which may fall below projected rates of return. Although 
a number of factors impact funding requirements, a decline in the market 
value of the assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations 
for decommissioning nuclear plants. If Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy 
Progress and Duke Energy Florida are unable to successfully manage their NDTF 
assets, their financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be 
negatively affected.

22

PART IDuke Energy is a holding company and depends on the cash flows from its 
subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations.

Because Duke Energy is a holding company with no operations or cash 
flows of its own, its ability to meet its financial obligations, including making 
interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and to pay 
dividends on its common stock, is primarily dependent on the net income 
and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to pay 
upstream dividends or to repay borrowed funds. Prior to funding Duke Energy, its 
subsidiaries have regulatory restrictions and financial obligations that must be 
satisfied. These subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation 
to provide Duke Energy with funds. In addition, Duke Energy may provide capital 
contributions or debt financing to its subsidiaries under certain circumstances, 
which would reduce the funds available to meet its financial obligations, 
including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness 
and to pay dividends on Duke Energy’s common stock.

Poor investment performance of the Duke Energy pension plan holdings 
and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably impact 
the Duke Energy Registrants’ liquidity and results of operations.

The costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans 
are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan 
assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required 
minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation and required 
or voluntary contributions made to the plans. The Subsidiary Registrants 
are allocated their proportionate share of the cost and obligations related to 
these plans. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time 
to increase the value of plan assets and, depending upon the other factors 
impacting costs as listed above, Duke Energy could be required to fund its 
plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations, and the 
Subsidiary Registrants’ proportionate share of such cash funding obligations, 
could have a material impact on the Duke Energy Registrants’ financial position, 
results of operations or cash flows.

Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

MTBE Litigation

On June 19, 2014, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania filed suit against, among others, Duke Energy Merchants, alleging contamination of “waters of the state” 

by MTBE from leaking gasoline storage tanks. MTBE is a gasoline additive intended to increase the oxygen level in gasoline and make it burn cleaner. The lawsuit 
was moved to federal court and consolidated into an existing multidistrict litigation docket of pending MTBE cases. This suit was settled for an immaterial amount in 
December 2017.

In December 2017, the state of Maryland filed a lawsuit in Baltimore City Circuit Court against Duke Energy Merchants and other defendants alleging 

contamination of its water supplies from MTBE. Discovery is underway. Duke Energy cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Management’s Discussion and Analysis includes financial information 
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) 
in the United States (U.S.), as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures 
such as adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share discussed below. 
Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of financial 
performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) 
amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable 
measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP 
financial measures should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute 
for, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP 
measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled 
measures used by other companies.

The following combined Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 

Financial Condition and Results of Operations is separately filed by Duke Energy 
Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, Duke Energy) and its subsidiaries 
Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (Duke Energy Carolinas), Progress Energy, Inc. 
(Progress Energy), Duke Energy Progress, LLC (Duke Energy Progress), Duke 
Energy Florida, LLC (Duke Energy Florida), Duke Energy Ohio, Inc. (Duke 
Energy Ohio), Duke Energy Indiana, LLC (Duke Energy Indiana) and Piedmont 
Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont). However, none of the registrants make 
any representation as to information related solely to Duke Energy or the 
subsidiary registrants of Duke Energy other than itself. Subsequent to Duke 
Energy’s acquisition of Piedmont on October 3, 2016, Piedmont is a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Duke Energy. The financial information for Duke Energy 
includes results of Piedmont subsequent to October 3, 2016. See Note 2 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Acquisitions and Dispositions,” for 
additional information regarding the acquisition.

net income attributable to Duke Energy per diluted share.

Duke Energy’s 2017 GAAP reported earnings were impacted by 

unfavorable weather and the absence of International Energy partially offset by 
growth in the electric and gas businesses, including the addition of a full year’s 
earnings contribution from Piedmont and ongoing cost management efforts. 
See “Results of Operations” below for a detailed discussion of the consolidated 
results of operations, as well as a detailed discussion of financial results for 
each of Duke Energy’s reportable business segments, as well as Other.

2017 Areas of Focus and Accomplishments

Duke Energy advanced a number of important strategic initiatives to 

transform its energy future with a focus on customers, employees, operations 
and growth. The company has responded to an environment of changing 
customer demands by investing in electric and natural gas infrastructure that 
customers value and that provide an opportunity for sustainable growth.

Portfolio Transition. On October 3, 2016, Duke Energy completed the 

acquisition of Piedmont, a North Carolina corporation primarily engaged in 
regulated natural gas distribution to residential, commercial, industrial and 
power generation customers in portions of North Carolina, South Carolina and 
Tennessee. In December 2016, Duke Energy completed the sale of its Latin 
American generation businesses in two separate transactions. See Note 2 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Acquisitions and Dispositions,” for 
additional information regarding these transactions.

With the acquisition of Piedmont and the sale of International Energy, 

Duke Energy completed a multiyear portfolio transition. The Piedmont 
acquisition reflects the growing importance of natural gas to the future of the 
energy infrastructure within the company’s service territory and throughout 
the U.S. and establishes a strategic platform for future growth in natural gas 
infrastructure. The growth opportunities reflected in our 10-year strategy are 
expected to increase the earnings contributions from the natural gas business 
from 8 percent to 15 percent.

Operational Excellence. Duke Energy continues to focus on the safe 

and efficient operation of its generation fleet. During 2017, we delivered strong 
overall safety and environmental performance, with our key employee safety 
metric, total incident case rate, and our reportable environmental events 
both improving from last year. Our nuclear and fossil/hydro generation fleets 
demonstrated strong performance, exceeding their respective reliability targets.

Storm Response and System Restoration. Hurricane Irma, in October 
2017, was one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the southern U.S. During 
Hurricane Irma, over 1.3 million customers in Florida were without power. Our 
restoration efforts involved coordination and communication with more than 
12,000 line and fieldworkers and our team restored power to 99 percent of 
customers within eight days.

Customer Satisfaction. Higher J.D. Power residential customer 

satisfaction scores in 2017 reflect progress in the company’s efforts to meet 
customers’ expectations. The work to improve customer satisfaction will 
continue, but all jurisdictions remain on track to make steady gains in the years 
ahead as Duke Energy continues to transform the customer experience through 
its Customer Connect Program.

Constructive Regulatory Outcomes. One of our long-term strategic 
goals is to achieve modernized regulatory constructs in all of our jurisdictions 
within 10 years. Modernized constructs provide a number of benefits, including 
improved earnings and cash flows through more timely recovery of investments, 
as well as stable pricing for customers. We filed several base rate cases during 
2017 to recover a range of strategic investments, such as customer service 
technologies, coal ash costs in the Carolinas, smart meters, natural gas and 
solar generation. We continue to pursue additional legislative and regulatory 
outcomes, both in Washington and across our service territories, that make 
sense for our customers and investors.

31

PART IICost Management and Efficiencies. Duke Energy has a demonstrated 
track record of driving efficiencies and productivity, including merger integration 
and continuous improvement efforts. These efficiencies will help in Duke 
Energy’s objective to keep overall customer rates below the national average, 
while moderating customer bill increases over time. We are on track to exceed 
targeted Piedmont merger cost synergies without significant disruptions to 
the business or culture, integrating the Piedmont and Midwest natural gas 
operations, and moving to a shared services model. We continue to leverage 
new technology and data analytics to drive additional efficiencies across the 
business.

Dividend Growth. In 2017, Duke Energy continued to grow the dividend 

payment to shareholders by approximately 4 percent. 2017 represented the 91st 
consecutive year Duke Energy paid a cash dividend on its common stock.

Duke Energy Objectives – 2018 and Beyond

Duke Energy will continue to deliver exceptional value to customers, be 

an integral part of the communities in which it does business, and provide 
attractive returns to investors. Duke Energy is committed to lead the way to 
cleaner, smarter energy solutions that customers value through a strategy 
focused on:

•	Transformation of the customer experience to meet changing customer 

expectations through enhanced convenience, control and choice in 
energy supply and usage.

•	Modernization of the electric grid, including smart meters, storm 
hardening, self-healing and targeted undergrounding to ensure 
the system is better prepared for severe weather and to improve 
the system’s reliability and flexibility, as well as to provide better 
information and services for customers.

•	Generation of cleaner energy through an increased amount of natural 

gas, renewables generation and the continued safe and reliable 
operation of nuclear plants.

•	Expansion of natural gas infrastructure, from midstream gas pipelines 

to local distribution systems.

•	Operational excellence through engagement with employees and being 

an industry leader in safety performance and efficient operations. 

•	Stakeholder engagement to ensure the regulatory rules in the states 

in which Duke Energy operates benefit customers and allow Duke 
Energy to recover its significant investments in a timely manner while 
maintaining affordable rates.

•	Engagement with regulatory commissions to determine the regulatory 

treatment of the impact of the Tax Act.

Primary objectives toward the implementation of this strategy include:

Growth Initiatives. Growth in the Electric Utilities and Infrastructure 
business is expected to be supported by the investment of significant capital 
in the electric transmission and distribution grid, and in cleaner, more efficient 
generation. Duke Energy expects to invest approximately $30 billion in Electric 
Utilities and Infrastructure growth projects over the next five years (2018-2022), 
continuing its efforts to generate cleaner energy. Duke Energy intends to work 
constructively with regulators to evaluate the current regulatory construct 
and seek modernized recovery solutions, such as riders, rate decoupling and 
multiyear rate plans, that benefit both customers and shareholders.

Investment projects at Electric Utilities and Infrastructure currently 

underway that will support growth initiatives include:

•	Duke Energy Indiana’s $1.4 billion grid modernization plan, which is 
aimed at improving reliability, including fewer outages and quicker 
restoration. 

•	Significant investments in combined-cycle natural gas plants, 

including completing the $1.5 billion Citrus County plant in Florida, the 
$600 million W.S. Lee facility in South Carolina and the $900 million 
investment in the Western Carolinas Modernization Project. These 
investments will allow Duke Energy to replace older, less efficient coal 
units.

•	Duke Energy expects to continue to advance other cleaner energy 

sources within its regulated electric jurisdictions, including hydro, wind, 
solar and combined heat and power projects, increasing the flexibility 
of the system and allowing Duke Energy to continue lowering carbon 
emissions. 

•	In North Carolina, HB 589 provides a timely cost recovery 

mechanism for any solar investments we are able to make through a 
competitive market process. 

•	In Florida, as part of the comprehensive multi-year rate settlement, 
we committed to invest in approximately 700 MW of solar capacity 
over the next five years and will be authorized to recover the cost of 
that investment through a single issue base rate increase. We also 
advanced our strategic priority of energy grid investment, establishing 
a multiyear recovery method for $1 billion of grid investments.

Duke Energy expects to invest around $7 billion growing its Gas Utilities 

and Infrastructure business over the next five years. Growth in Gas Utilities and 
Infrastructure will be focused on the following:

•	With the acquisition of Piedmont, Duke Energy now operates natural gas 
distribution businesses across five states. The continued integration of 
Piedmont, as well as additional investments in the natural gas Local 
Distribution Company (LDC) system, will help maintain system integrity 
and expand natural gas distribution to new customers.

•	Duke Energy will continue to grow its midstream pipeline business, 

underpinned by investments in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, Sabal Trail 
and Constitution pipeline projects. These highly contracted pipelines will 
bring much needed, low-cost natural gas supplies to the eastern U.S., 
spurring economic growth and helping Duke Energy to grow its customer 
base in the Southeast.

For Commercial Renewables, Duke Energy will continue to pursue long-

term contracted wind and solar projects that meet its return criteria.

Cost Management. Duke Energy has a demonstrated track record of 
driving efficiencies and productivity into the business, leveraging its scale 
through competitive procurement initiatives, deploying digital transformation 
and continuing to identify sustainable cost savings as an essential element in 
response to a transforming industry.

Execute on Coal Ash Management Strategy. Duke Energy will 

continue the company’s compliance strategy with the North Carolina Coal 
Ash Management Act of 2014 (Coal Ash Act) and Resource Conservation and 
Recovery Act. Duke Energy will update ash management plans to comply with 
the appropriate regulations and expand excavation and other compliance work 
at additional sites once plans and permits are approved.

32

PART IIResults of Operations

Non-GAAP Measures

Management evaluates financial performance in part based on non-GAAP 

financial measures, including adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS. 
These items represent income from continuing operations attributable to 
Duke Energy, adjusted for the dollar and per share impact of special items. 
As discussed below, special items include certain charges and credits, which 
management believes are not indicative of Duke Energy’s ongoing performance. 
Management believes the presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted 
diluted EPS provides useful information to investors, as it provides them with an 
additional relevant comparison of Duke Energy’s performance across periods.
Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning and 

forecasting, and for reporting financial results to the Duke Energy Board of 
Directors (Board of Directors), employees, stockholders, analysts and investors. 
Adjusted diluted EPS is also used as a basis for employee incentive bonuses. 
The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted earnings and 
adjusted diluted EPS are Net Income Attributable to Duke Energy Corporation 
(GAAP Reported Earnings) and Diluted EPS Attributable to Duke Energy 
Corporation common stockholders (GAAP Reported EPS), respectively.

Special items included in the periods presented include the following, 

which management believes do not reflect ongoing costs:

•	Costs to Achieve Mergers represents charges that result from strategic 

acquisitions.

•	Cost Savings Initiatives represent severance charges related to 

company-wide initiatives, excluding merger integration, to standardize 
processes and systems, leverage technology and workforce 
optimization.

•	Regulatory Settlements in 2017 represent charges related to the Levy 

nuclear project in Florida and the Mayo Zero Liquid Discharge and 
Sutton combustion turbine projects in North Carolina. The 2015 amount 
represents charges related to the IGCC Settlement.

•	Commercial Renewables Impairments represent other-than-temporary, 

asset and goodwill impairments.

•	Impacts of the Tax Act represent estimated amounts recognized related 

to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

•	Ash Basin Settlement and Penalties represent charges related to Plea 

Agreements and settlement agreements with regulators and other 
governmental entities.

Adjusted earnings also include the operating results of the nonregulated 

Midwest generation business and Duke Energy Retail Sales (collectively, the 
Midwest Generation Disposal Group) and the International Disposal Group, 
which have been classified as discontinued operations. Management believes 
inclusion of the operating results of the Disposal Groups within adjusted 
earnings and adjusted diluted EPS results in a better reflection of Duke Energy’s 
financial performance during the period.

Duke Energy’s adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS may not be 
comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because other 
companies may not calculate the measures in the same manner.

results and Midwest Generation Disposal Group operating results, which are included in adjusted earnings, and (ii) a state tax charge resulting from the completion of the sale of the Midwest Generation Disposal Group but not 
reported as discontinued operations.

(c)  The Tax Act reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018. As the tax change was enacted in 2017, Duke Energy is required to remeasure its existing deferred tax assets and 

liabilities at the lower rate. For Duke Energy’s regulated operations, where the reduction in the net accumulated deferred income tax liability is expected to be returned to customers in future rates, the remeasurement has 
been deferred as a regulatory liability.

33

PART IIYear Ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016

Partially offset by:

•	Higher storm costs at Electric Utilities and Infrastructure due to 

significant 2016 storms;

•	Higher interest expense related to additional debt outstanding; and

•	Higher depreciation and amortization expense at Electric Utilities and 

Infrastructure primarily due to higher depreciable base.

SEGMENT RESULTS

The remaining information presented in this discussion of results of 

operations is on a GAAP basis. Management evaluates segment performance 
based on segment income. Segment income is defined as income from 
continuing operations net of income attributable to noncontrolling interests. 
Segment income includes intercompany revenues and expenses that are 
eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Duke Energy’s segment structure includes the following segments: Electric 

Utilities and Infrastructure, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure and Commercial 
Renewables. The remainder of Duke Energy’s operations is presented as Other. 
See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Business Segments,” for 
additional information on Duke Energy’s segment structure.

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act)

On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Act into law. 

Among other provisions, the Tax Act lowers the corporate federal income tax rate 
from 35 percent to 21 percent, limits interest deductions outside of regulated 
utility operations, and eliminates bonus depreciation for regulated utilities, 
effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Act also could be amended or subject to 
technical correction, which could change the financial impacts that were 
recorded at December 31, 2017, or are expected to be recorded in future periods. 
See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Income Taxes,” for 
additional information on the Tax Act. The FERC and state utility commissions 
will determine the regulatory treatment of the impacts of the Tax Act for the 
Subsidiary Registrants. Duke Energy’s segments’ future results of operations, 
financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by the Tax 
Act, subsequent amendments or corrections, or the actions of the FERC, state 
utility commissions or credit rating agencies related to the Tax Act. Duke Energy 
is reviewing orders to address the rate treatment of the Tax Act by each state 
utility commission in which the Subsidiary Registrants operate. See Note 4 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters,” for additional 
information. Beginning in January 2018, the Subsidiary Registrants will defer 
the estimated ongoing impacts of the Tax Act that are expected to be returned to 
customers. See the Credit Ratings section below for additional information on the 
impact of the Tax Act on the Duke Energy Registrants’ credit ratings.

As a result of the Tax Act, Duke Energy revalued its existing deferred tax 

assets and deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2017, to account for 
the estimated future impact of lower corporate tax rates on these deferred tax 
amounts. For Duke Energy’s regulated operations, where the net reduction in 
the net accumulated deferred income tax liability is expected to be returned to 
customers in future rates, the remeasurement has been deferred as a regulatory 
liability. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory 
Matters,” for additional information on the Tax Act’s impact to the regulatory 
asset and liability accounts.  

Duke Energy’s full-year 2017 GAAP Reported EPS was $4.36 compared 

to $3.11 for full-year 2016. In addition to the adjusted diluted EPS drivers 
discussed below, GAAP Reported EPS in 2017 was higher primarily due to a 
$0.14 benefit per share related to the Tax Act in 2017, lower costs to achieve the 
Piedmont merger and a loss on sale and impairments associated with the sale 
of the International Disposal Group in 2016, partially offset by charges of $0.14 
related to regulatory settlements in Electric Utilities and Infrastructure.

As discussed, management also evaluates financial performance based on 
adjusted earnings. Duke Energy’s full-year 2017 adjusted diluted EPS was $4.57 
compared to $4.69 for full-year 2016. The decrease in adjusted diluted EPS was 
primarily due to:

•	Lower regulated electric revenues of $0.26 per share due to less 

favorable weather in the current year, including lost revenues related to 
Hurricane Irma;

•	The prior year operating results from the International Disposal Group, 
which was sold in December 2016. The 2016 operating results included 
a benefit from the valuation of deferred income taxes. See Note 22 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements, Income Taxes,” for additional 
information;

•	Higher financing costs, primarily due to the Piedmont acquisition; and

•	Higher depreciation and amortization expense at Electric Utilities and 

Infrastructure primarily due to higher depreciable base.

Partially offset by:

•	Higher regulated electric revenues from increased pricing and riders 

driven by new rates in Duke Energy Progress South Carolina, base rate 
adjustments in Florida and energy efficiency rider revenues in North 
Carolina, as well as growth in weather-normal retail volumes;

•	Lower operations, maintenance and other expenses, net of amounts 

recoverable in rates, at Electric Utilities and Infrastructure resulting from 
ongoing cost efficiency efforts and lower year-to-date storm costs than 
the prior year; and

•	Additional earnings from incremental investments in Atlantic Coast 

Pipeline, LLC (ACP) and Sabal Trail natural gas pipelines.

Year Ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015

Duke Energy’s full-year 2016 GAAP Reported EPS was $3.11 compared 
to $4.05 for full-year 2015. GAAP Reported EPS was lower primarily due to a 
$0.93 loss on sale of the International business, which has been presented as 
discontinued operations. Duke Energy also recorded $0.40 of after-tax costs to 
achieve the Piedmont merger in 2016, including losses on interest rate swaps 
related to the acquisition financing. See Note 2, “Acquisitions and Dispositions,” 
for additional information on the Piedmont and International transactions.

As discussed, management also evaluates financial performance based on 
adjusted earnings. Duke Energy’s full-year 2016 adjusted diluted EPS was $4.69 
compared to $4.54 for full-year 2015. The variance in adjusted diluted EPS was 
primarily due to:

•	More favorable weather in 2016 compared to 2015;

•	Increased retail revenues from pricing and riders, including energy 

efficiency programs;

•	Strong operations and maintenance cost control at Electric Utilities and 

Infrastructure; and

•	Piedmont’s earnings contribution subsequent to the acquisition in 

October 2016.

Year Ended December 31, 2017, as Compared to 2016 

Partially offset by:

Electric Utilities and Infrastructure’s results were impacted by the Tax Act, 
growth from investments, lower operations and maintenance expense and higher 
weather-normal retail sales volumes, partially offset by less favorable weather, 
impairment charges due to regulatory settlements, increased depreciation and 
amortization, higher interest expense and higher property and other taxes. The 
following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.

Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:

•	a $292 million decrease in retail sales, net of fuel revenue, due to less 

favorable weather in the current year; and

•	a $235 million decrease in fuel revenues driven by lower retail sales 

volumes, lower fuel prices included in rates and changes in the 
generation mix.

35

•	a $364 million increase in rider revenues including increased revenues 

related to energy efficiency programs, Duke Energy Florida’s nuclear 
asset securitization, Midwest transmission and distribution capital 
investments and Duke Energy Indiana’s Edwardsport Integrated 
Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plant, as well as an increase in 
retail pricing due to base rate adjustments for Duke Energy Florida’s 
Osprey acquisition and Hines Chillers and the Duke Energy Progress 
South Carolina rate case;

•	an $86 million increase in weather-normal sales volumes to customers; and

•	a $26 million increase in other revenues primarily due to favorable 

transmission revenues.

PART IIOperating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:

•	a $160 million increase in impairment charges primarily due to the 
write-off of remaining unrecovered Levy Nuclear Project costs in the 
current year at Duke Energy Florida and the disallowance from rate 
base of certain projects at the Mayo and Sutton plants in the current 
year at Duke Energy Progress related to the partial settlement in the 
North Carolina rate case;

•	a $113 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense 

primarily due to additional plant in service; and

•	a $58 million increase in property and other taxes primarily due to 

higher property taxes.

Partially offset by:

•	a $101 million increase in retail sales, net of fuel revenue, due to 

favorable weather compared to the prior year; and

•	a $76 million increase in wholesale power revenues primarily due to 
additional volumes and capacity charges for customers served under 
long-term contracts, including the NCEMPA wholesale contract.

Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:

•	a $713 million decrease in fuel expense (including purchased power 

and natural gas purchases for resale) primarily due to lower natural gas 
and coal prices, and lower volumes of coal and oil, partially offset by 
higher volumes of natural gas; and

•	an $85 million decrease in pretax impairment charges in the prior year 

primarily due to the 2015 Edwardsport IGCC settlement.

•	a $216 million decrease in fuel expense (including purchased power) 

primarily due to lower retail sales and changes in the generation mix; and 

Partially offset by:

•	a $162 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily 

due to additional plant in service, including the additional ownership 
interest in generating assets acquired from NCEMPA, as well as the 
expiration of the North Carolina cost of removal decrement rider; and

•	a $154 million increase in operations and maintenance expense 

primarily due to higher environmental and operational costs that are 
recoverable in rates, increased employee benefit costs, and higher 
storm restoration costs, partially offset by lower costs due to effective 
cost control efforts.

Other Income and Expenses. The variance was primarily driven by 

higher AFUDC equity.

Interest Expense. The variance was due to higher debt outstanding in 

the current year.

Income Tax Expense. The variance was primarily due to an increase in 
pretax income. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016, 
and 2015 were 35.5 percent and 36.2 percent, respectively.

Matters Impacting Future Electric Utilities and Infrastructure Results

An order from regulatory authorities disallowing recovery of costs related 

to closure of ash impoundments could have an adverse impact on Electric 
Utilities and Infrastructure’s financial position, results of operations and 
cash flows. See Note 4 and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
“Regulatory Matters” and “Asset Retirement Obligations,” respectively, for 
additional information.

On May 18, 2016, the North Carolina Department of Environmental 

Quality (NCDEQ) issued proposed risk classifications for all coal ash surface 
impoundments in North Carolina. All ash impoundments not previously 
designated as high priority by the North Carolina Coal Ash Management 
Act of 2014 (Coal Ash Act) were designated as intermediate risk. Certain 
impoundments classified as intermediate risk, however, may be reassessed in 
the future as low risk pursuant to legislation enacted on July 14, 2016. Electric 
Utilities and Infrastructure’s estimated asset retirement obligations (AROs) 
related to the closure of North Carolina ash impoundments are based upon 
the mandated closure method or a probability weighting of potential closure 

•	a $96 million decrease in operation, maintenance and other expense 
primarily due to lower plant outage, storm restoration and labor and 
benefits costs partially offset by higher operational costs that are 
recoverable in rates.

Interest Expense. The variance was due to higher debt outstanding in 

the current year and Duke Energy Florida’s Crystal River 3 (CR3) regulatory 
asset debt return ending in June 2016 upon securitization.

Income Tax Expense. The variance was primarily due to a decrease in 

pretax income and the impact of the Tax Act. The effective tax rates for the years 
ended December 31, 2017, and 2016 were 29.7 percent and 35.5 percent, 
respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the 
impact of the Tax Act. See the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act section above for additional 
information on the Tax Act.

Year Ended December 31, 2016, as Compared to 2015 

Electric Utilities and Infrastructure’s higher earnings were primarily due to 
increased pricing and rider revenues, favorable weather, a prior year impairment 
charge associated with the 2015 Edwardsport IGCC settlement and an increase 
in wholesale power margins. These impacts were partially offset by increased 
depreciation and amortization expense, higher interest expense and higher 
operations and maintenance expense. The following is a detailed discussion of 
the variance drivers by line item.

Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:

•	a $768 million decrease in fuel revenues driven by lower fuel prices 

included in rates.

Partially offset by:

•	a $414 million increase in rider revenues including increased revenues 
related to energy efficiency programs, the additional ownership interest 
in generating assets acquired from NCEMPA in the third quarter of 2015 
and increased revenues related to Duke Energy Indiana’s clean coal 
equipment, and increased retail electric pricing primarily due to the 
expiration of the North Carolina cost of removal decrement rider; 

36

PART IImethods for the impoundments that may be reassessed to low risk. As the 
final risk ranking classifications in North Carolina are delineated, final closure 
plans and corrective action measures are developed and approved for each 
site, the closure work progresses and the closure method scope and remedial 
methods are determined, the complexity of work and the amount of coal 
combustion material could be different than originally estimated and, therefore, 
could materially impact Electric Utilities and Infrastructure’s financial position. 
See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Asset Retirement 
Obligations,” for additional information.

Duke Energy is a party to multiple lawsuits and could be subject to fines 
and other penalties related to operations at certain North Carolina facilities with 
ash basins. The outcome of these lawsuits and potential fines and penalties 
could have an adverse impact on Electric Utilities and Infrastructure’s financial 
position, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 5 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, “Commitments and Contingencies,” for additional 
information.

In the fourth quarter of 2016, Hurricane Matthew caused historic flooding, 

extensive damage and widespread power outages within the Duke Energy 
Progress service territory. Duke Energy Progress filed a petition with the North 
Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) requesting an accounting order to defer 
incremental operation and maintenance and capital costs incurred in response 
to Hurricane Matthew and other significant 2016 storms. The NCUC will address 
this request in Duke Energy Progress’ currently pending rate case. A final 
order from the NCUC that disallows the deferral and future recovery of all or 
a significant portion of the incremental storm restoration costs incurred could 
result in an adverse impact on Electric Utilities and Infrastructure’s financial 
position, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters,” for additional information.

Duke Energy has several rate cases pending. Duke Energy Kentucky filed 

an electric rate case with the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC) 

on September 1, 2017, to recover costs of capital investments in generation, 
transmission and distribution systems and to recover other incremental 
expenses since its previous rate case. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy 
Progress filed general rate cases with the NCUC on August 25, 2017, and June 
1, 2017, respectively, to recover costs of complying with Coal Combustion 
Residuals (CCR) regulations and the Coal Ash Act, as well as costs of capital 
investments in generation, transmission and distribution systems and any 
increase in expenditures subsequent to previous rate cases. In March 2017, 
Duke Energy Ohio filed an electric distribution base rate case application and 
supporting testimony with the Public Utility Commission of Ohio (PUCO). Electric 
Utilities and Infrastructure’s earnings could be impacted adversely if these 
rate increases are delayed or denied by the KPSC, NCUC or PUCO. See Note 4 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters,” for additional 
information.

On August 29, 2017, Duke Energy Florida filed a 2017 Second Revised 

and Restated Settlement Agreement (2017 Settlement) with the FPSC. On 
November 20, 2017, the FPSC issued an order to approve the 2017 Settlement. 
See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters,” for 
additional information about the 2017 Settlement. In accordance with the 2017 
Settlement, Duke Energy Florida will not seek recovery of any costs associated 
with the ongoing Westinghouse contract litigation, which is currently being 
appealed. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Commitments 
and Contingencies,” for additional information about the litigation. An 
unfavorable appeals ruling on that matter could have an adverse impact on 
Electric Utilities and Infrastructure’s financial position, results of operations and 
cash flows.

37

PART IIYear Ended December 31, 2017, as Compared to 2016

Partially offset by:

Gas Utilities and Infrastructure’s higher results were primarily due to the 
inclusion of Piedmont’s earnings in the current year as a result of Duke Energy’s 
acquisition of Piedmont on October 3, 2016, as well as additional equity 
earnings from investments in the ACP and Sabal Trail pipelines.

•	a $38 million decrease in the cost of natural gas, primarily due 
to decreased volumes and lower natural gas prices for Midwest 
operations.

Other Income and Expenses. The increase was driven primarily by 

higher equity earnings from pipeline investments.

Interest Expense. The variance was primarily due to the inclusion of 

Piedmont’s interest expenses beginning in October 2016.

Income Tax Expense. The variance was primarily due to an increase in 
pretax income. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016, 
and 2015 were 37.2 percent and 37.6 percent, respectively.

Matters Impacting Future Gas Utilities and Infrastructure Results

Gas Utilities and Infrastructure has a 24 percent ownership interest in 

Constitution Pipeline Company, LLC (Constitution), a natural gas pipeline project 
slated to transport natural gas supplies to major northeastern markets. On 
April 22, 2016, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation 
denied Constitution’s application for a necessary water quality certification 
for the New York portion of the Constitution pipeline. Constitution has stopped 
construction and discontinued capitalization of future development costs until 
the project’s uncertainty is resolved. As a result of the permitting delays and 
project uncertainty, total anticipated contributions by Duke Energy can no longer 
be reasonably estimated. To the extent the legal and regulatory proceedings 
have unfavorable outcomes, or if Constitution concludes that the project is 
not viable or does not go forward, an impairment charge of up to the recorded 
investment in the project, net of salvage value and any cash and working 
capital returned, may be recorded. Due to the FERC’s January 2018 ruling and 
the resulting increase in uncertainty, Duke Energy is evaluating the potential to 
recognize a pretax impairment charge on its investment in Constitution during 
the first quarter of 2018 of up to the current carrying amount of the investment, 
net of salvage value and any cash and working capital returned. With the project 
on hold, funding of project costs has ceased until resolution of legal actions. At 
December 31, 2017, Duke Energy’s investment in Constitution was $81 million. 
See Note 4 and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory 
Matters,” and “Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates,” respectively, for 
additional information.

Gas Utilities and Infrastructure has a 47 percent ownership interest 
in ACP, which is building an approximately 600-mile interstate natural gas 
pipeline intended to transport diverse natural gas supplies into southeastern 
markets. Affected states (West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina) have 
issued certain necessary permits; the project remains subject to other pending 
federal and state approvals, which will allow full construction activities to 
begin. In early 2018, the FERC issued series of Partial Notices to Proceed which 
authorized the project to begin limited construction-related activities along the 
pipeline route. The project has a targeted in-service date of late 2019. Due to 
delays in obtaining the required permits to commence construction and the 
conditions imposed upon the project by the permits, ACP’s project manager 
estimates the project pipeline development costs have increased from a range 
of $5.0 billion to $5.5 billion to a range of $6.0 billion to $6.5 billion, excluding 
financing costs. Project construction activities, schedule and final costs are still 
subject to uncertainty due to potential additional permitting delays, construction 
productivity and other conditions and risks that could result in potential higher 
project costs and a potential delay in the targeted in-service date. See Note 4 

Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:

•	an $884 million increase in operating revenues due to the inclusion of 

Piedmont’s operating revenues beginning in October 2016; and

•	a $47 million increase in Piedmont’s fourth quarter results due to colder 
weather, higher natural gas prices, Integrity Management Rider (IMR) rate 
adjustments, customer growth and new power generation customers.

Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:

•	a $686 million increase in operating expenses due to the inclusion of 

Piedmont’s operating expenses beginning in October 2016; and

•	a $34 million increase in Piedmont’s fourth quarter results primarily 

due to higher natural gas costs passed through to customers due to the 
higher price per dekatherm of natural gas.

Other Income and Expenses. The increase was driven primarily by 

higher equity earnings from pipeline investments.

Interest Expense. The variance was primarily due to the inclusion of 

Piedmont’s interest expense beginning in October 2016.

Income Tax Expense. The variance was primarily due to an increase in 
pretax income due to the inclusion of Piedmont’s earnings beginning in October 
2016, partially offset by prior period true-ups. The effective tax rates for the 
years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016 were 26.7 percent and 37.2 percent, 
respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the prior 
period true-ups and the impact of the Tax Act. See the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
section above for additional information on the Tax Act.

Year Ended December 31, 2016, as Compared to 2015 

Gas Utilities and Infrastructure’s higher results were primarily due to the 
inclusion of Piedmont’s earnings subsequent to the merger on October 3, 2016, 
and higher equity earnings from pipeline investments. Piedmont’s earnings 
included in Gas Utilities and Infrastructure’s results were $67 million for the 
year ended December 31, 2016.

Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:

•	a $398 million increase in operating revenues due to the inclusion of 

Piedmont’s operating revenues beginning in October 2016,

Partially offset by:

•	a $38 million decrease in fuel revenues driven by lower natural gas 

prices and decreased sales volumes for Midwest operations.

Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:

•	 a $276 million increase in operating expenses due to the inclusion of 

Piedmont’s operating expenses beginning in October 2016.

38

PART IIto the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters,” for additional 
information.

Rapidly rising interest rates without timely or adequate updates to the 

regulated allowed return on equity or failure to achieve the anticipated benefits 
of the Piedmont merger, including cost savings and growth targets, could 
significantly impact the estimated fair value of reporting units in Gas Utilities 

and Infrastructure. In the event of a significant decline in the estimated fair 
value of the reporting units, goodwill impairment charges could be recorded. 
The carrying value of goodwill within Gas Utilities and Infrastructure was 
approximately $1,924 million at December 31, 2017.

Year Ended December 31, 2017, as Compared to 2016

Commercial Renewables’ higher earnings were primarily due to the Tax 
Act, partially offset by pretax impairment charges. The following is a detailed 
discussion of the variance drivers by line item.

Operating Revenues. The decrease was primarily due to lower 
engineering, procurement and construction revenues from REC Solar, a 
California-based provider of solar installations acquired by Duke Energy in 2015.

Operating Expenses. The increase was primarily due to $99 million in 
pretax impairment charges in the current year related to a wholly owned non-
contracted wind project and other investments and higher expenses associated 
with new wind and solar projects, partially offset by lower operations and 
maintenance expense at REC Solar due to fewer projects under construction. 
See Notes 10 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Property, 
Plant and Equipment” and “Goodwill and Intangible Assets,” respectively, for 
additional information.

Other Income and Expenses. The variance was primarily due to a $71 

million pretax impairment charge in the prior year related to certain equity 
method investments. For additional information, see Note 12 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, “Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates.”

Interest Expense. The variance was primarily due to new project 

financings and less capitalized interest due to fewer projects under construction.

Income Tax Benefit. The variance was primarily due to the impact of 
the Tax Act and higher production tax credits (PTCs), partially offset by lower 
investment tax credits (ITCs). See the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act section above for 
additional information on the Tax Act and the impact on the effective tax rate.

Year Ended December 31, 2016, as Compared to 2015 

Commercial Renewables’ lower earnings were primarily due to an 
impairment charge related to certain equity method investments in wind 
projects, partially offset by new wind and solar generation placed in service and 
improved wind production. The following is a detailed discussion of variance 
drivers by line item.

Operating Revenues. The variance was primarily due to a $135 million 
increase due to growth of REC Solar and a $66 million increase from new wind 
and solar generation placed in service and improved wind production.

Operating Expenses. The variance was primarily due to a $130 million 

increase in operating expenses due to growth of REC Solar and a $36 million increase 
in operating expenses due to new wind and solar generation placed in service.

Other Income and Expenses. The variance was due to a $71 million 

pretax impairment charge related to certain equity method investments in wind 
projects. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Investments in 
Unconsolidated Affiliates,” for additional information.

PART IIIncome Tax Benefit. The variance was primarily due to a decrease in 

pretax income and the impact of PTCs for the renewables portfolio.

Matters Impacting Future Commercial Renewables Results

Changes or variability in assumptions used in calculating the fair value 
of the Commercial Renewables reporting units for goodwill testing purposes, 
including but not limited to legislative actions related to tax credit extensions, 
long-term growth rates and discount rates could significantly impact the 
estimated fair value of the Commercial Renewables reporting units. In the

Other’s higher net expense was driven by the Tax Act, partially offset 
by prior year losses on forward-starting interest rate swaps and other costs 
related to the Piedmont acquisition, decreased severance expenses, prior year 
donations to the Duke Energy Foundation and insurance proceeds resulting from 
settlement of the shareholder litigation related to the Progress Energy merger. 
The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.

Operating Revenues. The increase was primarily due to higher OVEC 
(Ohio Valley Electric Corporation) revenues and prior year customer credits 
related to Piedmont merger commitments. See Note 2 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, “Acquisitions and Dispositions,” for additional information.

Operating Expenses. The decrease was primarily due to lower 

transaction and integration costs associated with the Piedmont acquisition, prior 
year severance expenses related to cost savings initiatives, donations to the 
Duke Energy Foundation in 2016 as well as prior year depreciation expense and 
other integration costs related to the Progress Energy merger. The Duke Energy 
Foundation is a nonprofit organization funded by Duke Energy shareholders 
that makes charitable contributions to selected nonprofits and government 
subdivisions.

Other Income and Expenses. The increase was primarily driven by 
insurance proceeds resulting from settlement of the shareholder litigation 
related to the Progress Energy merger, higher earnings from the equity method 
investment in NMC and increased returns on investments that fund certain 
employee benefit obligations.

40

event of a significant decline in the estimated fair value of the Commercial 
Renewables reporting units, goodwill or other asset impairment charges could 
be recorded. The carrying value of goodwill within Commercial Renewables was 
approximately $93 million at December 31, 2017.

Persistently low market pricing for wind resources, primarily in the 

Electric Reliability Council of Texas West market and the future expiration of tax 
incentives including ITCs and PTCs could result in adverse impacts to the future 
results of Commercial Renewables.

Interest Expense. The decrease was primarily due to prior year losses 

on forward-starting interest rate swaps related to Piedmont pre-acquisition 
financing, partially offset by higher interest costs on $3.75 billion of debt 
issued in August 2016 to fund the acquisition. For additional information see 
Notes 2, 6 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Acquisitions and 
Dispositions,” “Debt and Credit Facilities” and “Derivatives and Hedging,” 
respectively.

Income Tax Benefit. The variance was primarily due to the impact of 

the Tax Act and a decrease in pretax loss. See the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act section 
above for additional information on the Tax Act and the impact on the effective 
tax rate.

Year Ended December 31, 2016, as Compared to 2015 

Other’s higher net expense was driven by costs related to the Piedmont 
acquisition, higher charitable donations and higher interest expense related to 
the Piedmont acquisition financing. The following is a detailed discussion of the 
variance drivers by line item.

Operating Revenues. The decrease was primarily due to customer 
credits recorded related to Piedmont merger commitments. See Note 2 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Acquisitions and Dispositions,” for 
additional information.

PART IIOperating Expenses. The increase was primarily due to transaction 

and integration costs associated with the Piedmont acquisition and increased 
donations to the Duke Energy Foundation, partially offset by a decrease in 
severance accruals.

Other Income and Expenses. The variance was primarily due to lower 

earnings from NMC, partially offset by higher returns on investments that 
support employee benefit obligations.

Interest Expense. The increase was primarily due to Piedmont 

acquisition financing, including bridge facility costs and losses on forward-
starting interest rate swaps. For additional information see Notes 2 and 14 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Acquisitions and Dispositions” and 
“Derivatives and Hedging,” respectively.

Income Tax Benefit. The variance was primarily due to an increase in 

pretax losses, partially offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate. The effective 
tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015 were 41.2 percent 
and 47.5 percent, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was 
primarily due to the benefit from legal entity restructuring recorded in 2015.

Matters Impacting Future Other Results

Included in Other is Duke Energy Ohio’s 9 percent ownership interest 

in the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (OVEC), which owns 2,256 MW of 
coal-fired generation capacity. As a counterparty to an inter-company 
power agreement (ICPA), Duke Energy Ohio has a contractual arrangement 
to receive entitlements to capacity and energy from OVEC’s power plants 
through June 2040 commensurate with its power participation ratio, which 
is equivalent to Duke Energy Ohio’s ownership interest. Costs, including fuel, 
operating expenses, fixed costs, debt amortization and interest expense, 
are allocated to counterparties to the ICPA, including Duke Energy Ohio, 
based on their power participation ratio. The value of the ICPA is subject to 
variability due to fluctuations in power prices and changes in OVEC’s costs 
of business. Deterioration in the credit quality or bankruptcy of one or more 
parties to the ICPA could increase the costs of OVEC. In addition, certain 
proposed environmental rulemaking costs could result in future increased cost 
allocations. For information on Duke Energy’s regulatory filings related to OVEC, 
see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters.”

The retired Beckjord generating station (Beckjord), a nonregulated facility 
retired during 2014, is not subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) rule related to the disposal of CCR from electric utilities. However, if 
costs are incurred as a result of environmental regulations or to mitigate risk 
associated with on-site storage of coal ash, the costs could have an adverse 
impact on Other’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

SUBSIDIARY REGISTRANTS

As a result of the Tax Act, the Subsidiary Registrants revalued their 

deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, as of December 31, 2017, to 
account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates on these deferred 
tax amounts. For the Subsidiary Registrants regulated operations, where 
the reduction is expected to be returned to customers in future rates, the 
remeasurement has been deferred as a regulatory liability. See Note 4 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters” for additional 
information on the Tax Act’s impact to the regulatory asset and liability 

accounts. The FERC and state utility commissions will determine the regulatory 
treatment of the impacts of the Tax Act for the Subsidiary Registrants.  
The Subsidiary Registrants’ future results of operations, financial condition 
and cash flows could be adversely impacted by the Tax Act, subsequent 
amendments or corrections, or the actions of the FERC, state utility 
commissions or credit rating agencies related to the Tax Act. The change in each 
Subsidiary Registrant’s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017, 
was primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act, unless noted below.

Matters Impacting Future Results

An order from regulatory authorities disallowing recovery of costs related 
to closure of ash impoundments could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy 
Carolinas’ financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Notes 
4 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters” and 
“Asset Retirement Obligations,” respectively, for additional information.

On May 18, 2016, the NCDEQ issued proposed risk classifications for 
all coal ash surface impoundments in North Carolina. All ash impoundments 
not previously designated as high priority by the Coal Ash Act were designated 
as intermediate risk. Certain impoundments classified as intermediate risk, 
however, may be reassessed in the future as low risk pursuant to legislation 
enacted on July 14, 2016. Duke Energy Carolinas’ estimated AROs related to 
the closure of North Carolina ash impoundments are based upon the mandated 
closure method or a probability weighting of potential closure methods for 
the impoundments that may be reassessed to low risk. As the final risk 
ranking classifications in North Carolina are delineated, final closure plans 
and corrective action measures are developed and approved for each site, 
the closure work progresses, and the closure method scope and remedial 
action methods are determined, the complexity of work and the amount of coal 
combustion material could be different than originally estimated and, therefore, 
could materially impact Duke Energy Carolinas’ financial position. See Note 9 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Asset Retirement Obligations,” for 
additional information.

Duke Energy Carolinas is a party to multiple lawsuits and subject to 

fines and other penalties related to operations at certain North Carolina 
facilities with ash basins. The outcome of these lawsuits, fines and penalties 
could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Carolinas’ financial position, 
results of operations and cash flows. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, “Commitments and Contingencies,” for additional information.

Duke Energy Carolinas filed a general rate case on August 25, 2017, to 
recover costs of complying with CCR regulations and the Coal Ash Act, as well 
as costs of capital investments in generation, transmission and distribution 
systems and any increase in expenditures subsequent to previous rate cases. 
Duke Energy Carolinas’ earnings could be adversely impacted if the rate 
increase is delayed or denied by the NCUC.

Within this Item 7, see the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act above as well as 

Liquidity and Capital Resources below for risks associated with the Tax Act.

Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:

•	a $179 million decrease in retail sales, net of fuel revenues, due to less 

favorable weather in the current year. 

Partially offset by:

•	a $74 million increase in rider revenues and retail pricing primarily 

related to energy efficiency programs; 

•	a $41 million increase in weather-normal sales volumes to retail 

customers, net of fuel revenues; 

•	a $30 million increase in fuel revenues primarily due to changes in 

generation mix partially offset by lower retail sales; and

•	a $7 million increase in wholesale power revenues, net of sharing and 
fuel, primarily due to additional volumes for customers served under 
long-term contracts.

Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:

•	a $145 million decrease in operations, maintenance and other 

expense primarily due to lower expenses at generating plants, lower 
costs associated with merger commitments related to the Piedmont 
acquisition in 2016, lower severance expenses, and lower employee 
benefit costs, partially offset by higher energy efficiency program costs.

Partially offset by:

•	a $25 million increase in fuel expense (including purchased power) 
primarily due to changes in generation mix, partially offset by lower 
retail sales; and

•	a $15 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense 

primarily due to additional plant in service, partially offset by lower 
amortization of certain regulatory assets.

Other Income and Expenses. The variance was primarily due to a 

decrease in recognition of post in-service equity returns for projects that had 
been completed prior to being reflected in customer rates.

Income Tax Expense. The variance was primarily due to an increase in 
pretax income and the impact of the Tax Act, offset by the impact of research 
credits and the manufacturing deduction. See the Subsidiary Registrants section 
above for additional information on the Tax Act and the impact on the effective 
tax rate.

Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:

•	a $231 million decrease in fuel revenues primarily due to lower retail 

sales and changes in generation mix at Duke Energy Progress; and

•	an $87 million decrease in retail sales, net of fuel revenues, due to less 

favorable weather in the current year.

Partially offset by:

•	a $108 million increase in retail pricing primarily due to Duke Energy 

Florida’s base rate adjustment for the Osprey Acquisition and the 
completion of the Hines Energy Complex Chiller Uprate Project, as well 
as the Duke Energy Progress South Carolina rate case;

•	a $76 million increase in rider revenues related to energy efficiency 

programs at Duke Energy Progress, as well as nuclear asset 
securitization beginning in July 2016 and extended uprate project 
revenues beginning in 2017 at Duke Energy Florida; and

•	a $51 million increase in weather-normal sales volumes to retail 

customers.

Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:

•	a $227 million decrease in fuel expense and purchased power primarily 
due to lower retail sales and changes in generation mix at Duke Energy 
Progress; and

•	a $166 million decrease in operations, maintenance and other expense 
primarily due to lower plant outage, storm restoration and labor costs. 

Partially offset by:

•	a $149 million increase in impairment charges primarily due to the 
write-off of remaining unrecovered Levy Nuclear Project costs in the 
current year at Duke Energy Florida and the disallowance from rate 
base of certain projects at the Mayo and Sutton plants in the current 
year at Duke Energy Progress related to the partial settlement in the 
North Carolina rate case; and

•	a $72 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense 

primarily due to additional plant in service, as well as nuclear 
regulatory asset amortization at Duke Energy Florida.

Interest Expense. The variance was due to higher debt outstanding, as 
well as interest charges on North Carolina fuel over collections at Duke Energy 
Progress and lower debt returns driven by the CR3 regulatory asset debt return 
ending in June 2016 upon securitization at Duke Energy Florida.

Income Tax Expense. The variance was primarily due to the impact 
of the Tax Act. See the Subsidiary Registrants section above for additional 
information on the Tax Act and the impact on the effective tax rate.

Matters Impacting Future Results

An order from regulatory authorities disallowing recovery of costs related 

to closure of ash impoundments could have an adverse impact on Progress 

44

PART IIEnergy’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Notes 
4 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters” and 
“Asset Retirement Obligations,” respectively, for additional information.

On May 18, 2016, the NCDEQ issued proposed risk classifications for 
all coal ash surface impoundments in North Carolina. All ash impoundments 
not previously designated as high priority by the Coal Ash Act were designated 
as intermediate risk. Certain impoundments classified as intermediate risk, 
however, may be reassessed in the future as low risk pursuant to legislation 
enacted on July 14, 2016. Progress Energy’s estimated AROs related to the 
closure of North Carolina ash impoundments are based upon the mandated 
closure method or a probability weighting of potential closure methods for 
the impoundments that may be reassessed to low risk. As the final risk 
ranking classifications in North Carolina are delineated, final closure plans 
and corrective action measures are developed and approved for each site, 
the closure work progresses, and the closure method scope and remedial 
action methods are determined, the complexity of work and the amount of coal 
combustion material could be different than originally estimated and, therefore, 
could materially impact Progress Energy’s financial position. See Note 9 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Asset Retirement Obligations,” for 
additional information.

Duke Energy Progress is a party to multiple lawsuits and subject to fines 
and other penalties related to operations at certain North Carolina facilities with 
ash basins. The outcome of these lawsuits, fines and penalties could have an 
adverse impact on Progress Energy’s financial position, results of operations 
and cash flows. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
“Commitments and Contingencies,” for additional information.

In the fourth quarter of 2016, Hurricane Matthew caused historic flooding, 

extensive damage and widespread power outages within the Duke Energy 
Progress service territory. Duke Energy Progress filed a petition with the North 

Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) requesting an accounting order to defer 
incremental operation and maintenance and capital costs incurred in response 
to Hurricane Matthew and other significant 2016 storms. The NCUC will address 
this request in Duke Energy Progress’ currently pending rate case. A final 
order from the NCUC that disallows the deferral and future recovery of all or 
a significant portion of the incremental storm restoration costs incurred could 
result in an adverse impact on Electric Utilities and Infrastructure’s financial 
position, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters,” for additional information.

Duke Energy Progress filed a general rate case with the NCUC on June 1, 
2017. Duke Energy Progress will seek to recover costs of complying with CCR 
regulations and the Coal Ash Act, as well as costs of capital investments 
in generation, transmission and distribution systems and any increase in 
expenditures subsequent to previous rate cases. Progress Energy’s earnings could 
be adversely impacted if the rate increase is delayed or denied by the NCUC.
On August 29, 2017, Duke Energy Florida filed the 2017 Settlement 

with the FPSC. On November 20, 2017, the FPSC issued an order to approve 
the 2017 Settlement. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
“Regulatory Matters,” for additional information about the 2017 Settlement. In 
accordance with the 2017 Settlement, Duke Energy Florida will not seek 
recovery of any costs associated with the ongoing Westinghouse contract 
litigation, which is currently being appealed. See Note 5 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, “Commitments and Contingencies” for additional 
information about the litigation. An unfavorable appeals ruling on that matter

Year Ended December 31, 2017, as Compared to 2016 

Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:

•	a $238 million decrease in fuel revenues due to lower retail sales and 

changes in generation mix; and 

•	a $37 million decrease in retail sales, net of fuel revenues, due to less 

favorable weather in the current year, partially offset by lower lost 
revenues related to hurricanes in the current year. 

Partially offset by:

•	a $40 million increase in rider revenues primarily due to energy 

efficiency programs;

•	a $38 million increase in retail sales due to the South Carolina rate 

case; and

•	a $31 million increase in wholesale power revenues, net of fuel, 

primarily due to higher peak demand.

Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:

•	a $221 million decrease in fuel used in electric generation and 

purchased power primarily due to lower retail sales and changes in 
generation mix; and

•	a $115 million decrease in operation, maintenance and other expense 
primarily due to lower nuclear outage costs and lower storm restoration 
costs. 

Partially offset by:

•	a $22 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense 

primarily due to additional plant in service; and

•	an $18 million increase in impairment charges primarily due to the 

disallowance from rate base of certain projects at the Mayo and Sutton 
plants in the current year related to the partial settlement in the North 
Carolina rate case.

Interest Expense. The variance was due to higher debt outstanding, as 

well as interest charges on North Carolina fuel overcollections.

Income Tax Expense. The variance was primarily due to the impact of 
the Tax Act and lower North Carolina corporate tax rates, partially offset by an 
increase in pretax net income. See the Subsidiary Registrants section above for 
additional information on the Tax Act and the impact on the effective tax rate.

Progress’ financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Notes 
4 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters” and 
“Asset Retirement Obligations,” respectively, for additional information.

On May 18, 2016, the NCDEQ issued proposed risk classifications for 
all coal ash surface impoundments in North Carolina. All ash impoundments 
not previously designated as high priority by the Coal Ash Act were designated 
as intermediate risk. Certain impoundments classified as intermediate risk, 
however, may be reassessed in the future as low risk pursuant to legislation 
enacted on July 14, 2016. Duke Energy Progress’ estimated AROs related to the 
closure of North Carolina ash impoundments are based upon the mandated 
closure method or a probability weighting of potential closure methods for 
the impoundments that may be reassessed to low risk. As the final risk 
ranking classifications in North Carolina are delineated, final closure plans 
and corrective action measures are developed and approved for each site, 
the closure work progresses, and the closure method scope and remedial 
action methods are determined, the complexity of work and the amount of coal 
combustion material could be different than originally estimated and, therefore, 
could materially impact Duke Energy Progress’ financial position. See Note 9 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Asset Retirement Obligations,” for 
additional information.

Duke Energy Progress is a party to multiple lawsuits and subject to 
fines and other penalties related to operations at certain North Carolina 
facilities with ash basins. The outcome of these lawsuits, fines and penalties 
could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Progress’ financial position, 
results of operations and cash flows. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, “Commitments and Contingencies,” for additional information.

In the fourth quarter of 2016, Hurricane Matthew caused historic flooding, 

extensive damage and widespread power outages within the Duke Energy 
Progress service territory. Duke Energy Progress filed a petition with the North 
Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) requesting an accounting order to defer 
incremental operation and maintenance and capital costs incurred in response 
to Hurricane Matthew and other significant 2016 storms. The NCUC will address 
this request in Duke Energy Progress’ currently pending rate case. A final 
order from the NCUC that disallows the deferral and future recovery of all or 
a significant portion of the incremental storm restoration costs incurred could 
result in an adverse impact on Electric Utilities and Infrastructure’s financial 
position, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters,” for additional information.

Duke Energy Progress filed a general rate case with the NCUC on June 1, 
2017. Duke Energy Progress will seek to recover costs of complying with CCR 
regulations and the Coal Ash Act, as well as costs of capital investments 
in generation, transmission and distribution systems and any increase in 
expenditures subsequent to previous rate cases. Duke Energy Progress’ earnings 
could be adversely impacted if the rate increase is delayed or denied by the 
NCUC. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory 
Matters,” for additional information.

Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:

•	a $70 million increase in retail pricing primarily due to the base rate 

adjustment for the Osprey acquisition and the completion of the Hines 
Energy Complex Chiller Uprate Project; 

•	a $45 million increase in weather-normal sales volumes to retail 

customers in the current year; and

•	a $36 million increase in rider revenues primarily due to nuclear asset 
securitization beginning in July 2016 and extended power uprate project 
revenues beginning in 2017.

Partially offset by:

•	a $50 million decrease in retail sales, net of fuel revenues, due to less 
favorable weather in the current year, including lost revenues related to 
Hurricane Irma; and

•	a $34 million decrease in wholesale power revenues primarily due to 

contracts that expired in the prior year.

47

Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:

•	a $132 million increase in impairment charges primarily due to the 
write-off of remaining unrecovered Levy Nuclear Project costs in the 
current year; and

•	a $51 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense 
primarily due to nuclear regulatory asset amortization, as well as 
additional plant in service.

Partially offset by:

•	a $47 million decrease in operations and maintenance expense 

primarily due to lower planned outage costs, lower severance expenses 
and lower employee benefit costs, partially offset by higher storm 
restoration costs in the current year.

Other Income and Expenses. The variance was primarily driven by 

higher AFUDC equity.

PART IIInterest Expense. The variance was primarily due to higher debt 

outstanding and lower debt returns driven by the Crystal River Unit 3 regulatory 
asset debt return ending in June 2016 upon securitization.

Income Tax Expense. The variance was primarily due to the impact of the 
Tax Act and lower pretax earnings. See the Subsidiary Registrants section above 
for additional information on the Tax Act and the impact on the effective tax rate.

Matters Impacting Future Results

On August 29, 2017, Duke Energy Florida filed the 2017 Settlement 

with the FPSC. On November 20, 2017, the FPSC issued an order to approve 

the 2017 Settlement. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
“Regulatory Matters,” for additional information about the 2017 Settlement. In 
accordance with the 2017 Settlement, Duke Energy Florida will not seek 
recovery of any costs associated with the ongoing Westinghouse contract 
litigation, which is currently being appealed. See Note 5 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, “Commitments and Contingencies” for additional 
information about the litigation. An unfavorable appeals ruling on that matter 
could have an adverse impact on Electric Utilities and Infrastructure’s financial 
position, results of operations and cash flows.

PART IIYear Ended December 31, 2017, as Compared to 2016 

Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:

•	a $69 million decrease in fuel revenues primarily due to lower electric 
fuel costs and a decrease in electric and natural gas sales volumes; 
and

•	a $16 million decrease in electric retail sales, net of fuel revenues, due 

to less favorable weather in the current year.

Partially offset by:

•	a $38 million increase in rider revenues primarily due to growth in 
energy efficiency programs and a rate increase for the distribution 
capital investment rider, partially offset by a decrease in the percentage 
of income payment plan rider due to a rate decrease;

•	a $10 million increase in PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) transmission 

revenues;

•	a $9 million increase in other revenues related to OVEC; and

•	a $6 million increase in non-native sales for resale.

Operating Expenses. The variance was driven by:

•	a $66 million decrease in fuel expense, primarily due to lower sales 

volumes and lower electric fuel costs.

Partially offset by:

•	a $28 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense due to 
additional plant in service and a true-up related to SmartGrid assets in 
the prior year;

•	a $20 million increase in property and other taxes due to higher 

property taxes; and 

•	a $12 million increase in operations, maintenance and other expense 

primarily due to higher energy efficiency program costs and higher 
transmission and distribution operations costs; partially offset by lower 
fossil/hydro operations costs due to timing of outage schedules.

financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Notes 4 and 9 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters” and “Asset Retirement 
Obligations,” respectively, for additional information.

Duke Energy Ohio’s nonregulated Beckjord station, a facility retired during 
2014, is not subject to the EPA rule related to the disposal of CCR from electric 
utilities. However, if costs are incurred as a result of environmental regulations 
or to mitigate risk associated with on-site storage of coal ash at the facility, the 
costs could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Ohio’s financial position, 
results of operations and cash flows.

Duke Energy Ohio has a 9 percent ownership interest in OVEC, which owns 
2,256 MW of coal-fired generation capacity. As a counterparty to an ICPA, Duke 
Energy Ohio has a contractual arrangement to receive entitlements to capacity 
and energy from OVEC’s power plants through June 2040 commensurate with its 
power participation ratio, which is equivalent to Duke Energy Ohio’s ownership 
interest. Costs, including fuel, operating expenses, fixed costs, debt amortization 
and interest expense, are allocated to counterparties to the ICPA, including Duke 
Energy Ohio, based on their power participation ratio. The value of the ICPA is 
subject to variability due to fluctuations in power prices and changes in OVEC’s 
costs of business. Deterioration in the credit quality or bankruptcy of one or 
more parties to the ICPA could increase the costs of OVEC. In addition, certain 
proposed environmental rulemaking costs could result in future increased cost 
allocations.

On March 2, 2017, Duke Energy Ohio filed an electric distribution base 

rate application with the PUCO to address recovery of electric distribution 
system capital investments and any increase in expenditures subsequent to 
previous rate cases. The application also includes requests to continue certain 
current riders and establish new riders related to LED Outdoor Lighting Service 
and regulatory mandates. Duke Energy Ohio’s earnings could be adversely 
impacted if the rate case and requested riders are delayed or denied by the 
PUCO. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory 
Matters,” for additional information.

On September 1, 2017, Duke Energy Kentucky filed a base rate case with 

the KPSC to recover costs of capital investments in generation, transmission 
and distribution systems and to recover other incremental expenses since its 
last rate case filed in 2006. The application also includes request to establish 
new riders. Duke Energy Kentucky’s earnings could be adversely impacted if the 
rate increase is delayed or denied by the KPSC.

Within this Item 7, see the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act above as well as 

Liquidity and Capital Resources below for risks associated with the Tax Act.

Income Tax Expense. The variance was primarily due to the impact 
of the Tax Act. See the Subsidiary Registrants section above for additional 
information on the Tax Act and the impact on the effective tax rate.

DUKE ENERGY INDIANA

 Introduction

Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax. The variance was 
primarily driven by a prior year income tax benefit resulting from immaterial out 
of period deferred tax liability adjustments related to the Midwest Generation 
Disposal Group. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
“Acquisitions and Dispositions,” for additional information.

Matters Impacting Future Results

An order from regulatory authorities disallowing recovery of costs related 
to closure of ash basins could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Ohio’s

Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:

•	a $67 million increase in rate rider revenues primarily related to the 
Edwardsport IGCC plant, the Transmission, Distribution and Storage 
System Improvement Charge (TDSIC) and energy efficiency programs; 
and

•	a $48 million increase in fuel revenues primarily due to higher 

purchased power costs passed through to customers and higher 
financial transmission rights (FTR) revenues.

Partially offset by:

•	a $13 million decrease in retail sales due to less favorable weather in 

the current year; and

•	a $13 million decrease in wholesale power revenues, net of fuel, 

primarily due to a decrease in demand rates and contracts that expired 
in the current year.

Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:

•	a $57 million increase in fuel used in electric generation and purchased 

power expenses, primarily due to higher purchased power volumes, 
partially offset by favorable fuel prices;

•	an $18 million increase in property and other taxes primarily due to 

higher franchise taxes;

to the impairment of certain metering equipment not recoverable in 
customer rates.

 Partially offset by:

•	a $38 million decrease in depreciation and amortization primarily due 
to the recognition of certain asset retirement obligations in 2016 that 
were subsequently deferred in 2017, partially offset by new IGCC rates 
that result in a lower deferral amount and higher depreciation due to 
additional plant in service. 

Other Income and Expense. The variance was driven primarily by higher 

AFUDC equity.

Income Tax Expense. The variance was primarily due to the impact of 
the Tax Act and an increase in pretax income. See the Subsidiary Registrants 
section above for additional information on the Tax Act and the impact on the 
effective tax rate.

PART IIMatters Impacting Future Results

On April 17, 2015, the EPA published in the Federal Register a rule to 

regulate the disposal of CCR from electric utilities as solid waste. Duke Energy 
Indiana has interpreted the rule to identify the coal ash basin sites impacted 
and has assessed the amounts of coal ash subject to the rule and a method of 
compliance. Duke Energy Indiana’s interpretation of the requirements of the CCR 
rule is subject to potential legal challenges and further regulatory approvals, 
which could result in additional ash basin closure requirements, higher costs 
of compliance and greater AROs. Additionally, Duke Energy Indiana has retired 
facilities that are not subject to the CCR rule. Duke Energy Indiana may incur 
costs at these facilities to comply with environmental regulations or to mitigate 
risks associated with on-site storage of coal ash. An order from regulatory 
authorities disallowing recovery of costs related to closure of ash basins

could have an adverse impact on Duke Energy Indiana’s financial position, 
results of operations and cash flows. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, “Regulatory Matters,” for additional information.

In August 2016, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) 

approved a settlement agreement between Duke Energy Indiana and multiple 
parties that resolves all disputes, claims and issues from the IURC proceedings 
related to post-commercial operating performance and recovery of ongoing 
operating and capital costs at the Edwardsport IGCC generating facility. The 
settlement agreement imposed a cost cap for retail recoverable operations and 
maintenance costs through 2017. An inability to manage future operating costs 
may result in unfavorable orders that could have an adverse impact on Duke 
Energy Indiana’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

PART IIThe following table shows the percent changes in dekatherms delivered and average number of customers. The percentages for all throughput deliveries 

represent billed and unbilled sales. Amounts are not weather-normalized.

Increase (Decrease) over prior year
Residential deliveries
Commercial deliveries
Industrial deliveries
Power generation deliveries

Average number of customers

Piedmont’s throughput was 468,259,777 dekatherms and 495,122,794 
dekatherms for the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 
Due to the margin decoupling mechanism in North Carolina and weather 
normalization adjustment (WNA) mechanisms in South Carolina and Tennessee, 
changes in throughput deliveries do not have a material impact on Piedmont’s 
revenues or earnings. The margin decoupling mechanism adjusts for variations 
in residential and commercial use per customer, including those due to weather 
and conservation. The WNA mechanisms mostly offset the impact of weather on 
bills rendered, but do not ensure full recovery of approved margin during periods 
when winter weather is significantly warmer or colder than normal.

Year Ended December 31, 2017, as Compared to 2016

Operating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:

•	a $74 million increase due to higher natural gas costs passed through 

to customers primarily due to higher natural gas prices;

•	a $34 million increase in revenues to residential and commercial 
customers, net of natural gas costs passed through to customers, 
primarily due to Integrity Management Rider (IMR) rate adjustments 
and customer growth. Increase is also due to new power generation 
customers, and is partially offset by wholesale marketing revenue; and

•	a $10 million increase in revenues due to merger-related bill credits 

applied to customer bills in 2016. 

Operating Expenses. The variance was driven by:

•	a $73 million increase in costs of natural gas primarily due to higher 
natural gas costs passed through to customers due to the higher price 
per dekatherm of natural gas;

•	a $15 million increase in depreciation expense and property and 

franchise taxes due to additional plant in service; and

•	a $7 million increase due to an impairment of software resulting from 

planned accounting system and process integration in 2018.

Partially offset by:

•	a $38 million decrease in operations, maintenance and other related 
to acquisition and integration expenses recorded in the prior year from 
costs paid to outside parties, primarily financial and legal advisory, 
severance expenses, retention costs and acceleration of incentive 
plans, and an accrual for our commitment of charitable contributions 
and community support.

Other Income and Expense. The variance was driven by:

•	a $132 million decrease in gain on sale of unconsolidated affiliates 
recorded in the prior year due to Piedmont’s sale of its 15 percent 
ownership interest in SouthStar Energy Services, LLC (SouthStar) on 
October 3, 2016; and

year.

Income Tax Expense. The variance was primarily due to a decrease in 

pretax income and the impact of the Tax Act. See the Subsidiary Registrants 
section above for additional information on the Tax Act and the impact on the 
effective tax rate.

Matters Impacting Future Results

Within this Item 7, see the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act above as well as 

Liquidity and Capital Resources below for risks associated with the Tax Act.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Preparation of financial statements requires the application of accounting 

policies, judgments, assumptions and estimates that can significantly affect 
the reported results of operations, cash flows or the amounts of assets and 
liabilities recognized in the financial statements. Judgments made include 
the likelihood of success of particular projects, possible legal and regulatory 
challenges, earnings assumptions on pension and other benefit fund 
investments and anticipated recovery of costs, especially through regulated 
operations.

Management discusses these policies, estimates and assumptions with 

senior members of management on a regular basis and provides periodic 
updates on management decisions to the Audit Committee of the Board of 
Directors. Management believes the areas described below require significant 
judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and 
assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent 
periods.

For further information, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial 

Statements, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”

Regulated Operations Accounting

Substantially all of Duke Energy’s regulated operations meet the criteria 
for application of regulated operations accounting treatment. As a result, Duke 
Energy is required to record assets and liabilities that would not be recorded 
for nonregulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs 
that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in 
customer rates. Regulatory liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a 
regulator will require Duke Energy to make refunds to customers or reduce rates 
to customers for previous collections or deferred revenue for costs that have yet 
to be incurred.

Management continually assesses whether recorded regulatory assets 

are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable 
regulatory environment changes, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs 
in Duke Energy’s jurisdictions, litigation of rate orders, recent rate orders to 
other regulated entities, levels of actual return on equity compared to approved 

PART IIrates of return on equity and the status of any pending or potential deregulation 
legislation. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, asset write-offs 
would be recognized in operating income. Additionally, regulatory agencies 
can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property, 
plant and equipment, recognition of asset retirement costs and amortization of 
regulatory assets, or may disallow recovery of all or a portion of certain assets. 
For further information on regulatory assets and liabilities, see Note 4 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters.”

As required by regulated operations accounting rules, significant judgment 
can be required to determine if an otherwise recognizable incurred cost, such as 
closure costs for ash impoundments, qualifies to be deferred for future recovery 
as a regulatory asset. Significant judgment can also be required to determine 
if revenues previously recognized are for entity specific costs that are no 
longer expected to be incurred or have not yet been incurred and are therefore 
a regulatory liability. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
“Regulatory Matters,” for a more in-depth discussion of Regulatory Assets and 
Liabilities.

Regulated operations accounting rules also require recognition of a 

disallowance (also called “impairment”) loss if it becomes probable that part of 
the cost of a plant under construction (or a recently completed or an abandoned 
plant) will be disallowed for ratemaking purposes and a reasonable estimate of 
the amount of the disallowance can be made. For example, if a cost cap is set 
for a plant still under construction, the amount of the disallowance is a result of 
a judgment as to the ultimate cost of the plant. Other disallowances can require 
judgments on allowed future rate recovery. See Note 4 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters,” for a discussion of disallowances 
recorded.

When it becomes probable that regulated assets will be abandoned, 

the cost of the asset is removed from plant in service. The value that may be 
retained as a regulatory asset on the balance sheet for the abandoned property 
is dependent upon amounts that may be recovered through regulated rates, 
including any return. As such, an impairment charge, if any, could be partially 
or fully offset by the establishment of a regulatory asset if rate recovery is 
probable. The impairment for a disallowance of costs for regulated plants under 
construction, recently completed or abandoned is based on discounted cash 
flows.

For further information, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial 

Statements, “Regulatory Matters.”

Goodwill Impairment Assessments

Duke Energy allocates goodwill to reporting units, which are either the 

Business Segments listed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements or 
one level below based on how the Business Segment is managed. Duke Energy 
is required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently 
if it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value. 
Duke Energy performs its annual impairment test as of August 31.

Application of the goodwill impairment test requires management’s 
judgment, including determining the fair value of the reporting unit, which 
management estimates using a weighted combination of the income approach, 
which estimates fair value based on discounted cash flows, and the market 
approach, which estimates fair value based on market comparables within the 
utility and energy industries. Significant assumptions used in these fair value 
analyses include discount and growth rates, future rates of return expected 
to result from ongoing rate regulation, utility sector market performance and 
transactions, forecasted earnings base, projected operating and capital cash 
flows for Duke Energy’s business and the fair value of debt.

Estimated future cash flows under the income approach are based 
to a large extent on Duke Energy’s internal business plan, and adjusted as 
appropriate for Duke Energy’s views of market participant assumptions. Duke 
Energy’s internal business plan reflects management’s assumptions related 
to customer usage and attrition based on internal data and economic data 
obtained from third-party sources, projected commodity pricing data and 

53

potential changes in environmental regulations. The business plan assumes the 
occurrence of certain events in the future, such as the outcome of future rate 
filings, future approved rates of returns on equity, anticipated earnings/returns 
related to significant future capital investments, continued recovery of cost of 
service, the renewal of certain contracts and the future of renewable tax credits. 
Management also makes assumptions regarding operation, maintenance 
and general and administrative costs based on the expected outcome of the 
aforementioned events. In estimating cash flows, Duke Energy incorporates 
expected growth rates, regulatory and economic stability, the ability to renew 
contracts and other factors, into its revenue and expense forecasts.

One of the most significant assumptions that Duke Energy utilizes in 
determining the fair value of its reporting units under the income approach 
is the discount rate applied to the estimated future cash flows. Management 
determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its reporting units based on 
the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for each individual reporting unit. 
The WACC takes into account both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. 
A major component of the cost of equity is the current risk-free rate on 20-year 
U.S. Treasury bonds. In the 2017 impairment tests, Duke Energy considered 
implied WACCs for certain peer companies in determining the appropriate WACC 
rates to use in its analysis. As each reporting unit has a different risk profile 
based on the nature of its operations, including factors such as regulation, 
the WACC for each reporting unit may differ. Accordingly, the WACCs were 
adjusted, as appropriate, to account for company specific risk premiums. The 
discount rates used for calculating the fair values as of August 31, 2017, for 
each of Duke Energy’s reporting units ranged from 5.3 percent to 6.7 percent. 
The underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time. 
Subsequent changes, particularly changes in the discount rates, authorized 
regulated rates of return or growth rates inherent in management’s estimates of 
future cash flows, could result in future impairment charges.

One of the most significant assumptions utilized in determining the fair 
value of reporting units under the market approach is implied market multiples 
for certain peer companies. Management selects comparable peers based 
on each peer’s primary business mix, operations, and market capitalization 
compared to the applicable reporting unit and calculates implied market 
multiples based on available projected earnings guidance and peer company 
market values as of August 31.

In December 2016, Duke Energy disposed of its International operations 

and no longer has goodwill associated with the International operations. For 
further information, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
“Acquisitions and Dispositions.”

Duke Energy primarily operates in environments that are rate-regulated. 

In such environments, revenue requirements are adjusted periodically by 
regulators based on factors including levels of costs, sales volumes and costs 
of capital. Accordingly, Duke Energy’s regulated utilities operate to some degree 
with a buffer from the direct effects, positive or negative, of significant swings in 
market or economic conditions. However, significant changes in discount rates 
over a prolonged period may have a material impact on the fair value of equity.

As of August 31, 2017, all of the reporting units’ estimated fair value 

of equity substantially exceeded the carrying value of equity, except for 
the Commercial Renewables reporting units. The goodwill at the Energy 
Management Solutions reporting unit of Commercial Renewables was evaluated 
for recoverability in 2017, and Duke Energy recorded impairment charges of 
$29 million.

The Commercial Renewables reporting units are impacted by a multitude 
of factors including, legislative actions related to tax credit extensions, long-term 
growth rate assumptions and discount rates. As of August 31, 2017, the 
Renewables reporting unit’s estimated fair value of equity exceeded the carrying 
value of equity by less than 10 percent. Management continues to monitor these 
assumptions for any indicators that the fair value of the reporting unit could be 
below the carrying value and will assess goodwill for impairment as appropriate.

For further information, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial 

Statements, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets.”

PART IIAsset Retirement Obligations

AROs are recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement 

of property, plant and equipment. Substantially all AROs are related to regulated 
operations. When recording an ARO, the present value of the projected liability 
is recognized in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of 
fair value can be made. The liability is accreted over time. For operating plants, 
the present value of the liability is added to the cost of the associated asset and 
depreciated over the remaining life of the asset. For retired plants, the present 
value of the liability is recorded as a regulatory asset unless determined not to 
be recoverable.

The present value of the initial obligation and subsequent updates are 
based on discounted cash flows, which include estimates regarding timing of 
future cash flows, selection of discount rates and cost escalation rates, among 
other factors. These estimates are subject to change. Depreciation expense is 
adjusted prospectively for any changes to the carrying amount of the associated 
asset. The Duke Energy Registrants receive amounts to fund the cost of the 
ARO for regulated operations through a combination of regulated revenues 
and earnings on the nuclear decommissioning trust fund (NDTF). As a result, 
accretion expense and depreciation of the associated ARO asset are netted and 
deferred as a regulatory asset or liability.

Obligations for nuclear decommissioning are based on site-specific cost 

studies. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress assume prompt 
dismantlement of the nuclear facilities after operations are ceased. Duke 
Energy Florida assumes Crystal River Unit 3 will be placed into a safe storage 
configuration until eventual dismantlement is completed by 2074. Duke Energy 
Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also assume that 
spent fuel will be stored on-site until such time that it can be transferred to a 
yet to be built U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) facility.

Obligations for closure of ash basins are based upon discounted cash 

flows of estimated costs for site-specific plans, if known, or probability 
weightings of the potential closure methods if the closure plans are under 
development and multiple closure options are being considered and evaluated 
on a site-by-site basis.

For further information, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial 

Statements, “Asset Retirement Obligations.”

Long-Lived Asset Impairment Assessments, Excluding Regulated 
Operations, and Equity Method Investments

Property, plant and equipment, excluding plant held for sale, is stated 
at the lower of carrying value (historical cost less accumulated depreciation 
and previously recorded impairments) or fair value, if impaired. Duke Energy 
evaluates property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or 
changes in circumstances (such as a significant change in cash flow projections 
or the determination that it is more likely than not that an asset or asset group 
will be sold) indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. 
The determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on an 
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as 
compared with their carrying value.

Performing an impairment evaluation involves a significant degree of 
estimation and judgment in areas such as identifying circumstances that 
indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets and 
developing the undiscounted future cash flows. If an impairment has occurred, 
the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair 
value and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. 
Additionally, determining fair value requires probability weighting future cash 
flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing 
and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Although cash flow estimates 
are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, 
estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary 
significantly from actual results.

When determining whether an asset or asset group has been impaired, 
management groups assets at the lowest level that has discrete cash flows.

54

Investments in affiliates that are not controlled by Duke Energy, but over 
which it has significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method. 
Equity method investments are assessed for impairment when conditions exist 
that indicate that the fair value of the investment is less than book value. It 
the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, the investment is 
written down to its estimated fair value, which establishes a new cost basis in 
the investment.

For further information, see Notes 10 and 12 to the Consolidated 

Financial Statements, “Property, Plant and Equipment” and “Investments in 
Unconsolidated Affiliates,” respectively.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues on sales of electricity and natural gas are recognized when 

service is provided or the product is delivered. As retail meters are read, 
invoices are prepared and the invoice amount is generally recognized as “billed” 
revenue. Operating revenues also include “unbilled” electric and natural gas 
revenues for the amount of service provided or product delivered after the last 
meter reading prior to the end of the accounting period. Unbilled retail revenues 
are estimated by applying an average revenue per kilowatt-hour (kWh), per 
thousand cubic feet (Mcf) or per dekatherm (dth) for all customer classes to the 
number of estimated kWh, Mcf or dth delivered but not yet billed.

For wholesale customers, the invoice amount is generally recognized as 
“billed” revenue. Although meters are read as of the end of the month, invoices 
have typically not been prepared. An estimate of the wholesale invoice is 
included in the reported amount of “unbilled” revenue.

The amount of unbilled revenues can vary significantly from period to 
period as a result of numerous factors that impact the change in the unbilled 
revenue receivable balance, including seasonality, weather, customer usage 
patterns, customer mix, timing of rendering customer bills, meter readings 
schedules and the average price in effect for customer classes.

Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits

The calculation of pension expense, other post-retirement benefit expense 

and net pension and other post-retirement assets or liabilities require the use 
of assumptions and election of permissible accounting alternatives. Changes 
in assumptions can result in different expense and reported asset or liability 
amounts and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Duke 
Energy believes the most critical assumptions for pension and other post-
retirement benefits are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 
and the assumed discount rate applied to future projected benefit payments. 
Additionally, the health care cost trend rate assumption is critical to Duke 
Energy’s estimate of other post-retirement benefits.

Duke Energy elects to amortize net actuarial gain or loss amounts that 
are in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the market-related value of plan 
assets or the plan’s projected benefit obligation, into net pension or other 
post-retirement benefit expense over the average remaining service period of 
active participants expected to benefit under the plan. If all or almost all of a 
plan’s participants are inactive, the average remaining life expectancy of the 
inactive participants is used instead of average remaining service period. Prior 
service cost or credit, which represents an increase or decrease in a plan’s 
pension benefit obligation resulting from plan amendment, is amortized on a 
straight-line basis over the average expected remaining service period of active 
participants expected to benefit under the plan. If all or almost all of a plan’s 
participants are inactive, the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive 
participants is used instead of average remaining service period.

Duke Energy maintains and the Subsidiary Registrants participate in, 

qualified, non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans. Most participants 
in the qualified plans earn benefits calculated using a cash balance formula. 
Under a cash balance formula, a plan participant accumulates a retirement 
benefit consisting of pay credits based upon a percentage, which varies with 
age and years of service, of current eligible earnings and current interest 
credits. Certain plan participants earn benefits that use a final average earnings 

PART IIformula. Certain executives are participants in non-qualified, non-contributory 
defined benefit retirement plans. These qualified and non-qualified, non-
contributory defined benefit plans are closed to new participants.

Duke Energy provides some health care and life insurance benefits 

for retired employees on a contributory and non-contributory basis. Certain 
employees are eligible for these benefits if they have met age and service 
requirements at retirement, as defined in the plans.

Assets for Duke Energy’s qualified pension and other post-retirement 

benefits (401(h) accounts) are maintained in the Duke Energy Master 
Retirement Trust (Master Trust). Duke Energy also invests other post-retirement 
assets in Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association trusts. The investment 
objective is to achieve sufficient returns, subject to a prudent level of portfolio 
risk, for the purpose of promoting the security of plan benefits for participants.
As of December 31, 2017, Duke Energy assumes pension and other post-
retirement plan assets will generate a long-term rate of return of 6.50 percent. 
The expected long-term rate of return was developed using a weighted average 
calculation of expected returns based primarily on future expected returns across 
asset classes considering the use of active asset managers, where applicable. 
The asset allocation targets were set after considering the investment objective 
and the risk profile. Equity securities are held for their higher expected returns. 
Debt securities are primarily held to hedge the qualified pension liability. 
Hedge funds, real estate and other global securities are held for diversification. 
Investments within asset classes are diversified to achieve broad market 
participation and reduce the impact of individual managers on investments. 

In 2013, Duke Energy adopted a de-risking investment strategy for 
the Master Trust. As the funded status of the pension plans increase, the 

targeted allocation to fixed-income assets may be increased to better manage 
Duke Energy’s pension liability and reduce funded status volatility. The asset 
allocation for the Master Trust is 63 percent fixed-income assets and 37 percent 
return-seeking assets. Duke Energy regularly reviews its actual asset allocation 
and periodically rebalances its investments to the targeted allocations when 
considered appropriate.

Duke Energy discounted its future U.S. pension and other post-retirement 
obligations using a rate of 3.6 percent as of December 31, 2017. Discount rates 
used to measure benefit plan obligations for financial reporting purposes reflect 
rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. As of December 31, 
2017, Duke Energy determined its discount rate for U.S. pension and other post-
retirement obligations using a bond selection-settlement portfolio approach. 
This approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality 
corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to provide for projected 
benefit payments of the plan. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a 
universe of non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or higher. After the 
bond portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the 
present value of the plan’s projected benefit payments discounted at this rate 
with the market value of the bonds selected.

Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various 

other factors related to the participants in Duke Energy’s pension and post-
retirement plans will impact future pension expense and liabilities. Duke Energy 
cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future. The following 
table presents the approximate effect on Duke Energy’s 2017 pretax pension 
expense, pretax other post-retirement expense, pension obligation and other post-
retirement benefit obligation if a 0.25 percent change in rates were to occur.

Duke Energy’s other post-retirement plan uses a health care trend rate covering both pre- and post-age 65 retired plan participants, which is comprised of a 

medical care trend rate, which reflects the near- and long-term expectation of increases in medical costs, and a prescription drug trend rate, which reflects the near- 
and long-term expectation of increases in prescription drug costs. As of December 31, 2017, the health care trend rate was 7 percent, trending down to 4.75 percent 
by 2024. The following table presents the approximate effect on Duke Energy’s 2017 pretax other post-retirement expense and other post-retirement benefit obligation

Income Taxes

Duke Energy and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income 

tax return and other state returns. The Subsidiary Registrants entered into a 
tax-sharing agreement with Duke Energy. Income taxes recorded represent 
amounts the Subsidiary Registrants would incur as separate C-Corporations. 
Deferred income taxes have been provided for temporary differences between 
GAAP and tax bases of assets and liabilities because the differences create 
taxable or tax-deductible amounts for future periods. ITCs associated with 
regulated operations are deferred and amortized as a reduction of income tax 
expense over the estimated useful lives of the related properties.

Accumulated deferred income taxes are valued using the enacted tax rate 

expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax 

asset or liability is expected to be settled or realized. In the event of a change in 
tax rates, deferred tax assets and liabilities are remeasured as of the enactment 
date of the new rate. To the extent that the change in the value of the deferred 
tax represents an obligation to customers, the impact of the remeasurement 
is deferred to a regulatory liability. Remaining impacts are recorded in income 
from continuing operations. Other impacts of the Tax Act have been recorded on 
a provisional basis, see Note 22, “Income Taxes,” for additional information. If 
Duke Energy’s estimate of the tax effect of reversing temporary differences is 
not reflective of actual outcomes, is modified to reflect new developments or 
interpretations of the tax law, revised to incorporate new accounting principles, 
or changes in the expected timing or manner of the reversal then Duke Energy’s 
results of operations could be impacted.

PART IILIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Sources and Uses of Cash

Duke Energy relies primarily upon cash flows from operations, debt and 
equity issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its liquidity 
and capital requirements. Duke Energy’s capital requirements arise primarily 
from capital and investment expenditures, repaying long-term debt and paying 
dividends to shareholders. Duke Energy’s projected primary sources and uses 
for the next three fiscal years are included in the table below.

Among other provisions, the Tax Act lowers the corporate federal income 
tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and eliminates bonus depreciation for 
regulated utilities. For Duke Energy’s regulated operations, the reduction in 
federal income taxes is expected to result in lower regulated customer rates. 
However, due to its existing NOL (Net operating loss) position and other tax 
credits, Duke Energy does not expect to be a significant federal cash tax payer 
through at least 2022. As a result, any reduction in customer rates could cause 
a material reduction in consolidated cash flows from operations in the short-
term. Over time, the reduction in deferred tax liabilities resulting from the Tax 
Act will increase Duke Energy’s regulated rate base investments and customer 
rates. See the Credit Ratings section below for additional information on the 
impact of the Tax Act on the Duke Energy Registrants’ credit ratings. Impacts 
of Tax Act to Duke Energy’s cash flows and credit metrics are subject to the 
regulatory actions of its state commissions and the FERC, which are currently 
pending. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory 
Matters,” for additional information.

In order to strengthen its balance sheet and credit metrics and bolster 

cash flows, Duke Energy plans to issue $2 billion of common stock equity during 
2018, including its previous plan to issue $350 million annually through its DRIP 
beginning in 2018, as well as reduce its capital expenditures during 2018-2022 
by approximately $1 billion.

The Subsidiary Registrants generally maintain minimal cash balances and 

use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash 
requirements. The Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, support 
their short-term borrowing needs through participation with Duke Energy and 
certain of its other subsidiaries in a money pool arrangement. The companies 
with short-term funds may provide short-term loans to affiliates participating 
under this arrangement. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
“Debt and Credit Facilities,” for additional discussion of the money pool 
arrangement.

Duke Energy and the Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, 

may also use short-term debt, including commercial paper and the money 
pool, as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may 
vary significantly over the course of the year due to the timing of long-term 
debt financings and the impact of fluctuations in cash flows from operations. 
From time to time, Duke Energy’s current liabilities exceed current assets 

resulting from the use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet scheduled 
maturities of long-term debt, as well as cash needs, which can fluctuate due to 
the seasonality of its businesses.

DEBT MATURITIES

See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Debt and Credit 
Facilities,” for further information regarding significant components of Current 
Maturities of Long-Term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

DIVIDEND PAYMENTS

In 2017, Duke Energy paid quarterly cash dividends for the 91st 

consecutive year and expects to continue its policy of paying regular cash 
dividends in the future. There is no assurance as to the amount of future 
dividends because they depend on future earnings, capital requirements, 
financial condition and are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.

Duke Energy targets a dividend payout ratio of between 70 percent and 
75 percent, based upon adjusted diluted EPS. In 2016 and 2017, Duke Energy 
increased the dividend by approximately 4 percent annually. Through 2022, the 
annual dividend growth rate is expected to be between approximately 4 to 6 percent. 

Dividend and Other Funding Restrictions of Duke Energy Subsidiaries

As discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 

“Regulatory Matters,” Duke Energy’s wholly owned public utility operating 
companies have restrictions on the amount of funds that can be transferred 
to Duke Energy through dividends, advances or loans as a result of conditions 
imposed by various regulators in conjunction with merger transactions. Duke 
Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also have restrictions imposed by 
their first mortgage bond indentures and Articles of Incorporation, which, in 
certain circumstances, limit their ability to make cash dividends or distributions 

56

PART IIon common stock. Additionally, certain other Duke Energy subsidiaries have 
other restrictions, such as minimum working capital and tangible net worth 
requirements pursuant to debt and other agreements that limit the amount 
of funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy. At December 31, 2017, the 
amount of restricted net assets of wholly owned subsidiaries of Duke Energy 
that may not be distributed to Duke Energy in the form of a loan or dividend 
is less than 25 percent of Duke Energy’s net assets. Duke Energy does not 
have any legal or other restrictions on paying common stock dividends to 
shareholders out of its consolidated equity accounts. Although these restrictions 
cap the amount of funding the various operating subsidiaries can provide 
to Duke Energy, management does not believe these restrictions will have a 
significant impact on Duke Energy’s ability to access cash to meet its payment 
of dividends on common stock and other future funding obligations.

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES

Cash flows from operations of Electric Utilities and Infrastructure and Gas 
Utilities and Infrastructure are primarily driven by sales of electricity and natural 
gas, respectively, and costs of operations. These cash flows from operations are 
relatively stable and comprise a substantial portion of Duke Energy’s operating cash 
flows. Weather conditions, working capital and commodity price fluctuations and 
unanticipated expenses including unplanned plant outages, storms, legal costs and 
related settlements can affect the timing and level of cash flows from operations.

Duke Energy believes it has sufficient liquidity resources through the 

commercial paper markets, and ultimately, the Master Credit Facility, to support 
these operations. Cash flows from operations are subject to a number of other 
factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory constraints, economic trends 
and market volatility (see Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for additional information).
At December 31, 2017, Duke Energy had cash and cash equivalents and 

short-term investments of $358 million.

DEBT ISSUANCES

Depending on availability based on the issuing entity, the credit rating of 
the issuing entity, and market conditions, the Subsidiary Registrants prefer to 
issue first mortgage bonds and secured debt, followed by unsecured debt. This 
preference is the result of generally higher credit ratings for first mortgage bonds 
and secured debt, which typically result in lower interest costs. Duke Energy 
Corporation primarily issues unsecured debt.

See to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Debt and Credit 

Facilities,” for further information regarding significant debt issuances. 

Duke Energy’s capitalization is balanced between debt and equity as 

shown in the table below.

Duke Energy’s fixed charges coverage ratio, calculated using Securities 

and Exchange Commission (SEC) guidelines, was 2.9 times for 2017, 2.7 times 
for 2016 and 3.1 times for 2015.

Restrictive Debt Covenants

Duke Energy’s debt and credit agreements contain various financial and 

other covenants. Duke Energy’s Master Credit Facility contains a covenant 
requiring the debt-to-total capitalization ratio to not exceed 65 percent for 
each borrower, excluding Piedmont, and 70 percent for Piedmont. Failure 
to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in 
accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements or sublimits 
thereto. As of December 31, 2017, each of the Duke Energy Registrants was 
in compliance with all covenants related to their debt agreements. In addition, 
some credit agreements may allow for acceleration of payments or termination 
of the agreements due to nonpayment, or acceleration of other significant 
indebtedness of the borrower or some of its subsidiaries. None of the debt or 
credit agreements contain material adverse change clauses.

Credit Ratings

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s Rating 

Services (S&P) and Fitch Ratings, Inc. provide credit ratings for various Duke 
Energy Registrants. The following table includes Duke Energy and certain

In January 2018, Moody’s revised the ratings outlook for Duke Energy Corporation and Piedmont from 
stable to negative, principally due to risk of deterioration in credit metrics resulting from the Tax Act. See 
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act section above for additional information on the Tax Act.

Credit ratings are intended to provide credit lenders a framework for 

comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, 
sell or hold. The Duke Energy Registrants’ credit ratings are dependent on the 
rating agencies’ assessments of their ability to meet their debt principal and 
interest obligations when they come due. If, as a result of market conditions 
or other factors, the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to maintain current 
balance sheet strength, or if earnings and cash flow outlook materially 
deteriorates, credit ratings could be negatively impacted.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016, the variance 

was driven primarily by:

•	a $1,325 million decrease in working capital due to weather, payment of 
merger transaction and integration related costs and increased property 
tax payments in 2017.

Offset by:

•	a $969 million increase in net income after non-cash adjustments 
primarily due to the inclusion of Piedmont’s earnings for a full year, 
favorable pricing and weather-normal retail volumes driven by the 
residential class in the Electric Utilities and Infrastructure Segment 
combined with continued strong cost control;

•	a $136 million decrease in contributions to qualified pension plans; and

•	a $37 million decrease in payments to AROs.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 2015, the variance 

was driven primarily by:

•	a $388 million increase in cash flows from working capital primarily 

due to the sale of the International business; and

•	a $147 million decrease in contributions to qualified pension plans.

Offset by:

•	a $262 million increase in payments for AROs; and

•	a $156 million decrease in net income after non-cash adjustments 

due to higher storm costs offset by favorable weather, increased rider 
revenues, higher wholesale margins and strong cost control.

expenditures mainly due to the Piedmont acquisition in the prior year.

Partially offset by:

•	a $1,418 million decrease in net proceeds from sales of discontinued 

operations due to the prior year sale of the International business.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 2015, the variance 

was driven primarily by:

•	a $4,852 million increase in capital, investment and acquisition 

expenditures mainly due to the Piedmont acquisition; and 

•	a $1,550 million decrease in net proceeds from sales of discontinued 
operations mainly due to the variance in proceeds between the 2015 
sale of the Midwest generation business and the 2016 sale of the 
International business.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016, the variance 

was driven primarily by:

•	a $2,722 million net decrease in proceeds from issuances of long-

term debt driven principally by the prior year $3,750 million of senior 
unsecured notes used to fund a portion of the Piedmont acquisition, 
offset primarily by $900 million of first mortgage bonds issued by Duke 
Energy Florida in the current year to fund capital expenditures for ongoing 
construction and capital maintenance and for general corporate purposes;

•	a $731 million decrease in proceeds from stock issuances used to fund 

a portion of the Piedmont acquisition in 2016; and

•	a $118 million current year increase in dividends paid.

PART IIPartially offset by:

•	a $1,085 million decrease in net borrowings from notes payable and 
commercial paper primarily due to the use of proceeds from $1,294 
million nuclear asset-recovery bonds issued at Duke Energy Florida in 
2016 to pay down outstanding commercial paper.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 2015, the variance 

was driven primarily by:

•	a $7,389 million increase in proceeds from net issuances of long-term 
debt mainly due to the issuances of $3,750 million of senior unsecured 
notes used to fund a portion of the Piedmont acquisition, $1,294 million 
of nuclear asset-recovery bonds and other issuances primarily used to 
fund capital expenditures, pay down outstanding commercial paper and 
repay debt maturities;

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

•	a $1,500 million decrease in cash outflows due to the 2015 repurchase 

of 19.8 million common shares under the ASR; and

•	a $714 million increase in proceeds resulting from the issuance of 

common stock to fund the acquisition of Piedmont.

Partially offset by:

•	a $2,692 million increase in cash outflows for the net payments of 
notes payable and commercial paper primarily through the use of 
proceeds from $1,294 million nuclear asset-recovery bonds issued at 
Duke Energy Florida, further increased by the use of short-term debt 
in 2015 to repay long-term debt maturities at Duke Energy Florida in 
advance of the 2016 proceeds from the nuclear asset-recovery bonds.

Duke Energy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee 

arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial 
transactions with third parties. These arrangements include performance 
guarantees, stand-by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and 
indemnifications.

Most of the guarantee arrangements entered into by Duke Energy enhance 

the credit standing of certain subsidiaries, non-consolidated entities or less 
than wholly owned entities, enabling them to conduct business. As such, these 
guarantee arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk, which 
are not always included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The possibility 
of Duke Energy, either on its own or on behalf of Spectra Energy Capital, LLC 
(Spectra Capital) through indemnification agreements entered into as part 
of the January 2, 2007, spin-off of Spectra Energy Corp, having to honor its 
contingencies is largely dependent upon the future operations of the subsidiaries, 
investees and other third parties, or the occurrence of certain future events.

Duke Energy performs ongoing assessments of its respective guarantee 

obligations to determine whether any liabilities have been incurred as a result of 
potential increased non-performance risk by third parties for which Duke Energy 
has issued guarantees.

See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Guarantees and 

Indemnifications,” for further details of the guarantee arrangements.

Issuance of these guarantee arrangements is not required for the majority 

of Duke Energy’s operations. Thus, if Duke Energy discontinued issuing these 
guarantees, there would not be a material impact to the consolidated results of 
operations, cash flows or financial position.

Other than the guarantee arrangements discussed above, normal 
operating lease arrangements and off-balance sheet debt related to non-
consolidated VIEs, Duke Energy does not have any material off-balance sheet 
financing entities or structures. For additional information, see Notes 5, 7 and 17 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Commitments and Contingencies,” 
“Guarantees and Indemnifications” and “Variable Interest Entities,” respectively.

(d)  Current liabilities, except for current maturities of long-term debt, and purchase obligations reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets have been excluded from the above table.
(e) 

Includes firm capacity payments that provide Duke Energy with uninterrupted firm access to electricity transmission capacity and natural gas transportation contracts, as well as undesignated contracts and contracts 
that qualify as normal purchase/normal sale (NPNS). For contracts where the price paid is based on an index, the amount is based on market prices at December 31, 2017, or the best projections of the index. For certain 
of these amounts, Duke Energy may settle on a net cash basis since Duke Energy has entered into payment netting arrangements with counterparties that permit Duke Energy to offset receivables and payables with such 
counterparties.

(f)  Amounts exclude obligations under the OVEC purchase power agreement. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Variable Interest Entities,” for additional information.

PART II(g) 

Includes contracts for software, telephone, data and consulting or advisory services. Amount also includes contractual obligations for engineering, procurement and construction costs for new generation plants, wind and solar 
facilities, plant refurbishments, maintenance and day-to-day contract work and commitments to buy certain products. Amount excludes certain open purchase orders for services that are provided on demand, for which the 
timing of the purchase cannot be determined.

(h)  Related to future annual funding obligations to NDTF through nuclear power stations’ relicensing dates. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Asset Retirement Obligations.”
(i)  Unrecognized tax benefits of $25 million are not reflected in this table as Duke Energy cannot predict when open income tax years will close with completed examinations. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 

(j) 

“Income Taxes.”
The table above excludes reserves for litigation, environmental remediation, asbestos-related injuries and damages claims and self-insurance claims (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Commitments 
and Contingencies”) because Duke Energy is uncertain as to the timing and amount of cash payments that will be required. Additionally, the table above excludes annual insurance premiums that are necessary to operate the 
business, including nuclear insurance (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Commitments and Contingencies”), funding of pension and other post-retirement benefit plans (see Note 21 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, “Employee Benefit Plans”), AROs, including ash management expenditures (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Asset Retirement Obligations”) and regulatory liabilities (see Note 4 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters”) because the amount and timing of the cash payments are uncertain. Also excluded are Deferred Income Taxes and ITCs recorded on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheets since cash payments for income taxes are determined based primarily on taxable income for each discrete fiscal year. 

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

underlying assumptions could result in significantly different fair values and 
income recognition.

Risk Management Policies

Hedging Strategies

The Enterprise Risk Management policy framework at Duke Energy 

includes strategy, operational, project execution and financial or transaction 
related risks. Enterprise Risk Management includes market risk as part of the 
financial and transaction related risks in its framework.

Duke Energy is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices, 

interest rates and equity prices. Duke Energy has established comprehensive 
risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks. Duke 
Energy’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for 
the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation 
of approval and authorization levels. The Finance and Risk Management 
Committee of the Board of Directors receives periodic updates from the Chief 
Risk Officer and other members of management on market risk positions, 
corporate exposures and overall risk management activities. The Chief Risk 
Officer is responsible for the overall governance of managing commodity price 
risk, including monitoring exposure limits.

The following disclosures about market risk contain forward-looking 

statements that involve estimates, projections, goals, forecasts, assumptions, 
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ 
materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Please 
review Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-
Looking Information” for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such 
forward-looking statements made herein.

Commodity Price Risk

Duke Energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices 

of electricity, coal, natural gas and other energy-related products marketed 
and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy-related assets. Duke 
Energy’s exposure to these fluctuations is limited by the cost-based regulation 
of its regulated operations as these operations are typically allowed to recover 
substantially all of these costs through various cost-recovery clauses, including 
fuel clauses, formula based contracts, or other cost-sharing mechanisms. While 
there may be a delay in timing between when these costs are incurred and when 
they are recovered through rates, changes from year to year generally do not 
have a material impact on operating results of these regulated operations.

Price risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the 
market price of electricity or other energy commodities. Duke Energy’s exposure 
to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors, including contract 
size, length, market liquidity, location and unique or specific contract terms. 
Duke Energy employs established policies and procedures to manage risks 
associated with these market fluctuations, which may include using various 
commodity derivatives, such as swaps, futures, forwards and options. For 
additional information, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
“Derivatives and Hedging.”

The inputs and methodologies used to determine the fair value of 

contracts are validated by an internal group separate from Duke Energy’s deal 
origination function. While Duke Energy uses common industry practices to 
develop its valuation techniques, changes in its pricing methodologies or the 

Duke Energy closely monitors risks associated with commodity price 

changes on its future operations and, where appropriate, uses various commodity 
instruments such as electricity, coal and natural gas forward contracts and 
options to mitigate the effect of such fluctuations on operations. Duke Energy’s 
primary use of energy commodity derivatives is to hedge against exposure to the 
prices of power, fuel for generation and natural gas for customers.

The majority of instruments used to manage Duke Energy’s commodity 
price exposure are either not designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge 
accounting. These instruments are referred to as undesignated contracts. 
Mark-to-market changes for undesignated contracts entered into by regulated 
businesses are reflected as regulatory assets or liabilities on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheets. Undesignated contracts entered into by unregulated businesses 
are marked-to-market each period, with changes in the fair value of the 
derivative instruments reflected in earnings.

Duke Energy may also enter into other contracts that qualify for the NPNS 
exception. When a contract meets the criteria to qualify as NPNS, Duke Energy 
applies such exception. Income recognition and realization related to NPNS 
contracts generally coincide with the physical delivery of the commodity. For 
contracts qualifying for the NPNS exception, no recognition of the contract’s fair 
value in the Consolidated Financial Statements is required until settlement of 
the contract as long as the transaction remains probable of occurring.

Generation Portfolio Risks

The Duke Energy Registrants optimize the value of their generation 

portfolios, which include generation assets, fuel and emission allowances. 
Modeled forecasts of future generation output and fuel requirements are based 
on forward power and fuel markets. The component pieces of the portfolio 
are bought and sold based on models and forecasts of generation in order to 
manage the economic value of the portfolio in accordance with the strategies of 
the business units.

For the Electric Utilities segment, the generation portfolio not utilized 
to serve retail operations or committed load is subject to commodity price 
fluctuations. However, the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations 
is partially offset by mechanisms in these regulated jurisdictions that result in 
the sharing of net profits from these activities with retail customers.

Interest Rate Risk

Duke Energy is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as 

a result of its issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. 
Duke Energy manages interest rate exposure by limiting variable-rate exposures 
to a percentage of total debt and by monitoring the effects of market changes 
in interest rates. Duke Energy also enters into financial derivative instruments, 
which may include instruments such as, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, 
swaptions and U.S. Treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest 
rate risk exposure. See Notes 1, 6, 14 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” “Debt and Credit 
Facilities,” “Derivatives and Hedging,” and “Fair Value Measurements.”

PART IIAt December 31, 2017, Duke Energy had $687 million notional amount 

of floating-to-fixed swaps outstanding, $500 million notional amount of 
fixed-to-floating swaps outstanding and $400 million forward-starting swaps 
outstanding. Duke Energy had $6.1 billion of unhedged long- and short-term 
floating interest rate exposure at December 31, 2017. The impact of a 100 basis 
point change in interest rates on pretax income is approximately $61 million at 
December 31, 2017. This amount was estimated by considering the impact of 
the hypothetical interest rates on variable-rate securities outstanding, adjusted 
for interest rate hedges as of December 31, 2017.

See Note 14, “Derivatives and Hedging,” to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements for additional information about the forward-starting interest rate 
swaps related to the Piedmont acquisition.

Credit Risk

Credit risk represents the loss that the Duke Energy Registrants would 

incur if a counterparty fails to perform under its contractual obligations. Where 
exposed to credit risk, the Duke Energy Registrants analyze the counterparty’s 
financial condition prior to entering into an agreement and monitor exposure 
on an ongoing basis. The Duke Energy Registrants establish credit limits where 
appropriate in the context of contractual arrangements and monitor such limits.

To reduce credit exposure, the Duke Energy Registrants seek to include 

netting provisions with counterparties, which permit the offset of receivables and 
payables with such counterparties. The Duke Energy Registrants also frequently 
use master agreements with credit support annexes to further mitigate certain 
credit exposures. The master agreements provide for a counterparty to post cash 
or letters of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established 
threshold. The threshold amount represents a negotiated unsecured credit 
limit for each party to the agreement, determined in accordance with the Duke 
Energy Registrants’ internal corporate credit practices and standards. Collateral 
agreements generally also provide that the inability to post collateral is sufficient 
cause to terminate contracts and liquidate all positions.

The Duke Energy Registrants also obtain cash or letters of credit from 

certain counterparties to provide credit support outside of collateral agreements, 
where appropriate, based on a financial analysis of the counterparty and the 
regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each transaction. 
See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Derivatives and 
Hedging,” for additional information regarding credit risk related to derivative 
instruments. 

The Duke Energy Registrants’ principal counterparties for its electric and 

natural gas businesses are regional transmission organizations, distribution 
companies, municipalities, electric cooperatives and utilities located throughout 
the U.S. The Duke Energy Registrants have concentrations of receivables from 
such entities throughout these regions. These concentrations of receivables may 
affect the Duke Energy Registrants’ overall credit risk in that risk factors can 
negatively impact the credit quality of the entire sector.

The Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to credit risk from 

transactions with their suppliers that involve prepayments in conjunction with 
outsourcing arrangements, major construction projects and certain commodity 
purchases. The Duke Energy Registrants’ credit exposure to such suppliers 
may take the form of increased costs or project delays in the event of non-
performance. The Duke Energy Registrants’ frequently require guarantees or 
letters of credit from suppliers to mitigate this credit risk.

Credit risk associated with the Duke Energy Registrants’ service to 
residential, commercial and industrial customers is generally limited to 
outstanding accounts receivable. The Duke Energy Registrants mitigate this 
credit risk by requiring customers to provide a cash deposit, letter of credit 
or surety bond until a satisfactory payment history is established, subject to 
the rules and regulations in effect in each retail jurisdiction, at which time the 
deposit is typically refunded. Charge-offs for retail customers have historically 
been insignificant to the operations of the Duke Energy Registrants and are 
typically recovered through retail rates. Management continually monitors 
customer charge-offs and payment patterns to ensure the adequacy of bad 
debt reserves. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana sell certain of their 

accounts receivable and related collections through Cinergy Receivables 
Company LLC (CRC), a Duke Energy consolidated variable interest entity. 
Losses on collection are first absorbed by the equity of CRC and next by the 
subordinated retained interests held by Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Kentucky 
and Duke Energy Indiana. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
“Variable Interest Entities.” 

Duke Energy Carolinas has third-party insurance to cover certain losses 

related to asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate self-
insured retention. Duke Energy Carolinas’ cumulative payments began to exceed 
the self-insurance retention in 2008. Future payments up to the policy limit will 
be reimbursed by the third-party insurance carrier. The insurance policy limit 
for potential future insurance recoveries indemnification and medical cost claim 
payments is $797 million in excess of the self-insured retention. Receivables 
for insurance recoveries were $489 million and $587 million at December 31, 
2017, and 2016, respectively. These amounts are classified in Other within 
Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Duke Energy 
Carolinas is not aware of any uncertainties regarding the legal sufficiency of 
insurance claims. Duke Energy Carolinas believes the insurance recovery asset 
is probable of recovery as the insurance carrier continues to have a strong 
financial strength rating.

The Duke Energy Registrants also have credit risk exposure through 

issuance of performance and financial guarantees, letters of credit and surety 
bonds on behalf of less than wholly owned entities and third parties. Where 
the Duke Energy Registrants have issued these guarantees, it is possible that 
they could be required to perform under these guarantee obligations in the 
event the obligor under the guarantee fails to perform. Where the Duke Energy 
Registrants have issued guarantees related to assets or operations that have 
been disposed of via sale, they attempt to secure indemnification from the buyer 
against all future performance obligations under the guarantees. See Note 7 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Guarantees and Indemnifications,” for 
further information on guarantees issued by the Duke Energy Registrants. 

Based on the Duke Energy Registrants’ policies for managing credit risk, 
their exposures and their credit and other reserves, the Duke Energy Registrants 
do not currently anticipate a materially adverse effect on their consolidated 
financial position or results of operations as a result of non-performance by any 
counterparty.

Marketable Securities Price Risk

As described further in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 

“Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” Duke Energy invests in debt 
and equity securities as part of various investment portfolios to fund certain 
obligations. The vast majority of investments in equity securities are within the 
NDTF and assets of the various pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.

Pension Plan Assets

Duke Energy maintains investments to facilitate funding the costs of 

providing non-contributory defined benefit retirement and other post-retirement 
benefit plans. These investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity 
markets and changes in interest rates. The equity securities held in these 
pension plans are diversified to achieve broad market participation and 
reduce the impact of any single investment, sector or geographic region. Duke 
Energy has established asset allocation targets for its pension plan holdings, 
which take into consideration the investment objectives and the risk profile 
with respect to the trust in which the assets are held. See Note 21 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, “Employee Benefit Plans,” for additional 
information regarding investment strategy of pension plan assets.

A significant decline in the value of plan asset holdings could require Duke 

Energy to increase funding of its pension plans in future periods, which could 
adversely affect cash flows in those periods. Additionally, a decline in the fair 
value of plan assets, absent additional cash contributions to the plan, could 
increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future periods, 
which could adversely affect Duke Energy’s results of operations in those periods.

PART IINuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds

As required by the NRC, NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC, subsidiaries of Duke 
Energy maintain trust funds to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning. As 
of December 31, 2017, these funds were invested primarily in domestic and 
international equity securities, debt securities, cash and cash equivalents and 
short-term investments. Per the NRC, Internal Revenue Code, NCUC, PSCSC 
and FPSC requirements, these funds may be used only for activities related to 
nuclear decommissioning. These investments are exposed to price fluctuations 
in equity markets and changes in interest rates. Duke Energy actively monitors 
its portfolios by benchmarking the performance of its investments against 
certain indices and by maintaining, and periodically reviewing, target allocation 
percentages for various asset classes. 

Accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are 
recovered through retail and wholesale rates; therefore, fluctuations in 
investment prices do not materially affect the Consolidated Statements of 
Operations, as changes in the fair value of these investments are primarily 
deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities pursuant to Orders by the 
NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC and FERC. Earnings or losses of the fund will ultimately 
impact the amount of costs recovered through retail and wholesale rates. 
See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Asset Retirement 
Obligations,” for additional information regarding nuclear decommissioning 
costs. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Investments in 
Debt and Equity Securities,” for additional information regarding NDTF assets.

Environmental Regulations

The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to federal, state and local 

regulations regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal 
and other environmental matters. These regulations can be changed from time 
to time and result in new obligations of the Duke Energy Registrants.

The following sections outline various proposed and recently enacted 

legislation and regulations that may impact the Duke Energy Registrants. Refer 
to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters,” for 
further information regarding potential plant retirements and regulatory filings 
related to the Duke Energy Registrants.

Coal Combustion Residuals

In April 2015, EPA published a rule to regulate the disposal of CCR 
from electric utilities as solid waste. The federal regulation classifies CCR 
as nonhazardous waste and allows for beneficial use of CCR with some 
restrictions. The regulation applies to all new and existing landfills, new 
and existing surface impoundments receiving CCR and existing surface 
impoundments that are no longer receiving CCR but contain liquid located at 
stations currently generating electricity (regardless of fuel source). The rule 
establishes requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design 
and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring, 
protection and remedial procedures and other operational and reporting 
procedures to ensure the safe disposal and management of CCR. Various 
industry and environmental parties have appealed EPA’s CCR rule in the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (D.C. Circuit Court). On April 18, 
2016, EPA filed a motion with the federal court to settle five issues raised in 
litigation. On June 14, 2016, the court approved the motion with respect to

all of those issues. Duke Energy does not expect a material impact from the 
settlement or that it will result in additional ARO adjustments. On September 13, 
2017, EPA responded to a petition by the Utility Solid Waste Activities Group that 
the agency would reconsider certain provisions of the final rule, and asked the 
D.C. Circuit Court to suspend the litigation. The D.C. Circuit Court denied EPA’s 
petition to suspend the litigation and oral argument was held on November 20, 
2017. The court has not issued an order in the matter. Duke Energy cannot 
predict the outcome of the litigation.

In a November 15, 2017, status report filed with the D.C. Circuit Court, 

EPA listed the provisions it intends to reconsider, including provisions that 
warrant revision due to passage of the Water Infrastructure Improvements for 
the Nation Act, which allows for implementation of the CCR rule through state or 
federal permit programs. EPA has indicated it will issue a proposed rule in early 
2018 that includes provisions from the June 2016 settlement with petitioners 
and additional provisions under reconsideration. The reconsideration would not 
repeal the CCR rule; rather, it would modify some requirements to align with the 
implementation of the rule through permit programs. At this time, Duke Energy 
does not expect a reconsideration rulemaking to have a material impact on its 
coal ash basin closure plans or compliance requirements under the CCR rule.

In addition to the requirements of the federal CCR regulation, CCR landfills 

and surface impoundments will continue to be independently regulated by 
most states. Cost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the 
normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions and via 
wholesale contracts, which permit recovery of necessary and prudently incurred 
costs associated with Duke Energy’s regulated operations. For more information, 
see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Asset Retirement 
Obligations.” 

PART IICoal Ash Management Act of 2014

AROs recorded on the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress 

Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2017, and December 31, 
2016, include the legal obligation for closure of coal ash basins and the 
disposal of related ash as a result of the Coal Ash Act, the EPA CCR rule 
and other agreements. The Coal Ash Act requires Duke Energy to undertake 
dam improvement projects and to provide access to a permanent alternative 
drinking water source to certain residents within a half-mile of coal ash basin 
compliance boundaries and to certain other potentially impacted residents. The 
legislation requires excavation of the Sutton, Riverbend and Dan River basins 
by August 1, 2019, and Asheville basins by August 1, 2022. Excavation at 
these sites may include a combination of transfer of coal ash to an engineered 
landfill or conversion for beneficial use. Basins at the H.F. Lee, Cape Fear 
and Weatherspoon sites are required to be closed through excavation no later 
than August 1, 2028. Excavation at these sites can include conversion of the 
basin to a lined industrial landfill, transfer of ash to an engineered landfill or 
conversion for beneficial use. The remaining basins are required to be closed no 
later than December 31, 2024, through conversion to a lined industrial landfill, 
transfer to an engineered landfill or conversion for beneficial use, unless certain 
dam improvement projects and alternative drinking water source projects are 
completed by October 15, 2018. Upon satisfactory completion of these projects, 
the closure deadline would be extended to December 31, 2029, and could 
include closure through the combination of a cap system and a groundwater 
monitoring system.

Additionally, the Coal Ash Act requires the installation and operation of 

three large-scale coal ash beneficiation projects to produce reprocessed ash for 
use in the concrete industry. Duke Energy selected the Buck, H.F. Lee and Cape 
Fear plants for these projects. Closure at these sites is required to be completed 
no later than December 31, 2029.

The Coal Ash Act includes a variance procedure for compliance deadlines 

and other issues surrounding the management of CCR and CCR surface 
impoundments and prohibits cost recovery in customer rates for unlawful 
discharge of ash impoundment waters occurring after January 1, 2014. The 
Coal Ash Act leaves the decision on cost recovery determinations related to 
closure of ash impoundments to the normal ratemaking processes before 
utility regulatory commissions. Consistent with the requirements of the Coal 
Ash Act, Duke Energy has submitted comprehensive site assessments and 
groundwater corrective plans to NCDEQ and will submit to NCDEQ site-specific 
coal ash impoundment closure plans in advance of closure. These plans and all 
associated permits must be approved by NCDEQ before closure work can begin.
For further information on AROs, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial 

Statements, “Asset Retirement Obligations.”

Clean Water Act 316(b)

EPA published the final 316(b) cooling water intake structure rule on 

August 15, 2014, with an effective date of October 14, 2014. The rule applies 
to 26 of the electric generating facilities the Duke Energy Registrants own and 
operate. The rule allows for several options to demonstrate compliance and 
provides flexibility to the state environmental permitting agencies to make 
determinations on controls, if any, that will be required for cooling water intake 
structures. Any required intake structure modifications and/or retrofits are 
expected to be installed in the 2019 to 2023 time frame. Petitions challenging 
the rule have been filed by several groups. Oral argument was held on 
September 14, 2017. It is unknown when the courts will rule on the petitions. 
The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters.

Steam Electric Effluent Limitations Guidelines

On January 4, 2016, the final Steam Electric Effluent Limitations 

Guidelines (ELG) rule became effective. The rule establishes new requirements 
for wastewater streams associated with steam electric power generation and 
includes more stringent controls for any new coal plants that may be built in 
the future. As originally written, affected facilities were required to comply 

between 2018 and 2023, depending on the timing of Clean Water Act (CWA) 
discharge permits. Most of the steam electric generating facilities the Duke 
Energy Registrants own are affected sources. The Duke Energy Registrants 
are well-positioned to meet the majority of the requirements of the rule due to 
current efforts to convert to dry ash handling. Petitions challenging the rule have 
been filed by several groups. On March 16, 2015, Duke Energy Indiana filed its 
own legal challenge to the rule with the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals specific 
to the ELG rule focused on the limits imposed on IGCC facilities (gasification 
wastewater). All challenges to the rule were consolidated in the Fifth Circuit 
Court of Appeals. On August 22, 2017, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals granted 
EPA’s Motion to Govern Further Proceedings, thereby severing and suspending 
the claims related to flue gas desulfurization wastewater, bottom ash transport 
water and gasification wastewater. Claims regarding gasification wastewater 
were stayed, pending the issuance of the variance to Duke Energy Indiana. The 
litigation will continue as to claims related to other waste streams.

On August 7, 2017, EPA issued a public notice regarding its proposed 

decision to grant a variance to Duke Energy Indiana for mercury and total 
dissolved solids for gasification wastewater at its Edwardsport facility. The 
public comment period has ended, but EPA has not finalized its decision. 
Separate from the litigation, EPA finalized a rule on September 18, 2017, 
postponing the earliest applicability date for bottom ash transport water and 
flue gas desulfurization wastewater from 2018 to 2020 and retaining the end 
applicability date of 2023. Also, as part of the rule, EPA reiterated its intent to 
review the limitation guidelines for bottom ash transport water and flue gas 
desulfurization wastewater and potentially to conduct a new rulemaking to 
revise those guidelines.

The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters.

Estimated Cost and Impacts of Rulemakings

Duke Energy will incur capital expenditures to comply with the 

environmental regulations and rules discussed above. The following table 
provides five-year estimated costs, excluding AFUDC, of new control equipment 
that may need to be installed on existing power plants primarily to comply 
with the Coal Ash Act requirements for conversion to dry disposal of bottom 
ash and fly ash, CWA 316(b) and ELGs through December 31, 2022. The table 
excludes ash basin closure costs recorded in Asset retirement obligations on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets. For more information related to AROs, see Note 9

The Duke Energy Registrants also expect to incur increased fuel, 
purchased power, operation and maintenance and other expenses, in 
addition to costs for replacement generation for potential coal-fired power 
plant retirements, as a result of these regulations. Actual compliance costs 
incurred may be materially different from these estimates due to reasons 
such as the timing and requirements of EPA regulations and the resolution of 
legal challenges to the rules. The Duke Energy Registrants intend to seek rate 
recovery of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with regulated 
operations to comply with these regulations.

Cross-State Air Pollution Rule

On December 3, 2015, EPA proposed a rule to lower the Cross-State 
Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) Phase 2 state ozone season nitrogen oxide (NOx) 
emission budgets for 23 eastern states, including North Carolina, Ohio, Kentucky 

63

PART IIand Indiana. EPA also proposed to eliminate the CSAPR Phase 2 ozone season 
state NOx budgets for Florida and South Carolina. On September 7, 2016, EPA 
finalized a CSAPR Update Rule that reduces the CSAPR Phase 2 state ozone 
season NOx emission budgets for 22 eastern states, including Ohio, Kentucky 
and Indiana. In the final CSAPR Update Rule, EPA removed Florida, South 
Carolina and North Carolina from the ozone season NOx program. Beginning 
in 2017, Duke Energy Registrants in these states will not be subject to any 
CSAPR ozone season NOx emission limitations. For the states that remain in 
the program, the reduced state ozone season NOx emission budgets took effect 
on May 1, 2017. In Kentucky and Indiana, where Duke Energy Registrants own 
and operate coal-fired electric generating units (EGUs) subject to the final 
rule requirements, near-term responses include changing unit dispatch to run 
certain generating units less frequently and/or purchasing NOx allowances 
from the trading market. Longer term, upgrading the performance of existing 
NOx controls is an option. The Indiana Utility Group and the Indiana Energy 
Association jointly filed a petition for reconsideration asking that EPA correct 
errors it made in calculating the Indiana budget and increase the budget 
accordingly. EPA has yet to act on the petition. Numerous parties have filed 
petitions with the D.C. Circuit Court challenging various aspects of the CSAPR 
Update Rule. Final briefs in the case are due April 9, 2018. The date for oral 
argument has not been established. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict 
the outcome of these matters.

Carbon Pollution Standards for New, Modified and  
Reconstructed Power Plants

On October 23, 2015, EPA published a final rule in the Federal Register 

establishing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions limits for new, modified and 
reconstructed power plants. The requirements for new plants apply to plants 
that commenced construction after January 8, 2014. EPA set an emissions 
standard for coal units of 1,400 pounds of CO2 per gross MWh, which would 
require the application of partial carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology 
for a coal unit to be able to meet the limit. Utility-scale CCS is not currently a 
demonstrated and commercially available technology for coal-fired EGUs, and 
therefore the final standard effectively prevents the development of new coal-
fired generation. EPA set a final standard of 1,000 pounds of CO2 per gross MWh 
for new natural gas combined-cycle units.

On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing 

EPA to review the rule and determine whether to suspend, revise or rescind it. On 
the same day, the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a motion with the D.C. Circuit 
Court requesting that the court stay the litigation of the rule while it is reviewed 
by EPA. Subsequent to the DOJ motion, the D.C. Circuit Court canceled oral 
argument in the case. On August 10, 2017, the court ordered that the litigation 
be suspended indefinitely. The rule remains in effect pending the outcome of 
litigation and EPA’s review. EPA has not announced a schedule for completing 
its review. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these 
matters, but do not expect the impacts of the current final standards will be 
material to Duke Energy’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Clean Power Plan

On October 23, 2015, EPA published in the Federal Register the final Clean 

Power Plan (CPP) rule that regulates CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel-
fired EGUs. The CPP established CO2 emission rates and mass cap goals that 
apply to existing fossil fuel-fired EGUs. Petitions challenging the rule were filed 
by several groups and on February 9, 2016, the Supreme Court issued a stay of 
the final CPP rule, halting implementation of the rule until legal challenges are 
resolved. States in which the Duke Energy Registrants operate have suspended 
work on the CPP in response to the stay. Oral arguments before 10 of the 
11 judges on D.C. Circuit Court were heard on September 27, 2016. The court 
has not issued its opinion in the case.

On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing 

EPA to review the CPP and determine whether to suspend, revise or rescind 
the rule. On the same day, the DOJ filed a motion with the D.C. Circuit Court 

64

requesting that the court stay the litigation of the rule while it is reviewed by 
EPA. On April 28, 2017, the court issued an order to suspend the litigation 
for 60 days. On August 8, 2017, the court, on its own motion, extended the 
suspension of the litigation for an additional 60 days. On October 16, 2017, 
EPA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) to repeal the CPP based 
on a change to EPA’s legal interpretation of the section of the Clean Air Act 
(CAA) on which the CPP was based. In the proposal, EPA indicates that it has 
not determined whether it will issue a rule to replace the CPP, and if it will do 
so, when and what form that rule will take. The comment period on EPA’s NPR 
ends April 26, 2018. On December 28, 2017, EPA issued an Advance Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) in which it seeks public comment on various 
aspects of a potential CPP replacement rule. The comment period on the 
ANPRM ends February 26, 2018. If EPA decides to move forward with a CPP 
replacement rule, it will need to issue a formal proposal for public comment. 
Litigation of the CPP remains on hold in the D.C. Circuit Court and the February 
2016 U.S. Supreme Court stay of the CPP remains in effect. The Duke Energy 
Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters.

Global Climate Change

The Duke Energy Registrants’ greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions consist 
primarily of CO2 and result primarily from operating a fleet of coal-fired and 
natural gas-fired power plants. In 2017, the Duke Energy Registrants’ power 
plants emitted approximately 105 million tons of CO2. Future levels of CO2 
emissions will be influenced by variables that include fuel prices, compliance 
with new or existing regulations, economic conditions that affect electricity 
demand and the technologies deployed to generate the electricity necessary to 
meet the customer demand.

The Duke Energy Registrants have taken actions that have resulted in 
a reduction of CO2 emissions over time. Actions have included the retirement 
of 47 coal-fired EGUs with a combined generating capacity of 5,425 MW. 
Much of that capacity has been replaced with state-of-the-art highly efficient 
natural gas-fired generation that produces far fewer CO2 emissions per unit of 
electricity generated. Duke Energy also has made investments to expand its 
portfolio of wind and solar projects, increase energy efficiency offerings and 
invest in its zero-CO2 emissions hydropower and nuclear plants. These efforts 
have diversified its system and significantly reduced CO2 emissions. Between 
2005 and 2017, the Duke Energy Registrants have collectively lowered the CO2 
emissions from their electricity generation by more than 31 percent, which lowers 
the exposure to any future mandatory CO2 emission reduction requirements 
or carbon tax, whether as a result of federal legislation, EPA regulation, state 
regulation or other as yet unknown emission reduction requirement. Duke 
Energy will continue to explore the use of currently-available and commercially-
demonstrated technology to reduce CO2 emissions, including energy efficiency, 
wind, solar, storage, nuclear and carbon sequestration. Duke Energy will adjust 
to evolving and innovative technologies in a way that balances the reliability 
and affordability that customers expect. Under any future scenario involving 
mandatory CO2 limitations, the Duke Energy Registrants would plan to seek 
recovery of their compliance costs through appropriate regulatory mechanisms.
The Duke Energy Registrants recognize certain groups associate severe 
weather events with increasing levels of GHGs in the atmosphere and forecast 
the possibility these weather events could have a material impact on future 
results of operations should they occur more frequently and with greater 
severity. However, the uncertain nature of potential changes in extreme weather 
events (such as increased frequency, duration and severity), the long period 
of time over which any potential changes might take place and the inability 
to predict potential changes with any degree of accuracy, make estimating 
any potential future financial risk to the Duke Energy Registrants’ operations 
impossible. The Duke Energy Registrants have historically planned and prepared 
for extreme weather events, such as ice storms, tornadoes, hurricanes, severe 
thunderstorms, high winds and droughts they occasionally experience.

The Duke Energy Registrants annually, biannually or triennially prepare 
lengthy, forward-looking “integrated resource plans” (IRPs). These detailed, 
highly technical plans are based on the company’s thorough analysis of 

PART IInumerous factors that can impact the cost of producing and delivering electricity 
that influence long-term resource planning decisions. The IRP process helps to 
evaluate a range of options, taking into account forecasts of future electricity 
demand, fuel prices, transmission improvements, new generating capacity, 
integration of renewables, energy storage, energy efficiency and demand 
response initiatives. The IRP process also helps evaluate potential environmental 
and regulatory scenarios to better mitigate policy and economic risks. The IRPs 
we file with regulators look out 10 to 20 years depending on the jurisdiction.

For a number of years, the Duke Energy Registrants have included a price 

on CO2 emissions in their IRP planning process to account for the potential 
regulation of CO2 emissions. Incorporating a price on CO2 emissions in the 
IRP allows for the evaluation of existing and future resource needs against 
potential climate change policy risk in the absence of policy certainty. One 
of the challenges with using a CO2 price, especially in the absence of a clear 
and certain policy, is determining the appropriate price to use. To address this 
uncertainty and ensure the company remains agile, the Duke Energy Registrants 
typically use a range of potential CO2 prices to reflect a range of potential policy 
outcomes.

The Duke Energy Registrants routinely take steps to reduce the potential 

impact of severe weather events on their electric distribution systems. 
The Duke Energy Registrants’ electric generating facilities are designed to 
withstand extreme weather events without significant damage. The Duke Energy 
Registrants maintain an inventory of coal and oil on-site to mitigate the effects 
of any potential short-term disruption in fuel supply so they can continue to 
provide customers with an uninterrupted supply of electricity.

North Carolina Legislation

In July 2017, the North Carolina General Assembly passed House Bill 589 

and it was subsequently enacted into law by the governor. The law includes, 
among other things, overall reform of the application of Public Utility Regulatory 
Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) for new solar projects in the state, a requirement 
for the utility to procure approximately 2,600 MW of renewable energy through 
a competitive bidding process and recovery of costs related to the competitive 
bidding process through the fuel clause and a competitive procurement rider. 

The law stipulated certain deadlines for Duke Energy to file for NCUC approval of 
programs required under the law. Duke Energy has made some regulatory filings 
since the passage of the law and will continue to implement the requirements of 
House Bill 589.

Nuclear Matters

Following the events at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station in 

Japan, in March 2011, the NRC formed a task force to conduct a comprehensive 
review of processes and regulations to determine whether the agency should 
make additional improvements to the nuclear regulatory system. Subsequently, 
the NRC targeted a set of improvements designed to enhance accident 
mitigation, strengthen emergency preparedness and improve efficiency of 
NRC programs. Pursuant to the findings of the task force, in March 2012, the 
NRC issued three regulatory orders requiring safety enhancements related to 
mitigation strategies to respond to extreme natural events resulting in the loss of 
power at a plant, ensuring reliable hardened containment vents and enhancing 
spent fuel pool instrumentation. Duke Energy is committed to compliance with 
all safety enhancements ordered by the NRC and has completed actions on 
two of the three NRC orders, as required. The remaining order is focused only 
on enhancements to boiling water reactor designs which, for Duke Energy, is 
unique to Brunswick Steam Electric Plant. Actions associated with this third 
order will be completed by March 2019. With the NRC’s continuing review of 
this matter, Duke Energy cannot predict to what extent the NRC will impose 
additional licensing and safety-related requirements or the costs of complying 
with such requirements. Upon receipt of additional guidance from the NRC 
and a collaborative industry review, Duke Energy will be able to determine an 
implementation plan and associated costs. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for 
further discussion of applicable risk factors.

New Accounting Standards

See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Summary of 

Significant Accounting Policies,” for a discussion of the impact of new accounting 
standards.

PART IIREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of  
Duke Energy Corporation

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Duke Energy Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2017 and 
2016, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended 
December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material 
respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in 
the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal 

control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 21, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control 
over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial 
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in 
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to 
assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such 
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the 
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that 
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

PART IIREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholder and the Board of  
Directors of Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2017 and 

2016, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period  
ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all 
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three 
years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial 

statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are 
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities 
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 

assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we 
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over 
financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we 
express no such opinion.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and 

performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

PART IIREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholder and the Board of  
Directors of Duke Energy Progress, LLC

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Duke Energy Progress, LLC and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2017 

and 2016, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period 
ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in 
all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the 
three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial 

statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are 
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities 
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 

assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we 
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over 
financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we 
express no such opinion.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and 

performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating 
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1930.

PART IIREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholder and the Board of  
Directors of Duke Energy Ohio, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Duke Energy Ohio, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2017 and 
2016, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period 
ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in 
all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the 
three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial 

statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are 
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities 
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 

assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we 
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over 
financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we 
express no such opinion.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and 

performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Charlotte, North Carolina 
February 21, 2018 
We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.

PART IIREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholder and the Board of  
Directors of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of 

December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the 
three years in the periods ended December 31, 2017, October 31, 2016, October 31, 2015 and for the 2 months ended December 31, 2016 and the related notes 
(collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the 
Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the periods ended December 31, 
2017, October 31, 2016, October 31, 2015 and for the 2 months ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in 
the United States of America.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial 

statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are 
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities 
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 

assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we 
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over 
financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we 
express no such opinion.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and 

performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Emphasis of Matter

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, effective for fiscal year 2016, the Company changed its fiscal year end from October 31 to December 31. 

This resulted in a 2-month transition period beginning November 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016.

/s/Deloitte & Touche LLP

Charlotte, North Carolina 
February 21, 2018  
We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1951.

Tables within the notes may not sum across due to (i) Progress Energy’s consolidation of Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and other subsidiaries that 

are not registrants and (ii) subsidiaries that are not registrants but included in the consolidated Duke Energy balances.

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

Duke Energy Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, Duke Energy) 

is an energy company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, subject to 
regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Duke Energy 
operates in the United States (U.S.) primarily through its direct and indirect 
subsidiaries. Certain Duke Energy subsidiaries are also subsidiary registrants, 
including Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (Duke Energy Carolinas); Progress 
Energy, Inc. (Progress Energy); Duke Energy Progress, LLC (Duke Energy 
Progress); Duke Energy Florida, LLC (Duke Energy Florida); Duke Energy Ohio, 
Inc. (Duke Energy Ohio); Duke Energy Indiana, LLC (Duke Energy Indiana) 
and Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. (Piedmont). When discussing 
Duke Energy’s consolidated financial information, it necessarily includes the 
results of its seven separate subsidiary registrants (collectively referred to 
as the Subsidiary Registrants), which along with Duke Energy, are collectively 
referred to as the Duke Energy Registrants.

In October 2016, Duke Energy completed the acquisition of Piedmont. 

Duke Energy’s consolidated financial statements include Piedmont’s results of 
operations and cash flows activity subsequent to the acquisition date. Effective 
November 1, 2016, Piedmont’s fiscal year-end was changed from October 31 
to December 31, the year-end of Duke Energy. A transition report was filed on 
Form 10-Q (Form 10-QT) as of December 31, 2016, for the transition period 
from November 1, 2016, to December 31, 2016. See Note 2 for additional 
information regarding the acquisition. 

In December 2016, Duke Energy completed an exit of the Latin American 
market to focus on its domestic regulated business, which was further bolstered 
by the acquisition of Piedmont. The sale of the International Energy business 
segment, excluding an equity method investment in National Methanol Company 
(NMC), was completed through two transactions including a sale of assets 
in Brazil to China Three Gorges (Luxembourg) Energy S.à.r.l. (CTG) and a sale 
of Duke Energy’s remaining Latin American assets in Peru, Chile, Ecuador, 
Guatemala, El Salvador and Argentina to ISQ Enerlam Aggregator, L.P. and 
Enerlam (UK) Holding Ltd. (I Squared) (collectively, the International Disposal 
Group). See Note 2 for additional information on the sale of International Energy. 

The information in these combined notes relates to each of the Duke 
Energy Registrants as noted in the Index to Combined Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements. However, none of the Subsidiary Registrants make any 
representation as to information related solely to Duke Energy or the Subsidiary 
Registrants of Duke Energy other than itself.

These Consolidated Financial Statements include, after eliminating 
intercompany transactions and balances, the accounts of the Duke Energy 
Registrants and subsidiaries where the respective Duke Energy Registrants 
have control. These Consolidated Financial Statements also reflect the Duke 
Energy Registrants’ proportionate share of certain jointly owned generation and 
transmission facilities. Substantially all of the Subsidiary Registrants’ operations 
qualify for regulatory accounting.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Use of Estimates

In preparing financial statements that conform to generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP) in the U.S., the Duke Energy Registrants must 
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets 
and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses and the 
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 
statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Regulatory Accounting

The majority of the Duke Energy Registrants’ operations are subject to price 

regulation for the sale of electricity and natural gas by state utility commissions 
or FERC. When prices are set on the basis of specific costs of the regulated 
operations and an effective franchise is in place such that sufficient natural 
gas or electric services can be sold to recover those costs, the Duke Energy 
Registrants apply regulatory accounting. Regulatory accounting changes the timing 
of the recognition of costs or revenues relative to a company that does not apply 
regulatory accounting. As a result, regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are 
recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Regulatory assets and liabilities 
are amortized consistent with the treatment of the related cost in the ratemaking 
process. See Note 4 for further information.

Regulatory accounting rules also require recognition of a disallowance 
(also called “impairment”) loss if it becomes probable that part of the cost 
of a plant under construction (or a recently completed plant or an abandoned 
plant) will be disallowed for ratemaking purposes and a reasonable estimate of 
the amount of the disallowance can be made. These disallowances can require 
judgments on allowed future rate recovery.

When it becomes probable that regulated generation, transmission or 
distribution assets will be abandoned, the cost of the asset is removed from 
plant in service. The value that may be retained as a regulatory asset on the

balance sheet for the abandoned property is dependent upon amounts that 
may be recovered through regulated rates, including any return. As such, an 
impairment charge could be partially or fully offset by the establishment of a 
regulatory asset if rate recovery is probable. The impairment for a disallowance 
of costs for regulated plants under construction, recently completed or 
abandoned is based on discounted cash flows.

Regulated Fuel and Purchased Gas Adjustment Clauses

The Duke Energy Registrants utilize cost-tracking mechanisms, commonly 

referred to as fuel adjustment clauses or purchased gas adjustment clauses 
(PGA). These clauses allow for the recovery of fuel and fuel-related costs, portions 
of purchased power, natural gas costs and hedging costs through surcharges on 
customer rates. The difference between the costs incurred and the surcharge 
revenues is recorded either as an adjustment to Operating Revenues, Operating 
Expenses – Fuel used in electric generation or Operating Expenses – Cost of 
natural gas on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, with an off-setting 
impact on regulatory assets or liabilities.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the 

date of acquisition are considered cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash

The Duke Energy Registrants have restricted cash related primarily to 

collateral assets, escrow deposits and variable interest entities (VIEs). Restricted 
cash balances are reflected in Other within Current Assets and in Other within 
Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 
2017, and 2016, Duke Energy had restricted cash totaling $147 million and 
$137 million, respectively.

Inventory is used for operations and is recorded primarily using the average cost method. Inventory related to regulated operations is valued at historical 

cost. Inventory related to nonregulated operations is valued at the lower of cost or market. Materials and supplies are recorded as inventory when purchased and 
subsequently charged to expense or capitalized to property, plant and equipment when installed. Inventory, including excess or obsolete inventory, is written-down to 
the lower of cost or market value. Once inventory has been written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. Provisions 
for inventory write-offs were not material at December 31, 2017, and 2016. The components of inventory are presented in the tables below.

Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

The Duke Energy Registrants classify investments into two categories – 
trading and available-for-sale. Both categories are recorded at fair value on 
the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on 
trading securities are included in earnings. For certain investments of regulated 
operations, such as substantially all of the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds 
(NDTF), realized and unrealized gains and losses (including any other-than-
temporary impairments (OTTIs)) on available-for-sale securities are recorded as 
a regulatory asset or liability. Otherwise, unrealized gains and losses are included 
in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), unless other-than-
temporarily impaired. OTTIs for equity securities and the credit loss portion of 
debt securities of nonregulated operations are included in earnings. Investments 
in debt and equity securities are classified as either current or noncurrent 
based on management’s intent and ability to sell these securities, taking into 
consideration current market liquidity. See Note 15 for further information.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill

Effective with Piedmont’s change in fiscal year end to December 31, as 

discussed above, Piedmont changed the date of its annual impairment testing of 
goodwill from October 31 to August 31 to align with the other Duke Energy Registrants.
Duke Energy, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Ohio and Piedmont perform 

annual goodwill impairment tests as of August 31 each year at the reporting unit 
level, which is determined to be an operating segment or one level below. Duke 

115

Energy, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Ohio and Piedmont update these tests 
between annual tests if events or circumstances occur that would more likely 
than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets are included in Other in Other Noncurrent Assets on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, intangible assets are amortized using 
an amortization method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits 
of the intangible asset are consumed or on a straight-line basis if that pattern is 
not readily determinable. Amortization of intangibles is reflected in Depreciation 
and amortization on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Intangible 
assets are subject to impairment testing and if impaired, the carrying value is 
accordingly reduced.

Emission allowances permit the holder of the allowance to emit certain 
gaseous byproducts of fossil fuel combustion, including sulfur dioxide (SO2) and 
nitrogen oxide (NOX). Allowances are issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) at zero cost and may also be bought and sold via third-party 
transactions. Allowances allocated to or acquired by the Duke Energy Registrants are 
held primarily for consumption. Carrying amounts for emission allowances are based 
on the cost to acquire the allowances or, in the case of a business combination, 
on the fair value assigned in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired 
business. Emission allowances are expensed to Fuel used in electric generation and 
purchased power on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  

Renewable energy certificates are used to measure compliance with 

renewable energy standards and are held primarily for consumption. See Note 11 
for further information.

The Duke Energy Registrants evaluate long-lived assets, excluding 

goodwill, for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of 
those assets may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when a long-lived 
asset’s carrying value exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected 
to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. The estimated 
cash flows may be based on alternative expected outcomes that are probability 
weighted. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset is not recoverable 
based on these estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the carrying value 
of the asset is written-down to its then-current estimated fair value and an 
impairment charge is recognized.

The Duke Energy Registrants assess fair value of long-lived assets using 

various methods, including recent comparable third-party sales, internally 
developed discounted cash flow analysis and analysis from outside advisors. 
Triggering events to reassess cash flows may include, but are not limited 
to, significant changes in commodity prices, the condition of an asset or 
management’s interest in selling the asset.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at the lower of depreciated 

historical cost net of any disallowances or fair value, if impaired. The Duke Energy 
Registrants capitalize all construction-related direct labor and material costs, 
as well as indirect construction costs such as general engineering, taxes and 
financing costs. See “Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) 
and Interest Capitalized” for information on capitalized financing costs. Costs 
of renewals and betterments that extend the useful life of property, plant and 
equipment are also capitalized. The cost of repairs, replacements and major 
maintenance projects, which do not extend the useful life or increase the expected 
output of the asset, are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is generally computed 
over the estimated useful life of the asset using the composite straight-line 
method. Depreciation studies are conducted periodically to update composite 
rates and are approved by state utility commissions and/or the FERC when 
required. The composite weighted average depreciation rates, excluding nuclear 
fuel, are included in the table that follows.

probable the asset will be retired substantially in advance of its original 
expected useful life or is abandoned, the cost of the asset and the corresponding 
accumulated depreciation is recognized as a separate asset. If the asset is still 
in operation, the net amount is classified as Generation facilities to be retired, 
net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the asset is no longer operating, 
the net amount is classified in Regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheets if deemed recoverable (see discussion of long-lived asset impairments 
above). When it becomes probable an asset will be abandoned, the cost of the 
asset and accumulated depreciation is reclassified to Regulatory assets on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets for amounts recoverable in rates. The carrying 
value of the asset is based on historical cost if the Duke Energy Registrants are 
allowed to recover the remaining net book value and a return equal to at least 
the incremental borrowing rate. If not, an impairment is recognized to the extent 
the net book value of the asset exceeds the present value of future revenues 
discounted at the incremental borrowing rate.

When the Duke Energy Registrants sell entire regulated operating units, 

or retire or sell nonregulated properties, the original cost and accumulated 
depreciation and amortization balances are removed from Property, Plant and 
Equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any gain or loss is recorded in 
earnings, unless otherwise required by the applicable regulatory body.

See Note 10 for further information.

Nuclear Fuel

Nuclear fuel is classified as Property, Plant and Equipment on the 

Consolidated Balance Sheets, except for Duke Energy Florida. Nuclear fuel 
amounts at Duke Energy Florida were reclassified to Regulatory assets pursuant 
to the Revised and Restated Stipulation and Settlement Agreement approved in 
November 2013 among Duke Energy Florida, the Florida Office of Public Counsel 
(Florida OPC) and other customer advocates (the 2013 Settlement).

Nuclear fuel in the front-end fuel processing phase is considered work 
in progress and not amortized until placed in service. Amortization of nuclear 
fuel is included within Fuel used in electric generation and purchased power on 
the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amortization is recorded using the 
units-of-production method.

respectively.

In general, when the Duke Energy Registrants retire regulated property, 

plant and equipment, the original cost plus the cost of retirement, less salvage 
value, is charged to accumulated depreciation. However, when it becomes 

116

For regulated operations, the debt and equity costs of financing the 
construction of property, plant and equipment are reflected as AFUDC and 
capitalized as a component of the cost of property, plant and equipment. AFUDC 
equity is reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as non-cash 
income in Other income and expenses, net. AFUDC debt is reported as a non-
cash offset to Interest Expense. After construction is completed, the Duke Energy 
Registrants are permitted to recover these costs through their inclusion in rate 
base and the corresponding subsequent depreciation or amortization of those 
regulated assets.

AFUDC equity, a permanent difference for income taxes, reduces 

the effective tax rate (ETR) when capitalized and increases the ETR when 
depreciated or amortized. See Note 22 for additional information.

For nonregulated operations, interest is capitalized during the 

construction phase with an offsetting non-cash credit to Interest Expense on the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Asset retirement obligations (AROs) are recognized for legal obligations 
associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment. Substantially 
all AROs are related to regulated operations. When recording an ARO, the 
present value of the projected liability is recognized in the period in which it 
is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The liability is 
accreted over time. For operating plants, the present value of the liability is 
added to the cost of the associated asset and depreciated over the remaining 
life of the asset. For retired plants, the present value of the liability is recorded 
as a regulatory asset unless determined not to be recoverable.

The present value of the initial obligation and subsequent updates are 
based on discounted cash flows, which include estimates regarding timing of 
future cash flows, selection of discount rates and cost escalation rates, among 
other factors. These estimates are subject to change. Depreciation expense is 
adjusted prospectively for any changes to the carrying amount of the associated 
asset. The Duke Energy Registrants receive amounts to fund the cost of the 
ARO for regulated operations through a combination of regulated revenues and 
earnings on the NDTF. As a result, amounts recovered in regulated revenues, 
earnings on the NDTF, accretion expense and depreciation of the associated 
asset are netted and deferred as a regulatory asset or liability.

Obligations for nuclear decommissioning are based on site-specific cost 

studies. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress assume prompt 
dismantlement of the nuclear facilities after operations are ceased. Duke Energy 
Florida assumes Crystal River Unit 3 Nuclear Plant (Crystal River Unit 3) will be 
placed into a safe storage configuration until eventual dismantlement is completed 
by 2074. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida 
also assume that spent fuel will be stored on-site until such time that it can be 
transferred to a yet to be built U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) facility.

Obligations for closure of ash basins are based upon discounted cash 

flows of estimated costs for site-specific plans, if known, or probability 
weightings of the potential closure methods if the closure plans are under 
development and multiple closure options are being considered and evaluated 
on a site-by-site basis. See Note 9 for additional information.

Revenue Recognition and Unbilled Revenue

Revenues on sales of electricity and natural gas are recognized when 

service is provided or the product is delivered. Unbilled revenues are recognized 
by applying customer billing rates to the estimated volumes of energy or natural 
gas delivered but not yet billed. Unbilled revenues can vary significantly from 
period to period as a result of seasonality, weather, customer usage patterns, 
customer mix, average price in effect for customer classes, timing of rendering 
customer bills and meter reading schedules, and the impact of weather 
normalization or margin decoupling mechanisms.

Unbilled revenues are included within Receivables and Receivables of 

VIEs on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as shown in the following table.

Derivatives and Hedging

Derivative and non-derivative instruments may be used in connection 
with commodity price and interest rate activities, including swaps, futures, 
forwards and options. All derivative instruments, except those that qualify 
for the normal purchase/normal sale (NPNS) exception, are recorded on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Qualifying derivative instruments may 
be designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. Other derivative 
instruments (undesignated contracts) either have not been designated or do not 
qualify as hedges. The effective portion of the change in the fair value of cash 
flow hedges is recorded in AOCI. The effective portion of the change in the fair 
value of a fair value hedge is offset in net income by changes in the hedged 
item. For activity subject to regulatory accounting, gains and losses on derivative 
contracts are reflected as regulatory assets or liabilities and not as other 
comprehensive income or current period income. As a result, changes in fair 
value of these derivatives have no immediate earnings impact.

Formal documentation, including transaction type and risk management 

strategy, is maintained for all contracts accounted for as a hedge. At inception and 
at least every three months thereafter, the hedge contract is assessed to see if it is 
highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items.

See Note 14 for further information.

Duke Energy has captive insurance subsidiaries that provide coverage, on 
an indemnity basis, to the Subsidiary Registrants as well as certain third parties, 
on a limited basis, for financial losses, primarily related to property, workers’ 
compensation and general liability. Liabilities include provisions for estimated 
losses incurred but not yet reported (IBNR), as well as estimated provisions for 
known claims. IBNR reserve estimates are primarily based upon historical loss 
experience, industry data and other actuarial assumptions. Reserve estimates 
are adjusted in future periods as actual losses differ from experience.

Duke Energy, through its captive insurance entities, also has reinsurance 

coverage with third parties for certain losses above a per occurrence and/or 
aggregate retention. Receivables for reinsurance coverage are recognized when 
realization is deemed probable.

Unamortized Debt Premium, Discount and Expense

Premiums, discounts and expenses incurred with the issuance of 

outstanding long-term debt are amortized over the term of the debt issue. The 
gain or loss on extinguishment associated with refinancing higher-cost debt 
obligations in the regulated operations is amortized. Amortization expense is 
recorded as Interest Expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations 
and is reflected as Depreciation, amortization and accretion within Net cash 
provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Premiums, discounts and expenses are presented as an adjustment to 
the carrying value of the debt amount and included in Long-Term Debt on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets presented.

Loss Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities

Contingent losses are recorded when it is probable a loss has occurred 

and can be reasonably estimated. When a range of the probable loss exists and 
no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the 
minimum amount in the range is recorded. Unless otherwise required by GAAP, 
legal fees are expensed as incurred.

Environmental liabilities are recorded on an undiscounted basis when 
environmental remediation or other liabilities become probable and can be 
reasonably estimated. Environmental expenditures related to past operations 
that do not generate current or future revenues are expensed. Environmental 
expenditures related to operations that generate current or future revenues are 
expensed or capitalized, as appropriate. Certain environmental expenditures 
receive regulatory accounting treatment and are recorded as regulatory assets.

See Notes 4 and 5 for further information.

Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans

Duke Energy maintains qualified, non-qualified and other post-retirement 

benefit plans. Eligible employees of the Subsidiary Registrants participate in 
the respective qualified, non-qualified and other post-retirement benefit plans 
and the Subsidiary Registrants are allocated their proportionate share of benefit 
costs. See Note 21 for further information, including significant accounting 
policies associated with these plans.

Severance and Special Termination Benefits

Duke Energy has severance plans under which, in general, the longer 
a terminated employee worked prior to termination the greater the amount 

118

of severance benefits. A liability for involuntary severance is recorded once 
an involuntary severance plan is committed to by management if involuntary 
severances are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For involuntary 
severance benefits incremental to its ongoing severance plan benefits, the fair 
value of the obligation is expensed at the communication date if there are no 
future service requirements or over the required future service period. From 
time to time, Duke Energy offers special termination benefits under voluntary 
severance programs. Special termination benefits are recorded immediately upon 
employee acceptance absent a significant retention period. Otherwise, the cost 
is recorded over the remaining service period. Employee acceptance of voluntary 
severance benefits is determined by management based on the facts and 
circumstances of the benefits being offered. See Note 19 for further information.

Guarantees

If necessary, liabilities are recognized at the time of issuance or material 

modification of a guarantee for the estimated fair value of the obligation it 
assumes. Fair value is estimated using a probability-weighted approach. The 
obligation is reduced over the term of the guarantee or related contract in a 
systematic and rational method as risk is reduced. Any additional contingent 
loss for guarantee contracts subsequent to the initial recognition of a liability 
is accounted for and recognized at the time a loss is probable and can be 
reasonably estimated. See Note 7 for further information.

Stock-Based Compensation

Stock-based compensation represents costs related to stock-based 
awards granted to employees and Duke Energy Board of Directors (Board 
of Directors) members. Duke Energy recognizes stock-based compensation 
based upon the estimated fair value of awards, net of estimated forfeitures at 
the date of issuance. The recognition period for these costs begins at either 
the applicable service inception date or grant date and continues throughout 
the requisite service period. Compensation cost is recognized as expense or 
capitalized as a component of property, plant and equipment. See Note 20 for 
further information.

Income Taxes

Duke Energy and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income 
tax return and other state and foreign jurisdictional returns. The Subsidiary 
Registrants are parties to a tax-sharing agreement with Duke Energy. Income 
taxes recorded represent amounts the Subsidiary Registrants would incur 
as separate C-Corporations. Deferred income taxes have been provided for 
temporary differences between GAAP and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
because the differences create taxable or tax-deductible amounts for future 
periods. Investment tax credits (ITCs) associated with regulated operations are 
deferred and amortized as a reduction of income tax expense over the estimated 
useful lives of the related properties.

Accumulated deferred income taxes are valued using the enacted tax rate 

expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax 
asset or liability is expected to be settled or realized. In the event of a change in 
tax rates, deferred tax assets and liabilities are remeasured as of the enactment 
date of the new rate. To the extent that the change in the value of the deferred 
tax represents an obligation to customers, the impact of the remeasurement 
is deferred to a regulatory liability. Remaining impacts are recorded in income 
from continuing operations. Other impacts of the Tax Act have been recorded on 

PART IIDUKE ENERGY CORPORATION • DUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS, LLC • PROGRESS ENERGY, INC. • DUKE ENERGY PROGRESS, LLC •  DUKE ENERGY FLORIDA, LLC • DUKE ENERGY OHIO, INC. • DUKE ENERGY INDIANA, LLC • PIEDMONT NATURAL GAS COMPANY, INC.Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)a provisional basis, see Note 22, “Income Taxes,” for additional information. If 
Duke Energy’s estimate of the tax effect of reversing temporary differences is 
not reflective of actual outcomes, is modified to reflect new developments or 
interpretations of the tax law, revised to incorporate new accounting principles, 
or changes in the expected timing or manner of the reversal then Duke Energy’s 
results of operations could be impacted.

Tax-related interest and penalties are recorded in Interest Expense and 
Other Income and Expenses, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

See Note 22 for further information.

Accounting for Renewable Energy Tax Credits

When Duke Energy receives ITCs on wind or solar facilities, it reduces 
the basis of the property recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets by the 
amount of the ITC and, therefore, the ITC benefit is ultimately recognized in the 
statement of operations through reduced depreciation expense. Additionally, 
certain tax credits and government grants result in an initial tax depreciable 
base in excess of the book carrying value by an amount equal to one half of the 
ITC. Deferred tax benefits are recorded as a reduction to income tax expense in 
the period that the basis difference is created.

Excise Taxes

Certain excise taxes levied by state or local governments are required to 

be paid even if not collected from the customer. These taxes are recognized on a 
gross basis. Otherwise, the taxes are accounted for net. Excise taxes accounted 
for on a gross basis within both Operating Revenues and Property and other 
taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations were as follows.

Dividend Restrictions and Unappropriated Retained Earnings

Duke Energy does not have any legal, regulatory or other restrictions on 

paying common stock dividends to shareholders. However, as further described 
in Note 4, due to conditions established by regulators in conjunction with merger 
transaction approvals, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke 
Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont have restrictions on paying 
dividends or otherwise advancing funds to Duke Energy. At December 31, 
2017, and 2016, an insignificant amount of Duke Energy’s consolidated 
Retained earnings balance represents undistributed earnings of equity method 
investments.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

The new accounting standards adopted for 2017 and 2016 had no 

material impact on the presentation or results of operations, cash flows or 
financial position of the Duke Energy Registrants. The following accounting 
standards were adopted by the Duke Energy Registrants during 2017.

Stock-Based Compensation and Income Taxes. In first quarter 2017, 
Duke Energy adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidance, 
which revised the accounting for stock-based compensation and the associated 
income taxes. The adopted guidance changed certain aspects of accounting for 
stock-based payment awards to employees including the accounting for income 
taxes and classification on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The 
primary impact to Duke Energy as a result of implementing this guidance was a 
cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings for tax benefits not previously 
recognized and additional income tax expense for the 12 months ended 
December 31, 2017. See the Duke Energy Consolidated Statements of Changes 
in Equity for further information.

Goodwill Impairment. In January 2017, the FASB issued revised 

guidance for the subsequent measurement of goodwill. Under the guidance, 
a company will recognize an impairment to goodwill for the amount by which 
a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, not to 
exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Duke Energy early 
adopted this guidance for the 2017 annual goodwill impairment test.

The following new accounting standards have been issued, but have not 

yet been adopted by the Duke Energy Registrants, as of December 31, 2017.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In May 2014, the FASB 

issued revised accounting guidance for revenue recognition from contracts with 
customers. The core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize 
revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an 
amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled 
in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in this update also 
require disclosure of sufficient information to allow users to understand the 
nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from 
contracts with customers.

Duke Energy has identified material revenue streams, which served as 

the basis for accounting analysis and documentation of the impact of this 
guidance on revenue recognition. The accounting analysis included reviewing 
representative contracts and tariffs for each material revenue stream. Most of 
Duke Energy’s revenue will be in scope of the new guidance. The majority of 
our sales, including energy provided to residential customers, are from tariff 
offerings that provide natural gas or electricity without a defined contractual 
term (“at-will”). For such arrangements, revenue from contracts with customers 
will be equivalent to the electricity or natural gas supplied and billed in that 
period (including estimated billings). As such, there will not be a significant shift 
in the timing or pattern of revenue recognition for such sales.

Also included in the accounting analysis was the evaluation of certain 

long-term revenue streams including electric wholesale contracts and 
renewables power purchase agreements (PPAs). For such arrangements, Duke 
Energy does not expect material changes to the pattern of revenue recognition 
on the registrants. In addition, Duke Energy has monitored the activities 
of the power and utilities industry revenue recognition task force including 
draft accounting positions released in October 2017 and the impact, if any, 
on Duke Energy’s specific contracts and conclusions. Potential revisions to 
processes, policies and controls, primarily related to evaluating supplemental 
disclosures required as a result of adopting this guidance, will be evaluated and 
implemented as necessary. Some revenue arrangements, such as alternative 
revenue programs and certain PPAs accounted for as leases, are excluded

accounted for and evaluated for separate presentation and disclosure under 
other relevant accounting guidance.

Duke Energy intends to use the modified retrospective method of adoption 
effective January 1, 2018. Under the modified retrospective method of adoption, 
prior year reported results are not restated and a cumulative-effect adjustment, 
if applicable, is recorded to retained earnings at January 1, 2018, as if the 
standard had always been in effect. In addition, disclosures, if applicable, include 
a comparison to what would have been reported for 2018 under the previous 
revenue recognition rules to assist financial statement users in understanding 
how revenue recognition has changed as a result of this standard and to facilitate 
comparability with prior year reported results, which are not restated under the 
modified retrospective approach as described above. Duke Energy will utilize 
certain practical expedients including applying this guidance to open contracts 
at the date of adoption and recognizing revenues for certain contracts under the 
invoice practical expedient, which allows revenue recognition to be consistent with 
invoiced amounts (including estimated billings) provided certain criteria are met, 
including consideration of whether the invoiced amounts reasonably represent the 
value provided to customers. While the adoption of this guidance is not expected 
to have a material impact on either the timing or amount of revenues recognized 
in Duke Energy’s financial statements, Duke Energy anticipates additional 
disclosures around the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenues 
and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Duke Energy continues 
to evaluate what information will be most useful for users of the financial 
statements, including information already provided in disclosures outside of the 
financial statement footnotes. These additional disclosures are expected to include 
the disaggregation of revenues by customer class.

Financial Instruments Classification and Measurement. In January 
2016, the FASB issued revised accounting guidance for the classification and 
measurement of financial instruments. Changes in the fair value of all equity 
securities will be required to be recorded in net income. Current GAAP allows 
some changes in fair value for available-for-sale equity securities to be recorded 
in AOCI. Additional disclosures will be required to present separately the financial 
assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial 
asset. An entity’s equity investments that are accounted for under the equity 
method of accounting are not included within the scope of the new guidance.

For Duke Energy, the revised accounting guidance is effective for interim 

and annual periods beginning January 1, 2018, by recording a cumulative 
effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. This guidance is 
expected to have minimal impact on the Duke Energy Registrant’s Consolidated 
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income as changes in the 
fair value of most of the Duke Energy Registrants’ available-for-sale equity 
securities are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities pursuant to accounting 
guidance for regulated operations.

Leases. In February 2016, the FASB issued revised accounting guidance 
for leases. The core principle of this guidance is that a lessee should recognize 
the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on the balance sheet.

For Duke Energy, this guidance is effective for interim and annual 

periods beginning January 1, 2019. The guidance is applied using a modified 
retrospective approach. Upon adoption, Duke Energy expects to elect the 
practical expedients, which would require no reassessment of whether 
existing contracts are or contain leases as well as no reassessment of lease 
classification for existing leases. Additionally, we expect to adopt the optional 
transition practical expedient allowing the entity not to reassess the accounting 
for land easements that currently exist at the adoption of the lease standard on 
January 1, 2019. Duke Energy is currently evaluating the financial statement 
impact of adopting this standard and is continuing to monitor industry 
implementation issues, including easements, pole attachments and renewable 

120

PPAs. Other than an expected increase in assets and liabilities, the ultimate 
impact of the new standard has not yet been determined. Significant system 
enhancements, including additional processes and controls, will be required 
to facilitate the identification, tracking and reporting of potential leases based 
upon requirements of the new lease standard. Duke Energy has begun the 
implementation of a third-party software tool to help with the adoption and 
ongoing accounting under the new standard.

Statement of Cash Flows. In November 2016, the FASB issued revised 

accounting guidance to reduce diversity in practice for the presentation 
and classification of restricted cash on the statement of cash flows. Under 
the updated guidance, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents will 
be included within beginning-of-period and end-of-period cash and cash 
equivalents on the statement of cash flows.

For Duke Energy, this guidance is effective for the interim and annual 

periods beginning January 1, 2018. The guidance will be applied using a 
retrospective transition method to each period presented. Upon adoption by 
Duke Energy, the revised guidance will result in a change to the amount of 
cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash explained when reconciling 
the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the 
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Prior to adoption, the Duke Energy 
Registrants reflect changes in restricted cash within Cash Flows from 
Investing Activities and within Cash Flows from Operating Activities on the 
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. As a result of this change, our Cash 
and cash equivalents balance on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows 
as of December 31, 2017 will change by $147 million.

Retirement Benefits. In March 2017, the FASB issued revised accounting 
guidance for the presentation of net periodic costs related to benefit plans. Current 
GAAP permits the aggregation of all the components of net periodic costs on the 
Consolidated Statement of Operations and does not require the disclosure of the 
location of net periodic costs on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Under 
the amended guidance, the service cost component of net periodic costs must 
be included within Operating Income within the same line as other compensation 
expenses. All other components of net periodic costs must be outside of 
Operating Income. In addition, the updated guidance permits only the service cost 
component of net periodic costs to be capitalized to Inventory or Property, Plant 
and Equipment. This represents a change from current GAAP, which permits all 
components of net periodic costs to be capitalized. These amendments should 
be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the various components of net 
periodic costs and prospectively for the change in eligible costs to be capitalized. 
The guidance allows for a practical expedient that permits a company to use 
amounts disclosed in prior-period financial statements as the estimation basis for 
applying the retrospective presentation requirements.

For Duke Energy, this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods 

beginning January 1, 2018. Duke Energy currently presents the total non-
capitalized net periodic costs within Operation, maintenance and other on the 
Consolidated Statement of Operations. The adoption of this guidance will result 
in a retrospective change to reclassify the presentation of the non-service cost 
(benefit) components of net periodic costs to Other income and expenses. Duke 
Energy intends to utilize the practical expedient for retrospective presentation. 
The change in net periodic costs eligible for capitalization is applicable 
prospectively. Since Duke Energy’s service cost component is expected to be 
greater than the total net periodic costs, the change will result in increased 
capitalization of net periodic costs, higher Operation, maintenance and other 
and higher Other income and expenses. The resulting impact to Duke Energy 
is expected to be an immaterial increase in Net Income resulting from the 
limitation of eligible capitalization of net periodic costs to the service cost 
component, which is larger than the total net periodic costs.

 ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

ACQUISITIONS

The Duke Energy Registrants consolidate assets and liabilities from 

acquisitions as of the purchase date and include earnings from acquisitions in 
consolidated earnings after the purchase date.

2016 Acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas

On October 3, 2016, Duke Energy acquired all outstanding common 

stock of Piedmont for a total cash purchase price of $5.0 billion and assumed 
Piedmont’s existing long-term debt, which had a fair value of approximately 
$2.0 billion at the time of the acquisition. The acquisition provides a 
foundation for Duke Energy to establish a broader, long-term strategic natural 
gas infrastructure platform to complement its existing natural gas pipeline 
investments and regulated natural gas business in the Midwest. In connection 
with the closing of the acquisition, Piedmont became a wholly owned subsidiary 
of Duke Energy.

Purchase Price Allocation

The purchase price allocation of the Piedmont acquisition is as follows:

5,000

The fair value of Piedmont’s assets and liabilities was determined based 

on significant estimates and assumptions that are judgmental in nature, including 
the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rates reflecting risk 
inherent in the future cash flows and market prices of long-term debt.

The majority of Piedmont’s operations are subject to the rate-setting 

authority of the NCUC, the PSCSC and the TPUC and are accounted for pursuant to 
accounting guidance for regulated operations. The rate-setting and cost recovery 
provisions currently in place for Piedmont’s regulated operations provide revenues 
derived from costs, including a return on investment of assets and liabilities 
included in rate base. Thus, the fair value of Piedmont’s assets and liabilities 
subject to these rate-setting provisions approximates the pre-acquisition carrying 
values and does not reflect any net valuation adjustments. 

The significant assets and liabilities for which valuation adjustments 

were reflected within the purchase price allocation include the acquired equity 
method investments and long-term debt. The difference between the fair value 
and the pre-merger carrying values of long-term debt for regulated operations 
was recorded as a regulatory asset.

The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of Piedmont’s assets 

and liabilities on the acquisition date was recorded as goodwill. The goodwill 

reflects the value paid by Duke Energy primarily for establishing a broader, 
long-term strategic natural gas infrastructure growth platform, an improved risk 
profile and expected synergies resulting from the combined entities.

Under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, Duke 

Energy elected not to apply push down accounting to the stand-alone Piedmont 
financial statements.

Accounting Charges Related to the Acquisition

Duke Energy incurred pretax non-recurring transaction and integration costs 
associated with the acquisition of $103 million, $439 million and $9 million for the 
years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Amounts recorded 
on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2017 were primarily system 
integration costs of $71 million related to combining the various operational and 
financial systems of Duke Energy and Piedmont, including a one-time software 
impairment resulting from planned accounting system and process integration. 
A $7 million charge was recorded within Impairment Charges, with the remaining 
$64 million recorded within Operation, maintenance and other.

Amounts recorded in 2016 include:

• Interest expense of $234 million related to the acquisition financing, 
including realized losses on forward-starting interest rate swaps of 
$190 million. See Note 14 for additional information on the swaps.

• Charges of $104 million related to commitments made in conjunction 

with the transaction, including charitable contributions and a one-
time bill credit to Piedmont customers. $10 million was recorded as 
a reduction in Operating Revenues, with the remaining $94 million 
recorded within Operation, maintenance and other.

• Other transaction and integration costs of $101 million recorded to 
Operation, maintenance and other, including professional fees and 
severance.

The majority of transition and integration activities are expected to be 

completed by the end of 2018.

Pro Forma Financial Information

The following unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the 

combined results of operations of Duke Energy and Piedmont as if the merger 
had occurred as of January 1, 2015. The pro forma financial information does 
not include potential cost savings, intercompany revenues, Piedmont’s earnings 
from a certain equity method investment sold immediately prior to the merger 
or non-recurring transaction and integration costs incurred by Duke Energy and 
Piedmont. The after-tax non-recurring transaction and integration costs incurred 
by Duke Energy and Piedmont were $279 million and $19 million for the years 
ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively.

This information has been presented for illustrative purposes only and is not 

necessarily indicative of the consolidated results of operations that would have 
been achieved or the future consolidated results of operations of Duke Energy.

Acquisition Related Financings and Other Matters

Duke Energy financed the Piedmont acquisition with a combination of debt 

and equity issuances and other cash sources, including:

• $3.75 billion of long-term debt issued in August 2016.

• $750 million borrowed under the $1.5 billion short-term loan facility in 

September 2016, which was repaid in December 2016.

• 10.6 million shares of common stock issued in October 2016 for net 

cash proceeds of approximately $723 million.

The $4.9 billion senior unsecured bridge financing facility (Bridge Facility) 

with Barclays Capital, Inc. (Barclays) was terminated following the issuance 
of the long-term debt. For additional information related to the debt and 
equity issuances, see Notes 6 and 18, respectively. For additional information 
regarding Duke Energy’s and Piedmont’s joint investment in Atlantic Coast 
Pipeline, LLC (ACP), see Note 4.

foreign currency translation adjustments. 

2016 Sale of International Energy

In February 2016, Duke Energy announced it had initiated a process 
to divest its International Energy businesses, excluding the equity method 
investment in NMC (the International Disposal Group), and in October 2016, 
announced it had entered into two separate purchase and sale agreements to 
execute the divestiture. Both sales closed in December of 2016, resulting in 
available cash proceeds of $1.9 billion, excluding transaction costs. Proceeds 
were primarily used to reduce Duke Energy holding company (the parent) debt. 
Existing favorable tax attributes result in no immediate U.S. federal-level cash 
tax impacts. Details of each transaction are as follows:

• On December 20, 2016, Duke Energy closed on the sale of its ownership 

interests in businesses in Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, El Salvador, 
Guatemala and Peru to I Squared Capital. The assets sold included 
approximately 2,230 MW of hydroelectric and natural gas generation 
capacity, transmission infrastructure and natural gas processing 
facilities. I Squared Capital purchased the businesses for an enterprise 
value of $1.2 billion.

•  On December 29, 2016, Duke Energy closed on the sale of its Brazilian 

business, which included approximately 2,090 MW of hydroelectric 
generation capacity, to CTG for an enterprise value of $1.2 billion. With 
the closing of the CTG deal, Duke Energy finalized its exit from the Latin 
American market.

Assets Held For Sale and Discontinued Operations

As a result of the transactions, the International Disposal Group was 

classified as held for sale and as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter 
of 2016. Interest expense directly associated with the International Disposal 
Group was allocated to discontinued operations. No interest from corporate level 
debt was allocated to discontinued operations.

The following table presents the results of the International Disposal 

Group for the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, which are included

In conjunction with the advancements of marketing efforts during 2016, Duke Energy performed recoverability 
tests of the long-lived asset groups of International Energy. As a result, Duke Energy determined the carrying 
value of certain assets in Central America was not fully recoverable and recorded a pretax impairment 
charge of $194 million. The charge represents the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value of 
the assets, which was based on a Level 3 Fair Value measurement that was primarily determined from the 
income approach using discounted cash flows but also considered market information obtained in 2016.

Other Sale Related Matters

During 2017, Duke Energy provided certain transition services to CTG 
and I Squared Capital. Cash flows related to providing the transition services 
were not material as of December 31, 2017. All transition services related to 
the International Disposal Group ended in 2017. Additionally, Duke Energy will 
reimburse CTG and I Squared Capital for all tax obligations arising from the 
period preceding consummation on the transactions, totaling approximately 
$78 million. Duke Energy has not recorded any other liabilities, contingent 
liabilities or indemnifications related to the International Disposal Group.

Duke Energy, through indirect subsidiaries, completed the sale of the Midwest Generation Disposal Group to a subsidiary of Dynegy on April 2, 2015, for 

approximately $2.8 billion in cash. The nonregulated Midwest generation business included generation facilities with approximately 5,900 MW of owned capacity 
located in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Illinois. On April 1, 2015, prior to the sale, Duke Energy Ohio distributed its indirect ownership interest in the nonregulated Midwest 
generation business to a subsidiary of Duke Energy Corporation. 

Duke Energy utilized a revolving credit agreement (RCA) to support the operations of the nonregulated Midwest generation business. Duke Energy Ohio had a 
power purchase agreement with the Midwest Generation Disposal Group for a portion of its standard service offer (SSO) supply requirement. The agreement and the 
SSO expired in May 2015.

The results of operations of the Midwest Generation Disposal Group prior to the date of sale are classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying 
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Interest expense associated with the RCA was allocated to discontinued operations. No other interest expense related to 
corporate level debt was allocated to discontinued operations. Certain immaterial costs that were eliminated as a result of the sale remained in continuing operations.

3.  BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Operating segments are determined based on information used by the 

chief operating decision-maker in deciding how to allocate resources and 
evaluate the performance of the business. Duke Energy evaluates segment 
performance based on segment income. Segment income is defined as income 
from continuing operations net of income attributable to noncontrolling interests. 
Segment income, as discussed below, includes intercompany revenues and 
expenses that are eliminated on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain 
governance costs are allocated to each segment. In addition, direct interest 
expense and income taxes are included in segment income.

Products and services are sold between affiliate companies and 

reportable segments of Duke Energy at cost. Segment assets as presented in the 
tables that follow exclude all intercompany assets.

DUKE ENERGY

Duke Energy’s segment structure includes the following segments: Electric 

Utilities and Infrastructure, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure and Commercial

PART IIDUKE ENERGY CORPORATION • DUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS, LLC • PROGRESS ENERGY, INC. • DUKE ENERGY PROGRESS, LLC •  DUKE ENERGY FLORIDA, LLC • DUKE ENERGY OHIO, INC. • DUKE ENERGY INDIANA, LLC • PIEDMONT NATURAL GAS COMPANY, INC.Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)Descriptions of regulatory assets and liabilities summarized in the tables 
above and below follow. See tables below for recovery and amortization periods 
at the separate registrants.

AROs – coal ash. Represents deferred depreciation and accretion related 
to the legal obligation to close ash basins. The costs are deferred until recovery 
treatment has been determined. See Notes 1 and 9 for additional information.
AROs – nuclear and other. Represents regulatory assets or liabilities, 

including deferred depreciation and accretion, related to legal obligations 
associated with the future retirement of property, plant and equipment, excluding 
amounts related to coal ash. The AROs relate primarily to decommissioning 
nuclear power facilities. The amounts also include certain deferred gains and 
losses on NDTF investments. See Notes 1 and 9 for additional information.

Accrued pension and OPEB. Accrued pension and other post-retirement 

benefit obligations (OPEB) represent regulatory assets and liabilities related 
to each of the Duke Energy Registrants’ respective shares of unrecognized 
actuarial gains and losses and unrecognized prior service cost and credit 
attributable to Duke Energy’s pension plans and OPEB plans. The regulatory 
asset or liability is amortized with the recognition of actuarial gains and losses 
and prior service cost and credit to net periodic benefit costs for pension and 
OPEB plans. The accrued pension and OPEB regulatory asset is expected 
to be recovered primarily over the average remaining service periods or life 
expectancies of employees covered by the benefit plans. See Note 21 for 
additional detail.

Retired generation facilities. Represents amounts to be recovered for 

facilities that have been retired and are probable of recovery.

Debt fair value adjustment. Purchase accounting adjustments recorded 

to state the carrying value of Progress Energy and Piedmont at fair value in 
connection with the 2012 and 2016 mergers, respectively. Amount is amortized 
over the life of the related debt.

Net regulatory asset or liability related to income taxes. Amounts 
for all registrants include regulatory liabilities related primarily to impacts from 
the Tax Act. See Note 22 for additional information. Amounts have no immediate 
impact on rate base as regulatory assets are offset by deferred tax liabilities.
Storm cost deferrals. Represents deferred incremental costs incurred 

related to extraordinary weather-related events.

Nuclear asset securitized balance, net. Represents the balance 

associated with Crystal River Unit 3 retirement approved for recovery by the 
FPSC on September 15, 2015, and the upfront financing costs securitized in 
2016 with issuance of the associated bonds. The regulatory asset balance is net 
of the AFUDC equity portion.

Hedge costs and other deferrals. Amounts relate to unrealized gains 

and losses on derivatives recorded as a regulatory asset or liability, respectively, 
until the contracts are settled.

Derivatives – natural gas supply contracts. Represents costs for 
certain long-dated, fixed quantity forward gas supply contracts, which are 
recoverable through PGA clauses.

DSM/EE. Deferred costs related to various DSM and EE programs 

recoverable through various mechanisms.

Grid modernization. Amounts represent deferred depreciation and 

operating expenses as well as carrying costs on the portion of capital expenditures 
placed in service but not yet reflected in retail rates as plant in service.

Vacation accrual. Generally recovered within one year.
Deferred fuel and purchased power. Represents certain energy-

related costs that are recoverable or refundable as approved by the applicable 
regulatory body.

Nuclear deferral. Includes amounts related to levelizing nuclear plant 
outage costs, which allows for the recognition of nuclear outage expenses over 
the refueling cycle rather than when the outage occurs, resulting in the deferral 
of operations and maintenance costs associated with refueling.

Post-in-service carrying costs and deferred operating expenses. 
Represents deferred depreciation and operating expenses as well as carrying 
costs on the portion of capital expenditures placed in service but not yet 
reflected in retail rates as plant in service.

Gasification services agreement buyout. The IURC authorized Duke 

Energy Indiana to recover costs incurred to buy out a gasification services 
agreement, including carrying costs through 2017.

Transmission expansion obligation. Represents transmission 
expansion obligations related to Duke Energy Ohio’s withdrawal from 
Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO).

MGP. Represents remediation costs incurred at former MGP sites and the 
deferral of costs to be incurred at the East End and West End sites through 2019.

AMI. Represents deferred costs related to the installation of AMI meters 
and remaining net book value of non-AMI meters to be replaced at Duke Energy 
Carolinas, net book value of existing meters at Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy 
Progress and Duke Energy Ohio and expected future recovery of net book value 
of electromechanical meters that have been replaced with AMI meters at Duke 
Energy Indiana.

NCEMPA deferrals. Represents retail allocated cost deferrals and returns 

associated with the additional ownership interest in assets acquired from 
NCEMPA in 2015.

East Bend deferrals. Represents both deferred operating expenses and 

deferred depreciation as well as carrying costs on the portion of East Bend 
Generating Station (East Bend) that was acquired from Dayton Power and Light 
and that had been previously operated as a jointly owned facility.

Deferred pipeline integrity costs. Represents pipeline integrity 

management costs in compliance with federal regulations recovered through a 
rider mechanism.

Amounts due from customers. Relates primarily to margin decoupling 

and IMR recovery mechanisms.

Costs of removal. Represents funds received from customers to cover 
the future removal of property, plant and equipment from retired or abandoned 
sites as property is retired. Also includes certain deferred gains on NDTF 
investments.

Amounts to be refunded to customers. Represents required rate 

reductions to retail customers by the applicable regulatory body.

Storm reserve. Amounts are used to offset future incurred costs for 

named storms as approved by regulatory commissions.

RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY OF CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES TO MAKE  
DIVIDENDS, ADVANCES AND LOANS TO DUKE ENERGY

As a condition to the approval of merger transactions, the NCUC, PSCSC, 

PUCO, KPSC and IURC imposed conditions on the ability of Duke Energy 
Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Kentucky, 
Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont to transfer funds to Duke Energy through 
loans or advances, as well as restricted amounts available to pay dividends to 
Duke Energy. Certain subsidiaries may transfer funds to the parent by obtaining 
approval of the respective state regulatory commissions. These conditions 
imposed restrictions on the ability of the public utility subsidiaries to pay cash 
dividends as discussed below.

The NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC, IURC, PUCO, TPUC and KPSC approve rates for 
retail electric and natural gas services within their states. The FERC approves 
rates for electric sales to wholesale customers served under cost-based 
rates (excluding Ohio and Indiana), as well as sales of transmission service. 
The FERC also regulates certification and siting of new interstate natural gas 
pipeline projects.

All Registrants

Tax Act Impacts

On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Act into law, 

which, among other provisions, reduces the maximum federal corporate income 
tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018. As a result 
of the Tax Act, the Subsidiary Registrants revalued their deferred tax assets 
and deferred tax liabilities, as of December 31, 2017, to account for the future 
impact of lower corporate tax rates on these deferred tax amounts. For the 
Subsidiary Registrants regulated operations, where the reduction is expected 
to be accounted for and applied to customers’ rates in future commission 
proceedings, including rate proceedings, the net remeasurement has been 
deferred as a regulatory liability. Each of the Subsidiary Registrant’s regulatory 
commissions is reviewing the Tax Act to determine the potential impacts on 
customer rates. Beginning in January 2018, the Subsidiary Registrants will defer 
the estimated ongoing impacts of the Tax Act that are expected to be returned to 
customers. See Note 22 for additional information.

Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress

Ash Basin Closure Costs Deferral

On December 30, 2016, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy 

Progress filed a joint petition with the NCUC seeking an accounting order 
authorizing deferral of certain costs incurred in connection with federal and 
state environmental remediation requirements related to the permanent closure 
of ash basins and other ash storage units at coal-fired generating facilities 
that have provided or are providing generation to customers located in North 
Carolina. Initial comments were received in March 2017, and reply comments 
were filed on April 19, 2017. The NCUC has consolidated Duke Energy Carolinas’ 
and Duke Energy Progress’ coal ash deferral requests into their respective 
general rate case dockets for decision. See “2017 North Carolina Rate Case” 
sections below for additional discussion. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke 
Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also have restrictions 

imposed by their first mortgage bond indentures, which, in certain 
circumstances, limit their ability to make cash dividends or distributions on 
common stock. Amounts restricted as a result of these provisions were not 
material at December 31, 2017.

Additionally, certain other subsidiaries of Duke Energy have restrictions 

on their ability to dividend, loan or advance funds to Duke Energy due to specific 
legal or regulatory restrictions, including, but not limited to, minimum working 
capital and tangible net worth requirements.

The restrictions discussed below were less than 25 percent of Duke 

Energy’s and Progress Energy’s net assets at December 31, 2017.

Duke Energy Carolinas

Duke Energy Carolinas must limit cumulative distributions subsequent to 
mergers to (i) the amount of retained earnings on the day prior to the closing of 
the mergers, plus (ii) any future earnings recorded.

Duke Energy Progress

Duke Energy Progress must limit cumulative distributions subsequent to 
the mergers between Duke Energy and Progress Energy and Duke Energy and 
Piedmont to (i) the amount of retained earnings on the day prior to the closing of 
the respective mergers, plus (ii) any future earnings recorded.

Duke Energy Ohio

Duke Energy Ohio will not declare and pay dividends out of capital or 

unearned surplus without the prior authorization of the PUCO. Duke Energy Ohio 
received FERC and PUCO approval to pay dividends from its equity accounts 
that are reflective of the amount that it would have in its retained earnings 
account had push-down accounting for the Cinergy Corp. (Cinergy) merger not 
been applied to Duke Energy Ohio’s balance sheet. The conditions include a 
commitment from Duke Energy Ohio that equity, adjusted to remove the impacts 
of push-down accounting, will not fall below 30 percent of total capital.

Duke Energy Kentucky is required to pay dividends solely out of retained 

earnings and to maintain a minimum of 35 percent equity in its capital 
structure.

Duke Energy Indiana

Duke Energy Indiana must limit cumulative distributions subsequent 

to the merger between Duke Energy and Cinergy to (i) the amount of retained 
earnings on the day prior to the closing of the merger, plus (ii) any future 
earnings recorded. In addition, Duke Energy Indiana will not declare and pay 
dividends out of capital or unearned surplus without prior authorization of the 
IURC.

Piedmont

Piedmont must limit cumulative distributions subsequent to the 

acquisition of Piedmont by Duke Energy to (i) the amount of retained earnings on 
the day prior to the closing of the merger, plus (ii) any future earnings recorded.

William States Lee Combined Cycle Facility

On April 9, 2014, the PSCSC granted Duke Energy Carolinas and 

North Carolina Electric Membership Corporation (NCEMC) a Certificate of 
Environmental Compatibility and Public Convenience and Necessity (CECPCN) 
for the construction and operation of a 750-MW combined-cycle natural gas-
fired generating plant at Duke Energy Carolinas’ existing William States Lee 
Generating Station in Anderson, South Carolina. Duke Energy Carolinas began 
construction in July 2015 and estimates a cost to build of $600 million for its 
share of the facility, including allowance for funds used during construction 
(AFUDC). The project is expected to be commercially available in the first 
quarter of 2018. NCEMC will own approximately 13 percent of the project. 
On July 3, 2014, the South Carolina Coastal Conservation League (SCCL) and 
Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE) jointly filed a Notice of Appeal with 
the Court of Appeals of South Carolina (S.C. Court of Appeals) seeking the 
court’s review of the PSCSC’s decision, claiming the PSCSC did not properly 
consider a request related to a proposed solar facility prior to granting approval 
of the CECPCN. The S.C. Court of Appeals affirmed the PSCSC’s decision on 
February 10, 2016, and on March 24, 2016, denied a request for rehearing 
filed by SCCL and SACE. On April 21, 2016, SCCL and SACE petitioned the 
South Carolina Supreme Court for review of the S.C. Court of Appeals decision. 
On March 24, 2017, the South Carolina Supreme Court denied the request for 
review, thus concluding the matter.

Lee Nuclear Station

In December 2007, Duke Energy Carolinas applied to the NRC for 

combined operating licenses (COLs) for two Westinghouse AP1000 reactors 
for the proposed William States Lee III Nuclear Station to be located at a site 
in Cherokee County, South Carolina. The NCUC and PSCSC concurred with the 
prudency of Duke Energy Carolinas incurring certain project development and 
preconstruction costs through several separately issued orders, although full 
cost recovery is not guaranteed. In December 2016, the NRC issued a COL for 
each reactor. Duke Energy Carolinas is not required to build the nuclear reactors 
as result of the COLs being issued.

On March 29, 2017, Westinghouse filed for voluntary Chapter 11 
bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New 
York. As part of its 2017 North Carolina Rate Case discussed above, Duke 
Energy Carolinas is seeking NCUC approval to cancel the development of the 
Lee Nuclear Station project due to the Westinghouse bankruptcy filing and 
other market activity and is requesting recovery of incurred licensing and 
development costs. Duke Energy Carolinas will maintain the license issued 
by the NRC in December 2016 as an option for potential future development. 
As of December 31, 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas has incurred approximately 
$558 million of costs, including AFUDC, related to the project. These project 
costs are included in Net property, plant and equipment on Duke Energy 
Carolinas’ Consolidated Balance Sheets. Duke Energy Carolinas cannot predict 
the outcome of this matter.

On August 25, 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an application with the 

NCUC for a rate increase for retail customers of approximately $647 million, 
which represents an approximate 13.6 percent increase in annual base 
revenues. The rate increase is driven by capital investments subsequent to the 
previous base rate case, including grid improvement projects, AMI, investments 
in customer service technologies, costs of complying with coal combustion 
residuals (CCR) regulations and the North Carolina Coal Ash Management Act of 
2014 (Coal Ash Act) and recovery of costs related to licensing and development 
of the William States Lee III Nuclear Station (Lee Nuclear Station) discussed 
below. On January 23, 2018, the North Carolina Public Staff filed testimony 
recommending an overall rate decrease of approximately $290 million. An 
evidentiary hearing is scheduled to begin on February 27, 2018, and a decision 
and revised customer rates are expected by mid-2018. Duke Energy Carolinas 
cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

FERC Formula Rate Matter

On July 31, 2017, Piedmont Municipal Power Agency (PMPA) filed a 

complaint with FERC against Duke Energy Carolinas alleging that Duke Energy 
Carolinas misapplied the formula rate under the purchase power agreement 
(PPA) between the parties by including regulatory amortization in its rates 
without FERC approval. Duke Energy Carolinas disagreed with PMPA as it 
believed it was properly applying its FERC filed rate. On February 15, 2018, 
FERC issued an order ruling in favor of PMPA and ordered Duke Energy Carolinas 
to refund to PMPA all amounts improperly collected under the PPA. Resolution of 
this matter is not expected to be material.

Lincoln County Combustion Turbine

On December 7, 2017, the NCUC issued an order approving a Certificate 

of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) for Duke Energy Carolinas’ 
proposed 402-megawatt (MW) simple cycle, advanced combustion turbine 
natural gas-fueled electric generating unit at its existing Lincoln County site. 
The CPCN also includes construction of related transmission and natural gas 
pipeline interconnection facilities. Construction is scheduled to begin in 2018 
with an extended commissioning and validation period from 2020-2024 and an 
estimated commercial operation date in 2024. As a condition of the approval, 
Duke Energy Carolinas will not seek recovery of costs associated with the 
project until it is placed into commercial operation.

Advanced Metering Infrastructure Deferral

On July 12, 2016, the PSCSC issued an accounting order for Duke Energy 

Carolinas to defer the financial effects of depreciation expense incurred for 
the installation of AMI meters, the carrying costs on the investment at its 
weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and the carrying costs on the deferred 
costs at its WACC not to exceed $45 million. The decision also allows Duke 
Energy Carolinas to continue to depreciate the non-AMI meters to be replaced. 
Current retail rates will not change as a result of the decision and the ability 
of interested parties to challenge the reasonableness of expenditures in 
subsequent proceedings is not limited.

On June 1, 2017, Duke Energy Progress filed an application with the NCUC 

for a rate increase for retail customers of approximately $477 million, which 
represented an approximate 14.9 percent increase in annual base revenues. 
Subsequent to the filing, Duke Energy Progress adjusted the requested amount 
to $420 million, representing an approximate 13 percent increase. The rate 
increase is driven by capital investments subsequent to the previous base 
rate case, costs of complying with CCR regulations and the Coal Ash Act, costs 
relating to storm recovery, investments in customer service technologies and 
recovery of costs associated with renewable purchased power. On November 22, 
2017, Duke Energy Progress and the North Carolina Public Staff filed an 
Agreement and Stipulation of Partial Settlement resolving certain portions of the 
proceeding, pending NCUC approval. Terms of the settlement include a return on 
equity of 9.9 percent and a capital structure of 52 percent equity and 48 percent 
debt. As a result of the settlement, in 2017 Duke Energy Progress recorded 
pretax charges totaling approximately $25 million to Impairment charges and 
Operation, maintenance and other on the Consolidated Income Statements, 
principally related to disallowances from rate base of certain projects at the 
Mayo and Sutton plants. The settlement does not include agreement on portions 
of the rate case relating to recovery of deferred storm recovery costs and coal 
ash basin deferred costs, which will be decided by the NCUC separately. Taking 
into consideration the settled portions and Duke Energy Progress’ requested 
recovery of the non-settled portions, the requested rate increase is reduced to 
approximately $300 million. An evidentiary hearing ended December 7, 2017, 
and a decision and revised customer rates are expected in the first quarter of 
2018. Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

Storm Cost Deferral Filings

On December 16, 2016, Duke Energy Progress filed a petition with 

the NCUC requesting an accounting order to defer certain costs incurred in 
connection with response to Hurricane Matthew and other significant storms 
in 2016. The final estimate of incremental operation and maintenance and 
capital costs of $116 million was filed with the NCUC in September 2017. On 
March 15, 2017, the NCUC Public Staff filed comments supporting deferral of a 
portion of Duke Energy Progress’ requested amount. Duke Energy Progress filed 
reply comments on April 12, 2017. On July 10, 2017, the NCUC consolidated 
Duke Energy Progress’ storm deferral request into the Duke Energy Progress rate 
case docket for decision. See “2017 North Carolina Rate Case” for additional 
discussion. As of December 31, 2017, Duke Energy Progress has approximately 
$77 million included in Regulatory assets on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

On December 16, 2016, Duke Energy Progress filed a petition with the 
PSCSC requesting an accounting order to defer certain costs incurred related 
to repairs and restoration of service following Hurricane Matthew. The final 
estimate of incremental operation and maintenance and capital costs was 
approximately $74 million. In January 2017, the PSCSC approved the deferral 
request and issued an accounting order. As of December 31, 2017, Duke Energy 
Progress has approximately $73 million included in Regulatory assets on its 
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

South Carolina Rate Case

In December 2016, the PSCSC approved a rate case settlement agreement 

among the ORS (Office of Regulatory Staff), intervenors and Duke Energy 
Progress. Terms of the settlement agreement included an approximate $56 
million increase in revenues over a two-year period. An increase of approximately 

133

$38 million in revenues was effective January 1, 2017, and an additional 
increase of approximately $18.5 million in revenues was effective January 1, 
2018. Duke Energy Progress amortized approximately $18.5 million from the cost 
of removal reserve in 2017. Other settlement terms included a rate of return on 
equity of 10.1 percent, recovery of coal ash costs incurred from January 1, 2015, 
through June 30, 2016, over a 15-year period and ongoing deferral of allocated 
ash basin closure costs from July 1, 2016, until the next base rate case. The 
settlement also provides that Duke Energy Progress will not seek an increase in 
rates in South Carolina to occur prior to 2019, with limited exceptions.

Western Carolinas Modernization Plan

On November 4, 2015, Duke Energy Progress announced a Western 

Carolinas Modernization Plan, which included retirement of the existing 
Asheville coal-fired plant, the construction of two 280-MW combined-cycle 
natural gas plants having dual fuel capability, with the option to build a third 
natural gas simple cycle unit in 2023 based upon the outcome of initiatives to 
reduce the region’s power demand. The plan also included upgrades to existing 
transmission lines and substations, installation of solar generation and a 
pilot battery storage project. These investments will be made within the next 
seven years. Duke Energy Progress is also working with the local natural gas 
distribution company to upgrade an existing natural gas pipeline to serve the 
natural gas plant.

On March 28, 2016, the NCUC issued an order approving a CPCN for 
the new combined-cycle natural gas plants, but denying the CPCN for the 
contingent simple cycle unit without prejudice to Duke Energy Progress to refile 
for approval in the future. On March 28, 2017, Duke Energy Progress filed an 
annual progress report for the construction of the combined-cycle plants with 
the NCUC, with an estimated cost of $893 million. Site preparation activities for 
the combined-cycle plants are underway and construction of these plants began 
in 2017, with an expected in-service date in late 2019. Duke Energy Progress 
plans to file for future approvals related to the proposed solar generation and 
pilot battery storage project.

The carrying value of the 376-MW Asheville coal-fired plant, including 

associated ash basin closure costs, of $385 million and $492 million are 
included in Generation facilities to be retired, net on Duke Energy Progress’ 
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 

Shearon Harris Nuclear Plant Expansion

In 2006, Duke Energy Progress selected a site at Harris to evaluate for 

possible future nuclear expansion. On February 19, 2008, Duke Energy Progress 
filed its COL application with the NRC for two Westinghouse AP1000 reactors 
at Harris, which the NRC docketed for review. On May 2, 2013, Duke Energy 
Progress filed a letter with the NRC requesting the NRC to suspend its review 
activities associated with the COL at the Harris site. The NCUC and PSCSC 
approved deferral of retail costs. Total deferred costs were approximately 
$47 million as of December 31, 2017, and are recorded in Regulatory assets on 
Duke Energy Progress’ Consolidated Balance Sheets. On November 17, 2016, 
the FERC approved Duke Energy Progress’ rate recovery request filing for the 
wholesale ratepayers’ share of the abandonment costs, including a debt only 
return to be recovered through revised formula rates and amortized over a 
15-year period beginning May 1, 2014. As part of the settlement agreement 
for the 2017 North Carolina Rate Case discussed above, Duke Energy Progress 
will amortize the regulatory asset over an eight-year period. The settlement is 
subject to NCUC approval. Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of 
this matter.

Storm Restoration Cost Recovery

In September 2017, Duke Energy Florida’s service territory suffered 

significant damage from Hurricane Irma, resulting in approximately 1.3 
million customers experiencing outages. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Duke 
Energy Florida also incurred preparation costs related to Hurricane Nate. On 
December 28, 2017, Duke Energy Florida filed a petition with the FPSC to 
recover incremental storm restoration costs for Hurricanes Irma and Nate and 
to replenish the storm reserve. The estimated recovery amount is approximately 
$513 million to be recovered over a three-year period beginning in March 2018, 
subject to true up, which includes reestablishment of a $132 million storm 
reserve. At December 31, 2017, Duke Energy Florida’s Consolidated Balance 
Sheets included approximately $376 million of recoverable costs under the 
FPSC’s storm rule in Regulatory assets within Other Noncurrent Assets related 

to storm recovery. On February 6, 2018, the FPSC approved Duke Energy 
Florida’s motion to approve a stipulation that would apply tax savings resulting 
from the Tax Act toward storm costs in lieu of implementing a storm surcharge.

2017 Second Revised and Restated Settlement Agreement

On November 20, 2017, the FPSC issued an order to approve the 2017 
Second Revised and Restated Settlement Agreement (2017 Settlement) filed 
by Duke Energy Florida. The 2017 Settlement replaces and supplants the 2013 
Settlement. The 2017 Settlement extends the base rate case stay-out provision 
from the 2013 Settlement through the end of 2021 unless actual or projected 
return on equity falls below 9.5 percent; however, Duke Energy Florida is allowed 
a multiyear increase to its base rates of $67 million per year in 2019, 2020 
and 2021, as well as base rate increases for solar generation. In addition to

the Crystal River 1 and 2 coal units discussed below and future generation 
needs in Florida, the 2017 Settlement contains provisions related to future 
investments in solar and renewable energy technology, future investments in 
AMI technology as well as recovery of existing meters, impacts of the Tax Act, 
an electric vehicle charging station pilot program and the termination of the 
proposed Levy Nuclear Project discussed below. As part of the 2017 Settlement, 
Duke Energy Florida will not move forward with building the Levy nuclear plant 
and recorded a pretax impairment charge of approximately $135 million in 2017 
to write off all unrecovered Levy Nuclear Project costs, including the COL. As a 
result of the 2017 Settlement, Duke Energy Florida transferred $75 million to a 
regulatory asset for the net book value of existing meter technology, which will 
be recovered over a 15-year period.

The 2017 Settlement includes provisions to recover 2017 under-recovered 

fuel costs of approximately $196 million over a 24-month period beginning in 
January 2018. On September 1, 2017, Duke Energy Florida submitted Alternate 
2018 Fuel and Capacity clause projection filings consistent with the terms of 
the 2017 Settlement. The updated capacity filing reflects the removal of all 
Levy costs. The FPSC approved Duke Energy Florida’s 2018 Alternate projection 
filings on October 25, 2017.

Hines Chiller Uprate Project

On February 2, 2017, Duke Energy Florida filed a petition seeking approval 

to include in base rates the revenue requirement for a Chiller Uprate Project 
(Uprate Project) at the Hines Energy Complex. The Uprate Project was placed 
into service in March 2017 at a cost of approximately $150 million. The annual 
retail revenue requirement is approximately $19 million. On March 28, 2017, the 
FPSC issued an order approving the revenue requirement, which was included 
in base rates for the first billing cycle of April 2017.

Citrus County Combined Cycle Facility

On October 2, 2014, the FPSC granted Duke Energy Florida a 

Determination of Need for the construction of a 1,640-MW combined-cycle 
natural gas plant in Citrus County, Florida. On May 5, 2015, the Florida 
Department of Environmental Protection approved Duke Energy Florida’s Site 
Certification Application. The project has received all required permits and 
approvals and construction began in October 2015. The facility is expected to be 
commercially available in 2018 at an estimated cost of $1.5 billion, including 
AFUDC. The plant will receive natural gas from the Sabal Trail Transmission, LLC 
(Sabal Trail) pipeline discussed below.

Purchase of Osprey Energy Center

Duke Energy Florida received a Civil Investigative Demand from the 

Department of Justice (DOJ) related to alleged violation of the waiting period 
for the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 related to the 
purchase of the Osprey Energy Center, LLC, which was completed in January 
2017. The DOJ alleged Duke Energy Florida assumed operational control of the 
Osprey Plant before the waiting period expiration on February 27, 2015. On 
January 17, 2017, Duke Energy Florida entered into a stipulation agreement to 
settle with the DOJ for $600,000 without admission of liability. On January 18, 
2017, the DOJ filed a complaint and the stipulation in the U.S. District Court 
for the District of Columbia, which was approved by the court. A final order 
dismissing the case was entered in April 2017.

Crystal River Unit 3

In December 2014, the FPSC approved Duke Energy Florida’s decision to 
construct an independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI) for the retired 
Crystal River Unit 3 nuclear plant and approved Duke Energy Florida’s request 
to defer amortization of the ISFSI pending resolution of litigation against the 
federal government as a result of the Department of Energy’s breach of its 
obligation to accept spent nuclear fuel. The return rate is based on the currently 
approved AFUDC rate with a return on equity of 7.35 percent, or 70 percent of 
the currently approved 10.5 percent. The return rate is subject to change if the 
return on equity changes in the future. In September 2016, the FPSC approved 
an amendment to the 2013 Settlement authorizing recovery of the ISFSI through 
the Capacity Cost Recovery Clause. Through December 31, 2017, Duke Energy 
Florida has deferred approximately $113 million for recovery associated with 
building the ISFSI. See Note 5 for additional information on spent nuclear fuel 
litigation.

The regulatory asset associated with the original Crystal River Unit 3 

power uprate project will continue to be recovered through the NCRC over an 
estimated seven-year period that began in 2013 with a remaining uncollected 
balance of $87 million at December 31, 2017. 

Crystal River Unit 3 Regulatory Asset

On September 15, 2015, the FPSC approved Duke Energy Florida’s 

motion for approval of a settlement agreement with intervenors to reduce the 
value of the projected Crystal River Unit 3 regulatory asset to be recovered to 
$1.283 billion as of December 31, 2015. An impairment charge of $15 million 
was recognized in 2015 to adjust the regulatory asset balance. In November 
2015, the FPSC issued a financing order approving Duke Energy Florida’s 
request to issue nuclear asset-recovery bonds to finance its unrecovered 
regulatory asset related to Crystal River Unit 3 through a wholly owned special 
purpose entity. Nuclear asset-recovery bonds replace the base rate recovery 
methodology authorized by the 2013 Settlement and result in a lower rate 
impact to customers with a recovery period of approximately 20 years.

Pursuant to provisions in Florida Statutes and the FPSC financing order, 
in 2016, Duke Energy Florida formed Duke Energy Florida Project Finance, LLC 
(DEFPF), a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary for the 
purpose of issuing nuclear asset-recovery bonds. In June 2016, DEFPF issued 
$1,294 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured bonds (nuclear 
asset-recovery bonds) to finance the recovery of Duke Energy Florida’s Crystal 
River 3 regulatory asset.

In connection with this financing, net proceeds to DEFPF of approximately 

$1,287 million, after underwriting costs, were used to acquire nuclear asset-recovery 
property from Duke Energy Florida and to pay transaction related expenses. The 
nuclear asset-recovery property includes the right to impose, bill, collect and adjust 
a non-bypassable nuclear asset-recovery charge, to be collected on a per kilowatt-
hour basis, from all Duke Energy Florida retail customers until the bonds are paid 
in full. Duke Energy Florida began collecting the nuclear asset-recovery charge on 
behalf of DEFPF in customer rates in July 2016.
See Note 17 for additional information.

Levy Nuclear Project

On July 28, 2008, Duke Energy Florida applied to the NRC for COLs for 

two Westinghouse AP1000 reactors at Levy (Levy Nuclear Project). In 2008, the 
FPSC granted Duke Energy Florida’s petition for an affirmative Determination 
of Need and related orders requesting cost recovery under Florida’s 
nuclear cost-recovery rule, together with the associated facilities, including 
transmission lines and substation facilities. In October 2016, the NRC issued

Duke Energy Florida is 
not required to build the nuclear reactors as a result of the COLs being issued.

On January 28, 2014, Duke Energy Florida terminated the Levy 

engineering, procurement and construction agreement (EPC). Duke Energy 
Florida may be required to pay for work performed under the EPC. Duke Energy 
Florida recorded an exit obligation in 2014 for the termination of the EPC. This 
liability was recorded within Other in Other Noncurrent Liabilities with an offset 
primarily to Regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Duke Energy 
Florida is allowed to recover reasonable and prudent EPC cancellation costs 
from its retail customers. On May 1, 2017, Duke Energy Florida filed a request 
with the FPSC to recover approximately $82 million of Levy Nuclear Project costs 
from retail customers in 2018. As part of the 2017 Settlement discussed above, 

Duke Energy Florida is no longer seeking recovery of costs related to the Levy 
Nuclear Project and the ongoing Westinghouse litigation discussed in Note 5. All 
remaining Levy Nuclear Project issues have been resolved.

Crystal River 1 and 2 Coal Units

Duke Energy Florida has evaluated Crystal River 1 and 2 coal units for 

retirement in order to comply with certain environmental regulations. Based on 
this evaluation, those units are expected to be retired by the end of 2018. Once 
those units are retired Duke Energy Florida will continue recovery of existing 
annual depreciation expense through the end of 2020. Beginning in 2021, Duke 
Energy Florida will be allowed to recover any remaining net book value of the 
assets from retail customers through the Capacity Cost Recovery Clause.

On September 1, 2017, Duke Energy Kentucky filed a rate case with the 

KPSC requesting an increase in electric base rates of approximately $49 million, 
which represents an approximate 15 percent increase on the average customer 
bill. The rate increase is driven by increased investment in utility plant, increased 
operations and maintenance expenses and recovery of regulatory assets. The 
application also includes implementation of the Environmental Surcharge 
Mechanism to recover environmental costs not included in base rates, requests 
to establish a Distribution Capital Investment Rider to recover incremental 
costs of specific programs, requests to establish a FERC Transmission Cost 
Reconciliation Rider to recover escalating transmission costs and modification to 
the Profit Sharing Mechanism to increase customers’ share of proceeds from the 
benefits of owning generation and to mitigate shareholder risks associated with 
that generation. An evidentiary hearing is scheduled to begin on March 6, 2018. 
Duke Energy Kentucky anticipates that rates will go into effect in mid-April 2018. 
Duke Energy Kentucky cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

2017 Electric Security Plan

On June 1, 2017, Duke Energy Ohio filed with the PUCO a request for a 

standard service offer in the form of an electric security plan (ESP). If approved 
by the PUCO, the term of the ESP would be from June 1, 2018, to May 31, 2024. 
Terms of the ESP include continuation of market-based customer rates through 
competitive procurement processes for generation, continuation and expansion 
of existing rider mechanisms and proposed new rider mechanisms relating to 
regulatory mandates, costs incurred to enhance the customer experience and 
transform the grid and a service reliability rider for vegetation management. On 
February 15, 2018, the procedural schedule was suspended to facilitate ongoing 
settlement discussions. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of this 
matter.

Woodsdale Station Fuel System Filing

On June 9, 2015, the FERC ruled in favor of PJM Interconnection, LLC 

(PJM) on a revised Tariff and Reliability Assurance Agreement including 
implementation of a Capacity Performance (CP) proposal and to amend 
sections of the Operating Agreement related to generation non-performance. 
The CP proposal includes performance-based penalties for non-compliance. 
Duke Energy Kentucky is a Fixed Resource Requirement (FRR) entity, and 
therefore is subject to the compliance standards through its FRR plans. A 
partial CP obligation will apply to Duke Energy Kentucky in the delivery year 
beginning June 1, 2019, with full compliance beginning June 1, 2020. Duke 
Energy Kentucky has developed strategies for CP compliance investments. 
On December 21, 2017, the KPSC issued an order approving Duke Energy 
Kentucky’s request for a CPCN to construct an ultra-low sulfur diesel backup 
fuel system for the Woodsdale Station. The backup fuel system is projected to 
cost approximately $55 million and is anticipated to be in service prior to the 
CP compliance deadline of April 2019.

Ohio Valley Electric Corporation

On March 31, 2017, Duke Energy Ohio filed for approval to adjust its 
existing price stabilization rider (Rider PSR), which is currently set at zero 
dollars, to pass through net costs related to its contractual entitlement to 
capacity and energy from the generating assets owned by OVEC. The filing seeks 
to adjust Rider PSR for OVEC costs subsequent to April 1, 2017. Duke Energy 
Ohio is seeking deferral authority for net costs incurred from April 1, 2017, until 
the new rates under Rider PSR are put into effect. Various intervenors have filed 

motions to dismiss or stay the proceeding and Duke Energy Ohio has opposed 
these filings. See Note 13 for additional discussion of Duke Energy Ohio’s 
ownership interest in OVEC. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of 
this matter.

East Bend Coal Ash Basin Filing

On December 2, 2016, Duke Energy Kentucky filed with the KPSC a 

request for a CPCN for construction projects necessary to close and repurpose 
an ash basin at the East Bend facility as a result of current and proposed EPA 
regulations. Duke Energy Kentucky estimated a total cost of approximately 
$93 million in the filing and expects in-service date by the first quarter of 2021. 
On June 6, 2017, the KPSC approved the CPCN request.

Electric Base Rate Case

Duke Energy Ohio filed with the PUCO an electric distribution base rate case 
application and supporting testimony in March 2017. Duke Energy Ohio requested 
an estimated annual increase of approximately $15 million and a return on equity 
of 10.4 percent. The application also includes requests to continue certain current 
riders and establish new riders. On September 26, 2017, the PUCO staff filed a 
report recommending a revenue decrease between approximately $18 million 
and $29 million and a return on equity between 9.22 percent and 10.24 percent. 
On February 15, 2018, the procedural schedule was suspended to facilitate 
ongoing settlement discussions. Duke Energy Ohio expects rates will go into effect 
the second quarter of 2018. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of 
this matter.

Natural Gas Pipeline Extension

Duke Energy Ohio is proposing to install a new natural gas pipeline in its 
Ohio service territory to increase system reliability and enable the retirement of 
older infrastructure. On January 20, 2017, Duke Energy Ohio filed an amended 
application with the Ohio Power Siting Board for approval of one of two proposed 
routes. A public hearing was held on June 15, 2017, and an adjudicatory 
hearing was scheduled to begin September 11, 2017. On August 24, 2017, an 
administrative law judge (ALJ) granted a request made by Duke Energy Ohio 
to delay the procedural schedule while it works through various issues related 
to the pipeline route. If approved, construction of the pipeline extension is 
expected to be completed before the 2020/2021 winter season. The proposed 
project involves the installation of a natural gas line and is estimated to cost 
approximately $110 million, excluding AFUDC.

Advanced Metering Infrastructure

On April 25, 2016, Duke Energy Kentucky filed with the KPSC an 

application for approval of a CPCN for the construction of advanced metering 
infrastructure. Duke Energy Kentucky estimates the $49 million project will 
take two years to complete. Duke Energy Kentucky also requested approval 
to establish a regulatory asset for the remaining book value of existing meter 
equipment and inventory to be replaced. Duke Energy Kentucky and the 
Kentucky attorney general entered into a stipulation to settle matters related 
to the application. On May 25, 2017, the KPSC issued an order to approve the 
stipulation with certain modifications. On June 1, 2017, Duke Energy Kentucky 
filed its acceptance of the modifications. The deployment of AMI meters began 
in third quarter 2017 and is expected to be completed in early 2019. Duke 
Energy Ohio has approximately $6 million included in Regulatory assets on 
its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2017, for the book value of 
existing meter equipment.

2014 Electric Security Plan

On January 20, 2015, Duke Energy Ohio filed an application for approval 
of an accelerated natural gas service line replacement program (ASRP). Under 
the ASRP, Duke Energy Ohio proposed to replace certain natural gas service lines 
on an accelerated basis over a 10-year period. Duke Energy Ohio also proposed 
to complete preliminary survey and investigation work related to natural gas 
service lines that are customer owned and for which it does not have valid 
records and, further, to relocate interior natural gas meters to suitable exterior 
locations where such relocation can be accomplished. Duke Energy Ohio’s 
projected total capital and operations and maintenance expenditures under 
the ASRP were approximately $240 million. The filing also sought approval of 
a rider mechanism (Rider ASRP) to recover related expenditures. Duke Energy 
Ohio proposed to update Rider ASRP on an annual basis. Intervenors opposed 
the ASRP, primarily because they believe the program is neither required nor 
necessary under federal pipeline regulation. On October 26, 2016, the PUCO 
issued an order denying the proposed ASRP. Duke Energy Ohio’s application for 
rehearing of the PUCO decision was denied on May 17, 2017.

Energy Efficiency Cost Recovery

On March 28, 2014, Duke Energy Ohio filed an application for recovery of 
program costs, lost distribution revenue and performance incentives related to 
its energy efficiency and peak demand reduction programs. These programs are 
undertaken to comply with environmental mandates set forth in Ohio law. The 
PUCO approved Duke Energy Ohio’s application but found that Duke Energy Ohio 
was not permitted to use banked energy savings from previous years in order to 
calculate the amount of allowed incentive. This conclusion represented a change 
to the cost recovery mechanism that had been agreed upon by intervenors and 
approved by the PUCO in previous cases. The PUCO granted the applications for 
rehearing filed by Duke Energy Ohio and an intervenor. On January 6, 2016, Duke 
Energy Ohio and the PUCO Staff entered into a stipulation, pending the PUCO’s 
approval, to resolve issues related to performance incentives and the PUCO 
Staff audit of 2013 costs, among other issues. In December 2015, based upon 
the stipulation, Duke Energy Ohio re-established approximately $20 million of 
the revenues that had been previously reversed. On October 26, 2016, the PUCO 
issued an order approving the stipulation without modification. In December 
2016, the PUCO granted the intervenors request for rehearing for the purpose 
of further review. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

On June 15, 2016, Duke Energy Ohio filed an application for approval of a 
three-year energy efficiency and peak demand reduction portfolio of programs. 
A stipulation and modified stipulation were filed on December 22, 2016, and 
January 27, 2017, respectively. Under the terms of the stipulations, which 
included support for deferral authority of all costs and a cap on shared savings 
incentives, Duke Energy Ohio offered its energy efficiency and peak demand 
reduction programs throughout 2017. On February 3, 2017, Duke Energy Ohio 
filed for deferral authority of its costs incurred in 2017 in respect of its proposed 
energy efficiency and peak demand reduction portfolio. On September 27, 2017, 
the PUCO issued an order approving a modified stipulation. The modifications 
impose an annual cap of approximately $38 million on program costs and 
shared savings incentives combined, but allowed for Duke Energy Ohio to file for 
a waiver of costs in excess of the cap in 2017. The PUCO approved the waiver 
request up to a total cost of $56 million. On November 21, 2017, the PUCO 
granted Duke Energy Ohio’s and intervenor’s applications for rehearing of the 
September 27, 2017, order. On January 10, 2018, the PUCO denied the Ohio 
Consumers’ Counsel’s application for rehearing of the PUCO order granting Duke 
Energy Ohio’s waiver request. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of 
this matter.

In April 2015, the PUCO modified and approved Duke Energy Ohio’s 

proposed electric security plan (ESP), with a three-year term and an effective 
date of June 1, 2015. The PUCO approved a competitive procurement process 
for SSO load, a distribution capital investment rider and a tracking mechanism 
for incremental distribution expenses caused by major storms. The PUCO also 
approved a placeholder tariff for a price stabilization rider, but denied Duke Energy 
Ohio’s specific request to include Duke Energy Ohio’s entitlement to generation 
from OVEC in the rider at this time; however, the order allows Duke Energy Ohio to 
submit additional information to request recovery in the future. On May 4, 2015, 
Duke Energy Ohio filed an application for rehearing requesting the PUCO to modify 
or amend certain aspects of the order. On May 28, 2015, the PUCO granted all 
applications for rehearing filed in the case for future consideration. Duke Energy 
Ohio cannot predict the outcome of the appeals in this matter.

2012 Natural Gas Rate Case/MGP Cost Recovery

On November 13, 2013, the PUCO issued an order approving a settlement 

of Duke Energy Ohio’s natural gas base rate case and authorizing the recovery 
of costs incurred between 2008 and 2012 for environmental investigation 
and remediation of two former MGP sites. The PUCO order also authorized 
Duke Energy Ohio to continue deferring MGP environmental investigation and 
remediation costs incurred subsequent to 2012 and to submit annual filings to 
adjust the MGP rider for future costs. Intervening parties appealed this decision to 
the Ohio Supreme Court and on June 29, 2017, the Ohio Supreme Court issued its 
decision affirming the PUCO order. Appellants filed a request for reconsideration, 
which was denied on September 27, 2017. This matter is now final.

The PUCO order also contained deadlines for completing the MGP 

environmental investigation and remediation costs at the MGP sites. For the 
property known as the East End site, the PUCO order established a deadline 
of December 31, 2016, which was subsequently extended to December 31, 
2019. In January 2017, intervening parties filed for rehearing of the PUCO’s 
decision. On February 8, 2017, the PUCO denied the rehearing request. As of 
December 31, 2017, Duke Energy Ohio had approximately, $35 million included 
in Regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for future remediation 
costs expected to be incurred at the East End site.

Regional Transmission Organization Realignment

Duke Energy Ohio, including Duke Energy Kentucky, transferred control of 
its transmission assets from MISO to PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM), effective 
December 31, 2011. The PUCO approved a settlement related to Duke Energy 
Ohio’s recovery of certain costs of the Regional Transmission Organization 
(RTO) realignment via a non-bypassable rider. Duke Energy Ohio is allowed to 
recover all MISO Transmission Expansion Planning (MTEP) costs, including but 
not limited to Multi Value Project (MVP) costs, directly or indirectly charged to 
Ohio customers. Duke Energy Ohio also agreed to vigorously defend against any 
charges for MVP projects from MISO. The KPSC also approved a request to effect 
the RTO realignment, subject to a commitment not to seek double recovery in 
a future rate case of the transmission expansion fees that may be charged by 
MISO and PJM in the same period or overlapping periods.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending 
balance of Duke Energy Ohio’s recorded liability for its exit obligation and share 
of MTEP costs, excluding MVP, recorded within Other in Current liabilities and 
Other in Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The 
retail portions of MTEP costs billed by MISO are recovered by Duke Energy 
Ohio through a non-bypassable rider. As of December 31, 2017, and 2016, 
$50 million and $71 million are recorded in Regulatory assets on Duke Energy 
Ohio’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively.

Duke Energy Ohio

MVP. MISO approved 17 MVP proposals prior to Duke Energy Ohio’s exit 
from MISO on December 31, 2011. Construction of these projects is expected 
to continue through 2020. Costs of these projects, including operating and 
maintenance costs, property and income taxes, depreciation and an allowed 
return, are allocated and billed to MISO transmission owners.

On December 29, 2011, MISO filed a tariff with the FERC providing for 
the allocation of MVP costs to a withdrawing owner based on monthly energy 
usage. The FERC set for hearing (i) whether MISO’s proposed cost allocation 
methodology to transmission owners who withdrew from MISO prior to January 
1, 2012, is consistent with the tariff at the time of their withdrawal from MISO 
and, (ii) if not, what the amount of and methodology for calculating any MVP 
cost responsibility should be. In 2012, MISO estimated Duke Energy Ohio’s MVP 
obligation over the period from 2012 to 2071 at $2.7 billion, on an undiscounted 
basis. On July 16, 2013, a FERC Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) issued an initial

decision. Under this initial decision, Duke Energy Ohio would be liable for MVP 
costs. Duke Energy Ohio filed exceptions to the initial decision, requesting FERC 
to overturn the ALJ’s decision.

On October 29, 2015, the FERC issued an order reversing the ALJ’s 

decision. The FERC ruled the cost allocation methodology is not consistent with 
the MISO tariff and that Duke Energy Ohio has no liability for MVP costs after 
its withdrawal from MISO. On May 19, 2016, the FERC denied the request for 
rehearing filed by MISO and the MISO Transmission Owners. On July 15, 2016, 
the MISO Transmission Owners filed a petition for review with the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. On June 21, 2017, a three-judge panel affirmed 
FERC’s 2015 decision holding that Duke Energy Ohio has no liability for the cost 
of the MVP projects constructed after Duke Energy Ohio’s withdrawal from MISO. 
MISO did not file further petitions for review and this matter is now final.

FERC Transmission Return on Equity Complaint

On March 17, 2016, Duke Energy Indiana filed with the IURC a request 

for approval of its first group of federally mandated CCR rule compliance 
projects (Phase I CCR Compliance Projects) to comply with the EPA’s CCR 
rule. The projects in this Phase I filing are CCR compliance projects, including 
the conversion of Cayuga and Gibson stations to dry bottom ash handling 
and related water treatment. Duke Energy Indiana requested timely recovery 
of approximately $380 million in retail capital costs, including AFUDC, and 
recovery of incremental operating and maintenance costs under a federal 
mandate tracker that provides for timely recovery of 80 percent of such costs 
and deferral with carrying costs of 20 percent of such costs for recovery in a 
subsequent retail base rate case. On January 24, 2017, Duke Energy Indiana 
and various intervenors filed a settlement agreement with the IURC. Terms of 
the settlement include recovery of 60 percent of the estimated CCR compliance 
construction project capital costs through existing rider mechanisms and 
deferral of 40 percent of these costs until Duke Energy Indiana’s next general 
retail rate case. The deferred costs will earn a return based on Duke Energy 
Indiana’s long-term debt rate of 4.73 percent until costs are included in retail 
rates, at which time the deferred costs will earn a full return. Costs are to be 
capped at $365 million, plus actual AFUDC. Costs above the cap would be 
considered for recovery in the next rate case. Terms of the settlement agreement 
also require Duke Energy Indiana to perform certain reporting and groundwater 
monitoring. On May 24, 2017, the IURC approved the settlement agreement.

Customer groups have filed with the FERC complaints against MISO and 

its transmission-owning members, including Duke Energy Indiana, alleging, 
among other things, that the current base rate of return on equity earned by 
MISO transmission owners of 12.38 percent is unjust and unreasonable. The 
complaints claim, among other things, that the current base rate of return on 
equity earned by MISO transmission owners should be reduced to 8.67 percent. 
On January 5, 2015, the FERC issued an order accepting the MISO transmission 
owners’ adder of 0.50 percent to the base rate of return on equity based on 
participation in an RTO subject to it being applied to a return on equity that is 
shown to be just and reasonable in the pending return on equity complaints. On 
December 22, 2015, the presiding FERC ALJ in the first complaint issued an Initial 
Decision in which the base rate of return on equity was set at 10.32 percent. On 
September 28, 2016, the Initial Decision in the first complaint was affirmed by 
FERC, but is subject to rehearing requests. On June 30, 2016, the presiding FERC 
ALJ in the second complaint issued an Initial Decision setting the base rate of 
return on equity at 9.70 percent. The Initial Decision in the second complaint is 
pending FERC review. On April 14, 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District 
of Columbia Circuit, in Emera Maine v. FERC, reversed and remanded certain 
aspects of the methodology employed by FERC to establish rates of return on 
equity. This decision may affect the outcome of the complaints against Duke 
Energy Indiana. Duke Energy Indiana currently believes these matters will not have 
a material impact on its results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

Edwardsport Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle Plant

Grid Infrastructure Improvement Plan

Costs for the Edwardsport Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) 

Plant are recovered from retail electric customers via a tracking mechanism 
(IGCC rider) with updates filed by Duke Energy Indiana. The IGCC Plant was 
placed into commercial operation in June 2013.

On August 24, 2016, the IURC approved a settlement (IGCC Settlement) 

among Duke Energy Indiana and several intervenors to resolve disputes 
related to five IGCC riders (the 11th through 15th) and a subdocket to Duke 
Energy Indiana’s fuel adjustment clause. The IGCC settlement resulted in 
customers not being billed for previously incurred plant operating costs of 
$87.5 million and payments and commitments from Duke Energy Indiana of 
$5.5 million for attorneys’ fees and consumer programs funding. Duke Energy 
Indiana recognized pretax impairment and related charges of $93 million 
in 2015. Additionally, under the IGCC settlement, the recovery of operating 
and maintenance expenses and ongoing maintenance capital at the plant 
were subject to certain caps during the years of 2016 and 2017. The IGCC 
settlement also included a commitment to either retire or stop burning coal by 
December 31, 2022, at the Gallagher Station. Pursuant to the IGCC settlement, 
the in-service date used for accounting and ratemaking will remain as June 
2013. Remaining deferred costs will be recovered over eight years beginning 
in 2016 and not earn a carrying cost. As of December 31, 2017, deferred 
costs related to the project are approximately $152 million and are included 
in Regulatory assets in Current Assets and Other Noncurrent Assets on Duke 
Energy Indiana’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the IGCC settlement, 
future IGCC riders will be filed annually with the next filing scheduled for first 
quarter 2018.

The ninth semi-annual IGCC rider order was appealed by various 

intervenors and the matter was remanded to the IURC for further proceedings 
and additional findings on a tax in-service issue. On February 2, 2017, the 
IURC issued an order upholding the original decision, finding that an estimate of 
impact on customer rates due to the federal income tax in-service determination 
was reasonable.

On December 7, 2015, Duke Energy Indiana filed a grid infrastructure 

improvement plan with an estimated cost of $1.8 billion in response to guidance 
from IURC orders and the Indiana Court of Appeals decisions related to a new 
statute. The plan uses a combination of advanced technology and infrastructure 
upgrades to improve service to customers and provide them with better 
information about their energy use. It also provides for cost recovery through a 
transmission and distribution rider (T&D Rider). In March 2016, Duke Energy 
Indiana entered into a settlement with all parties to the proceeding except the 
Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, Inc. The settlement agreement decreased 
the capital expenditures eligible for timely recovery of costs in the seven-year 
plan to approximately $1.4 billion, including the removal of an AMI project. 
Under the settlement, the return on equity to be used in the T&D Rider is 10 
percent. The IURC approved the settlement and issued a final order on June 29, 
2016. The order was not appealed and the proceeding is concluded.

The settlement agreement provided for deferral accounting for depreciation 

and post-in-service carrying costs for AMI projects outside the plan. Duke 
Energy Indiana withdrew its request for a regulatory asset for current meters 
and will retain any savings associated with future AMI installation until the next 
retail base rate case, which is required to be filed prior to the end of the plan. 
During the third quarter of 2016, Duke Energy Indiana decided to implement 
the AMI project. This decision resulted in a pretax impairment charge related to 
existing or non-AMI meters of approximately $8 million in 2016, based in part 
on the requirement to file a base rate case in 2022 under the approved plan. 
Duke Energy Indiana evaluates the need for rate cases as part of its business 
planning, based on the outlook of emerging costs, ongoing investment and 
impact related to the Tax Act enacted in late 2017 and expects to file a rate 
case prior to the 2022 requirement. As a result, in 2017, Duke Energy Indiana 
recorded an additional impairment charge of approximately $22 million. As of 
December 31, 2017, Duke Energy Indiana’s remaining net book value of non-AMI 
meters is approximately $21 million and will be depreciated through July 2020.

On December 16, 2013, Benton County Wind Farm LLC (BCWF) filed 
a lawsuit against Duke Energy Indiana seeking damages for past generation 
losses alleging Duke Energy Indiana violated its obligations under a 2006 PPA 
by refusing to offer electricity to the market at negative prices. Damage claims 
continue to increase during times that BCWF is not dispatched. Under 2013 
revised MISO market rules, Duke Energy Indiana is required to make a price 
offer to MISO for the power it proposes to sell into MISO markets and MISO 
determines whether BCWF is dispatched. Because market prices would have 
been negative due to increased market participation, Duke Energy Indiana 
determined it would not bid at negative prices in order to balance customer 
needs against BCWF’s need to run. BCWF contends Duke Energy Indiana 
must bid at the lowest negative price to ensure dispatch, while Duke Energy 

Indiana contends it is not obligated to bid at any particular price, that it cannot 
ensure dispatch with any bid and that it has reasonably balanced the parties’ 
interests. On July 6, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of 
Indiana entered judgment against BCWF on all claims. BCWF appealed the 
decision and on December 9, 2016, the appeals court ruled in favor of BCWF. 
Duke Energy Indiana recorded an obligation and a regulatory asset related to 
the settlement amount in fourth quarter 2016. On June 30, 2017, the parties 
finalized a settlement agreement. Terms of the settlement included Duke Energy 
Indiana paying $29 million for back damages. Additionally, the parties agreed 
on the method by which the contract will be bid into the market in the future. 
The settlement amount was paid in June 2017. The IURC issued an order on 
September 27, 2017, approving recovery of the settlement amount through Duke 
Energy Indiana’s fuel clause. The IURC order has been appealed to the Indiana 
Court of Appeals. Duke Energy Indiana cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

South Carolina Rate Stabilization Adjustment Filing

North Carolina Integrity Management Rider Filings

In June 2017, Piedmont filed with the PSCSC under the South Carolina Rate 

Stabilization Act its quarterly monitoring report for the 12-month period ending 
March 31, 2017. The filing included a revenue deficiency calculation and tariff 
rates in order to permit Piedmont the opportunity to earn the rate of return on 
equity of 12.6 percent established in its last general rate case. On October 4, 
2017, the PSCSC approved a settlement agreement between Piedmont and the 
SC Office of Regulatory Staff. Terms of the settlement included implementation 
of rates for the 12-month period beginning November 2017 with a return on 
equity of 10.2 percent. 

141

In October 2017, Piedmont filed a petition with the NCUC under the 

Integrity Management Rider (IMR) mechanism to collect an additional 
$8.9 million in annual revenues, effective December 2017, based on the eligible 
capital investments closed to integrity and safety projects over the six-month 
period ending September 30, 2017. On November 28, 2017, the NCUC approved 
the requested rate adjustment.

the IMR mechanism to collect an additional $11.6 million in annual revenues, 
effective June 2017, based on the eligible capital investments closed to integrity 
and safety projects over the six-month period ending March 31, 2017.

Tennessee Integrity Management Rider Filing

In November 2017, Piedmont filed a petition with the TPUC under the IMR 

mechanism to collect an additional $3.3 million in annual revenues, effective 
January 2018, based on the eligible capital investments closed to integrity and 
safety projects over the 12-month period ending October 31, 2017. In January 
2018, Piedmont filed an amended computation under the IMR mechanism, 
revising the proposed increase in annual revenues to approximately $0.4 million 
based on the decrease in the corporate federal income tax rate effective 
January 1, 2018. A hearing on this matter is scheduled for March 2018.

OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS

Atlantic Coast Pipeline

On September 2, 2014, Duke Energy, Dominion Resources (Dominion), 

Piedmont and Southern Company Gas announced the formation of Atlantic 
Coast Pipeline, LLC (ACP) to build and own the proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline 
(ACP pipeline), an approximately 600-mile interstate natural gas pipeline 
running from West Virginia to North Carolina. The ACP pipeline is designed 
to meet, in part, the needs identified by Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy 
Progress and Piedmont. Dominion will build and operate the ACP pipeline and 
holds a leading ownership percentage in ACP of 48 percent. Duke Energy owns 
a 47 percent interest through its Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment. 
Southern Company Gas maintains a 5 percent interest. See Notes 12 and 17 for 
additional information related to Duke Energy’s ownership interest.

Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Piedmont, among 

others, will be customers of the pipeline. Purchases will be made under several 
20-year supply contracts, subject to state regulatory approval. On September 18, 
2015, ACP filed an application with the FERC requesting a CPCN authorizing 
ACP to construct the pipeline. ACP executed a construction agreement in 
September 2016. ACP also requested approval of an open access tariff and 
the precedent agreements it entered into with future pipeline customers. In 
December 2016, FERC issued a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) 
indicating that the proposed pipeline would not cause significant harm to the 
environment or protected populations. The FERC issued the final EIS in July 
2017. On October 13, 2017, FERC issued an order approving the CPCN, subject 
to conditions. On October 16, 2017, ACP accepted the FERC order subject to 
reserving its right to file a request for rehearing or clarification on a timely basis. 
On November 9, 2017, ACP filed a request for rehearing on several limited 
issues. On December 12, 2017, ACP filed an answer to intervenors’ request for 
rehearing of the certificate order and for stay of the certificate order.

In December 2017, West Virginia issued a waiver of the state water 

quality permit in reliance on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers national water 
quality permit and Virginia issued a conditional water quality permit subject 
to completion of additional studies and stormwater plans. In early 2018, the 
FERC issued a series of Partial Notices to Proceed which authorized the project 
to begin limited construction-related activities along the pipeline route. North 
Carolina issued the state water quality permit in January 2018. The project 
remains subject to other pending federal and state approvals, which will allow 
full construction activities to begin. The ACP pipeline project has a targeted 
in-service date of late 2019.

Due to delays in obtaining the required permits to commence construction 

and the conditions imposed upon the project by the permits, ACP’s project 
manager estimates the project’s pipeline development costs have increased 
from a range of $5.0 billion to $5.5 billion to a range of $6.0 billion and 
$6.5 billion, excluding financing costs. Project construction activities, schedule 
and final costs are still subject to uncertainty due to potential additional 
permitting delays, construction productivity and other conditions and risks 
which could result in potential higher project costs and a potential delay in the 
targeted in-service date.

Sabal Trail Transmission Pipeline

On May 4, 2015, Duke Energy acquired a 7.5 percent ownership interest 
in Sabal Trail Transmission, LLC (Sabal Trail) from Spectra Energy Partners, LP, 
a master limited partnership, formed by Enbridge Inc. (formerly Spectra Energy 
Corp.). Spectra Energy Partners, LP holds a 50 percent ownership interest in Sabal 
Trail and NextEra Energy has a 42.5 percent ownership interest. Sabal Trail is a 
joint venture to construct a 515-mile natural gas pipeline (Sabal Trail pipeline) to 
transport natural gas to Florida. Total estimated project costs are approximately 
$3.2 billion. The Sabal Trail pipeline traverses Alabama, Georgia and Florida. The 
primary customers of the Sabal Trail pipeline, Duke Energy Florida and Florida 
Power & Light Company (FP&L), have each contracted to buy pipeline capacity for 
25-year initial terms. See Notes 12 and 17 for additional information.

On February 3, 2016, the FERC issued an order granting the request for 
a CPCN to construct and operate the pipeline. The Sabal Trail pipeline received 
other required regulatory approvals and the phase one mainline was placed 
in service in July 2017. On October 12, 2017, Sabal Trail filed a request with 
FERC to place in-service a lateral line to Duke Energy Florida’s Citrus County 
Combined Cycle facility, which remains pending. This request is required to 
support commissioning and testing activities at the facility. 

On September 21, 2016, intervenors filed an appeal of FERC’s CPCN 
orders to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. 
Circuit Court of Appeals). On August 22, 2017, the appeals court ruled against 
FERC in the case for failing to include enough information on the impact of 
greenhouse-gas emissions carried by the pipeline, vacated the CPCN order and 
remanded the case to FERC. In response to the August 2017 court decision, 
the FERC issued a draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) 
on September 27, 2017. On October 6, 2017, FERC and a group of industry 
intervenors, including Sabal Trail and Duke Energy Florida, filed separate 
petitions with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals requesting rehearing regarding 
the court’s decision to vacate the CPCN order. On January 31, 2018, the D.C. 
Circuit Court of Appeals denied the requests for rehearing. On February 2, 2018, 
Sabal Trail filed a request with FERC for expedited issuance of its order on 
remand and reissuance of the CPCN. In the alternative, the pipeline requested 
that FERC issue a temporary emergency CPCN to allow for continued operations. 
On February 5, 2018, FERC issued the final SEIS but did not issue the order 
on remand. On February 6, 2018, FERC and the intervenors in this case each 
filed motions for stay with the D.C. Circuit Court to stay the court’s mandate. 
The February 6, 2018 motions automatically stay the issuance of the court’s 
mandate until the later of seven days after the court denies the motions or the 
expiration of any stay granted by the court. Both motions are pending. Sabal Trail 
will continue to monitor the progress and the impact to the project going forward.

Constitution Pipeline

Duke Energy owns a 24 percent ownership interest in Constitution Pipeline 
Company, LLC (Constitution). Constitution is a natural gas pipeline project slated 
to transport natural gas supplies from the Marcellus supply region in northern 
Pennsylvania to major northeastern markets. The pipeline will be constructed

share. The remaining interest is held by Cabot Oil and Gas Corporation and WGL 
Holdings, Inc. Before the permitting delays discussed below, Duke Energy’s 
total anticipated contributions were approximately $229 million. As a result of 
the permitting delays and project uncertainty, total anticipated contributions by 
Duke Energy can no longer be reasonably estimated.

In December 2014, Constitution received approval from the FERC to 

construct and operate the proposed pipeline. However, on April 22, 2016, the 
New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) denied 
Constitution’s application for a necessary water quality certification for the New 
York portion of the Constitution pipeline. Constitution filed legal actions in the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (U.S. Court of Appeals) challenging 
the legality and appropriateness of the NYSDEC’s decision and on August 18, 
2017, the petition was denied in part and dismissed in part. In September 2017, 
Constitution filed a petition for a rehearing of portions of the decision unrelated 
to the water quality certification, which was denied by the U.S. Court of Appeals. 
In January 2018, Constitution petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States 
to review the U.S. Court of Appeals decision. In October 2017, Constitution 
filed a petition for declaratory order requesting FERC to find that the NYSDEC 
waived its rights to issue a Section 401 water quality certification by not acting 
on Constitution’s application within a reasonable period of time as required by 
statute. This petition was based on precedent established by another pipeline’s 
successful petition with FERC following a District of Columbia Circuit Court 
ruling. On January 11, 2018, FERC denied Constitution’s petition. In February 
2018, Constitution filed a rehearing request with FERC of its finding that the 
NYSDEC did not waive the Section 401 certification requirement. Constitution 
is currently unable to approximate an in-service date for the project due to the 
NYDSEC’s denial of the water quality certification. The Constitution partners 
remain committed to the project and are evaluating next steps to move the 
project forward. Duke Energy cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

Since April 2016, with the actions of the NYSDEC, Constitution stopped 
construction and discontinued capitalization of future development costs until 
the project’s uncertainty is resolved.

See Notes 12 and 17 for additional information related to ownership 

interest and carrying value of the investment.

Progress Energy Merger FERC Mitigation

Following the closing of the Progress Energy merger, outside counsel 

reviewed Duke Energy’s long-term FERC mitigation plan and discovered 
a technical error in the calculations. On December 6, 2013, Duke Energy 
submitted a filing to the FERC disclosing the error and arguing that no additional 
mitigation is necessary. The city of New Bern filed a protest and requested that 
FERC order additional mitigation. On October 29, 2014, the FERC ordered that 
the amount of the stub mitigation be increased from 25 MW to 129 MW. The 
stub mitigation is Duke Energy’s commitment to set aside for third parties a 
certain quantity of firm transmission capacity from Duke Energy Carolinas to 
Duke Energy Progress during summer off-peak hours. The FERC also ordered 
that Duke Energy operate certain phase shifters to create additional import 
capability and that such operation be monitored by an independent monitor. 
The costs to comply with this order are not material. The FERC also referred 
Duke Energy’s failure to expressly designate the phase shifter reactivation as 
a mitigation project in the original mitigation plan filing in March 2012 to the 
FERC Office of Enforcement for further inquiry. In response, and since December 
2014, the FERC Office of Enforcement has been conducting a nonpublic 
investigation of Duke Energy’s market power analyses included in the Progress 
merger filings submitted to FERC. Duke Energy cannot predict the outcome of 
this investigation.

Potential Coal Plant Retirements

The Subsidiary Registrants periodically file Integrated Resource Plans 

(IRP) with their state regulatory commissions. The IRPs provide a view of 
forecasted energy needs over a long term (10 to 20 years) and options being 
considered to meet those needs. Recent IRPs filed by the Subsidiary Registrants 
included planning assumptions to potentially retire certain coal-fired generating 
facilities in Florida and Indiana earlier than their current estimated useful 
lives primarily because facilities do not have the requisite emission control 
equipment to meet EPA regulations recently approved or proposed. 

The table below contains the net carrying value of generating facilities planned for retirement or included in recent IRPs as evaluated for potential retirement 
due to a lack of requisite environmental control equipment. Dollar amounts in the table below are included in Net property, plant and equipment on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2017, and exclude capitalized asset retirement costs.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

INSURANCE

General Insurance

The Duke Energy Registrants have insurance and reinsurance coverage 

either directly or through indemnification from Duke Energy’s captive insurance 
company, Bison, and its affiliates, consistent with companies engaged in 
similar commercial operations with similar type properties. The Duke Energy 
Registrants’ coverage includes (i) commercial general liability coverage for 
liabilities arising to third parties for bodily injury and property damage; (ii) 
workers’ compensation; (iii) automobile liability coverage; and (iv) property 
coverage for all real and personal property damage. Real and personal property 
damage coverage excludes electric transmission and distribution lines, but 
includes damages arising from boiler and machinery breakdowns, earthquakes, 
flood damage and extra expense, but not outage or replacement power 
coverage. All coverage is subject to certain deductibles or retentions, sublimits, 
exclusions, terms and conditions common for companies with similar types of 
operations. The Duke Energy Registrants self-insure their electric transmission 
and distribution lines against loss due to storm damage and other natural 
disasters. As discussed further in Note 4, Duke Energy Florida maintains a 
storm damage reserve and has a regulatory mechanism to recover the cost of 
named storms on an expedited basis.

The cost of the Duke Energy Registrants’ coverage can fluctuate from year 
to year reflecting claims history and conditions of the insurance and reinsurance 
markets.

In the event of a loss, terms and amounts of insurance and reinsurance 
available might not be adequate to cover claims and other expenses incurred. 
Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered by other 
sources, could have a material effect on the Duke Energy Registrants’ results of 
operations, cash flows or financial position. Each company is responsible to the 
extent losses may be excluded or exceed limits of the coverage available.

Nuclear Insurance

Duke Energy Carolinas owns and operates the McGuire Nuclear Station 
(McGuire) and the Oconee Nuclear Station (Oconee) and operates and has a 
partial ownership interest in the Catawba Nuclear Station (Catawba). McGuire 
and Catawba each have two reactors. Oconee has three reactors. The other 
joint owners of Catawba reimburse Duke Energy Carolinas for certain expenses 
associated with nuclear insurance per the Catawba joint owner agreements.
Duke Energy Progress owns and operates the Robinson Nuclear Plant 

(Robinson), Brunswick and Harris. Robinson and Harris each have one reactor. 
Brunswick has two reactors.

Duke Energy Florida owns Crystal River Unit 3, which permanently ceased 

operation in 2013 and reached a SAFSTOR condition in January 2018 after the 
successful transfer of all used nuclear fuel assemblies to an onsite dry cask 
storage facility.

In the event of a loss, terms and amounts of insurance available might not 
be adequate to cover property damage and other expenses incurred. Uninsured 
losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered by other sources, could 
have a material effect on Duke Energy Carolinas’, Duke Energy Progress’ and 
Duke Energy Florida’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 
Each company is responsible to the extent losses may be excluded or exceed 
limits of the coverage available.

Nuclear Liability Coverage

The Price-Anderson Act requires owners of nuclear reactors to provide for 

public nuclear liability protection per nuclear incident up to a maximum total 
financial protection liability. The maximum total financial protection liability, 
which is approximately $13.4 billion, is subject to change every five years for 
inflation and for the number of licensed reactors. Total nuclear liability coverage 
consists of a combination of private primary nuclear liability insurance coverage 
and a mandatory industry risk-sharing program to provide for excess nuclear 
liability coverage above the maximum reasonably available private primary 
coverage. The U.S. Congress could impose revenue-raising measures on the 
nuclear industry to pay claims.

Primary Liability Insurance

Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida 
have purchased the maximum reasonably available private primary nuclear 
liability insurance as required by law, which is $450 million per station.

Excess Liability Program

This program provides $13 billion of coverage per incident through the 

Price-Anderson Act’s mandatory industrywide excess secondary financial 
protection program of risk pooling. This amount is the product of potential 
cumulative retrospective premium assessments of $127 million times the 
current 102 licensed commercial nuclear reactors in the U.S. Under this 
program, licensees could be assessed retrospective premiums to compensate 
for public nuclear liability damages in the event of a nuclear incident at any 
licensed facility in the U.S. Retrospective premiums may be assessed at a rate 
not to exceed $19 million per year per licensed reactor for each incident. The 
assessment may be subject to state premium taxes.

Nuclear Property and Accidental Outage Coverage

Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida 
are members of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), an industry mutual 
insurance company, which provides property damage, nuclear accident 
decontamination and premature decommissioning insurance for each station 
for losses resulting from damage to its nuclear plants, either due to accidents 
or acts of terrorism. Additionally, NEIL provides accidental outage coverage for 
each station for losses in the event of a major accidental outage at an insured 
nuclear station.

Pursuant to regulations of the NRC, each company’s property damage 
insurance policies provide that all proceeds from such insurance be applied, 
first, to place the plant in a safe and stable condition after a qualifying accident 
and second, to decontaminate the plant before any proceeds can be used for 
decommissioning, plant repair or restoration.

Losses resulting from acts of terrorism are covered as common 

occurrences, such that if terrorist acts occur against one or more commercial 
nuclear power plants insured by NEIL within a 12-month period, they would be 
treated as one event and the owners of the plants where the act occurred would 
share one full limit of liability. The full limit of liability is currently $3.2 billion. 
NEIL sublimits the total aggregate for all of their policies for non-nuclear 
terrorist events to approximately $1.83 billion.

and premature decommissioning liability insurance from NEIL with limits 
of $1.5 billion, except for Crystal River Unit 3. Crystal River Unit 3’s limit is 
$50 million and is on an actual cash value basis. All nuclear facilities except for 
Catawba and Crystal River Unit 3 also share an additional $1.25 billion nuclear 
accident insurance limit above their dedicated underlying limit. This shared 
additional excess limit is not subject to reinstatement in the event of a loss. 
Catawba has a dedicated $1.25 billion of additional nuclear accident insurance 
limit above its dedicated underlying limit. Catawba and Oconee also have an 
additional $750 million of non-nuclear accident property damage limit. All 
coverages are subject to sublimits and significant deductibles.

NEIL’s Accidental Outage policy provides some coverage, such as 

business interruption, for losses in the event of a major accident property 
damage outage of a nuclear unit. Coverage is provided on a weekly limit basis 
after a significant waiting period deductible and at 100 percent of the available 
weekly limits for 52 weeks and 80 percent of the available weekly limits for the 
next 110 weeks. Coverage is provided until these available weekly periods are 
met where the accidental outage policy limit will not exceed $490 million for 
McGuire and Catawba, $462 million for Brunswick, $448 million for Harris, $434 
million for Oconee and $378 million for Robinson. NEIL sublimits the accidental 
outage recovery to the first 104 weeks of coverage not to exceed $328 million 
from non-nuclear accidental property damage. Coverage amounts decrease 
in the event more than one unit at a station is out of service due to a common 
accident. All coverages are subject to sublimits and significant deductibles.

Potential Retroactive Premium Assessments

In the event of NEIL losses, NEIL’s board of directors may assess 

member companies’ retroactive premiums of amounts up to 10 times their 
annual premiums for up to six years after a loss. NEIL has never exercised 
this assessment. The maximum aggregate annual retrospective premium 
obligations for Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy 
Florida are $146 million, $96 million and $1 million, respectively. Duke 
Energy Carolinas’ maximum assessment amount includes 100 percent of 

potential obligations to NEIL for jointly owned reactors. Duke Energy Carolinas 
would seek reimbursement from the joint owners for their portion of these 
assessment amounts.

ENVIRONMENTAL

The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to federal, state and local 

regulations regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal 
and other environmental matters. These regulations can be changed from time 
to time, imposing new obligations on the Duke Energy Registrants. The following 
environmental matters impact all of the Duke Energy Registrants. 

Remediation Activities

In addition to the ARO recorded as a result of various environmental 

regulations, discussed in Note 9, the Duke Energy Registrants are responsible 
for environmental remediation at various sites. These include certain properties 
that are part of ongoing operations and sites formerly owned or used by Duke 
Energy entities. These sites are in various stages of investigation, remediation 
and monitoring. Managed in conjunction with relevant federal, state and 
local agencies, remediation activities vary based upon site conditions and 
location, remediation requirements, complexity and sharing of responsibility. 
If remediation activities involve joint and several liability provisions, strict 
liability, or cost recovery or contribution actions, the Duke Energy Registrants 
could potentially be held responsible for environmental impacts caused by 
other potentially responsible parties and may also benefit from insurance 
policies or contractual indemnities that cover some or all cleanup costs. 
Liabilities are recorded when losses become probable and are reasonably 
estimable. The total costs that may be incurred cannot be estimated because 
the extent of environmental impact, allocation among potentially responsible 
parties, remediation alternatives and/or regulatory decisions have not yet been 
determined at all sites. Additional costs associated with remediation activities 
are likely to be incurred in the future and could be significant. Costs are typically 
expensed as Operation, maintenance and other in the Consolidated Statements 
of Operations unless regulatory recovery of the costs is deemed probable.

The following tables contain information regarding reserves for probable and estimable costs related to the various environmental sites. These reserves are 

recorded in Accounts payable within Current Liabilities and Other within Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

North Carolina and South Carolina Ash Basins

In February 2014, a break in a stormwater pipe beneath an ash basin 
at Duke Energy Carolinas’ retired Dan River Steam Station caused a release 
of ash basin water and ash into the Dan River. Duke Energy Carolinas 
estimates 30,000 to 39,000 tons of ash and 24 million to 27 million gallons of 
basin water were released into the river. In July 2014, Duke Energy completed 
remediation work identified by the EPA and continues to cooperate with the 
EPA’s civil enforcement process. Future costs related to the Dan River release, 
including future state or federal civil enforcement proceedings, future regulatory 
directives, natural resources damages, future claims or litigation and long-term 
environmental impact costs, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ) has 
historically assessed Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress with 
Notice of Violations (NOV) for violations that were most often resolved through 
satisfactory corrective actions and minor, if any, fines or penalties. Subsequent 
to the Dan River ash release, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress 
have been served with a higher level of NOVs, including assessed penalties for 
violations at L.V. Sutton Combined Cycle Plant (Sutton) and Dan River Steam 
Station. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress cannot predict 
whether the NCDEQ will assess future penalties related to existing unresolved 
NOVs and if such penalties would be material. See “NCDEQ Notices of Violation” 
section below for additional discussion. 

LITIGATION

Duke Energy

Duke Energy no longer has exposure to litigation matters related to the 
International Disposal Group as a result of the divestiture of the business in 
December 2016. See Note 2 for additional information related to the sale of 
International Energy.

Ash Basin Shareholder Derivative Litigation

Five shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in Delaware Chancery 
Court relating to the release at Dan River and to the management of Duke 
Energy’s ash basins. On October 31, 2014, the five lawsuits were consolidated 
in a single proceeding titled In Re Duke Energy Corporation Coal Ash 
Derivative Litigation. On December 2, 2014, plaintiffs filed a Corrected Verified 
Consolidated Shareholder Derivative Complaint (Consolidated Complaint). 
The Consolidated Complaint names as defendants several current and former 
Duke Energy officers and directors (collectively, the “Duke Energy Defendants”). 
Duke Energy is named as a nominal defendant.

The Consolidated Complaint alleges the Duke Energy Defendants 

breached their fiduciary duties by failing to adequately oversee Duke Energy’s 
ash basins and that these breaches of fiduciary duty may have contributed to 
the incident at Dan River and continued thereafter. The lawsuit also asserts 
claims against the Duke Energy Defendants for corporate waste (relating to the 
money Duke Energy has spent and will spend as a result of the fines, penalties 
and coal ash removal) and unjust enrichment (relating to the compensation 
and director remuneration that was received despite these alleged breaches 
of fiduciary duty). The lawsuit seeks both injunctive relief against Duke Energy 
and restitution from the Duke Energy Defendants. On January 21, 2015, the 
Duke Energy Defendants filed a Motion to Stay, which the court granted. The 
stay was lifted on March 24, 2016, after which plaintiffs filed an Amended 
Verified Consolidated Shareholder Derivative Complaint (Amended Complaint) 
making the same allegations as in the Consolidated Complaint. The Duke Energy 
Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint on June 21, 2016, 
which was granted by the Court on December 14, 2016. Plaintiffs filed an 
appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court on January 9, 2017. Oral argument was 
held on September 27, 2017. On December 15, 2017, the Delaware Supreme 
Court affirmed the Chancery Court’s order of dismissal.

In addition to the above derivative complaints, in 2014, Duke Energy 
received two shareholder litigation demand letters. The letters alleged that 
the members of the Board of Directors and certain officers breached their 
fiduciary duties by allowing the company to illegally dispose of and store coal 
ash pollutants. One of the letters also alleged a breach of fiduciary duty in 
the decision-making relating to the leadership changes following the close of 
the Progress Energy merger in July 2012. By letter dated September 4, 2015, 
attorneys for the shareholders were informed that, on the recommendation of 
the Demand Review Committee formed to consider such matters, the Board of 
Directors concluded not to pursue potential claims against individuals. One of 
the shareholders, Mitchell Pinsly, sent a formal demand for records and Duke 
Energy has responded to this request. There was no follow-up after the records 
were provided; therefore, this matter has been resolved.

On October 30, 2015, shareholder Saul Bresalier filed a shareholder 
derivative complaint (Bresalier Complaint) in the U.S. District Court for the 
District of Delaware. The lawsuit alleges that several current and former Duke 
Energy officers and directors (Bresalier Defendants) breached their fiduciary 
duties in connection with coal ash environmental issues, the post-merger 
change in Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and oversight of political contributions. 
Duke Energy is named as a nominal defendant. The Bresalier Complaint 
contends that the Demand Review Committee failed to appropriately consider 
the shareholder’s earlier demand for litigation and improperly decided not 
to pursue claims against the Bresalier Defendants. On March 30, 2017, the 
court granted Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss on the claims relating to coal 
ash environmental issues and political contributions. As discussed below, 
a settlement agreement was approved for the merger-related claims in the 
Bresalier Complaint, and those claims were dismissed. On September 8, 
2017, Bresalier filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Third Circuit (Third Circuit Court) challenging the dismissal of his coal ash and 
political contribution claims. On January 19 2018, Bresalier filed a stipulation of 
dismissal, closing this case.

Progress Energy Merger Shareholder Litigation

Duke Energy, the 11 members of the Board of Directors who were also 

members of the pre-merger Board of Directors (Legacy Duke Energy Directors) 
and certain Duke Energy officers were defendants in a purported securities 
class-action lawsuit (Nieman v. Duke Energy Corporation, et al). This lawsuit 
consolidated three lawsuits originally filed in July 2012. The plaintiffs alleged

claims based on allegations of materially false and misleading representations 
and omissions in the Registration Statement filed on July 7, 2011, and purportedly 
incorporated into other documents, all in connection with the post-merger change 
in CEO. On August 15, 2014, the parties reached an agreement in principle 
to settle the litigation. On March 10, 2015, the parties filed a Stipulation of 
Settlement and a Motion for Preliminary Approval of the Settlement. Under the 
terms of the agreement, Duke Energy agreed to pay $146 million to settle the 
claim. On April 22, 2015, Duke Energy made a payment of $25 million into the 
settlement escrow account. The remainder of $121 million was paid by insurers 
into the settlement escrow account. The final order approving the settlement was 
issued on November 2, 2015, thus closing the matter.

On May 31, 2013, the Delaware Chancery Court consolidated four 

shareholder derivative lawsuits filed in 2012. The Court also appointed a lead 
plaintiff and counsel for plaintiffs and designated the case as In Re Duke Energy 
Corporation Derivative Litigation (Merger Chancery Litigation). The lawsuit 
names as defendants the Legacy Duke Energy Directors. Duke Energy is named 
as a nominal defendant. The case alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duties 
of loyalty and care in connection with the post-merger change in CEO.

Two shareholder Derivative Complaints, filed in 2012 in federal district 

court in Delaware, were consolidated as Tansey v. Rogers, et al. The case 
alleges claims against the Legacy Duke Energy Directors for breach of fiduciary 
duty and waste of corporate assets, as well as claims under Section 14(a) and 
20(a) of the Exchange Act. Duke Energy is named as a nominal defendant. On 
December 21, 2015, Plaintiff filed a Consolidated Amended Complaint asserting 
the same claims contained in the original complaints.

The Legacy Duke Energy Directors have reached an agreement-in-

principle to settle the Merger Chancery Litigation, conditioned on dismissal as 
well, of the Tansey v. Rogers, et al case and the merger related claims in the 
Bresalier Complaint discussed above, which was approved by the Delaware 
Chancery Court on July 13, 2017. The entire settlement amount was funded by 
insurance. The settlement amount, less court-approved attorney fees, totaled 
$20 million and was paid to Duke Energy in 2017.

NCDEQ State Enforcement Actions

In the first quarter of 2013, Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) 
sent notices of intent to sue Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress 
related to alleged Clean Water Act (CWA) violations from coal ash basins 
at two of their coal-fired power plants in North Carolina. The NCDEQ filed 
enforcement actions against Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress 
alleging violations of water discharge permits and North Carolina groundwater 
standards. The cases have been consolidated and are being heard before a 
single judge in the North Carolina Superior Court.

On August 16, 2013, the NCDEQ filed an enforcement action against Duke 
Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress related to their remaining plants in 
North Carolina alleging violations of the CWA and violations of the North Carolina 
groundwater standards. Both of these cases have been assigned to the judge 
handling the enforcement actions discussed above. SELC is representing several 
environmental groups who have been permitted to intervene in these cases.
The court issued orders in 2016 granting Motions for Partial Summary 

Judgment for seven of the 14 North Carolina plants with coal ash basins 
named in the enforcement actions. On February 13, 2017, the court issued 
an order denying motions for partial summary judgment brought by both the 
environmental groups and Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress for 
the remaining seven plants. On March 15, 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas and 
Duke Energy Progress filed a Notice of Appeal to challenge the trial court’s order. 
The parties were unable to reach an agreement at mediation in April 2017. 
The parties submitted briefs to the court on remaining issues to be tried and a 
ruling is pending. On August 22, 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy 
Progress filed a Petition for Discretionary Review, requesting the North Carolina 
Supreme Court to accept the appeal. On August 24, 2017, SELC filed a motion to 
dismiss the appeal. Duke Energy Carolinas’ and Duke Energy Progress’ opening 
appellate briefs were filed on October 12, 2017, and briefing is now complete. 
Argument was held on February 8, 2018.

It is not possible to predict any liability or estimate any damages Duke 

Energy Carolinas or Duke Energy Progress might incur in connection with 
these matters.

Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress

Coal Ash Insurance Coverage Litigation

In March 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed a 

civil action in North Carolina Superior Court against various insurance providers. 
The lawsuit seeks payment for coal ash-related liabilities covered by third-party 
liability insurance policies. The insurance policies were issued between 1971 
and 1986 and provide third-party liability insurance for property damage. The 
civil action seeks damages for breach of contract and indemnification for costs 
arising from the Coal Ash Act and the EPA CCR rule at 15 coal-fired plants in 
North Carolina and South Carolina. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy 
Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

NCDEQ Notice of Violation

On February 8, 2016, the NCDEQ assessed a penalty of approximately 

$6.8 million, including enforcement costs, against Duke Energy Carolinas 
related to stormwater pipes and associated discharges at the Dan River Steam 
Station. Duke Energy Carolinas recorded a charge in December 2015 for this 
penalty. In March 2016, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an appeal of this penalty. 
On September 23, 2016, Duke Energy Carolinas entered into a settlement 
agreement with the NCDEQ, without admission of liability, under which Duke 
Energy Carolinas agreed to a payment of $6 million to resolve allegations 
underlying the asserted civil penalty related to the Dan River coal ash release 
and a March 4, 2016, NOV alleging unpermitted discharges at the facility.

Federal Citizens Suits

On June 13, 2016, the Roanoke River Basin Association (RRBA) filed a 

federal citizen suit in the Middle District of North Carolina alleging unpermitted 
discharges to surface water and groundwater violations at the Mayo Plant. On 
August 19, 2016, Duke Energy Progress filed a Motion to Dismiss. On April 26, 
2017, the court entered an order dismissing four of the claims in the federal 
citizen suit. Two claims relating to alleged violations of National Pollutant 
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit provisions survived the motion 
to dismiss, and Duke Energy Progress filed its response on May 10, 2017. The 
parties are engaged in pre-trial discovery. Trial has been scheduled for July 9, 
2018.

On March 16, 2017, RRBA served Duke Energy Progress with a Notice 

of Intent to Sue under the CWA for alleged violations of effluent standards 
and limitations at the Roxboro Plant. In anticipation of litigation, Duke Energy 
Progress filed a Complaint for Declaratory Relief in the U.S. District Court for 
the Western District of Virginia on May 11, 2017, which was subsequently 
dismissed. On May 16, 2017, RRBA filed a federal citizen suit in the U.S. District 
Court for the Middle District of North Carolina which asserts two claims relating 
to alleged violations of NPDES permit provisions and one claim relating to the 
use of nearby water bodies. The parties are engaged in pre-trial discovery. Trial 
has been scheduled for October 1, 2018.

the Mayo Plant under the EPA CCR Rule. Duke Energy Progress filed a motion to 
dismiss, which was argued on January 30, 2018.

On August 2, 2017, RRBA filed a federal citizen suit in the U.S. District 
Court for the Middle District of North Carolina challenging the closure plans at 
the Roxboro Plant under the EPA CCR Rule. Duke Energy Progress filed a motion 
to dismiss on October 2, 2017.

On December 6, 2017, various parties filed a federal citizen suit in the 

U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina for alleged violations 
at Duke Energy Carolinas’ Belews Creek Steam Station (Belews Creek) under the 
CWA. Duke Energy Carolinas filed a motion to dismiss on February 5, 2018.

It is not possible to predict whether Duke Energy Carolinas or Duke Energy 

Progress will incur any liability or to estimate the damages, if any, they might 
incur in connection with these matters.

Five previously filed cases involving the Riverbend, Cape Fear, H.F. Lee, 

Sutton and Buck plants have been dismissed or settled during 2016.

Groundwater Contamination Claims

Beginning in May 2015, a number of residents living in the vicinity of 

the North Carolina facilities with ash basins received letters from the NCDEQ 
advising them not to drink water from the private wells on their land tested by 
the NCDEQ as the samples were found to have certain substances at levels 
higher than the criteria set by the North Carolina Department of Health and 
Human Services (DHHS). Results of Comprehensive Site Assessments (CSAs) 
testing performed by Duke Energy under the Coal Ash Act have been consistent 
with historical data provided to state regulators over many years. The DHHS and 
NCDEQ sent follow-up letters on October 15, 2015, to residents near coal ash 
basins who have had their wells tested, stating that private well samplings at a 
considerable distance from coal ash basins, as well as some municipal water 
supplies, contain similar levels of vanadium and hexavalent chromium, which 
led investigators to believe these constituents are naturally occurring. In March 
2016, DHHS rescinded the advisories.

Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have received formal 
demand letters from residents near Duke Energy Carolinas’ and Duke Energy 
Progress’ coal ash basins. The residents claim damages for nuisance and 
diminution in property value, among other things. The parties held three days 
of mediation discussions which ended at impasse. On January 6, 2017, Duke 
Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress received the plaintiffs’ notice of 
their intent to file suits should the matter not settle. The NCDEQ preliminarily 
approved Duke Energy’s permanent water solution plans on January 13, 2017, 
and as a result shortly thereafter, Duke Energy issued a press release, providing 
additional details regarding the homeowner compensation package. This 
package consists of three components: (i) a $5,000 goodwill payment to each 
eligible well owner to support the transition to a new water supply, (ii) where 
a public water supply is available and selected by the eligible well owner, a 
stipend to cover 25 years of water bills and (iii) the Property Value Protection 
Plan. The Property Value Protection Plan is a program offered by Duke Energy 
designed to guarantee eligible plant neighbors the fair market value of their 
residential property should they decide to sell their property during the time that 
the plan is offered. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress recognized 
reserves of $19 million and $4 million, respectively.

On August 23, 2017, a class-action suit was filed in Wake County Superior 
Court, North Carolina, against Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress 
on behalf of certain property owners living near coal ash impoundments at Allen, 
Asheville, Belews Creek, Buck, Cliffside, Lee, Marshall, Mayo and Roxboro. 
The class is defined as those who are well-eligible under the Coal Ash Act or 

148

those to whom Duke Energy has promised a permanent replacement water 
supply and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, along with compensatory 
damages. Plaintiffs allege that Duke Energy’s improper maintenance of coal ash 
impoundments caused harm, particularly through groundwater contamination. 
Despite NCDEQ’s preliminary approval, Plaintiffs contend that Duke Energy’s 
proposed permanent water solutions plan fails to comply with the Coal Ash 
Act. On September 28, 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress 
filed a Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Strike the class designation. The parties 
entered into a Settlement Agreement on January 24, 2018, which resulted in the 
dismissal of the underlying class action on January 25, 2018.

On September 14, 2017, a complaint was filed against Duke Energy 
Progress in New Hanover County Superior Court by a group of homeowners 
residing approximately 1 mile from Duke Energy Progress’ Sutton Steam Plant. 
The homeowners allege that coal ash constituents have been migrating from ash 
impoundments at Sutton into their groundwater for decades and that in 2015, 
Duke Energy Progress discovered these releases of coal ash, but failed to notify 
any officials or neighbors and failed to take remedial action. The homeowners 
claim unspecified physical and mental injuries as a result of consuming their

and the hearing is scheduled for March 7, 2018.

It is not possible to estimate the maximum exposure of loss, if any, that 
may occur in connection with claims which might be made by these residents.

Duke Energy Carolinas

Asbestos-related Injuries and Damages Claims

Duke Energy Carolinas has experienced numerous claims for 

indemnification and medical cost reimbursement related to asbestos exposure. 
These claims relate to damages for bodily injuries alleged to have arisen from 
exposure to or use of asbestos in connection with construction and maintenance 
activities conducted on its electric generation plants prior to 1985. As of 
December 31, 2017, there were 161 asserted claims for non-malignant cases 
with the cumulative relief sought of up to $42 million and 54 asserted claims for 
malignant cases with the cumulative relief sought of up to $16 million. Based on 
Duke Energy Carolinas’ experience, it is expected that the ultimate resolution of 
most of these claims likely will be less than the amount claimed.

Duke Energy Carolinas has recognized asbestos-related reserves of 

$489 million and $512 million at December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 
These reserves are classified in Other within Other Noncurrent Liabilities and 
Other within Current Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These 
reserves are based upon the minimum amount of the range of loss for current 
and future asbestos claims through 2037, are recorded on an undiscounted 
basis and incorporate anticipated inflation. In light of the uncertainties inherent 
in a longer-term forecast, management does not believe they can reasonably 
estimate the indemnity and medical costs that might be incurred after 2037 
related to such potential claims. It is possible Duke Energy Carolinas may incur 
asbestos liabilities in excess of the recorded reserves.

Duke Energy Carolinas has third-party insurance to cover certain losses 

related to asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate self-
insured retention. Duke Energy Carolinas’ cumulative payments began to exceed 
the self-insurance retention in 2008. Future payments up to the policy limit will 
be reimbursed by the third-party insurance carrier. The insurance policy limit 
for potential future insurance recoveries indemnification and medical cost claim 
payments is $797 million in excess of the self-insured retention. Receivables for 
insurance recoveries were $585 million and $587 million at December 31, 2017, 
and 2016, respectively. These amounts are classified in Other within Other

Balance Sheets. Duke Energy Carolinas is not aware of any uncertainties 
regarding the legal sufficiency of insurance claims. Duke Energy Carolinas 
believes the insurance recovery asset is probable of recovery as the insurance 
carrier continues to have a strong financial strength rating.

Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida

Spent Nuclear Fuel Matters

On October 16, 2014, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida sued 
the U.S. in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The lawsuit claimed the Department 
of Energy breached a contract in failing to accept spent nuclear fuel under the 
Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and asserted damages for the cost of on-site 
storage. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida asserted damages for 
the period January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2013, of $48 million and 
$25 million, respectively. On November 17, 2017, the Court awarded Duke Energy 
Progress and Duke Energy Florida $48 million and $21 million, respectively, 
subject to appeal. No appeals were filed and Duke Energy Progress and Duke 
Energy Florida will recognize the recoveries in the first quarter of 2018. Claims 
for all periods through 2013 have been resolved. Additional claims will be filed 
in 2018.

Duke Energy Progress

Gypsum Supply Agreements Matter

On June 30, 2017, CertainTeed Gypsum NC, Inc. (CertainTeed) filed a 

declaratory judgment action against Duke Energy Progress in the North Carolina 
Business Court relating to a gypsum supply agreement. In its complaint, 
CertainTeed seeks an order from the court declaring that the minimum amount 
of gypsum Duke Energy Progress must provide to CertainTeed under the supply 
agreement is 50,000 tons per month through 2029. On September 28, 2017, 
the Court denied CertainTeed’s motion for summary judgment. Discovery in the 
case is underway and a trial date has not been set. In light of the volatility in 
future production of gypsum, Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome 
of this matter. 

Duke Energy Florida

Class-Action Lawsuit

On February 22, 2016, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the 
Southern District of Florida on behalf of a putative class of Duke Energy Florida 
and FP&L’s customers in Florida. The suit alleges the State of Florida’s nuclear 
power plant cost recovery statutes (NCRS) are unconstitutional and pre-empted 
by federal law. Plaintiffs claim they are entitled to repayment of all money 
paid by customers of Duke Energy Florida and FP&L as a result of the NCRS, 
as well as an injunction against any future charges under those statutes. The 
constitutionality of the NCRS has been challenged unsuccessfully in a number of 
prior cases on alternative grounds. Duke Energy Florida and FP&L filed motions 
to dismiss the complaint on May 5, 2016. On September 21, 2016, the Court 
granted the motions to dismiss with prejudice. Plaintiffs filed a motion for 
reconsideration, which was denied. On January 4, 2017, plaintiffs filed a notice 
of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals. The appeal, which has been fully briefed, 
was heard on August 22, 2017, and a decision is pending. Duke Energy Florida 
cannot predict the outcome of this appeal.

Westinghouse Contract Litigation

On March 28, 2014, Duke Energy Florida filed a lawsuit against 

Westinghouse in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina. 
The lawsuit seeks recovery of $54 million in milestone payments in excess of 
work performed under the terminated EPC for Levy as well as a determination 
by the court of the amounts due to Westinghouse as a result of the termination 
of the EPC. Duke Energy Florida recognized an exit obligation as a result of the 
termination of the EPC contract.

On March 31, 2014, Westinghouse filed a lawsuit against Duke Energy 

Florida in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. The 
Pennsylvania lawsuit alleged damages under the EPC in excess of $510 million 
for engineering and design work, costs to end supplier contracts and an alleged 
termination fee.

On June 9, 2014, the judge in the North Carolina case ruled that the 

litigation will proceed in the Western District of North Carolina. On July 11, 2016, 
Duke Energy Florida and Westinghouse filed separate Motions for Summary 
Judgment. On September 29, 2016, the court issued its ruling on the parties’ 
respective Motions for Summary Judgment, ruling in favor of Westinghouse 
on a $30 million termination fee claim and dismissing Duke Energy Florida’s 
$54 million refund claim, but stating that Duke Energy Florida could use the 
refund claim to offset any damages for termination costs. Westinghouse’s 
claim for termination costs was unaffected by this ruling and continued to 
trial. At trial, Westinghouse reduced its claim for termination costs from $482 
million to $424 million. Following a trial on the matter, the court issued its final 
order in December 2016 denying Westinghouse’s claim for termination costs 
and re-affirming its earlier ruling in favor of Westinghouse on the $30 million 
termination fee and Duke Energy Florida’s refund claim. Judgment was entered 
against Duke Energy Florida in the amount of approximately $34 million, which 
includes pre-judgment interest. Westinghouse has appealed the trial court’s 
order and Duke Energy Florida has cross-appealed. Duke Energy Florida cannot 
predict the ultimate outcome of the appeal of the trial court’s order.

On March 29, 2017, Westinghouse filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 
the Southern District of New York, which automatically stayed the appeal. 
On May 23, 2017, the bankruptcy court entered an order lifting the stay 
with respect to the appeal. Briefing of the appeal concluded on October 20, 
2017. Oral argument in the appeal was originally set for March 2018 but has 
tentatively been rescheduled to May 2018, due to scheduling conflicts.

Ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material effect on the 
results of operations, financial position or cash flows of Duke Energy Florida. 
See discussion of the 2017 Settlement and the Levy Nuclear Project in Note 4 
for additional information regarding recovery of costs related to Westinghouse. 
The 2017 Settlement does not permit recovery of any amounts paid to resolve 
this contract litigation.

MGP Cost Recovery Action

On December 30, 2011, Duke Energy Florida filed a lawsuit against 

FirstEnergy Corp. (FirstEnergy) to recover investigation and remediation costs 
incurred by Duke Energy Florida in connection with the restoration of two former 
MGP sites in Florida. Duke Energy Florida alleged that FirstEnergy, as the 
successor to Associated Gas & Electric Co., owes past and future contribution 
and response costs of up to $43 million for the investigation and remediation 
of MGP sites. On December 6, 2016, the trial court entered judgment against 
Duke Energy Florida in the case. In January 2017, Duke Energy Florida appealed 
the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which has been 
fully briefed and argued. Duke Energy Florida cannot predict the outcome of this 
appeal.

Antitrust Lawsuit

In January 2008, four plaintiffs, including individual, industrial and 

nonprofit customers, filed a lawsuit against Duke Energy Ohio in federal court 
in the Southern District of Ohio. Plaintiffs alleged Duke Energy Ohio conspired 
to provide inequitable and unfair price advantages for certain large business 
consumers by entering into nonpublic option agreements in exchange for 
their withdrawal of challenges to Duke Energy Ohio’s Rate Stabilization Plan 
implemented in early 2005. In March 2014, a federal judge certified this matter 
as a class action. Plaintiffs alleged claims of antitrust violations under the 
federal Robinson Patman Act as well as fraud and conspiracy allegations under 
the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute and the Ohio 
Corrupt Practices Act.

During 2015, the parties received preliminary court approval of a 

settlement agreement. Duke Energy Ohio recorded a litigation settlement reserve 
of $81 million classified in Other within Current Liabilities on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015. Duke Energy Ohio also recognized a pretax 
charge of $81 million in (Loss) Income From Discontinued Operations, net of tax 
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for 
the year ended December 31, 2015. The settlement agreement was approved at 
a federal court hearing on April 19, 2016. Distribution of the settlement checks 
was approved by the court in January 2017 and all settlement amounts have 
been paid. See Note 2 for further discussion on the Midwest Generation Exit.

Other Litigation and Legal Proceedings

The Duke Energy Registrants are involved in other legal, tax and regulatory 

proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, some of which involve 
significant amounts. The Duke Energy Registrants believe the final disposition of 
these proceedings will not have a material effect on their results of operations, 
cash flows or financial position.

The table below presents recorded reserves based on management’s 
best estimate of probable loss for legal matters, excluding asbestos-related 
reserves and the exit obligation discussed above related to the termination of 
an EPC contract. Reserves are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in 
Other within Other Noncurrent Liabilities and Accounts payable and Other within 

Current Liabilities. The reasonably possible range of loss in excess of recorded 
reserves is not material, other than as described above.

OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

General

As part of their normal business, the Duke Energy Registrants are party 
to various financial guarantees, performance guarantees and other contractual 
commitments to extend guarantees of credit and other assistance to various 
subsidiaries, investees and other third parties. These guarantees involve 
elements of performance and credit risk, which are not fully recognized on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets and have unlimited maximum potential payments. 
However, the Duke Energy Registrants do not believe these guarantees will have 
a material effect on their results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

Gas Supply and Capacity Contracts

Duke Energy Ohio and Piedmont routinely enter into long-term natural 
gas supply commodity and capacity commitments and other agreements that 
commit future cash flows to acquire services needed in their businesses. These 
commitments include pipeline and storage capacity contracts and natural gas 
supply contracts to provide service to customers. Costs arising from the natural 
gas supply commodity and capacity commitments, while significant, are pass-

through costs to customers and are generally fully recoverable through the fuel 
adjustment or PGA procedures and prudence reviews in North Carolina and South 
Carolina and under the Tennessee Incentive Plan in Tennessee. In the Midwest, 
these costs are recovered via the Gas Cost Recovery Rate in Ohio or the Gas 
Cost Adjustment Clause in Kentucky. The time periods for fixed payments under 
pipeline and storage capacity contracts are up to 19 years. The time periods for 
fixed payments under natural gas supply contracts are up to three years. The 
time period for the natural gas supply purchase commitments is up to 15 years.

(a)  Excludes $1,732 million in purchase accounting adjustments related to the Progress Energy merger and the Piedmont acquisition.

The Duke Energy Registrants have the ability under certain debt facilities to call and repay the obligation prior to its scheduled maturity. Therefore, the actual 

timing of future cash repayments could be materially different than as presented above.

Short-Term Obligations Classified as Long-Term Debt

Tax-exempt bonds that may be put to the Duke Energy Registrants at the option of the holder and certain commercial paper issuances and money pool 

borrowings are classified as Long-Term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These tax-exempt bonds, commercial paper issuances and money pool borrowings, 
which are short-term obligations by nature, are classified as long term due to Duke Energy’s intent and ability to utilize such borrowings as long-term financing. 
As Duke Energy’s Master Credit Facility and other bilateral letter of credit agreements have non-cancelable terms in excess of one year as of the balance sheet 
date, Duke Energy has the ability to refinance these short-term obligations on a long-term basis. The following tables show short-term obligations classified as 
long-term debt.

(a)  Proceeds were used to pay down outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.
(b)  Proceeds were used to finance a portion of the Piedmont acquisition. The $4.9 billion Bridge Facility was terminated following the issuance of this debt. See Note 2 for additional information on the Piedmont acquisition.
(c)  DEFPF issued nuclear-asset recovery bonds and used the proceeds to acquire nuclear-asset recovery property from its parent, Duke Energy Florida. The nuclear-asset recovery bonds are payable only from and secured by 

the nuclear asset-recovery property. DEFPF is consolidated for financial reporting purposes; however, the nuclear asset-recovery bonds do not constitute a debt, liability or other legal obligation of, or interest in, Duke Energy 
Florida or any of its affiliates other than DEFPF. The assets of DEFPF, including the nuclear-asset recovery property, are not available to pay creditors of Duke Energy Florida or any of its affiliates. Duke Energy Florida used 
the proceeds from the sale to repay short-term borrowings under the intercompany money pool borrowing arrangement and make an equity distribution of $649 million to the ultimate parent, Duke Energy (Parent), which 
repaid short-term borrowings. The nuclear-asset recovery bonds are sequential pay amortizing bonds. The maturity date above represents the scheduled final maturity date for the bonds. See Notes 4 and 17 for additional 
information.

(d)  Emerald State Solar, LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy entered into portfolio financing of approximately 22 North Carolina solar facilities. Tranche A of $228 million is secured by substantially all of 
the assets of the solar facilities and is nonrecourse to Duke Energy. Tranche B of $105 million is secured by an Equity Contribution Agreement with Duke Energy. Proceeds were used to reimburse Duke Energy for a portion 
of previously funded construction expenditures related to the Emerald State Solar, LLC portfolio. The initial interest rate on the loans was six months London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin of 
1.75 percent plus a 0.125 percent increase every three years thereafter. In connection with this debt issuance, Emerald State Solar, LLC entered into two interest rate swaps to convert the substantial majority of the loan 
interest payments from variable rates to fixed rates of approximately 1.81 percent for Tranche A and 1.38 percent for Tranche B, plus the applicable margin. See Note 14 for further information on the notional amounts of the 
interest rate swaps.

(e)  Proceeds were used to fund capital expenditures for ongoing construction, capital maintenance and for general corporate purposes.
(f)  Proceeds were used to repay $325 million of unsecured debt due June 2016, $150 million of first mortgage bonds due July 2016 and for general corporate purposes.
(g)  Proceeds were used to fund capital expenditures for ongoing construction, capital maintenance, to repay short-term borrowings under the intercompany money pool borrowing arrangement and for general corporate purposes.
(h)  Proceeds were used to repay at maturity $350 million aggregate principal amount of certain bonds due December 2016, as well as to fund capital expenditures for ongoing construction and capital maintenance and for general 

corporate purposes.

(i)  Debt issuance has a floating interest rate.

In July 2016, Piedmont issued $300 million unsecured notes maturing 
in November 2046 with an interest rate of 3.64%. Piedmont has the option to 
redeem all or part of the notes before May 1, 2046, at a redemption price equal 
to the greater of a) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, 
and b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments 
of principal and interest on the notes to be redeemed, discounted to the date 
of redemption on a semi-annual basis at the Treasury Rate as defined in the 
indenture, as supplemented, plus 25 basis points and any accrued and unpaid 
interest to the date of redemption. Piedmont has the option to redeem all or part 
of the notes on or after May 1, 2046, at 100% of the principal amounts plus 
any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Piedmont used the 
proceeds to fund capital expenditures, to repay short-term borrowings under 
Piedmont’s commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes.

Available Credit Facilities

In March 2017, Duke Energy amended its Master Credit Facility 

to increase its capacity from $7.5 billion to $8 billion, and to extend the 
termination date of the facility from January 30, 2020, to March 16, 2022. 
The amendment also added Piedmont as a borrower within the Master Credit 
Facility. Piedmont’s separate $850 million credit facility was terminated 
in connection with the amendment. With the amendment, the Duke Energy 
Registrants, excluding Progress Energy (Parent), have borrowing capacity 
under the Master Credit Facility up to specified sublimits for each borrower. 
Duke Energy has the unilateral ability at any time to increase or decrease the 
borrowing sublimits of each borrower, subject to a maximum sublimit for each 
borrower. The amount available under the Master Credit Facility has been

and variable-rate demand tax-exempt bonds that may be put to the Duke 
Energy Registrants at the option of the holder. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke 
Energy Progress are also required to each maintain $250 million of available 
capacity under the Master Credit Facility as security to meet obligations under 

plea agreements reached with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2015 related to 
violations at North Carolina facilities with ash basins.

In January 2018, Duke Energy further amended its Master Credit Facility 
with consenting lenders to extend $7.65 billion of our existing $8 billion Master 
Credit Facility by one year to March 16, 2023.

(a)  Represents the sublimit of each borrower.
(b)  Duke Energy issued $625 million of commercial paper and loaned the proceeds through the money pool to Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. The balances are classified 

as Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Companies in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility

In June 2017, Duke Energy (Parent) entered into a three-year $1.0 billion 
revolving credit facility (the Three Year Revolver). Borrowings under this facility 
will be used for general corporate purposes.

As of December 31, 2017, $500 million has been drawn under the Three 
Year Revolver. This balance is classified as Long-Term Debt on Duke Energy’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any undrawn commitments can be drawn, and 
borrowings can be prepaid, at any time throughout the term of the facility. The 
terms and conditions of the Three Year Revolver are generally consistent with 
those governing Duke Energy’s Master Credit Facility.

Piedmont Term Loan Facility

In June 2017, Piedmont entered into an 18-month term loan facility with 

commitments totaling $250 million (the Piedmont Term Loan). Borrowings under 
the facility will be used for general corporate purposes. 

As of December 31, 2017, the entire $250 million has been drawn 

under the Piedmont Term Loan. This balance is classified as Long-Term Debt 
on Piedmont’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The terms and conditions of 
the Piedmont Term Loan are generally consistent with those governing Duke 
Energy’s Master Credit Facility.

Other Debt Matters

In September 2016, Duke Energy filed a Registration statement (Form 
S-3) with the SEC. Under this Form S-3, which is uncapped, the Duke Energy 
Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, may issue debt and other securities in 
the future at amounts, prices and with terms to be determined at the time of 
future offerings. The registration statement was filed to replace a similar prior 
filing upon expiration of its three-year term and also allows for the issuance of 
common stock by Duke Energy.

Duke Energy has an effective Form S-3 with the SEC to sell up to $3 billion 

of variable denomination floating-rate demand notes, called PremierNotes. 
The Form S-3 states that no more than $1.5 billion of the notes will be 
outstanding at any particular time. The notes are offered on a continuous basis 

and bear interest at a floating rate per annum determined by the Duke Energy 
PremierNotes Committee, or its designee, on a weekly basis. The interest rate 
payable on notes held by an investor may vary based on the principal amount 
of the investment. The notes have no stated maturity date, are non-transferable 
and may be redeemed in whole or in part by Duke Energy or at the investor’s 
option at any time. The balance as of December 31, 2017, and 2016 was 
$986 million and $1,090 million, respectively. The notes are short-term debt 
obligations of Duke Energy and are reflected as Notes payable and commercial 
paper on Duke Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In January 2017, Duke Energy amended its Form S-3 to add Piedmont as 
a registrant and included in the amendment a prospectus for Piedmont under 
which it may issue debt securities in the same manner as other Duke Energy 
Registrants.

Duke Energy guaranteed debt issued by Duke Energy Carolinas of $650 

million and $762 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017, and 2016.

Money Pool

The Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, are eligible to 
receive support for their short-term borrowing needs through participation 
with Duke Energy and certain of its subsidiaries in a money pool arrangement. 
Under this arrangement, those companies with short-term funds may provide 
short-term loans to affiliates participating in this arrangement. The money 
pool is structured such that the Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress 
Energy, separately manage their cash needs and working capital requirements. 
Accordingly, there is no net settlement of receivables and payables between 
money pool participants. Duke Energy (Parent), may loan funds to its 
participating subsidiaries, but may not borrow funds through the money pool. 
Accordingly, as the money pool activity is between Duke Energy and its wholly 
owned subsidiaries, all money pool balances are eliminated within Duke 
Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Money pool receivable balances are reflected within Notes receivable 

from affiliated companies on the Subsidiary Registrants’ Consolidated Balance 
Sheets. Money pool payable balances are reflected within either Notes payable 
to affiliated companies or Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Companies on 
the Subsidiary Registrants’ Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Duke Energy Registrants’ debt and credit agreements contain various 

financial and other covenants. Duke Energy’s Master Credit Facility contains 
a covenant requiring the debt-to-total capitalization ratio not to exceed 65 
percent for each borrower, excluding Piedmont, and 70 percent for Piedmont. 
Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in 
accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements. As of December 31, 
2017, each of the Duke Energy Registrants was in compliance with all covenants 
related to their debt agreements. In addition, some credit agreements may 
allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to 
nonpayment, or acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or 

some of its subsidiaries. None of the debt or credit agreements contain material 
adverse change clauses.

Other Loans

As of December 31, 2017, and 2016, Duke Energy had loans outstanding 
of $701 million, including $38 million at Duke Energy Progress and $661 million, 
including $39 million at Duke Energy Progress, respectively, against the cash 
surrender value of life insurance policies it owns on the lives of its executives. 
The amounts outstanding were carried as a reduction of the related cash 
surrender value that is included in Other within Investments and Other Assets 
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

7.   GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS 

maximum exposure to loss under the terms of the guarantee is limited to 
47 percent of the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility, which was 
$312 million as of December 31, 2017. 

Duke Energy has guaranteed certain issuers of surety bonds, obligating 

itself to make payment upon the failure of a wholly owned and former non-
wholly owned entity to honor its obligations to a third party. Under these 
arrangements, Duke Energy has payment obligations that are triggered by a 
draw by the third party or customer due to the failure of the wholly owned 
or former non-wholly owned entity to perform according to the terms of its 
underlying contract. At December 31, 2017, Duke Energy had guaranteed 
$81 million of outstanding surety bonds, most of which have no set expiration.

Duke Energy uses bank-issued stand-by letters of credit to secure the 
performance of wholly owned and non-wholly owned entities to a third party 
or customer. Under these arrangements, Duke Energy has payment obligations 
to the issuing bank that are triggered by a draw by the third party or customer 
due to the failure of the wholly owned or non-wholly owned entity to perform 
according to the terms of its underlying contract. At December 31, 2017, 
Duke Energy had issued a total of $449 million in letters of credit, which expire 
between 2018 and 2022. The unused amount under these letters of credit was 
$66 million.

Duke Energy and Progress Energy have issued indemnifications 
for certain asset performance, legal, tax and environmental matters to 
third parties, including indemnifications made in connection with sales of 
businesses. At December 31, 2017, the estimated maximum exposure for these 
indemnifications was $89 million, most of which have no set expiration. For 
certain matters for which Progress Energy receives timely notice, indemnity 
obligations may extend beyond the notice period. Certain indemnifications 
related to discontinued operations have no limitations as to time or maximum 
potential future payments.

Duke Energy recognized $21 million and $13 million, as of December 31, 

2017, and 2016, respectively, primarily in Other within Other Noncurrent 
Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, for the guarantees discussed 
above. As current estimates change, additional losses related to guarantees and 
indemnifications to third parties, which could be material, may be recorded by 
the Duke Energy Registrants in the future. 

Duke Energy and Progress Energy have various financial and performance 

guarantees and indemnifications, which are issued in the normal course of 
business. As discussed below, these contracts include performance guarantees, 
stand-by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. 
Duke Energy and Progress Energy enter into these arrangements to facilitate 
commercial transactions with third parties by enhancing the value of the 
transaction to the third party. At December 31, 2017, Duke Energy and 
Progress Energy do not believe conditions are likely for significant performance 
under these guarantees. To the extent liabilities are incurred as a result of 
the activities covered by the guarantees, such liabilities are included on the 
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

On January 2, 2007, Duke Energy completed the spin-off of its natural gas 
businesses to shareholders. Guarantees issued by Duke Energy or its affiliates, 
or assigned to Duke Energy prior to the spin-off, remained with Duke Energy 
subsequent to the spin-off. Guarantees issued by Spectra Energy Capital, LLC 
(Spectra Capital) or its affiliates prior to the spin-off remained with Spectra 
Capital subsequent to the spin-off, except for guarantees that were later 
assigned to Duke Energy. Duke Energy has indemnified Spectra Capital against 
any losses incurred under certain of the guarantee obligations that remain 
with Spectra Capital. At December 31, 2017, the maximum potential amount 
of future payments associated with these guarantees was $205 million, the 
majority of which expires by 2028.

Duke Energy has issued performance guarantees to customers and other 

third parties that guarantee the payment and performance of other parties, 
including certain non-wholly owned entities, as well as guarantees of debt of 
certain non-consolidated entities and less than wholly owned consolidated 
entities. If such entities were to default on payments or performance, Duke 
Energy would be required under the guarantees to make payments on the 
obligations of the less than wholly owned entity. The maximum potential amount 
of future payments required under these guarantees as of December 31, 2017, 
was $326 million. Of this amount, $11 million relates to guarantees issued 
on behalf of less than wholly owned consolidated entities, with the remainder 
related to guarantees issued on behalf of third parties and unconsolidated 
affiliates of Duke Energy. Of the guarantees noted above, $281 million of the 
guarantees expire between 2019 and 2030, with the remaining performance 
guarantees having no contractual expiration.

In October 2017, ACP executed a $3.4 billion revolving credit facility with 
a stated maturity date of October 2021. Duke Energy entered into a guarantee 
agreement to support its share of the ACP revolving credit facility. Duke Energy’s

JOINT OWNERSHIP OF GENERATING AND TRANSMISSION FACILITIES

The Duke Energy Registrants maintain ownership interests in certain 

jointly owned generating and transmission facilities. The Duke Energy 
Registrants are entitled to a share of the generating capacity and output of each 
unit equal to their respective ownership interests. The Duke Energy Registrants 
pay their ownership share of additional construction costs, fuel inventory 

purchases and operating expenses. The Duke Energy Registrants share of 
revenues and operating costs of the jointly owned facilities is included within 
the corresponding line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Each 
participant in the jointly owned facilities must provide its own financing.

The following table presents the Duke Energy Registrants’ interest of jointly owned plant or facilities and amounts included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

All facilities are operated by the Duke Energy Registrants and are included in the Electric Utilities and Infrastructure segment.

9.   ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

Duke Energy records an ARO when it has a legal obligation to incur 

retirement costs associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the 
obligation can be reasonably estimated. Certain assets of the Duke Energy 
Registrants’ have an indeterminate life, such as transmission and distribution 
facilities, and thus the fair value of the retirement obligation is not reasonably 
estimable. A liability for these AROs will be recorded when a fair value is 
determinable.

The Duke Energy Registrants’ regulated operations accrue costs of 
removal for property that does not have an associated legal retirement 
obligation based on regulatory orders from state commissions. These costs 
of removal are recorded as a regulatory liability in accordance with regulatory 
accounting treatment. The Duke Energy Registrants do not accrue the estimated 
cost of removal for any nonregulated assets. See Note 4 for the estimated cost 
of removal for assets without an associated legal retirement obligation, which 
are included in Regulatory liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The following table presents the AROs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

AROs related to nuclear decommissioning are based on site-specific 

cost studies. The NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC require updated cost estimates for 
decommissioning nuclear plants every five years.

The following table summarizes information about the most recent site-
specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies. Decommissioning costs in the 
table below are stated in 2013 or 2014 dollars, depending on the year of the 
cost study, and include costs to decommission plant components not subject to 
radioactive contamination.

Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds

Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida each 

maintain NDTFs that are intended to pay for the decommissioning costs of their 
respective nuclear power plants. The NDTF investments are managed and invested 
in accordance with applicable requirements of various regulatory bodies including 
the NRC, FERC, NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
Use of the NDTF investments is restricted to nuclear decommissioning 

activities including license termination, spent fuel and site restoration. The license 
termination and spent fuel obligations relate to contaminated decommissioning 
and are recorded as AROs. The site restoration obligation relates to non-
contaminated decommissioning and is recorded to cost of removal within 
Regulatory liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The following table presents the fair value of NDTF assets legally restricted 

for purposes of settling AROs associated with nuclear decommissioning. Duke 
Energy Florida is actively decommissioning Crystal River Unit 3 and was granted 
an exemption from the NRC which allows for use of the NDTF for all aspects of 
nuclear decommissioning. The entire balance of Duke Energy Florida’s NDTF 
may be applied toward license termination, spent fuel and site restoration 
costs incurred to decommission Crystal River Unit 3. See Note 16 for additional 
information related to the fair value of the Duke Energy Registrants’ NDTFs.

Closure of Ash Impoundments

The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to state and federal regulations 

covering the closure of coal ash impoundments, including the EPA CCR rule 
and the Coal Ash Act, and other agreements. AROs recorded on the Duke 
Energy Registrants’ Consolidated Balance Sheets include the legal obligation for 
closure of coal ash basins and the disposal of related ash as a result of these 
regulations and agreements.

The Coal Ash Act, as amended, requires excavation of the Sutton, 
Riverbend and Dan River basins by August 1, 2019, and Asheville basins 
by August 1, 2022. Excavation at these sites may include a combination of 
transfer of coal ash to an engineered landfill or conversion for beneficial use. 
Basins at the H.F. Lee, Cape Fear and Weatherspoon sites are required to be 
closed through excavation no later than August 1, 2028. Excavation at these 
sites can include conversion of the basin to a lined industrial landfill, transfer 
of ash to an engineered landfill or conversion for beneficial use. The remaining 
basins are required to be closed no later than December 31, 2024, through 
conversion to a lined industrial landfill, transfer to an engineered landfill or 
conversion for beneficial use, unless certain dam improvement projects and 
alternative drinking water source projects are completed by October 15, 2018. 
Upon satisfactory completion of these projects, the closure deadline would 
be extended to December 31, 2029, and could include closure through the 
combination of a cap system and a groundwater monitoring system.

The Coal Ash Act also required the installation and operation of three 

large-scale coal ash beneficiation projects to produce reprocessed ash for use 
in the concrete industry. Duke Energy selected the Buck, H.F. Lee and Cape Fear 
plants for these projects. Closure at these sites is required to be completed no 
later than December 31, 2029.

The Coal Ash Act includes a variance procedure for compliance deadlines 

and other issues surrounding the management of CCR and CCR surface 
impoundments and prohibits cost recovery in customer rates for unlawful 
discharge of ash impoundment waters occurring after January 1, 2014. The Coal 
Ash Act leaves the decision on cost recovery determinations related to closure of 
ash impoundments to the normal ratemaking processes before utility regulatory 
commissions. Closure plans and all associated permits must be approved by 
NCDEQ before any closure work can begin.

The EPA CCR rule establishes requirements regarding landfill design, 

structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, 
groundwater monitoring and protection procedures and other operational and 
reporting procedures to ensure the safe disposal and management of CCR. 
The EPA CCR rule has certain requirements which if not met could initiate 
impoundment closure and require closure completion within five years. The 
EPA CCR rule includes extension requirements, which if met could allow the 
extension of closure completion by up to 10 years.

The ARO amount recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets is based 

upon estimated closure costs for impacted ash impoundments. The amount 

PART IIDUKE ENERGY CORPORATION • DUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS, LLC • PROGRESS ENERGY, INC. • DUKE ENERGY PROGRESS, LLC •  DUKE ENERGY FLORIDA, LLC • DUKE ENERGY OHIO, INC. • DUKE ENERGY INDIANA, LLC • PIEDMONT NATURAL GAS COMPANY, INC.Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)recorded represents the discounted cash flows for estimated closure costs 
based upon either specific closure plans or the probability weightings of the 
potential closure methods as evaluated on a site-by-site basis. Actual costs 
to be incurred will be dependent upon factors that vary from site to site. The 
most significant factors are the method and time frame of closure at the 
individual sites. Closure methods considered include removing the water from 
ash basins, consolidating material as necessary and capping the ash with a 
synthetic barrier, excavating and relocating the ash to a lined structural fill or 
lined landfill or recycling the ash for concrete or some other beneficial use. 
The ultimate method and timetable for closure will be in compliance with 
standards set by federal and state regulations and other agreements. The ARO 
amount will be adjusted as additional information is gained through the closure 
and post-closure process, including acceptance and approval of compliance 
approaches which may change management assumptions, and may result in 
a material change to the balance. See ARO Liability Rollforward section below 
for information on revisions made to the coal ash liability during 2017 and 2016.

The following tables present changes in the liability associated with AROs.

Asset retirement costs associated with the AROs for operating plants and 
retired plants are included in Net property, plant and equipment and Regulatory 
assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 4 for 
additional information on Regulatory assets related to AROs.

Cost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the normal 

ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions, which permit 
recovery of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke 
Energy’s regulated operations. See Note 4 for additional information on recovery 
of coal ash costs. 

ARO Liability Rollforward

During 2017 and 2016, the Duke Energy Registrants updated coal ash 
ARO liability estimates based on additional site-specific information for the 
related costs, methods and timing of work to be performed. Actual closure costs 
incurred could be materially different from current estimates that form the basis 
of the recorded AROs.

pretax impairment charge of $69 million on a wholly owned non-contracted 
wind project. The impairment was recorded within Impairment charges on Duke 
Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. $58 million of the impairment 
related to property, plant and equipment and $11 million of the impairment 
related to a net intangible asset; see Note 11 for additional information. The 
charge represents the excess carrying value over the estimated fair value 

of the project, which was based on a Level 3 Fair Value measurement that 
was determined from the income approach using discounted cash flows. The 
impairment was primarily due to the non-contracted wind project being located 
in a market that has experienced continued declining market pricing during 2017 
and declining long-term forecasted energy and capacity prices, driven by low 
natural gas prices, additional renewable generation placed in service and lack of 
significant load growth.

Duke Energy’s Commercial Renewables segment operates various 

renewable energy projects and sells the generated output to utilities, electric 
cooperatives, municipalities and commercial and industrial customers 
through long-term contracts. In certain situations, these long-term contracts 
and the associated renewable energy projects qualify as operating leases. 
Rental income from these leases is accounted for as Operating Revenues 
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. There are no minimum lease

(a)  Duke Energy evaluated the recoverability of goodwill during 2017 and recorded impairment charges of 

$29 million related to the Energy Management Solutions reporting unit within the Commercial Renewables 
segment. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined based on the market approach.

Duke Energy Ohio

Duke Energy Ohio’s Goodwill balance of $920 million, allocated $596 

million to Electric Utilities and Infrastructure and $324 million to Gas Utilities 
and Infrastructure, is presented net of accumulated impairment charges of $216 
million on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2017, and 2016.

Intangible Assets

Progress Energy

Progress Energy’s Goodwill is included in the Electric Utilities and 

Infrastructure operating segment and there are no accumulated impairment 
charges.

Piedmont

Piedmont’s Goodwill is included in the Gas Utilities and Infrastructure 

operating segment and there are no accumulated impairment charges. Effective 
with Piedmont’s fiscal year being changed to December 31, as discussed in 
Note 1, Piedmont changed the date of its annual impairment testing of goodwill 
from October 31 to August 31 to align with the other Duke Energy Registrants.

Impairment Testing

Duke Energy, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Ohio and Piedmont are 

required to perform an annual goodwill impairment test as of the same date 
each year and, accordingly, perform their annual impairment testing of goodwill 
as of August 31. Duke Energy, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Ohio and Piedmont 
update their test between annual tests if events or circumstances occur that 
would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its 
carrying value. Except for the Energy Management Solutions reporting unit, the 
fair value of all other reporting units for Duke Energy, Progress Energy, Duke 
Energy Ohio and Piedmont exceeded their respective carrying values at the date 
of the annual impairment analysis.

(a)  During the year ended December 31, 2017, Piedmont transferred its share of ownership interest in ACP 

and Constitution to a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy at book value.

(b)  Piedmont owns the Cardinal, Pine Needle and Hardy Storage investments.
(c)  Duke Energy includes purchase accounting adjustments related to Piedmont.

166

In October 2017, Duke Energy entered into a guarantee agreement to 

support its share of the ACP revolving credit facility. See Note 7 for additional 
information. As a result of the financing, ACP returned capital of $265 million to 
Duke Energy.

Piedmont sold its 15 percent membership interest in SouthStar on October 
3, 2016, for $160 million resulting in an after tax gain of $81 million during the 
year ended October 31, 2016. Piedmont’s Equity in Earnings in SouthStar was 
$19 million for the years ended October 31, 2016, and 2015. 

For regulatory matters and other information on the ACP, Sabal Trail and 

Constitution investments, see Notes 4 and 17.

Commercial Renewables

In 2016, Duke Energy sold its interest in three of the Catamount 

Sweetwater, LLC wind farm projects. Duke Energy has a 47 percent ownership 
interest in each of the two other Catamount Sweetwater, LLC wind farm projects 
and 50 percent interest in DS Cornerstone, LLC, which owns wind farm projects 
in the U.S.

Impairment of Equity Method Investments

Duke Energy evaluated its investment in Constitution for OTTI as of 

December 31, 2017. Our impairment assessment uses a discounted cash flow 
income approach, including consideration of the severity and duration of any 
decline in fair value of our investment in the project. Our key inputs involve 
significant management judgments and estimates, including projections of 
the project’s cash flows, selection of a discount rate and probability weighting 
of potential outcomes of legal and regulatory proceedings. Based upon these 
estimates using information known as of December 31, 2017, the fair value of 
Duke Energy’s investment in Constitution approximated its carrying value. As a 
result, Duke Energy did not recognize any impairment charge in the year ended 
December 31, 2017. However, due to the FERC’s January 2018 ruling and the 
resulting increase in uncertainty, Duke Energy is evaluating the potential to 
recognize a pretax impairment charge on its investment in Constitution during 
the first quarter of 2018 of up to the current carrying amount of the investment, 
net of salvage value and any cash and working capital returned. For additional 
information on the Constitution investment, see Note 4.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, Duke Energy recorded an OTTI 

of certain wind project investments. The $71 million pretax impairment was 
recorded within Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates on Duke 
Energy’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The other-than-temporary 
decline in value of these investments was primarily attributable to a sustained 
decline in market pricing where the wind investments are located, projected net 
losses for the projects and a reduction in the projected cash distribution to the 
class of investment owned by Duke Energy.

2017. Duke Energy retains 25 percent of the board representation and voting 
rights of NMC. The investment in NMC is accounted for under the equity method 
of accounting.

(c)  Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress participate in a JDA, which allows the collective 

dispatch of power plants between the service territories to reduce customer rates. Revenues from the 
sale of power and expenses from the purchase of power pursuant to the JDA are recorded in Operating 
Revenues and Fuel used in electric generation and purchased power, respectively, on the Consolidated 
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

(d)  Piedmont provides long-term natural gas delivery service to certain Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke 

Energy Progress natural gas-fired generation facilities. Piedmont records the sales in Regulated natural 
gas revenues, and Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress record the related purchases in 
Fuel used in electric generation and purchased power on their respective Consolidated Statements of 
Operations and Comprehensive Income. The amounts are not eliminated in accordance with rate-based 
accounting regulations. For the two months ended December 31, 2016, and for sales made subsequent 
to the acquisition for the year ended October 31, 2016, Piedmont recorded $14 million and $7 million, 
respectively, of natural gas sales with Duke Energy. For sales made prior to the acquisition for the year 
ended October 31, 2016, and for the year ended October 31, 2015, Piedmont recorded $74 million and 
$83 million, respectively of natural gas sales with Duke Energy.

In addition to the amounts presented above, the Subsidiary Registrants 
have other affiliate transactions, including rental of office space, participation 
in a money pool arrangement, other operational transactions and their 
proportionate share of certain charged expenses. See Note 6 for more 
information regarding money pool. These transactions of the Subsidiary 
Registrants were not material for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 
and 2015.

As discussed in Note 17, certain trade receivables have been sold by 
Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana to CRC, an affiliate formed by a 
subsidiary of Duke Energy. The proceeds obtained from the sales of receivables 
are largely cash but do include a subordinated note from CRC for a portion of the 
purchase price.

Refer to Note 2 for further information on the sale of the Midwest 

Generation Disposal Group.

Piedmont had accounts payable to its equity method investments of $2 million at December 31, 2017, and 2016 related to these transactions. These amounts 

are included in Accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Intercompany Income Taxes

Duke Energy and the Subsidiary Registrants file a consolidated federal income tax return and other state and jurisdictional returns. The Subsidiary Registrants 
have a tax sharing agreement with Duke Energy for the allocation of consolidated tax liabilities and benefits. Income taxes recorded represent amounts the Subsidiary 
Registrants would incur as separate C-Corporations. The following table includes the balance of intercompany income tax receivables and payables for the Subsidiary 
Registrants.

The Duke Energy Registrants use commodity and interest rate contracts 

to manage commodity price risk and interest rate risk. The primary use of 
commodity derivatives is to hedge the generation portfolio against changes in 
the prices of electricity and natural gas. Piedmont enters into natural gas supply 
contracts to provide diversification, reliability and natural gas cost benefits to its 
customers. Interest rate swaps are used to manage interest rate risk associated 
with borrowings.

All derivative instruments not identified as NPNS are recorded at fair 

value as assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash 
collateral related to derivative instruments executed under master netting 
arrangements is offset against the collateralized derivatives on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheets. The cash impacts of settled derivatives are recorded as 
operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

INTEREST RATE RISK

The Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to changes in interest rates 

as a result of their issuance or anticipated issuance of variable-rate and 
fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. Interest rate risk is managed by limiting 
variable-rate exposures to a percentage of total debt and by monitoring 
changes in interest rates. To manage risk associated with changes in interest 
rates, the Duke Energy Registrants may enter into interest rate swaps, U.S. 
Treasury lock agreements and other financial contracts. In anticipation of 

168

certain fixed-rate debt issuances, a series of forward-starting interest rate 
swaps may be executed to lock in components of current market interest rates. 
These instruments are later terminated prior to or upon the issuance of the 
corresponding debt.

Cash Flow Hedges

For a derivative designated as hedging the exposure to variable cash 
flows of a future transaction, referred to as a cash flow hedge, the effective 
portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of 
other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings once 
the future transaction impacts earnings. Amounts for interest rate contracts 
are reclassified to earnings as interest expense over the term of the related 
debt. See the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity for gains and 
losses reclassified out of AOCI for the years ended December 31, 2017, and 
2016. Duke Energy’s interest rate derivatives designated as hedges include 
interest rate swaps used to hedge existing debt within the Commercial 
Renewables business.

Undesignated contracts include contracts not designated as a hedge 

because they are accounted for under regulatory accounting and contracts that 
do not qualify for hedge accounting.

Duke Energy’s interest rate swaps for its regulated operations employ 

regulatory accounting. With regulatory accounting, the mark-to-market gains or 
losses on the swaps are deferred as regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets, 
respectively. Regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized consistent with the 

treatment of the related costs in the ratemaking process. The accrual of interest 
on the swaps is recorded as Interest Expense.

In August 2016, Duke Energy unwound $1.4 billion of forward-starting 

interest rate swaps associated with the Piedmont acquisition financing 
described in Note 6. The swaps were considered undesignated as they did not 
qualify for hedge accounting. Losses on the swaps of $190 million are included 
within Interest Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the 
year ended December 31, 2016. See Note 2 for additional information related to 
the Piedmont acquisition.

(a)  Duke Energy includes amounts related to consolidated VIEs of $660 million and $750 million at December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively. During 2016, Duke Energy entered into interest rate swaps related to solar financing 

with an outstanding notional amount of $300 million, including $81 million of four-year swaps and $219 million of 18-year swaps, at December 31, 2016. See note 6 for additional information related to the solar facilities 
financing.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

The Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to the impact of changes in 
the prices of electricity purchased and sold in bulk power markets and coal 
and natural gas purchases, including Piedmont’s natural gas supply contracts. 
Exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors including 
the term of contracts, the liquidity of markets and delivery locations. For 
the Subsidiary Registrants, bulk power electricity and coal and natural gas 

purchases flow through fuel adjustment clauses, formula based contracts or 
other cost sharing mechanisms. Differences between the costs included in rates 
and the incurred costs, including undesignated derivative contracts, are largely 
deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. Piedmont policies allow for 
the use of financial instruments to hedge commodity price risks. The strategy 
and objective of these hedging programs are to use the financial instruments to 
reduce gas cost volatility for customers.

Volumes

The tables below include volumes of outstanding commodity derivatives. Amounts disclosed represent the absolute value of notional volumes of commodity 
contracts excluding NPNS. The Duke Energy Registrants have netted contractual amounts where offsetting purchase and sale contracts exist with identical delivery 
locations and times of delivery. Where all commodity positions are perfectly offset, no quantities are shown.

The Duke Energy Registrants have elected to offset cash collateral and fair values of derivatives. For amounts to be netted, the derivative and cash collateral 

must be executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement.

15. INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES

The Duke Energy Registrants classify their investments in debt and equity 

securities as either trading or available-for-sale.

TRADING SECURITIES

Piedmont’s investments in debt and equity securities held in rabbi trusts 
associated with certain deferred compensation plans are classified as trading 
securities. The fair value of these investments was $1 million and $5 million as 
of December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE (AFS) SECURITIES

All other investments in debt and equity securities are classified as AFS.
Duke Energy’s AFS securities are primarily comprised of investments held 
in (i) the nuclear decommissioning trust funds (NDTF) at Duke Energy Carolinas, 
Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, (ii) grantor trusts at Duke Energy 
Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana related to OPEB plans 
and (iii) Bison.

Duke Energy classifies all other investments in debt and equity securities 

as long term, unless otherwise noted.

Investment Trusts

The investments within the NDTF investments and the Duke Energy 

Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana grantor trusts 
(Investment Trusts) are managed by independent investment managers with 
discretion to buy, sell and invest pursuant to the objectives set forth by the 
trust agreements. The Duke Energy Registrants have limited oversight of the 
day-to-day management of these investments. As a result, the ability to hold 

173

investments in unrealized loss positions is outside the control of the Duke 
Energy Registrants. Accordingly, all unrealized losses associated with debt and 
equity securities within the Investment Trusts are considered OTTIs and are 
recognized immediately.

Investments within the Investment Trusts generally qualify for regulatory 

accounting and accordingly realized and unrealized gains and losses are 
generally deferred as a regulatory asset or liability.

Substantially all amounts of the Duke Energy Registrants’ gross unrealized 

holding losses as of December 31, 2017, and 2016, are considered OTTIs on 
investments within Investment Trusts that have been recognized immediately as 
a regulatory asset.

Other AFS Securities

Unrealized gains and losses on all other AFS securities are included in 

other comprehensive income until realized, unless it is determined the carrying 
value of an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. If an OTTI exists, the 
unrealized loss is included in earnings based on the criteria discussed below.

The Duke Energy Registrants analyze all investment holdings each 

reporting period to determine whether a decline in fair value should be 
considered other-than-temporary. Criteria used to evaluate whether an 
impairment associated with equity securities is other-than-temporary includes, 
but is not limited to, (i) the length of time over which the market value has 
been lower than the cost basis of the investment, (ii) the percentage decline 
compared to the cost of the investment and (iii) management’s intent and 
ability to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any 
anticipated recovery in market value. If a decline in fair value is determined 
to be other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to its fair value 
through a charge to earnings.

PART IIDUKE ENERGY CORPORATION • DUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS, LLC • PROGRESS ENERGY, INC. • DUKE ENERGY PROGRESS, LLC •  DUKE ENERGY FLORIDA, LLC  • DUKE ENERGY OHIO, INC. • DUKE ENERGY INDIANA, LLC • PIEDMONT NATURAL GAS COMPANY, INC.Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)If the entity does not have an intent to sell a debt security and it is not 

more likely than not management will be required to sell the debt security before 
the recovery of its cost basis, the impairment write-down to fair value would 
be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income, except for when 
it is determined a credit loss exists. In determining whether a credit loss exists, 
management considers, among other things, (i) the length of time and the extent 
to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, (ii) changes 
in the financial condition of the issuer of the security, or in the case of an asset 
backed security, the financial condition of the underlying loan obligors, (iii) 
consideration of underlying collateral and guarantees of amounts by government 

DUKE ENERGY

entities, (iv) ability of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or 
principal payments and (v) any changes to the rating of the security by rating 
agencies. If a credit loss exists, the amount of impairment write-down to fair 
value is split between credit loss and other factors. The amount related to credit 
loss is recognized in earnings. The amount related to other factors is recognized 
in other comprehensive income. There were no material credit losses as of 
December 31, 2017, and 2016. 

Other Investments amounts are recorded in Other within Other Noncurrent 

Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

16.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is the exchange price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in 
an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 
The fair value definition focuses on an exit price versus the acquisition cost. 
Fair value measurements use market data or assumptions market participants 
would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and 
the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs may 
be readily observable, corroborated by market data, or generally unobservable. 
Valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize use 
of unobservable inputs. A midmarket pricing convention (the midpoint price 
between bid and ask prices) is permitted for use as a practical expedient.

Fair value measurements are classified in three levels based on the fair 

value hierarchy:

Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets 

or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date. An 
active market is one in which transactions for an asset or liability occur with 
sufficient frequency and volume to provide ongoing pricing information.

Level 2 – A fair value measurement utilizing inputs other than quoted 

prices included in Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for an 
asset or liability. Inputs include (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities 
in active markets, (ii) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in 
markets that are not active, and (iii) inputs other than quoted market prices that 

are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rate curves and yield 
curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit spreads. 
A Level 2 measurement cannot have more than an insignificant portion of its 
valuation based on unobservable inputs. Instruments in this category include 
non-exchange-traded derivatives, such as over-the-counter forwards, swaps 
and options; certain marketable debt securities; and financial instruments 
traded in less than active markets.

Level 3 – Any fair value measurement which includes unobservable 

inputs for more than an insignificant portion of the valuation. These inputs may 
be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management’s 
best estimate of fair value. Level 3 measurements may include longer-term 
instruments that extend into periods in which observable inputs are not 
available.

Not Categorized – Certain investments are not categorized within the 

Fair Value hierarchy. These investments are measured based on the fair value of 
the underlying investments but may not be readily redeemable at that fair value.

Fair value accounting guidance permits entities to elect to measure 

certain financial instruments that are not required to be accounted for at fair 
value, such as equity method investments or the company’s own debt, at fair 
value. The Duke Energy Registrants have not elected to record any of these 
items at fair value.

PART IIDUKE ENERGY CORPORATION • DUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS, LLC • PROGRESS ENERGY, INC. • DUKE ENERGY PROGRESS, LLC •  DUKE ENERGY FLORIDA, LLC  • DUKE ENERGY OHIO, INC. • DUKE ENERGY INDIANA, LLC • PIEDMONT NATURAL GAS COMPANY, INC.Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)Transfers between levels represent assets or liabilities that were 

previously (i) categorized at a higher level for which the inputs to the estimate 
became less observable or (ii) classified at a lower level for which the inputs 
became more observable during the period. The Duke Energy Registrant’s policy 
is to recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end 
of the period. There were no transfers between levels during the years ended 
December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. In addition, for Piedmont, there were no 
transfers between levels during the two months ended December 31, 2016, and 
the years ended October 31, 2016, and 2015.

Valuation methods of the primary fair value measurements disclosed 

below are as follows.

Investments in equity securities

The majority of investments in equity securities are valued using Level 
1 measurements. Investments in equity securities are typically valued at the 
closing price in the principal active market as of the last business day of the 
quarter. Principal active markets for equity prices include published exchanges 
such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ Stock Market. 
Foreign equity prices are translated from their trading currency using the 
currency exchange rate in effect at the close of the principal active market. 
There was no after-hours market activity that was required to be reflected in the 
reported fair value measurements.

Investments in debt securities

Most investments in debt securities are valued using Level 2 

measurements because the valuations use interest rate curves and credit 
spreads applied to the terms of the debt instrument (maturity and coupon 
interest rate) and consider the counterparty credit rating. If the market for a 
particular fixed-income security is relatively inactive or illiquid, the measurement 
is Level 3.

DUKE ENERGY

Commodity derivatives

Commodity derivatives with clearinghouses are classified as Level 1. 

Other commodity derivatives, including Piedmont’s natural gas supply contracts, 
are primarily valued using internally developed discounted cash flow models that 
incorporate forward price, adjustments for liquidity (bid-ask spread) and credit 
or non-performance risk (after reflecting credit enhancements such as collateral) 
and are discounted to present value. Pricing inputs are derived from published 
exchange transaction prices and other observable data sources. In the absence 
of an active market, the last available price may be used. If forward price 
curves are not observable for the full term of the contract and the unobservable 
period had more than an insignificant impact on the valuation, the commodity 
derivative is classified as Level 3. In isolation, increases (decreases) in natural 
gas forward prices result in favorable (unfavorable) fair value adjustments 
for gas purchase contracts; and increases (decreases) in electricity forward 
prices result in unfavorable (favorable) fair value adjustments for electricity 
sales contracts. Duke Energy regularly evaluates and validates pricing inputs 
used to estimate the fair value of natural gas commodity contracts by a market 
participant price verification procedure. This procedure provides a comparison of 
internal forward commodity curves to market participant generated curves.

Interest rate derivatives

Most over-the-counter interest rate contract derivatives are valued using 

financial models that utilize observable inputs for similar instruments and 
are classified as Level 2. Inputs include forward interest rate curves, notional 
amounts, interest rates and credit quality of the counterparties.

Other fair value considerations

See Note 11 for a discussion of the valuation of goodwill and intangible 

assets. See Note 2 related to the acquisition of Piedmont in 2016 and the 
purchase of NCEMPA’s ownership interests in certain generating assets in 2015.

The following tables provide recorded balances for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Derivative amounts in the table below for all Duke Energy Registrants exclude cash collateral, which is disclosed in Note 14. See Note 15 for additional information 
related to investments by major security type for the Duke Energy Registrants.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

A VIE is an entity that is evaluated for consolidation using more than 
a simple analysis of voting control. The analysis to determine whether an 
entity is a VIE considers contracts with an entity, credit support for an entity, 
the adequacy of the equity investment of an entity and the relationship of 
voting power to the amount of equity invested in an entity. This analysis is 
performed either upon the creation of a legal entity or upon the occurrence of 
an event requiring reevaluation, such as a significant change in an entity’s 
assets or activities. A qualitative analysis of control determines the party that 
consolidates a VIE. This assessment is based on (i) what party has the power 
to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic 
performance and (ii) what party has rights to receive benefits or is obligated to 
absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The analysis of the 
party that consolidates a VIE is a continual reassessment.

CONSOLIDATED VIEs

The obligations of these VIEs discussed in the following paragraphs 
are nonrecourse to the Duke Energy Registrants. The registrants have no 
requirement to provide liquidity to, purchase assets of or guarantee performance 
of these VIEs unless noted in the following paragraphs.

No financial support was provided to any of the consolidated VIEs during 

the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, or is expected to be 
provided in the future, that was not previously contractually required.

Receivables Financing – DERF/DEPR/DEFR

Duke Energy Receivables Finance Company, LLC (DERF), Duke Energy 
Progress Receivables, LLC (DEPR) and Duke Energy Florida Receivables, LLC 
(DEFR) are bankruptcy remote, special purpose subsidiaries of Duke Energy 
Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, respectively. DERF, 
DEPR and DEFR are wholly owned limited liability companies with separate 
legal existence from their parent companies and their assets are not generally 
available to creditors of their parent companies. On a revolving basis, DERF, 
DEPR and DEFR buy certain accounts receivable arising from the sale of 
electricity and related services from their parent companies.

DERF, DEPR and DEFR borrow amounts under credit facilities to buy these 

receivables. Borrowing availability from the credit facilities is limited to the 
amount of qualified receivables purchased. The sole source of funds to satisfy 
the related debt obligations is cash collections from the receivables. Amounts 
borrowed under the credit facilities are reflected on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheets as Long-Term Debt.

The most significant activity that impacts the economic performance of 

DERF, DEPR and DEFR are the decisions made to manage delinquent receivables. 
Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida 
consolidate DERF, DEPR and DEFR, respectively, as they make those decisions.

Receivables Financing – CRC

CRC is a bankruptcy remote, special purpose entity indirectly owned by 

Duke Energy. On a revolving basis, CRC buys certain accounts receivable arising 
from the sale of electricity, natural gas and related services from Duke Energy 
Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. CRC borrows amounts under a credit facility to 
buy the receivables from Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. Borrowing 
availability from the credit facility is limited to the amount of qualified receivables 
sold to CRC. The sole source of funds to satisfy the related debt obligation is cash 
collections from the receivables. Amounts borrowed under the credit facility are 
reflected on Duke Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as Long-Term Debt.
The proceeds Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana receive from 
the sale of receivables to CRC are typically 75 percent cash and 25 percent in 
the form of a subordinated note from CRC. The subordinated note is a retained 
interest in the receivables sold. Depending on collection experience, additional 
equity infusions to CRC may be required by Duke Energy to maintain a minimum 
equity balance of $3 million.

CRC is considered a VIE because (i) equity capitalization is insufficient to 
support its operations, (ii) power to direct the activities that most significantly 
impact the economic performance of the entity are not performed by the equity 
holder and (iii) deficiencies in net worth of CRC are funded by Duke Energy. The 
most significant activities that impact the economic performance of CRC are 
decisions made to manage delinquent receivables. Duke Energy consolidates 
CRC as it makes these decisions. Neither Duke Energy Ohio nor Duke Energy 
Indiana consolidate CRC.

Duke Energy Florida Project Finance, LLC (DEFPF) is a bankruptcy remote, wholly owned special purpose subsidiary of Duke Energy Florida. DEFPF was formed 

in 2016 for the sole purpose of issuing nuclear asset-recovery bonds to finance Duke Energy Florida’s unrecovered regulatory asset related to Crystal River Unit 3.

In June 2016, DEFPF issued $1,294 million of senior secured bonds and used the proceeds to acquire nuclear asset-recovery property from Duke Energy 

Florida. The nuclear asset-recovery property acquired includes the right to impose, bill, collect and adjust a non-bypassable nuclear asset-recovery charge from all 
Duke Energy Florida retail customers until the bonds are paid in full and all financing costs have been recovered. The nuclear asset-recovery bonds are secured by 
the nuclear asset-recovery property and cash collections from the nuclear asset-recovery charges are the sole source of funds to satisfy the debt obligation. The 
bondholders have no recourse to Duke Energy Florida. For additional information see Notes 4 and 6.

DEFPF is considered a VIE primarily because the equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations. Duke Energy Florida has the power to direct the 

significant activities of the VIE as described above and therefore Duke Energy Florida is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates DEFPF.

The following table summarizes the impact of DEFPF on Duke Energy Florida’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Certain of Duke Energy’s renewable energy facilities are VIEs due to Duke Energy issuing guarantees for debt service and operations and maintenance reserves 

in support of debt financings. Assets are restricted and cannot be pledged as collateral or sold to third parties without prior approval of debt holders. The activities 
that most significantly impact the economic performance of these renewable energy facilities were decisions associated with siting, negotiating PPAs, engineering, 
procurement and construction and decisions associated with ongoing operations and maintenance-related activities. Duke Energy consolidates the entities as it is 
responsible for all of these decisions.

(a)  Duke Energy holds a 50 percent equity interest in Duke-American Transmission Company, LLC (DATC). As of December 31, 2016, DATC was considered a VIE due to having insufficient equity to finance its own activities 
without subordinated financial support. However, DATC is no longer considered a VIE based on sufficient equity to finance its own activities, and, therefore, is no longer considered a VIE as of December 31, 2017. Duke 
Energy’s investment in DATC was $46 million at December 31, 2017.

In April 2017, Piedmont transferred its non-consolidated VIE investments to a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy. See Note 12 and the “Pipeline Investments” section below for additional detail.

The Duke Energy Registrants are not aware of any situations where the 

maximum exposure to loss significantly exceeds the carrying values shown above 
except for the power purchase agreement with OVEC, which is discussed below, 
and various guarantees, some of which are reflected in the table above as Other 
noncurrent liabilities. For more information on various guarantees, refer to Note 7.

Pipeline Investments

Duke Energy has investments in various joint ventures with pipeline 

projects currently under construction. These entities are considered VIEs due to 
having insufficient equity to finance their own activities without subordinated 
financial support. Duke Energy does not have the power to direct the activities 
that most significantly impact the economic performance, the obligation to 
absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of these VIEs and therefore does 
not consolidate these entities.

The table below presents Duke Energy’s ownership interest and 

investment balance in in these joint ventures.

Commercial Renewables

Duke Energy has investments in various renewable energy project entities. 
Some of these entities are VIEs due to Duke Energy issuing guarantees for debt 
service and operations and maintenance reserves in support of debt financings. 
Duke Energy does not consolidate these VIEs because power to direct and 
control key activities is shared jointly by Duke Energy and other owners.

CRC

Duke Energy holds a 50 percent equity interest in Pioneer. Pioneer is 

considered a VIE due to having insufficient equity to finance their own activities 
without subordinated financial support. The activities that most significantly 
impact Pioneer’s economic performance are decisions related to the 
development of new transmission facilities. The power to direct these activities 
is jointly and equally shared by Duke Energy and the other joint venture partner, 
American Electric Power, therefore Duke Energy does not consolidate Pioneer.

OVEC

Duke Energy Ohio’s 9 percent ownership interest in OVEC is considered a 
non-consolidated VIE due to having insufficient equity to finance their activities 
without subordinated financial support. As a counterparty to an inter-company 
power agreement (ICPA), Duke Energy Ohio has a contractual arrangement 
to buy power from OVEC’s power plants through June 2040 commensurate 
with its power participation ratio, which is equivalent to Duke Energy Ohio’s 
ownership interest. Costs, including fuel, operating expenses, fixed costs, debt 
amortization, and interest expense are allocated to counterparties to the ICPA 
based on their power participation ratio. The value of the ICPA is subject to 
variability due to fluctuation in power prices and changes in OVEC’s cost of 
business, including costs associated with its 2,256 MW of coal-fired generation 
capacity. Deterioration in the credit quality, or bankruptcy of one or more parties 
to the ICPA could increase the costs of OVEC. In addition, certain proposed 
environmental rulemaking could result in future increased cost allocations.

See discussion under Consolidated VIEs for additional information related 

to CRC.

Amounts included in Receivables from affiliated companies in the above 

table for Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana reflect their retained 
interest in receivables sold to CRC. These subordinated notes held by Duke 
Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana are stated at fair value. Carrying values of 
retained interests are determined by allocating carrying value of the receivables 
between assets sold and interests retained based on relative fair value. The 
allocated bases of the subordinated notes are not materially different than 
their face value because (i) the receivables generally turnover in less than 
two months, (ii) credit losses are reasonably predictable due to the broad 
customer base and lack of significant concentration and (iii) the equity in CRC 
is subordinate to all retained interests and thus would absorb losses first. The 
hypothetical effect on fair value of the retained interests assuming both a 10 
percent and a 20 percent unfavorable variation in credit losses or discount rates 
is not material due to the short turnover of receivables and historically low credit 
loss history. Interest accrues to Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana on 
the retained interests using the acceptable yield method. This method generally 
approximates the stated rate on the notes since the allocated basis and the 
face value are nearly equivalent. An impairment charge is recorded against 
the carrying value of both retained interests and purchased beneficial interest 
whenever it is determined that an OTTI has occurred.

Key assumptions used in estimating fair value are detailed in the following table.

From Operating Activities on Duke Energy Ohio’s and Duke Energy Indiana’s 
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Collection fees received in connection with servicing transferred accounts 

receivable are included in Operation, maintenance and other on Duke Energy 
Ohio’s and Duke Energy Indiana’s Consolidated Statements of Operations 
and Comprehensive Income. The loss recognized on sales of receivables is 

calculated monthly by multiplying receivables sold during the month by the 
required discount. The required discount is derived monthly utilizing a three-
year weighted average formula that considers charge-off history, late charge 
history and turnover history on the sold receivables, as well as a component for 
the time value of money. The discount rate, or component for the time value of 
money, is the prior month-end LIBOR plus a fixed rate of 1.00 percent.

18.  COMMON STOCK

Basic Earnings Per Share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income 

attributable to Duke Energy common stockholders, as adjusted for distributed 
and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities, by the weighted 
average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted 
EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to Duke Energy common 
stockholders, as adjusted for distributed and undistributed earnings allocated 
to participating securities, by the diluted weighted average number of common 
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution 
that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common shares, such 

as stock options and equity forward sale agreements, were exercised or settled. 
Duke Energy’s participating securities are restricted stock units that are entitled 
to dividends declared on Duke Energy common stock during the restricted stock 
unit’s vesting periods.

The following table presents Duke Energy’s basic and diluted EPS 

calculations and reconciles the weighted average number of common stock 
outstanding to the diluted weighted average number of common stock 
outstanding.

Equity Distribution Agreement

On February 20, 2018, Duke Energy filed a prospectus supplement and 

executed an Equity Distribution Agreement (the EDA) under which it may sell up 
to $1 billion of its common stock through an at-the-market offering program, 
including an equity forward sales component. The EDA was entered into with 
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., and J.P. Morgan 
Securities LLC (the Agents). Under the terms of the EDA, Duke Energy may issue 
and sell, through either of the Agents, shares of common stock during the period 
ending September 23, 2019.

In addition to the issuance and sales of shares by Duke Energy through the 

Agents, Duke Energy may enter into Equity Forward Agreements with affiliates 
of the Agents as Forward Purchasers. There were no transactions under the EDA 
from the time of execution of the EDA to the filing of this document.

Stock Issuance

In March 2016, Duke Energy marketed an equity offering of 10.6 million shares 

of common stock. In lieu of issuing equity at the time of the offering, Duke Energy 
entered into Equity Forwards with Barclays. The Equity Forwards required Duke 
Energy to either physically settle the transactions by issuing 10.6 million shares, or 
net settle in whole or in part through the delivery or receipt of cash or shares.

On October 5, 2016, following the close of the Piedmont acquisition, Duke 

Energy physically settled the Equity Forwards in full by delivering 10.6 million 
shares of common stock in exchange for net cash proceeds of approximately 

$723 million. The net proceeds were used to finance a portion of the Piedmont 
acquisition. As a result of the acquisition, all of Piedmont’s issued and 
outstanding stock became the issued and outstanding shares of a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Duke Energy. See Note 2 for additional information related to the 
Piedmont acquisition.

Accelerated Stock Repurchase Program

On April 6, 2015, Duke Energy entered into agreements with each of 

Goldman, Sachs & Co. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (the 
Dealers) to repurchase a total of $1.5 billion of Duke Energy common stock 
under an accelerated stock repurchase program (the ASR). Duke Energy made 
payments of $750 million to each of the Dealers and was delivered 16.6 million 
shares, with a total fair value of $1.275 billion, which represented approximately 
85 percent of the total number of shares of Duke Energy common stock expected 
to be repurchased under the ASR. The company recorded the $1.5 billion 
payment as a reduction to common stock as of April 6, 2015. In June 2015, the 
Dealers delivered 3.2 million additional shares to Duke Energy to complete the 
ASR. Approximately 19.8 million shares, in total, were delivered to Duke Energy 
and retired under the ASR at an average price of $75.75 per share. The final 
number of shares repurchased was based upon the average of the daily volume 
weighted average stock prices of Duke Energy’s common stock during the term 
of the program, less a discount.

SEVERANCE

As part of its strategic planning processes, Duke Energy implemented 

targeted cost savings initiatives during 2016 and 2015 aimed at reducing 
operations and maintenance expense. The initiatives included efforts to reduce 
costs through the standardization of processes and systems, leveraging 
technology and workforce optimization throughout the company.

During 2016, Duke Energy and Piedmont announced severance plans 
covering certain eligible employees whose employment will be involuntarily 
terminated without cause as a result of Duke Energy’s acquisition of Piedmont. 
These reductions continue to be implemented and are a part of the synergies 
expected to be realized with the acquisition. Refer to Note 2 for additional 
information on the Piedmont acquisition.

Severance benefit costs for initiatives and plans discussed above were 
accrued for a total of approximately 100 employees in 2017, 600 employees 
in 2016 and 900 employees in 2015. The following table presents the direct 
and allocated severance and related expenses recorded by the Duke Energy 
Registrants. Amounts are included within Operation, maintenance and other on 
the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Duke Energy Corporation 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2015 

Plan) provides for the grant of stock-based compensation awards to employees 
and outside directors. The 2015 Plan reserves 10 million shares of common stock 
for issuance. Duke Energy has historically issued new shares upon exercising or 
vesting of share-based awards. However, Duke Energy may use a combination of 
new share issuances and open market repurchases for share-based awards that 
are exercised or vest in the future. Duke Energy has not determined with certainty 
the amount of such new share issuances or open market repurchases.

The following table summarizes the total expense recognized by the Duke 

Energy Registrants, net of tax, for stock-based compensation.

The total grant date fair value of shares vested during the years ended 

December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $42 million, $38 million and $41 million, 
respectively. At December 31, 2017, Duke Energy had $29 million of unrecognized 
compensation cost, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average 
period of twenty-three months.

PERFORMANCE AWARDS

Stock-based performance awards generally vest after three years if 

performance targets are met.

Performance awards granted in 2017, 2016 and 2015 contain market 
conditions based on the total shareholder return (TSR) of Duke Energy stock 
relative to a predefined peer group (relative TSR). These awards are valued using 
a path-dependent model that incorporates expected relative TSR into the fair value 
determination of Duke Energy’s performance-based share awards. The model uses 
three-year historical volatilities and correlations for all companies in the predefined 
peer group, including Duke Energy, to simulate Duke Energy’s relative TSR as of the 
end of the performance period. For each simulation, Duke Energy’s relative TSR 
associated with the simulated stock price at the end of the performance period 

plus expected dividends within the period results in a value per share for the award 
portfolio. The average of these simulations is the expected portfolio value per 
share. Actual life to date results of Duke Energy’s relative TSR for each grant are 
incorporated within the model. For performance awards granted in 2017, the model 
used a risk-free interest rate of 1.5 percent, which reflects the yield on three-year 
Treasury bonds as of the grant date, and an expected volatility of 17.2 percent based 
on Duke Energy’s historical volatility over three years using daily stock prices.

In addition to TSR, performance awards granted in 2017 and 2016 contain 

a performance condition based on Duke Energy’s cumulative adjusted EPS. 
Performance awards granted in 2017 also contain a performance condition 
based on the total incident case rate, one of our key employee safety metrics. 
The actual number of shares issued will range from zero to 200 percent of target 
shares depending on the level of performance achieved.

Prior to Duke Energy’s acquisition of Piedmont, Piedmont had an incentive 

compensation plan that had a series of three-year performance and RSU 
awards for eligible officers and other participants. The Agreement and Plan of 
Merger (Merger Agreement) between Duke Energy and Piedmont provided for 
the conversion of the 2014-2016 and 2015-2017 performance awards and the 
nonvested 2016 RSU award into the right to receive $60 cash per share upon 
the close of the transaction. In December 2015, Piedmont’s board of directors 
authorized the accelerated vesting, payment and taxation of the 2014-2016 
and 2015-2017 performance awards, as well as the 2016 RSU award, at the 
election of the participant. Substantially all participants elected to accelerate 

the settlement of these awards. As a result of the settlement of these awards, 
194 thousand shares of Piedmont shares were issued to participants, net of 
shares withheld for applicable federal and state income taxes, at a closing price 
of $56.85 and a fair value of $11 million. The 2016-2018 performance award 
cycle was approved subsequent to the Merger Agreement and was converted 
into a Duke Energy RSU award as discussed above at the consummation of the 
acquisition.

Piedmont’s stock-based compensation costs and the tax benefit 
associated with stock-based compensation expense are included in the 
following table. Piedmont’s stock-based compensation costs were not material

participant portions of such plans, along with a pension plan acquired as part 
of the Piedmont transaction, into a single active plan. Benefits offered to the 
plan participants remain unchanged except that the Piedmont plan’s final 
average earnings formula was frozen as of December 31, 2017, and affected 
participants were moved into the active plan’s cash balance formula. Actuarial 
gains and losses associated with the Inactive Plan will be amortized over the 
remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants. The longer amortization 
period is expected to lower Duke Energy’s 2018 pretax qualified pension plan 
expense by approximately $33 million. 

Duke Energy uses a December 31 measurement date for its defined 

benefit retirement plan assets and obligations.

Net periodic benefit costs disclosed in the tables below represent the cost 
of the respective benefit plan for the periods presented. However, portions of the 
net periodic benefit costs disclosed in the tables below have been capitalized as 
a component of property, plant and equipment. Amounts presented in the tables 
below for the Subsidiary Registrants represent the amounts of pension and 
other post-retirement benefit cost allocated by Duke Energy for employees of 
the Subsidiary Registrants. Additionally, the Subsidiary Registrants are allocated 
their proportionate share of pension and post-retirement benefit cost for 
employees of Duke Energy’s shared services affiliate that provide support to the 
Subsidiary Registrants. These allocated amounts are included in the governance 
and shared service costs discussed in Note 13.

21.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 

DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLANS

Duke Energy and certain subsidiaries maintain, and the Subsidiary 

Registrants participate in, qualified, non-contributory defined benefit retirement 
plans. The Duke Energy plans cover most employees using a cash balance 
formula. Under a cash balance formula, a plan participant accumulates a 
retirement benefit consisting of pay credits based upon a percentage of current 
eligible earnings, age or age and years of service and interest credits. Certain 
employees are eligible for benefits that use a final average earnings formula. 
Under these final average earnings formulas, a plan participant accumulates 
a retirement benefit equal to the sum of percentages of their (i) highest three-
year, four-year, or five-year average earnings, (ii) highest three-year, four-year, 
or five-year average earnings in excess of covered compensation per year of 
participation (maximum of 35 years), (iii) highest three-year average earnings 
times years of participation in excess of 35 years. Duke Energy also maintains, 
and the Subsidiary Registrants participate in, non-qualified, non-contributory 
defined benefit retirement plans that cover certain executives. The qualified 
and non-qualified, non-contributory defined benefit plans are closed to new 
participants. 

Duke Energy approved plan amendments to restructure its qualified 

non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans, effective January 1, 2018. 
The restructuring involved (i) the spin-off of the majority of inactive participants 
from two plans into a separate inactive plan and (ii) the merger of the active

Assumptions Used for Pension Benefits Accounting

The discount rate used to determine the current year pension obligation and following year’s pension expense is based on a bond selection-settlement portfolio 

approach. This approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to provide for projected 
benefit payments of the plan. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or higher. After the bond portfolio 
is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan’s projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the market value 
of the bonds selected.

The average remaining service period of active covered employees is 13 years for Duke Energy and Duke Energy Progress, 12 years for Duke Energy Carolinas, 

Progress Energy, and Duke Energy Florida, 14 years for Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana, and nine years for Piedmont.

Assumptions Used for Pension Benefits Accounting

The discount rate used to determine the current year pension obligation and following year’s pension expense is based on a bond selection-settlement portfolio 

approach. This approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to provide for projected 
benefit payments of the plan. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or higher. After the bond portfolio 
is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan’s projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the market value 
of the bonds selected.

The average remaining service period of active covered employees is 11 years for Duke Energy and Duke Energy Progress, 14 years for Progress Energy, 15 

years for Duke Energy Florida, eight years for Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Ohio, and Duke Energy Indiana, and nine years for Piedmont. The following tables 
present the assumptions used for pension benefit accounting.

Duke Energy provides, and the Subsidiary Registrants participate in, some health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees on a contributory and 

non-contributory basis. Employees are eligible for these benefits if they have met age and service requirements at retirement, as defined in the plans. The health care 
benefits include medical, dental and prescription drug coverage and are subject to certain limitations, such as deductibles and copayments.

Duke Energy did not make any pre-funding contributions to its other post-retirement benefit plans during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015.

Assumptions Used for Other Post-Retirement Benefits Accounting

The discount rate used to determine the current year other post-retirement benefits obligation and following year’s other post-retirement benefits expense is 

based on a bond selection-settlement portfolio approach. This approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that generate 
sufficient cash flow to provide for projected benefit payments of the plan. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of non-callable corporate bonds rated 
Aa quality or higher. After the bond portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan’s projected benefit payments 
discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected. The average remaining service period of active covered employees is nine years for Duke Energy, 
eight years for Duke Energy Carolinas, seven years for Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, and Piedmont, and six years for Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress, 
and Duke Energy Indiana. 

The following tables present the assumptions used for other post-retirement benefits accounting.

Description and Allocations

Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust

Assets for both the qualified pension and other post-retirement benefits 
are maintained in the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust. Qualified pension 
and other post-retirement assets related to Piedmont were transferred into the 
Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust during 2017. Approximately 98 percent 
of the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust assets were allocated to qualified 
pension plans and approximately 2 percent were allocated to other post-
retirement plans (comprised of 401(h) accounts), as of December 31, 2017, 
and 2016. The investment objective of the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust 
is to achieve reasonable returns, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for 
the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for plan participants.

As of December 31, 2017, Duke Energy assumes pension and other 
post-retirement plan assets will generate a long-term rate of return of 6.50 
percent. The expected long-term rate of return was developed using a weighted 
average calculation of expected returns based primarily on future expected 
returns across asset classes considering the use of active asset managers, 
where applicable. The asset allocation targets were set after considering the 
investment objective and the risk profile. Equity securities are held for their 
higher expected returns. Debt securities are primarily held to hedge the qualified 
pension plan liability. Hedge funds, real estate and other global securities 
are held for diversification. Investments within asset classes are diversified 
to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual 
managers or investments. 

In 2013, Duke Energy adopted a de-risking investment strategy for the 

Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust. As the funded status of the pension 
plans increase, the targeted allocation to fixed-income assets may be 
increased to better manage Duke Energy’s pension liability and reduce funded 
status volatility. Duke Energy regularly reviews its actual asset allocation 
and periodically rebalances its investments to the targeted allocation when 
considered appropriate.

The Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust is authorized to engage in the 

lending of certain plan assets. Securities lending is an investment management 
enhancement that utilizes certain existing securities of the Duke Energy Master 
Retirement Trust to earn additional income. Securities lending involves the 
loaning of securities to approved parties. In return for the loaned securities, the 
Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust receives collateral in the form of cash and 
securities as a safeguard against possible default of any borrower on the return 
of the loan under terms that permit the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust 
to sell the securities. The Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust mitigates credit 
risk associated with securities lending arrangements by monitoring the fair 
value of the securities loaned, with additional collateral obtained or refunded as 
necessary. The fair value of securities on loan was approximately $195 million 
and $156 million at December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Cash and 
securities obtained as collateral exceeded the fair value of the securities loaned 
at December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Securities lending income 
earned by the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust was immaterial for the years 
ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Qualified pension and other post-retirement benefits for the Subsidiary 

Registrants are derived from the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust, as such, 
each are allocated their proportionate share of the assets discussed below.

Retirement Trust.

Investments in real estate limited partnerships

Investments in real estate limited partnerships are valued by the trustee 

at each valuation date (monthly). As part of the trustee’s valuation process, 
properties are externally appraised generally on an annual basis, conducted 
by reputable, independent appraisal firms, and signed by appraisers that are 
members of the Appraisal Institute, with the professional designation MAI. Fair 
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to 
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date. There are three valuation techniques that can be used to 
value investments in real estate assets: the market, income or cost approach. 
The appropriateness of each valuation technique depends on the type of 
asset or business being valued. In addition, the trustee may cause additional 
appraisals to be performed as warranted by specific asset or market conditions. 
Property valuations and the salient valuation-sensitive assumptions of each 
direct investment property are reviewed by the trustee quarterly and values 
are adjusted if there has been a significant change in circumstances related to 
the investment property since the last valuation. Value adjustments for interim 
capital expenditures are only recognized to the extent that the valuation process 
acknowledges a corresponding increase in fair value. An independent firm is 
hired to review and approve quarterly direct real estate valuations. Key inputs 
and assumptions used to determine fair value includes among others, rental 
revenue and expense amounts and related revenue and expense growth rates, 
terminal capitalization rates and discount rates. Development investments 
are valued using cost incurred to date as a primary input until substantive 
progress is achieved in terms of mitigating construction and leasing risk at 
which point a discounted cash flow approach is more heavily weighted. Key 
inputs and assumptions in addition to those noted above used to determine 
the fair value of development investments include construction costs and the 
status of construction completion and leasing. Investments in real estate limited 
partnerships are valued at net asset value of units held at year end and are not 
readily redeemable at the measurement date. Investments in real estate limited 
partnerships are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy.

Fair Value Measurements

Duke Energy classifies recurring and non-recurring fair value 

measurements based on the fair value hierarchy as discussed in Note 16.
Valuation methods of the primary fair value measurements disclosed 

below are as follows:

Investments in equity securities

Investments in equity securities are typically valued at the closing price in 

the principal active market as of the last business day of the reporting period. 
Principal active markets for equity prices include published exchanges such 
as NASDAQ and NYSE. Foreign equity prices are translated from their trading 
currency using the currency exchange rate in effect at the close of the principal 
active market. Prices have not been adjusted to reflect after-hours market 
activity. The majority of investments in equity securities are valued using 
Level 1 measurements. When the price of an institutional commingled fund is 
unpublished, it is not categorized in the fair value hierarchy, even though the 
funds are readily available at the fair value.

Investments in corporate debt securities and U.S. government securities

Most debt investments are valued based on a calculation using interest 

rate curves and credit spreads applied to the terms of the debt instrument 
(maturity and coupon interest rate) and consider the counterparty credit rating. 
Most debt valuations are Level 2 measurements. If the market for a particular 
fixed-income security is relatively inactive or illiquid, the measurement is Level 
3. U.S. Treasury debt is typically Level 2.

Investments in short-term investment funds

Investments in short-term investment funds are valued at the net asset 
value of units held at year end and are readily redeemable at the measurement 
date. Investments in short-term investment funds with published prices 
are valued as Level 1. Investments in short-term investment funds with 
unpublished prices are valued as Level 2.

calculation of basic and diluted EPS.

As of January 1, 2014, for new and rehired non-union and certain 

unionized employees (excludes Piedmont employees until 2018 plan year, 
discussed below) who are not eligible to participate in Duke Energy’s defined 
benefit plans, an additional employer contribution of 4 percent of eligible pay per 
pay period, which is subject to a three-year vesting schedule, is provided to the 
employee’s savings plan account.

Money Purchase Pension Plan

Piedmont sponsors the MPP plan, which is a defined contribution 

pension plan that allows employees to direct investments and assume risk 
of investment returns. Under the MPP plan, Piedmont annually deposits a 
percentage of each participant’s pay into an account of the MPP plan. This 
contribution equals 4 percent of the participant’s eligible compensation plus 
an additional 4 percent of eligible compensation above the Social Security 
wage base up to the IRS compensation limit. The participant is vested in MPP 

plan after three years of service. No contributions were made to the MPP plan 
during the two months ended December 31, 2016. Piedmont contributed $2 
million to the MPP plan during each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 
October 31, 2016 and 2015. Effective December 31, 2017, the MPP Plan was 
merged into the Retirement Savings Plan and the money purchase plan formula 
was discontinued. Beginning with the 2018 plan year, the former MPP Plan 
participants are eligible to receive the additional employer contribution under 
the Retirement Savings Plan, discussed above.

year from the Tax Act enactment date, during which a company acting in good 
faith may complete the accounting for the impacts of the Tax Act under ASC 
Topic 740. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax 
effects of the Tax Act in the reporting period in which the accounting under ASC 
Topic 740 is complete. To the extent that a company’s accounting for certain 
income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete, a company can determine a 
reasonable estimate for those effects and record a provisional estimate in the 
financial statements in the first reporting period in which a reasonable estimate 
can be determined.

Duke Energy recorded a provisional net tax benefit of $112 million 

related to the Tax Act in the period ending December 31, 2017. This net benefit 
primarily consists of a net benefit of $534 million due to the remeasurement 
of deferred tax accounts to reflect the corporate rate reduction impact to net 
deferred tax balances, a net expense for the establishment of a valuation 
allowance related to foreign tax credits of $406 million and a transition tax on 
previously untaxed earnings and profits on foreign subsidiaries of $10 million. 
The majority of Duke Energy’s operations are regulated and it is expected that 
the Subsidiary Registrants will ultimately pass on the savings associated with 
the amount representing the remeasurement of deferred tax balances related to 
regulated operations to customers. Duke Energy recorded a regulatory liability 
of $8,313 million, representing the revaluation of those deferred tax balances. 
The Subsidiary Registrants continue to respond to requests from regulators in 
various jurisdictions to determine the timing and magnitude of savings they will 
pass on to customers.

The net provisional charge from deferred tax remeasurement and 

assessment of valuation allowance is based on currently available information 
and interpretations which are continuing to evolve. Duke Energy continues 
to analyze additional information and guidance related to certain aspects of 
the Tax Act, such as limitations on the deductibility of interest and executive 
compensation, conformity or decoupling by state legislatures in response to the 
Tax Act, and the final determination of the net deferred tax liabilities subject 
to the remeasurement. The prospects of supplemental legislation or regulatory 
processes to address questions that arise because of the Tax Act, or evolving 
technical interpretations of the tax law, may also cause the final impact from 
the Tax Act to differ from the estimated amounts. Duke Energy continues to 
appropriately refine such amounts within the measurement period allowed by 
SAB 118, which will be completed no later than the fourth quarter of 2018.

INCOME TAXES

Tax Act

On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Act into law. 

Among other provisions, the Tax Act lowers the corporate federal income tax rate 
from 35 percent to 21 percent and eliminates bonus depreciation for regulated 
utilities, effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Act also could be amended or 
subject to technical correction, which could change the financial impacts that 
were recorded at December 31, 2017, or are expected to be recorded in future 
periods. The FERC and state utility commissions will determine the regulatory 
treatment of the impacts of the Tax Act for the Subsidiary Registrants. The Duke 
Energy Registrants’ future results of operations, financial condition and cash 
flows could be adversely impacted by the Tax Act, subsequent amendments or 
corrections or the actions of the FERC, state utility commissions or credit rating 
agencies related to the Tax Act. Duke Energy is reviewing orders to address 
the rate treatment of the Tax Act by each state utility commission in which the 
Subsidiary Registrants operate. See Note 4 for additional information. Beginning 
in January 2018, the Subsidiary Registrants will defer the estimated ongoing 
impacts of the Tax Act that are expected to be returned to customers.

As a result of the Tax Act, Duke Energy revalued its existing deferred tax 

assets and deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2017, to account for 
the estimated future impact of lower corporate tax rates on these deferred tax 
amounts. For Duke Energy’s regulated operations, where the reduction in the 
net accumulated deferred income tax (ADIT) liability is expected to be returned 
to customers in future rates, the net remeasurement has been deferred as a 
regulatory liability. The regulatory liability for income taxes includes the effect 
of the reduction of the net deferred tax liability including the tax gross-up of the 
excess accumulated deferred tax liabilities and the effect of the new tax rate on 
the previous regulatory asset for income taxes. Excess accumulated deferred 
income taxes are generally classified as either “protected” or “unprotected” 
under IRS rules. Protected excess ADIT, resulting from accumulated tax 
depreciation of public utility property, are required to utilize the average rate 
assumption method under the IRS normalization rules for determining the 
timing of the return to customers. The majority of the excess ADIT is related 
to protected amounts associated with public utility property. See Note 4 for 
additional information on the Tax Act’s impact to the regulatory asset and 
liability accounts.

On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 

No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 
118), which provides guidance on accounting for the Tax Act’s impact. SAB 118

In February 2016, Duke Energy announced it had initiated a process to 
divest the International Disposal Group and, accordingly, no longer intended to 
indefinitely reinvest post-2014 undistributed foreign earnings. This change in 
the company’s intent, combined with the extension of bonus depreciation by 
Congress in late 2015, allowed Duke Energy to more efficiently utilize foreign 
tax credits and reduce U.S. deferred tax liabilities associated with the historical 
unremitted foreign earnings by approximately $95 million during the year ended 
December 31, 2016.

Statutory Rate Reconciliation

Due to the classification of the International Disposal Group as 

discontinued operations beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, income tax 
amounts related to the International Disposal Group’s foreign earnings are 
presented within (Loss) Income From Discontinued Operations, net of tax on the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations. In December 2016, Duke Energy closed 
on the sale of the International Disposal Group in two separate transactions to 
execute the divestiture. See Note 2 for additional information on the sale.

On August 6, 2015, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. 105-130.3C, the North 

Carolina Department of Revenue announced the North Carolina corporate 
income tax rate would be reduced from a statutory rate of 5.0 percent to 4.0 
percent beginning January 1, 2016. Duke Energy and Piedmont recorded net 
reductions of approximately $95 million and $18 million to their North Carolina 
deferred tax liabilities in the third quarter of 2015. The significant majority of 

these deferred tax liability reductions were offset by recording a regulatory 
liability pending NCUC determination of the disposition of amounts related to 
Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Piedmont. The impact did not 
have a significant impact on the financial position, results of operation, or cash 
flows of Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy or Duke Energy 
Progress.

ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Management’s Annual Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Duke Energy Registrants’ management is responsible for establishing 
and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, 
as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The 
Duke Energy Registrants’ internal control system was designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the 
preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Due to inherent 
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect 
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of the 
internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk 
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that 
the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.
The Duke Energy Registrants’ management, including their Chief 

Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the 
effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 
2017, based on the framework in the Internal Control – Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that its internal 
controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2017.
Deloitte & Touche LLP, Duke Energy’s independent registered public 

accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of Duke 
Energy’s internal control over financial reporting. This attestation report is 
included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This report is not applicable to 
the Subsidiary Registrants as these companies are not accelerated or large 
accelerated filers.

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures 
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the 
Duke Energy Registrants in the reports they file or submit under the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and 
reported, within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms.

Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls 

and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information 
required to be disclosed by the Duke Energy Registrants in the reports they 
file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to 
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, 
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, 

including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Duke Energy 
Registrants have evaluated the effectiveness of their disclosure controls and 
procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the 
Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2017, and, based upon this evaluation, the 
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these 
controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance of 
compliance.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Under the supervision and with the participation of management, 

including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Duke Energy 
Registrants have evaluated changes in internal control over financial reporting 
(as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange 
Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017, and 
have concluded no change has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to 
materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.

226

PART IIWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the 

PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial 
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining 
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk 
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing 
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We 
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process 

designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal 
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately 
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary 
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the 
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management 
and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition 
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial 
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting 
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of 
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Duke Energy Corporation

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Duke 
Energy Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 
2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material 
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 
2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public 

Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated 
balance sheets as of December 31, 2017, the related consolidated statements 
of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for the 
period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes of the Company and 
our report dated February 21, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on those 
financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective 

internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the 
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the 
accompanying Management’s Annual Report On Internal Control Over 
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We 
are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be 
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal 
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

PART IIITEM 10.  DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Information regarding Duke Energy’s Executive Officers is set forth in Part I, Item 1, “Business – Executive Officers of the Registrants,” in this Annual Report 
on Form 10-K. Duke Energy will provide information that is responsive to the remainder of this Item 10 in its definitive proxy statement or in an amendment to this 
Annual Report not later than 120 days after the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report. That information is incorporated in this Item 10 by reference.

ITEM 11.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

Duke Energy will provide information that is responsive to this Item 11 in its definitive proxy statement or in an amendment to this Annual Report not later than 

120 days after the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report. That information is incorporated in this Item 11 by reference.

ITEM 12.  SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

Equity Compensation Plan Information

The following table shows information as of December 31, 2017, about securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and rights

Includes restricted stock units and performance shares (assuming the maximum payout level) granted under the Duke Energy Corporation 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan or the Duke Energy Corporation 2015 Long-Term 
Incentive Plan, as well as shares that could be payable with respect to certain compensation deferred under the Duke Energy Corporation Executive Savings Plan (Executive Savings Plan) or the Duke Energy Corporation 
Directors’ Savings Plan (Directors’ Savings Plan).
Includes shares remaining available for issuance pursuant to stock awards under the Duke Energy Corporation 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
Includes shares that could be payable with respect to certain compensation deferred under the Executive Savings Plan or and the Directors’ Savings Plan, each of which is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan described 
in more detail below. Upon the acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc., performance shares granted prior to such acquisition under the Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. Incentive Compensation Plan were 
converted into restricted stock units payable in shares of Duke Energy common stock. As of December 31, 2017, 45,173 such restricted stock units were outstanding. Following the acquisition, no further stock awards were 
permitted to be granted under the Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. Incentive Compensation Plan. These converted awards are not listed in the table above.

(5)  The number of shares remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans not approved by security holders cannot be determined because it is based on the amount of future voluntary deferrals, if any, 

under the Executive Savings Plan and the Directors’ Savings Plan.

Under the Executive Savings Plan, participants can elect to defer a portion 

of their base salary and short-term incentive compensation. Participants also 
receive a company matching contribution in excess of the contribution limits 
prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code under the Duke Energy Retirement 
Savings Plan, which is the 401(k) plan in which employees are generally 
eligible to participate. In general, payments are made following termination of 
employment or death in the form of a lump sum or installments, as selected 
by the participant. Participants may direct the deemed investment of base 
salary deferrals, short-term incentive compensation deferrals and matching 
contributions among investment options available under the Duke Energy 
Retirement Savings Plan, including the Duke Energy Common Stock Fund. 
Participants may change their investment elections on a daily basis. Deferrals of 
equity awards are credited with earnings and losses based on the performance 

of the Duke Energy Common Stock Fund. The benefits payable under the plan 
are unfunded and subject to the claims of Duke Energy’s creditors.

Under the Directors’ Savings Plan, outside directors may elect to defer 

all or a portion of their annual compensation, generally consisting of retainers. 
Deferred amounts are credited to an unfunded account, the balance of which is 
adjusted for the performance of phantom investment options, including the Duke 
Energy common stock fund, as elected by the director, and generally are paid 
when the director terminates his or her service from the Board of Directors.

Duke Energy will provide additional information that is responsive to this 

Item 12 in its definitive proxy statement or in an amendment to this Annual 
Report not later than 120 days after the end of the fiscal year covered by this 
Annual Report. That information is incorporated in this Item 12 by reference.

ITEM 13.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE

Duke Energy will provide information that is responsive to this Item 13 in its definitive proxy statement or in an amendment to this Annual Report not later than 

120 days after the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report. That information is incorporated in this Item 13 by reference.
