In fiscal 2018, Performance Food Group (PFG) 
delivered on several strategic initiatives and 
generated double-digit earnings growth and 
strong cash flow. 

Total case volume grew 3%, which included 
a solid increase in independent cases. Vistar 
had an exceptional year, particularly the back 
half of fiscal 2018. The strategic investments 
we made two years ago paid dividends in the 
fourth quarter, and we expect them to help fuel 
future growth. In Performance Foodservice, 
we are making strategic investments in our 
sales force, supply chain optimization and 
technology.

FISCAL 2018 HIGHLIGHTS INCLUDE: 
n   Total case volume growth of 3%
n  Solid net sales growth of more than 5%
n  Gross profit increase of nearly 8%
n  Net income grew 59.4% to $64.4 million
n  Adjusted EBITDA growth of more than 9%
n  Substantial return on invested capital 

Total case volume included a 6.1% increase 
in independent cases, growth in Performance 
Brands cases and broad-based growth in 
Vistar’s sales channels, partially offset by 
declines in the casual dining segment within 
PFG Customized. The increase in net sales was 
primarily attributable to sales growth in Vistar, 
particularly in the theater and retail channels; 
case growth in Performance Foodservice, 
particularly in the independent channel; and 
recent acquisitions. Gross profit growth was the 
result of case growth and an improved sales mix 
of customer channels and products, specifically 
to the independent restaurant channel. 

Performance Foodservice net sales increased 
6.2% driven by an increase in cases sold, 
including independent case growth and solid 
independent customer demand for Performance 
Brands. For fiscal 2018, independent sales as a 
percentage of total segment sales was up 100 
basis points to 45.2%. EBITDA increased 3.3% 
for the full year. Performance Foodservice’s 
earnings were lower than expected due to 
higher than anticipated operating expenses 
from labor costs associated with hiring sales, 
delivery and warehouse associates, and rising 
fuel prices. We believe this is the right time to 
strategically invest in Performance Foodservice 
to support future growth and are continuing to 
invest in customer-facing technology to further 
enhance our customer experience. 

GEORGE L. HOLM

Vistar had a robust year with net sales growth 
of 11.2% driven by strong case sales  
growth in the segment’s theater, vending 
and retail channels, and as a result of recent 
acquisitions. The box office continued to 
outpace expectations and helped drive our 
theater business. Vistar’s full-year EBITDA 
increased 13.1% driven by gross profit dollar 
growth of 18.4%. These increases were fueled 
by an increase in the number of cases sold 
and a favorable change in mix towards higher 
margin channels. 

Customized net sales decreased 4.2%. This 
decrease was primarily a result of the Georgia 
facility that was closed in the fourth quarter 
of fiscal 2017 and the challenging casual 
dining environment. PFG Customized EBITDA 
increased 16.6% driven by good operating 
expense control.

PFG’s return on invested capital significantly 
improved during fiscal 2018 driven by strong 
operating profit, a lower tax rate, and robust 
cash flow which was used to reduce debt. 
We generated $367 million in cash flow from 
operating activities, an increase of $165.3 
million versus the prior year period. We 
invested $140.1 million in capital expenditures, 
in line with capital spending versus prior year. 

I want to thank all of our associates for their 
hard work and dedication over the past year. 
I’m proud to be part of such a great company 
that has so much potential for growth. Our 
more than 15,000 associates strive every day 
to provide an unsurpassed customer-centric 
experience. 

Looking ahead, we believe we are well-
positioned across our businesses for another 
fiscal year of solid earnings growth, with 
associates who are determined to provide the 
best customer experience. And we believe we 
have the right strategies to deliver best-in-class 
service and sustainable annual growth. And, 
we are investing in people and technology, and 
most importantly, our customers, so they can 
compete and grow.

Best regards,

George L. Holm
President and CEO

SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

In addition to historical information, this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Form 10-K”) may contain “forward-looking 

statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), which are subject to the “safe harbor” created by those 
sections. All statements, other than statements of historical facts included in this Form 10-K, including statements concerning our 
plans, objectives, goals, beliefs, business strategies, future events, business conditions, our results of operations, financial position and

“expects,” “contemplates,” “will,” “anticipates,” “projects,” “plans,” “intends,” “believes,” “forecasts,” “may,” “should” and 
variations of such words or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements 
are not historical facts, and are based upon our current expectations, beliefs, estimates and projections, and various assumptions, many 
of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Our expectations, beliefs, estimates and projections are 
expressed in good faith and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them. However, there can be no assurance that management’s 
expectations, beliefs, estimates and projections will result or be achieved and actual results may vary materially from what is 
expressed in or indicated by the forward-looking statements.  

There are a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause 
our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K. Such risks, uncertainties and 
other important factors that could cause actual results to differ include, among others, the risks, uncertainties and factors set forth 
under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Form 10-K, as such risk factors may be updated from time to time in our periodic filings

Item 1. Business  

PART I  

Performance Food Group Company (“we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” or “PFG”), through its subsidiaries, markets and 

distributes more than 150,000 food and food-related products from 73 distribution centers to over 150,000 customer locations across 
the United States. Our more than 15,000 employees serve a diverse mix of customers, from independent and chain restaurants to 
schools, business and industry locations, hospitals, vending distributors, office coffee service distributors, retailers, and theaters. We 
source our products from over 5,000 suppliers and serve as an important partner to our suppliers by providing them access to our 
broad customer base. In addition to the products we offer to our customers, we provide value-added services by allowing our 
customers to benefit from our industry knowledge, scale, and expertise in the areas of product selection and procurement, menu 
development, and operational strategy. Our three reportable segments are Performance Foodservice, PFG Customized, and Vistar. 
Performance Food Group Company was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on September 23, 2002.  

References to “Blackstone” refer to certain investment funds affiliated with The Blackstone Group L.P. and references to 

“Wellspring” are to investment funds affiliated with Wellspring Capital Management LLC.  

Customers and Marketing  

We serve different types of customers through each of our three reportable segments. Our Performance Foodservice segment 

serves two types of customers—independent customers and multi-unit, or “Chain” customers. Our PFG Customized segment 
distributes to Chain customers, including family and casual dining, fast casual, and quick serve restaurants. Our Vistar segment 
distributes to vending and office coffee service distributors, retailers, theaters, and hospitality providers, among others. We believe 
that customers select a distributor based on breadth of product offerings, consistent product quality, timely and accurate delivery of 
orders, value-added services, and price. In addition, we believe that some of our larger independent and Chain customers gain 
operational efficiencies by dealing with a limited number of foodservice distributors. No single customer accounted for more than 
10% of our total net sales for fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2016.  

Independent Customers. Our Performance Foodservice segment serves our independent customers, which predominantly 

include family dining, bar and grill, pizza and Italian, and fast casual restaurants. We seek to increase the mix of our total sales to 
independent customers because they typically generate higher gross profit per case that more than offsets the generally higher supply 
chain costs that we incur in serving these customers. Independent customers use more value-added services, particularly in the areas of 
product selection and procurement, market trends, menu development, and operational strategy. In addition, independent customers 
also use more of our proprietary-branded products (“Performance Brands”), which are our highest margin products. Our Performance 
Foodservice segment supports sales to independent customers with a team of sales and marketing representatives, customer service 
representatives, and product specialists. Our sales representatives serve customers in person, by telephone, and through the internet, 
accepting and processing orders, reviewing inventory and account balances, disseminating new product information, and providing 
business assistance and advice where appropriate. These representatives typically use laptop computers to assist customers by entering 
orders, checking product availability, and pricing and developing menu-planning ideas on a real-time basis.  

Chain Customers. Both our Performance Foodservice and PFG Customized segments serve Chain customers. Chain customers 

are multi-unit restaurants with five or more locations and include fine dining, family and casual dining, fast casual, and quick serve 
restaurants, as well as hotels, healthcare facilities, and other multi-unit institutional customers. Our Performance Foodservice segment 
Chain customers, primarily regional businesses requiring short-haul routes, include various locations of Blaze Pizza, Chuy’s, Marco’s 
Pizza, Mellow Mushroom, Pollo Tropical, Shake Shack, Subway, Zaxby’s and many others. Our PFG Customized segment customers, 
primarily national businesses requiring long-haul routes, include many of the most recognizable family and casual dining restaurant 
chains including Cracker Barrel, Red Lobster, TGI Friday’s, Outback Steakhouse, O’Charley’s, Chili’s, and Ruby Tuesday. PFG 
Customized also serves fast casual chains such as Fuzzy’s Taco Shop and PDQ. Sales to Chain customers are typically lower gross 
margin but have larger deliveries than those to independent customers. Dedicated account representatives are responsible for 
managing the overall Chain customer relationship, including ensuring complete order fulfillment and customer satisfaction. Members 
of senior management assist in identifying potential new Chain customers and managing long-term account relationships.  

Vistar Customers. Our Vistar segment distributes candy, snacks, beverages, health & beauty, and other products to a number of 
distinct channels. Vending operators comprise Vistar’s largest channel. We distribute a broad selection of vending machine products 
to the operators’ depots, from which they distribute products and stock machines. We are a leading distributor of these products to 
theater chains, and Vistar’s customers include AMC, Cinemark, Galaxy Theaters, Regal Cinemas, and others. We typically deliver our 
orders directly to individual theater locations. We are a leading distributor to the office coffee service channel. Vistar also distributes 
to retailers, particularly for candy, snack, and beverage purchases in impulse buying locations. Our customers include retailers such as 
Dollar Tree, Home Depot, Staples, and others. Vistar distributes to other channels with a heavy concentration of candy, snacks, and 

3 

3

PFG_10K_2018_FINAL_96pages.indd   3

8/28/18   11:59 AM

 
beverage products, including hospitality providers, concessionaires, college book stores, hotel and airport gift shops, corrections 
facilities, and others. The distribution model also includes a “pick and pack” capability, which utilizes third-party carriers and Vistar’s 
SKU variety to sell to customers whose order sizes are too small to be served effectively by our delivery network. Vistar also operates 
Merchant’s Marts locations, which are cash-and-carry operators where customers generally pick up orders rather than having them 
delivered.  

Products and Services  

We distribute more than 150,000 food and food-related products. These products include a full line of frozen foods, such as 
meats, fully prepared appetizers and entrees, fruits, vegetables, and desserts; a full line of canned and dry foods; fresh meats; dairy 
products; beverage products; imported specialties; fresh produce; and candy, snack, and other products. We also supply a wide variety 
of non-food items including paper products such as pizza boxes, disposable napkins, plates and cups; tableware such as china and 
silverware; cookware such as pots, pans, and utensils; restaurant and kitchen equipment and supplies; and cleaning supplies. We also 
provide our customers with value-added services, as described below, in the normal course of providing full-service distribution 
services.  

Performance Brands. We offer our customers an extensive line of proprietary-branded products. We provide umbrella brands 

for our broadline distribution operation. Ridgecrest provides discerning chefs with the one of the highest levels of quality and 
consistency. West Creek provides a level of quality, consistency, and value that we believe meets or exceeds national brand offerings. 
Silver Source provides core products that are value priced while satisfying customers’ specifications. We also have a number of 
specialty brands, such as Braveheart 100% Black Angus beef, Empire’s Treasure seafood, Brilliance premium shortenings and oils, 
Heritage Ovens baked goods, Village Garden salad dressings, Guest House premium teas and cocoas, Peak Fresh Produce, Allegiance 
Premium Pork, Ascend Beverages, and others. We also have an extensive line of products for use in the pizzeria and Italian restaurant 
business under the names Piancone, Roma, Assoluti, and others. We believe that these products are a major source of competitive 
advantage. We intend to continue to enhance our product offerings based on supplier advice, customer preferences, and data analysis 
using our data warehouse. Our Performance Brands enable us to offer customers an alternative to comparable national brands across a 
wide range of products and price points, which we believe also promotes customer loyalty. Our Performance Brands products are 
manufactured for us according to specifications that have been developed by our quality assurance team. In addition, our quality 
assurance team certifies the manufacturing and processing plants where these products are packaged, enforces our quality control 
standards, and identifies supply sources that satisfy our requirements.  

National Brands. We offer our customers a broad selection of national brand products. We believe that these brands are 
attractive to Chain, independent, and other customers seeking recognized national brands in their operations. We believe that 
distributing national brands has strengthened our relationships with many national suppliers who provide us with important sales and 
marketing support. These sales complement sales of our Performance Brand products.  

Customer Brands. Some of our Chain customers, particularly those with national distribution, develop exclusive SKU 

specifications directly with suppliers and brand these SKUs. We purchase these SKUs directly from suppliers and receive them into 
our distribution centers, where they are mixed with other SKUs and delivered to the Chain customers’ locations.  

Value-Added Services. We believe that prompt and accurate delivery of orders, close contact with customers, and the ability to 

provide a full array of products and services to assist customers in their foodservice operations are of primary importance in 
foodservice distribution. Our operating companies offer multiple deliveries per week to certain customer locations and have the 
capability of delivering special orders on short notice. Through our sales and marketing representatives and support staff, we monitor 
the needs of our customers and acquaint them with new products and services. Our operating companies also provide ancillary 
services relating to foodservice distribution, such as providing customers with electronic order-taking, payment, and other internet 
based services, various reports and other data, menu planning advice, food safety training, and assistance in inventory control, as well 
as access to various third-party services designed to add value to our customers’ businesses.  

Refer to Note 19. Segment Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 – “Financial 

Statements and Supplementary Data” (“Item 8”) for the sales mix for the Company’s principal product and service categories for each 
of the last three fiscal years.

Suppliers  

We purchase from over 5,000 suppliers, none of which accounted for more than 5% of our aggregate purchases in fiscal 2018, 

fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2016. Many of our suppliers provide products to all three reportable segments, while others sell to only one 
segment. Our supplier base consists principally of large corporations that sell their national brands, our Performance Brands, and 
sometimes both. We also buy from smaller suppliers, particularly on a regional basis, and particularly those that specialize in produce 
and other perishable commodities. Many of our suppliers provide sales material and sales call support for the products that we 
purchase.  

Pricing  

Our pricing to customers is either set by contract with the customer or is priced at the time of order. If the price is by contract, 
then it is either based on a percentage markup over cost or a fixed markup per unit, and the unit may be expressed either in cases or 
pounds of product. If the pricing is set at time of order, the pricing is agreed to between our sales associate and the customer and is 
typically based on a product cost that fluctuates weekly or more frequently.  

If contracts are based on a fixed markup per unit or pound, then our customers bear the risk of cost fluctuations during the 

contract life. In the case of a fixed markup percentage, we typically bear the risk of cost deflation or the benefit of cost inflation. If 
pricing is set at the time of order, we have the current cost of goods in our inventory and typically pass cost increases or decreases to 
our customers. We generally do not lock in or otherwise hedge commodity costs or other costs of goods sold except within certain 
customer contracts where the customer bears the risk of cost fluctuation. We believe that our pricing mechanisms provide us with 
significant insulation from fluctuations in the cost of goods that we sell. Our inventory turns, on average, approximately every three-
and-a-half weeks, which further protects us from cost fluctuations.  

We seek to minimize the effect of higher diesel fuel costs both by reducing fuel usage and by taking action to offset higher fuel 
prices. We reduce usage by designing more efficient truck routes and by increasing miles per gallon through on-board computers that 
monitor and adjust idling time and maximum speeds and through other technologies. In our Performance Foodservice and Vistar 
segments, we seek to manage fuel prices through diesel fuel surcharges to our customers and through the use of costless collars. As of 
June 30, 2018, we had collars in place for approximately 13% of the gallons we expect to use over the 12 months following June 30, 
2018. These fuel collars do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment for reasons discussed in Note 9. Derivatives and Hedging 
Activities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, these collars are recorded at fair value as either an asset or 
liability on the balance sheet. Any changes in fair value are recorded in the period of the change as unrealized gains or losses on fuel 
hedging instruments. In our PFG Customized segment, we have limited exposure to fuel costs since our sales contracts largely transfer 
fuel price volatility to our customers.  

Competition  

The foodservice distribution industry is highly competitive. Certain of our competitors have greater financial and other 

resources than we do. Furthermore, there are two larger broadline distributors, Sysco and US Foods, with national footprints. In 
addition, there are numerous regional, local, and specialty distributors. These smaller distributors often align themselves with other 
smaller distributors through purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups to enhance their geographic reach, private label offerings, 
overall purchasing power, cost efficiencies and to assemble delivery networks for national or multi-regional distribution. We often do 
not have exclusive service agreements with our customers and our customers may switch to other distributors if those distributors can 
offer lower prices, differentiated products, or customer service that is perceived to be superior. We believe that most purchasing 
decisions in the foodservice business are based on the quality and price of the product and a distributor’s ability to fill orders 
completely and accurately and to provide timely deliveries.  

We believe we have a competitive advantage over regional and local broadline distributors through economies of scale in 

purchasing and procurement, which allow us to offer a broad variety of products (including our proprietary Performance Brands) at 
competitive prices to our customers. Our customers benefit from our ability to provide them with extensive geographic coverage as 
they continue to grow. We believe we also benefit from supply chain efficiency, including a growing inbound logistics backhaul 
network that uses our collective distribution network to deliver inbound products across business segments; best practices in 
warehousing, transportation, and risk management; the ability to benefit from the scale of our purchases of items not for resale, such 
as trucks, construction materials, insurance, banking relationships, healthcare, and material handling equipment; and the ability to 
optimize our networks so that customers are served from the most efficient distribution centers, which minimizes the cost of delivery. 

5

8/28/18   11:59 AM

 
We believe these efficiencies and economies of scale will provide opportunities for improvements in our operating margins when 
combined with incremental fixed-cost advantage.  

Seasonality  

Historically, the food-away-from-home and foodservice distribution industries are seasonal, with lower profit in the first and 

third quarters of each calendar year. Consequently, we typically experience lower operating profit during our first and third fiscal 
quarters, depending on the timing of acquisitions, if any.  

Information Systems  

We operate three principal systems that are customized versions of commercial products. These systems span operational 

functions including procurement, receiving, warehouse and inventory management, and order processing. All three principal systems 
feed financial systems that differ by segment. These financial systems in turn feed into a single consolidation system for financial and 
managerial reporting. In addition, we continue to invest into what we believe are “best in breed” systems to optimize our business 
performance. These systems include our sales force laptops and order entry systems, inbound logistics, and our “pay for performance” 
systems in warehouse stock replenishment and order selection, delivery loading, routing, driver performance, and sales force 
productivity.  

Trademarks and Trade Names  

We have numerous trademarks and trade names that are of significant importance, including West Creek, Silver Source, 

Braveheart 100% Black Angus, Empire’s Treasure, Brilliance, Heritage Ovens, Village Garden, Guest House, Piancone, Luigi’s, 
Ultimo, Corazo, Assoluti, Peak Fresh Produce, Roma, First Mark, Nature’s Best Dairy and Liberty. Although in the aggregate these 
trademark and trade names are material to our results of operations, we believe the loss of a trademark or trade name individually 
would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The Company does not have any material patents or licenses.  

Employees  

As of June 30, 2018, we had more than 15,000 full-time employees. As of June 30, 2018, unions represented approximately 

1,000 of our employees. We have entered into 12 collective bargaining and similar agreements with respect to our unionized 
employees. We believe that we have good relations with both union and non-union employees and we strive to be well regarded in the 
communities in which we operate. We have not had any material work stoppages or lockouts in the last five years. Our agreements 
with our union employees expire at various times through 2027. See Part I, Item 1A.—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business 
and Industry—We face risks relating to labor relations and the availability of qualified labor.”  

We have made investments to increase the size of our sales force and currently employ over 3,000 sales associates who are 

dedicated to serving our customers. Our typical sales representative calls on customers in their place of business on a periodic basis, 
usually weekly, to ascertain customer product needs, to help manage the customer’s inventory, and to discuss new products and other 
business. These sales representatives are supported by customer services representatives who work in the local market and assist 
customers in a variety of ways; business development managers, who help sales representatives prospect for new business; and 
category managers and specialists who assist sales representatives and customers with product specific knowledge. All of our 
segments have a multi-unit, or Chain, sales force who call on regional and national customers.  

Insurance  

We maintain high-deductible insurance programs covering portions of general and vehicle liability and workers’ compensation. 

The amounts in excess of the deductibles are insured by third-party insurance carriers, subject to certain limitations and exclusions. 
We also maintain self-funded group medical insurance. In addition, we maintain property, business and casualty insurance that we 
believe accords with customary foodservice industry practice. We cannot predict whether this insurance will be adequate to cover all 
potential hazards incidental to our business.  

Our operations are subject to regulation by state and local health departments, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (the 

“USDA”), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), which generally impose standards for product quality and 

Regulation

sanitation and are responsible for the administration of bioterrorism legislation affecting the foodservice industry. These government 
authorities regulate, among other things, the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, and labeling of our products. In 
2010, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (the “FSMA”) was enacted. The FSMA requires that the FDA impose comprehensive, 
prevention-based controls across the food supply chain, further regulates food products imported into the United States, and provides 
the FDA with mandatory recall authority. The FSMA requires the FDA to undertake numerous rulemakings and to issue numerous 
guidance documents, as well as reports, plans, standards, notices, and other tasks. As a result, implementation of the legislation is 
ongoing and likely to take several years. Our seafood operations are also specifically regulated by federal and state laws, including 
those administered by the National Marine Fisheries Service, established for the preservation of certain species of marine life, 
including fish and shellfish. Our processing and distribution facilities must be registered with the FDA biennially and are subject to 
periodic government agency inspections. State and/or federal authorities generally inspect our facilities at least annually. The Federal 
Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, which specifies standards for the sale, shipment, inspection, and rejection of agricultural 
products, governs our relationships with our fresh food suppliers with respect to the grading and commercial acceptance of product 
shipments. We are also subject to regulation by state authorities for the accuracy of our weighing and measuring devices. Our 
suppliers are also subject to similar regulatory requirements and oversight.  

The failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, administrative, civil, or 

criminal penalties or fines, mandatory or voluntary product recalls, warning or untitled letters, cease and desist orders against 
operations that are not in compliance, closure of facilities or operations, the loss, revocation, or modification of any existing licenses, 
permits, registrations, or approvals, or the failure to obtain additional licenses, permits, registrations, or approvals in new jurisdictions 
where we intend to do business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of 
operations. These laws and regulations may change in the future and we may incur material costs in our efforts to comply with current 
or future laws and regulations or in any required product recalls.  

Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws and other requirements, including, but not limited to, 

employment practice standards for workers set by the U.S. Department of Labor, and relating to the protection of the environment and 
the safety and health of personnel and the public. These include requirements regarding the use, storage, and disposal of solid and 
hazardous materials and petroleum products, including food processing wastes, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, and 
worker safety and health practices and procedures. In order to comply with environmental, health, and safety requirements, we may be 
required to spend money to monitor, maintain, upgrade, or replace our equipment; plan for certain contingencies; acquire or maintain 
environmental permits; file periodic reports with regulatory authorities; or investigate and clean up contamination. We operate and 
maintain vehicle fleets, and some of our distribution centers have regulated underground and aboveground storage tanks for diesel fuel 
and other petroleum products. Some jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that affect the composition and operation of our truck 
fleet, such as limits on diesel emissions and engine idling. A number of our facilities have ammonia- or freon-based refrigeration 
systems, which could cause injury or environmental damage if accidentally released, and many of our distribution centers have 
propane or battery powered forklifts. Proposed or recently enacted legal requirements, such as those requiring the phase-out of certain 
ozone-depleting substances and proposals for the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, may require us to upgrade or replace 
equipment, or may increase our transportation or other operating costs. To date, our cost of compliance with environmental, health, 
and safety requirements has not been material. The discovery of contamination for which we are responsible, any accidental release of 
regulated materials, the enactment of new laws and regulations, or changes in how existing requirements are enforced could require us 
to incur additional costs or subject us to unexpected liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial 
condition, or results of operations.  

The Surface Transportation Board and the Federal Highway Administration regulate our trucking operations. In addition, 

interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed in the U.S. Department of Transportation and other 
relevant federal and state agencies. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state 
regulations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements relating to our motor carrier 
operations. Failure to comply with the applicable motor carrier regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our 
operating permits.  

Our Segments  

Performance Foodservice. Performance Foodservice is a leading U.S. foodservice distributor with substantial scale along the 

Eastern Seaboard and in the Southeast. Performance Foodservice operates a network of 37 distribution centers, which supply a “broad 
line” of products. Each of these distribution centers is run by a business team who understands the local markets and the needs of its 
particular customers and who is empowered to make decisions on how best to serve them. This segment serves over 85,000 customer 
locations with over 125,000 food and food-related products.  

We offer our customers a broad product assortment that ranges from “center-of-the-plate” items (such as beef, pork, poultry, and 

seafood), frozen foods, refrigerated products, and dry groceries to disposables, cleaning and kitchen supplies, and related products 

7

used by our customers. In addition to the products we offer, we provide value-added services by enabling our customers to benefit 
from our industry knowledge, scale, and expertise in the areas of product selection and procurement, menu development, and 
operational strategy.  

We classify our customers under two major categories: independent and multi-unit “Chain.” Chain customers are multi-unit 

restaurants with five or more locations, which include fine dining, family and casual dining, fast casual, and quick serve restaurants, as 
well as hotels, healthcare facilities, and other multi-unit institutional customers. Independent customers utilize more of our value-
added services, particularly in the areas of product selection and procurement, market trends, menu development, and operational 
strategy. Independent customer purchases typically generate greater gross profit per case compared to sales to Chain customers.  

Our products consist of Performance Brands, as well as nationally-branded products and products bearing our customers’ 

brands. Our Performance Brands typically generate higher gross profit per case than other brands.  

PFG Customized. PFG Customized is a leading national distributor to the family and casual dining channel. We serve over 
4,500 customer locations across the United States from eight distribution centers that provide tailored supply chain solutions to our 
customers. Our network of distribution centers was developed around our customers and is strategically positioned to provide an 
efficient supply chain across both inbound and outbound logistics. PFG Customized’s product offerings are determined by each of our 
customers’ specific menu requirements. We also provide customers with value-added services, such as expertise in fresh product 
distribution, logistics management, procurement management, and information system interfaces, which enable our customers to run 
their businesses efficiently.  

We serve many of the most recognizable family and casual dining restaurant chains, including Cracker Barrel, Red Lobster, TGI 

Friday’s, Outback Steakhouse, O’Charley’s, Chili’s, and Ruby Tuesday. PFG Customized’s five largest family and casual dining 
customers have been with us for an average of more than 15 years. Cracker Barrel was PFG Customized’s first customer and grew 
from a substantial regional account served by Performance Foodservice to an account whose needs are best served by customized 
distribution. PFG Customized also serves fast casual chains such as Fuzzy’s Taco Shop and PDQ.  

Vistar. Vistar is a leading national distributor of candy, snacks, and beverages to vending and office coffee service distributors, 

retailers, theaters, and hospitality providers. The segment provides national distribution of approximately 20,000 different SKUs of 
candy, snacks, beverages, and other items to over 60,000 customer locations from our network of 25 Vistar OpCos and seven 
Merchant’s Marts locations. Merchant’s Marts are cash-and-carry operators where customers generally pick up orders rather than 
having them delivered. Vistar’s scale in these channels enhances our ability to procure a broad variety of products for our customers. 
Vistar OpCos deliver to vending and office coffee service distributors and directly to most theaters and some other locations. The 
distribution model also includes a “pick and pack” capability, which utilizes third-party carriers and Vistar’s SKU variety to sell to 
customers whose order sizes are too small to be served effectively by our delivery network. We believe these capabilities, in 
conjunction with the breadth of our inventory, are differentiating and allow us to serve many distinct customer types. Vistar has 
successfully built upon our national platform to broaden the channels we serve to include hospitality venues, concessionaires, airport 
gift shops, college book stores, corrections facilities, and impulse locations in big box retailers such as Home Depot, Dollar Tree, 
Staples, and others.

Item 1A. Risk Factors  

Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry  

Competition in our industry is intense, and we may not be able to compete successfully.  

The foodservice distribution industry is highly competitive. Certain of our competitors have greater financial and other 

resources than we do. Furthermore, there are two larger broadline distributors, Sysco and US Foods, with national footprints. In 
addition, there are numerous regional, local, and specialty distributors. These smaller distributors often align themselves with other 
smaller distributors through purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups to enhance their geographic reach, private label offerings, 
overall purchasing power, cost efficiencies and to assemble delivery networks for national or multi-regional distribution. We often do 
not have exclusive service agreements with our customers and our customers may switch to other distributors if those distributors can 
offer lower prices, differentiated products, or customer service that is perceived to be superior. We believe that most purchasing 
decisions in the foodservice business are based on the quality and price of the product and a distributor’s ability to fill orders 
completely and accurately and provide timely deliveries. We cannot assure you that our current or potential competitors will not 
provide products or services that are comparable or superior to those provided by us or adapt more quickly than we do to evolving 
trends or changing market requirements. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively against current 
and future competitors, and increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share, any 
of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.  

We operate in a low margin industry, which could increase the volatility of our results of operations.  

Similar to other resale-based industries, the foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively low profit margins. 

These low profit margins tend to increase the volatility of our reported net income since any decline in our net sales or increase in our 
costs that is small relative to our total net sales or costs may have a large impact on our net income.  

We may not realize anticipated benefits from our cost reduction and productivity improvement efforts.  

We have implemented a number of cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives that we believe are necessary to 
position our business for future success and growth. Our future success and earnings growth depend upon our ability to achieve a 
lower cost structure and to operate efficiently in the highly competitive foodservice distribution industry, particularly in an 
environment of increased competitive activity and reduced profitability. A variety of factors could cause us not to realize some of the 
expected cost savings and productivity enhancements, including, among other things, difficulties in implementation, delays in the 
anticipated timing of activities related to our cost savings initiatives, lack of sustainability in cost savings over time, and unexpected 
costs associated with operating our business. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our cost cutting and productivity 
improvement efforts we could become cost disadvantaged in the marketplace, which could adversely affect our competitiveness and 
our profitability. Furthermore, even if we realize the anticipated benefits of our cost reduction and productivity improvement efforts, 
we may experience an adverse impact on our employees, customers, suppliers, and purchasing partners that could adversely affect our 
business, financial condition, or results of operations.  

Cost inflation or deflation could affect the value of our inventory and our financial results.  

We make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell plus a percentage markup. As a 

result, volatile food costs may have a direct impact upon our profitability. Our profit levels may be negatively affected during periods 
of product cost deflation, even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant or even increase. Prolonged periods 
of product cost inflation also may have a negative impact on our profit margins and earnings to the extent such product cost increases 
are not passed on to customers because of their resistance to higher prices. Furthermore, our business model requires us to maintain an 
inventory of products, and changes in price levels between the time that we acquire inventory from our suppliers and the time we sell 
the inventory to our customers could lead to unexpected shifts in demand for our products or could require us to sell inventory at 
lesser profit or a loss. In addition, product cost inflation may negatively affect consumer discretionary spending decisions within our 
customers’ establishments, which could impact our sales. Our inability to quickly respond to inflationary and deflationary cost 
pressures could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.  

Many of our customers are not obligated to continue purchasing products from us.  

Many of our customers buy from us pursuant to individual purchase orders, and we often do not enter into long-term agreements 

with these customers. Because such customers are not obligated to continue purchasing products from us, we cannot assure you that 
the volume and/or number of our customers’ purchase orders will remain constant or increase or that we will be able to maintain our 

9 

9

PFG_10K_2018_FINAL_96pages.indd   9

8/28/18   11:59 AM

 
existing customer base. Significant decreases in the volume and/or number of our customers’ purchase orders or our inability to retain 
or grow our current customer base may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.  

Group purchasing organizations may become more active in our industry and increase their efforts to add our customers as 
members of these organizations.  

Some of our customers, particularly our larger customers, purchase their products from us through group purchasing 

organizations (“GPOs”) in an effort to lower the prices paid by these customers on their foodservice orders, and we have experienced 
some pricing pressure from these purchasers. These GPOs have also made efforts to include smaller, independent restaurants. If these 
GPOs are able to add a significant number of our customers as members, we may be forced to lower the prices we charge these 
customers in order to retain their business, which would negatively affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
Additionally, if we are unable or unwilling to lower the prices we charge for our products to a level that is satisfactory to the GPOs, 
we may lose the business of those of our customers that are members of these organizations, which could have a material adverse 
impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations  

Changes in consumer eating habits could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of 
operations.  

Changes in consumer eating habits (such as a decline in consuming food away from home, a decline in portion sizes, or a shift 
in preferences toward restaurants that are not our customers) could reduce demand for our products. Consumer eating habits could be 
affected by a number of factors, including changes in attitudes regarding diet and health or new information regarding the health 
effects of consuming certain foods. If consumer eating habits change significantly, we may be required to modify or discontinue sales 
of certain items in our product portfolio, and we may experience higher costs associated with the implementation of those changes. 
Changing consumer eating habits may reduce the frequency with which consumers purchase meals outside of the home. Additionally, 
changes in consumer eating habits may result in the enactment of laws and regulations that affect the ingredients and nutritional 
content of our food products, or laws and regulations requiring us to disclose the nutritional content of our food products. Compliance 
with these laws and regulations, as well as others regarding the ingredients and nutritional content of our food products, may be costly 
and time-consuming. Our inability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health perceptions or resulting new laws or 
regulations or to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits, which could materially and adversely affect our business, 
financial condition, or results of operations.  

Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters may interrupt our business or our customers’ businesses, which could have 
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.  

Many of our facilities and our customers’ facilities are located in areas that may be subject to extreme and occasionally 

prolonged weather conditions, including hurricanes, blizzards, and extreme heat or cold. Such extreme weather conditions may 
interrupt our operations and reduce the number of consumers who visit our customers’ facilities in such areas. Furthermore, such 
extreme weather conditions may interrupt or impede access to our customers’ facilities, all of which could have a material adverse 
effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.  

We rely on third-party suppliers, and our business may be affected by interruption of supplies or increases in product costs.  

We obtain substantially all of our foodservice and related products from third-party suppliers. We typically do not have long-

term contracts with our suppliers. Although our purchasing volume can sometimes provide an advantage when dealing with suppliers, 
suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by us in the quantities and at the prices requested. Our 
suppliers may also be affected by higher costs to source or produce and transport food products, as well as by other related expenses 
that they pass through to their customers, which could result in higher costs for the products they supply to us. Because we do not 
control the actual production of most of the products we sell, we are also subject to material supply chain interruptions, delays caused 
by interruption in production, and increases in product costs, including those resulting from product recalls or a need to find alternate 
materials or suppliers, based on conditions outside our control. These conditions include work slowdowns, work interruptions, strikes 
or other job actions by employees of suppliers, weather conditions or more prolonged climate change, crop conditions, water 
shortages, transportation interruptions, unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel costs, competitive demands, contamination with mold, 
bacteria or other contaminants, and natural disasters or other catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, the outbreak of e. coli 
or similar food borne illnesses or bioterrorism in the United States. Our inability to obtain adequate supplies of foodservice and related 
products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could mean that we could not fulfill our obligations to our customers 
and, as a result, our customers may turn to other distributors. Our inability to anticipate and react to changing food costs through our 
sourcing and purchasing practices in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of 
operations.

We face risks relating to labor relations, labor costs, and the availability of qualified labor.  

As of June 30, 2018, we had more than 15,000 employees of whom approximately 1,000 were members of local unions 

associated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters or other unions. Although our labor contract negotiations have in the past 
generally taken place with the local union representatives, we may be subject to increased efforts to engage us in multi-unit bargaining 
that could subject us to the risk of multi-location labor disputes or work stoppages that would place us at greater risk of being 
materially adversely affected by labor disputes. In addition, labor organizing activities could result in additional employees becoming 
unionized, which could result in higher labor costs. Although we have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work 
stoppages in recent history, and we believe we have satisfactory relationships with our employees, including those who are union 
members, increased unionization or a work stoppage because of our failure to renegotiate union contracts could have a material 
adverse effect on us.  

We are subject to a wide range of labor costs. Because our labor costs are, as a percentage of net sales, higher than in many 

other industries, we may be significantly harmed by labor cost increases. In addition, labor is a significant cost of many of our 
customers in the U.S. food-away-from-home industry. Any increase in their labor costs, including any increases in costs as a result of 
increases in minimum wage requirements, could reduce the profitability of our customers and reduce demand for our products.  

We rely heavily on our employees, particularly drivers, and any shortage of qualified labor could significantly affect our 

business. Our recruiting and retention efforts and efforts to increase productivity may not be successful and we could encounter a 
shortage of qualified drivers in future periods. Any such shortage would decrease our ability to serve our customers effectively. Such a 
shortage would also likely lead to higher wages for employees and a corresponding reduction in our profitability.  

Further, we continue to assess our healthcare benefit costs. Despite our efforts to control costs while still providing competitive 
healthcare benefits to our associates, significant increases in healthcare costs continue to occur, and we can provide no assurance that 
our cost containment efforts in this area will be effective. Our distributors and suppliers also may be affected by higher minimum 
wage and benefit standards, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us. If we are unable to raise our 
prices or cut other costs to cover this expense, such increases in expenses could materially reduce our operating profit.   

Fluctuations in fuel costs and other transportation costs could harm our business.  

The high cost of fuel can negatively affect consumer confidence and discretionary spending and, as a result, reduce the 

frequency and amount spent by consumers within our customers’ establishments for food away from home. The high cost of fuel and 
other transportation related costs, such as tolls, fuel taxes, and license and registration fees, can also increase the price we pay for 
products as well as the costs incurred by us to deliver products to our customers. Furthermore, both the price and supply of fuel are 
unpredictable and fluctuate based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and 
gas, actions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing 
countries and regions, regional production patterns, and environmental concerns. These factors in turn could have a material adverse 
effect on our sales, margins, operating expenses, or results of operations.  

From time to time, we may enter into arrangements to manage our exposure to fuel costs. Such arrangements, however, may not 
be effective and may result in us paying higher than market costs for a portion of our fuel. In addition, while we have been successful 
in the past in implementing fuel surcharges to offset fuel cost increases, we may not be able to do so in the future.  

In addition, compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations relating to carbon emissions and the effects 
of global warming can be expected to have a significant impact on our transportation costs and could have a material adverse effect on 
our business, financial condition, or results of operations.  

If one or more of our competitors implements a lower cost structure, they may be able to offer lower prices to customers and 
we may be unable to adjust our cost structure in order to compete profitably.  

Over the last several decades, the retail food industry has undergone significant change as companies such as Wal-Mart and 

Costco have developed a lower cost structure to provide their customer base with an everyday low-cost product offering. As a large-
scale foodservice distributor, we have similar strategies to remain competitive in the marketplace by reducing our cost structure. 
However, if one or more of our competitors in the foodservice distribution industry adopted an everyday low price strategy, we would 
potentially be pressured to lower prices to our customers and would need to achieve additional cost savings to offset these reductions. 
We may be unable to change our cost structure and pricing practices rapidly enough to successfully compete in such an environment.

If we fail to increase our sales in the highest margin portions of our business, our profitability may suffer.  

Foodservice distribution is a relatively low margin industry. The most profitable customers within the foodservice distribution 

industry are generally independent customers. In addition, our most profitable products are our Performance Brands. We typically 
provide a higher level of services to our independent customers and are able to earn a higher operating margin on sales to independent 
customers. Independent customers are also more likely to purchase our Performance Brands. Our ability to continue to penetrate this 
key customer type is critical to achieving increased operating profits. Changes in the buying practices of independent customers or 
decreases in our sales to independent customers or a decrease in the sales of our Performance Brands could have a material adverse 
effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.  

Changes in pricing practices of our suppliers could negatively affect our profitability.  

Foodservice distributors have traditionally generated a significant percentage of their gross margins from promotional 
allowances paid by their suppliers. Promotional allowances are payments from suppliers based upon the efficiencies that the 
distributor provides to its suppliers through purchasing scale and through marketing and merchandising expertise. Promotional 
allowances are a standard practice among suppliers to foodservice distributors and represent a significant source of profitability for us 
and our competitors. Any change in such practices that results in the reduction or elimination of promotional allowances could be 
disruptive to us and the industry as a whole and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of 
operations.  

Our growth strategy may not achieve the anticipated results.  

Our future success will depend on our ability to grow our business, including through increasing our independent sales, 

expanding our Performance Brands, making strategic acquisitions, and achieving improved operating efficiencies as we continue to 
expand and diversify our customer base. Our growth and innovation strategies require significant commitments of management 
resources and capital investments and may not grow our net sales at the rate we expect or at all. As a result, we may not be able to 
recover the costs incurred in developing our new projects and initiatives or to realize their intended or projected benefits, which could 
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.  

We may not be able to realize benefits of acquisitions or successfully integrate the businesses we acquire.  

From time to time, we acquire businesses that broaden our customer base, and/or increase our capabilities and geographic reach. 

If we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully or to realize anticipated economic, operational, and other benefits and 
synergies in a timely manner, our profitability could be adversely affected. Integration of an acquired business may be more difficult 
when we acquire a business in a market in which we have limited expertise or with a company culture different from ours. A 
significant expansion of our business and operations, in terms of geography or magnitude, could strain our administrative and 
operational resources. Additionally, we may be unable to retain qualified management and other key personnel employed by acquired 
companies and may fail to build a network of acquired companies in new markets. We could face significantly greater competition 
from broadline foodservice distributors in these markets than we face in our existing markets.  

We also regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire other companies. To the extent our future growth includes acquisitions, we 

cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any necessary financing for such acquisitions, consummate such potential acquisitions 
effectively, effectively and efficiently integrate any acquired entities, or successfully expand into new markets.  

Our business is subject to significant governmental regulation, and costs or claims related to these requirements could 
adversely affect our business.  

Our operations are subject to regulation by state and local health departments, the USDA, and the FDA, which generally impose 

standards for product quality and sanitation and are responsible for the administration of recent bioterrorism legislation affecting the 
foodservice industry. These government authorities regulate, among other things, the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, 
advertising, and labeling of our products. The FSMA requires that the FDA impose comprehensive, prevention-based controls across 
the food supply, further regulates food products imported into the United States, and provides the FDA with mandatory recall 
authority. Our seafood operations are also specifically regulated by federal and state laws, including those administered by the 
National Marine Fisheries Service, established for the preservation of certain species of marine life, including fish and shellfish. Our 
processing and distribution facilities must be registered with the FDA biennially and are subject to periodic government agency 
inspections. State and/or federal authorities generally inspect our facilities at least annually. The Federal Perishable Agricultural 
Commodities Act, which specifies standards for the sale, shipment, inspection, and rejection of agricultural products, governs our 
relationships with our fresh food suppliers with respect to the grading and commercial acceptance of product shipments. We are also 
subject to regulation by state authorities for the accuracy of our weighing and measuring devices. Additionally, the Surface 

12 

12

PFG_10K_2018_FINAL_96pages.indd   12

8/28/18   11:59 AM

 
Transportation Board and the Federal Highway Administration regulate our trucking operations, and interstate motor carrier 
operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the U.S. Department of Transportation and other relevant federal and state 
agencies. Our suppliers are also subject to similar regulatory requirements and oversight. The failure to comply with applicable 
regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, administrative, civil, or criminal penalties or fines; mandatory or 
voluntary product recalls; warning or untitled letters; cease and desist orders against operations that are not in compliance; closure of 
facilities or operations; the loss, revocation, or modification of any existing licenses, permits, registrations, or approvals; or the failure 
to obtain additional licenses, permits, registrations, or approvals in new jurisdictions where we intend to do business, any of which 
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. These laws and regulations may 
change in the future and we may incur material costs in our efforts to comply with current or future laws and regulations or in any 
required product recalls.  

In addition, our operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations in many areas of our business, 
such as, minimum wage, overtime, wage payment, wage and hour and employment discrimination, immigration, human health and 
safety and relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air, soil, and 
water; the management and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes; employee exposure to hazards in the workplace; and 
the investigation and remediation of contamination resulting from releases of petroleum products and other regulated materials. In the 
course of our operations, we operate, maintain, and fuel fleet vehicles; store fuel in on-site above and underground storage tanks; 
operate refrigeration systems, and use and dispose of hazardous substances and food wastes. We could incur substantial costs, 
including fines or penalties and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of any violations of 
environmental or workplace safety laws and regulations or releases of regulated materials into the environment. In addition, we could 
incur investigation, remediation, or other costs related to environmental conditions at our currently or formerly owned or operated 
properties. Additionally, concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and 
international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Increased regulation regarding greenhouse gas 
emissions, especially diesel engine emissions, could impose substantial costs upon us. These costs include an increase in the cost of 
the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital costs associated with updating or replacing our vehicles prematurely.  

If the products we distribute are alleged to cause injury or illness or fail to comply with governmental regulations, we may 
need to recall our products and may experience product liability claims.  

The products we distribute may be subject to product recalls, including voluntary recalls or withdrawals, if they are alleged to 

cause injury or illness or if they are alleged to have been mislabeled, misbranded, or adulterated or to otherwise be in violation of 
governmental regulations. We may also voluntarily recall or withdraw products that we consider not to meet our quality standards, 
whether for taste, appearance, or otherwise, in order to protect our brand and reputation. If there is any future product withdrawal that 
could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, destruction of product inventory, damage to our reputation, and lost sales 
because of the unavailability of the product for a period of time, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be 
materially adversely affected.  

We also may be subject to product liability claims if the consumption or use of our products is alleged to cause injury or illness. 
While we carry product liability insurance, our insurance may not be adequate to cover all liabilities we may incur in connection with 
product liability claims. For example, punitive damages may not be covered by insurance. In addition, we may not be able to continue 
to maintain our existing insurance, to obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all, or to secure additional coverage, 
which may result in future product liability claims being uninsured. If there is a product liability judgment against us or a settlement 
agreement related to a product liability claim, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be materially adversely 
affected.  

We rely heavily on technology in our business and any technology disruption or delay in implementing new technology could 
adversely affect our business.  

The foodservice distribution industry is transaction intensive. Our ability to control costs and to maximize profits, as well as to 

serve customers effectively, depends on the reliability of our information technology systems and related data entry processes. We rely 
on software and other technology systems, some of which are managed by third-party service providers, to manage significant aspects 
of our business, including making purchases, processing orders, managing our warehouses, loading trucks in the most efficient 
manner, and optimizing the use of storage space. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could 
disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our 
business and results of operations to suffer. In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or 
interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, power outages, systems failures, security 
breaches, cyber attacks, and viruses. While we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster 
recovery plans, these measures cannot fully insulate us from technology disruption that could result in adverse effects on our 
operations and profits.  

13

Information technology systems evolve rapidly and in order to compete effectively we are required to integrate new 

technologies in a timely and cost effective manner. If competitors implement new technologies before we do, allowing such 
competitors to provide lower priced or enhanced services of superior quality compared to those we provide, this could have an adverse 
effect on our operations and profits.  

A cyber security incident or other technology disruptions could negatively affect our business and our relationships with 
customers.  

We rely upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to 

manage or support virtually all of our business processes and activities. We also use mobile devices, social networking, and other 
online activities to connect with our employees, suppliers, business partners, and customers. These uses give rise to cybersecurity 
risks, including security breach, espionage, system disruption, theft, and inadvertent release of information. Our business involves the 
storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including 
customers’ and suppliers’ personal information, private information about employees, and financial and strategic information about us 
and our business partners. Additionally, while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and other cyber incidents, 
our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective. The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, 
release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or 
the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, 
violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability, and competitive disadvantage.  

We may be subject to or affected by product liability claims relating to products we distribute.  

We, like any other seller of food, may be exposed to product liability claims in the event that the use of products we sell causes 
injury or illness. While we believe we have sufficient primary and excess umbrella liability insurance with respect to product liability 
claims we cannot assure you that our limits are sufficient to cover all our liabilities or that we will be able to obtain replacement 
insurance on comparable terms, and any replacement insurance or our current insurance may not continue to be available at a 
reasonable cost, or, if available, may not be adequate to cover all of our liabilities. We generally seek contractual indemnification and 
insurance coverage from parties supplying products to us, but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited, as a practical 
matter, to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers. If we do not 
have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available, product liability relating to defective products could adversely affect 
our profitability.  

Adverse judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved in the normal course of our 
business could reduce our profits or limit our ability to operate our business.  

In the normal course of our business, we are involved in various legal proceedings. The outcome of these proceedings cannot be 
predicted. If any of these proceedings were to be determined adversely to us or a settlement involving a payment of a material sum of 
money were to occur, it could materially and adversely affect our profits or ability to operate our business. Additionally, we could 
become the subject of future claims by third parties, including our employees; suppliers, customers, and other counterparties; our 
investors; or regulators. Any significant adverse judgments or settlements would reduce our profits and could limit our ability to 
operate our business. Further, we may incur costs related to claims for which we have appropriate third-party indemnity, but such third 
parties fail to fulfill their contractual obligations.  

Adverse publicity about us, lack of confidence in our products or services, and other risks could negatively affect our 
reputation and affect our business.  

Maintaining a good reputation and public confidence in the safety of the products we distribute or services we provide is critical 

to our business, particularly to selling our Performance Brands products. Anything that damages our reputation, or the public’s 
confidence in our products, services, facilities, delivery fleet, operations, or employees, whether or not justified, including adverse 
publicity about the quality, safety, or integrity of our products, could quickly affect our net sales and profits. Reports, whether true or 
not, of food-borne illnesses or harmful bacteria (such as e. coli, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, hepatitis A, trichinosis, listeria, or 
salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering could also severely injure our reputation or negatively affect the public’s 
confidence in our products. We may need to recall our products if they become adulterated. If patrons of our restaurant customers 
become ill from food-borne illnesses, our customers could be forced to temporarily close restaurant locations and our sales would be 
correspondingly decreased. In addition, instances of food-borne illnesses, food tampering, or other health concerns, such as flu 
epidemics or other pandemics, even those unrelated to the use of our products, or public concern regarding the safety of our products, 
can result in negative publicity about the foodservice distribution industry and cause our sales to decrease dramatically. In addition, a 
widespread health epidemic or food-borne illness, whether or not related to the use of our products, as well as terrorist events may 
cause consumers to avoid public gathering places, like restaurants, or otherwise change their eating behaviors. Health concerns and 

14 

14

PFG_10K_2018_FINAL_96pages.indd   14

8/28/18   11:59 AM

 
negative publicity may harm our results of operations and damage the reputation of, or result in a lack of acceptance of, our products 
or the brands that we carry or the services that we provide.  

Our participation in a “multiemployer” pension plan could give rise to significant expenses and liabilities in the future.  

We participate in a “multiemployer” pension plan administered by a labor union representing some of our employees. We make 
periodic contributions to the plan to allow the plan to meet its pension benefit obligations to its participants. In the ordinary course of 
our renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements with the labor union that maintains the plan, we could decide to discontinue 
participation in the plan, and in that event we could face withdrawal liability. We could be treated as withdrawing from participation 
in the plan if the number of our employees participating in the plan is reduced to a certain degree over certain periods of time. Such 
reductions in the number of our employees participating in the plan could occur as a result of changes in our business operations, such 
as facility closures or consolidations. In the event that we withdraw from participation in the plan, applicable law could require us to 
make withdrawal liability contributions to the plan, and we would have to reflect that on our balance sheet. Our withdrawal liability 
for the multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan’s funding of vested benefits. If the multiemployer pension plan in 
which we participate has significant underfunded liabilities, such underfunding will increase the size of our potential withdrawal 
liability.  

Our earnings may be reduced by amortization charges associated with any future acquisitions.  

After we complete an acquisition, we must amortize any identifiable intangible assets associated with the acquired company 

over future periods. We also must amortize any identifiable intangible assets that we acquire directly. Our amortization of these 
amounts reduce our future earnings in the affected periods.  

We have experienced losses because of the inability to collect accounts receivable in the past and could experience increases in 
such losses in the future if our customers are unable to pay their debts to us when due.  

Certain of our customers have from time to time experienced bankruptcy, insolvency, and/or an inability to pay their debts to us 

as they come due. If our customers suffer significant financial difficulty, they may be unable to pay their debts to us timely or at all, 
which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. It is possible that customers may contest their contractual 
obligations to us under bankruptcy laws or otherwise. Significant customer bankruptcies could further adversely affect our net sales 
and increase our operating expenses by requiring larger provisions for bad debt expense. In addition, even when our contracts with 
these customers are not contested, if customers are unable to meet their obligations on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our 
ability to collect receivables. Further, we may have to negotiate significant discounts and/or extended financing terms with these 
customers in such a situation. If we are unable to collect upon our accounts receivable as they come due in an efficient and timely 
manner, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be materially adversely affected.  

Periods of difficult economic conditions and heightened uncertainty in the financial markets affect consumer confidence, 
which can adversely affect our business.  

The foodservice industry is sensitive to national and regional economic conditions. From 2008 through the beginning of 2010, 
deteriorating economic conditions and heightened uncertainty in the financial markets negatively affected consumer confidence and 
discretionary spending. This led to reductions in the frequency of dining out and the amount spent by consumers for food-away-from-
home purchases. These conditions, in turn, negatively affected our results during these periods. The development of similar economic 
conditions in the future or permanent changes in consumer dining habits as a result of such conditions would likely negatively affect 
our operating results.  

We are highly dependent upon senior management. Our failure to attract and retain key members of senior management 
could have a material adverse effect on us.  

We are highly dependent on the performance and continued efforts of our senior management team. Our future success depends 

on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified executive officers and senior management. Any inability to manage our 
operations effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Although we 
have an employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer, we cannot prevent him from terminating employment with us. Most 
of our other executives are not bound by employment agreements with us. Losing the services of any of these individuals could 
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and it may be difficult to replace them quickly with 
executives of equal experience and capabilities.

Federal, state, and local tax rules may adversely impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations.  

We are subject to federal, state, and local taxes in the United States. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, 

if the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or any other taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken on our tax returns, we 
could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. If material, payment of such additional amounts upon final 
adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact upon our business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, 
complying with new tax rules, laws, or regulations could affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations, and 
increases to federal or state statutory tax rates and other changes in tax laws, rules, or regulations may increase our effective tax rate. 
Any increase in our effective tax rate could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.  

Insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability.  

Our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historic levels, which could reduce our profitability. We maintain high-
deductible insurance programs covering portions of general and vehicle liability and workers’ compensation. The amount in excess of 
the deductibles is insured by third-party insurance carriers, subject to certain limitations and exclusions. We also maintain self-funded 
group medical insurance.  

We reserve for anticipated losses and expenses and periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect our 

experience. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts.  

Although we believe our aggregate insurance limits should be sufficient to cover reasonably expected claims costs, it is possible 
that the amount of one or more claims could exceed our aggregate coverage limits. Insurance carriers have raised premiums for many 
businesses in our industry, including ours. As a result, our insurance and claims expense could increase. Our results of operations and 
financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if (1) total claims costs significantly exceed our coverage limits, (2) we 
experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits, (3) our insurance carriers fail to pay on our insurance claims, (4) we experience a 
claim for which coverage is not provided or (5) a large number of claims may cause our cost under our deductibles to differ from 
historic averages.  

If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and 
accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.  

We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and requirements pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-

Oxley Act of 2002. We expect that these requirements will continue to cause significant legal, accounting, and financial compliance 
costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and place strain on our personnel, systems, and resources.  

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and 

internal control over financial reporting. We are also required to make a formal assessment and provide an annual management report 
on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which must be attested to by our independent registered public 
accounting firm. In order to maintain the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial 
reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, resources, including accounting-related costs and 
management oversight.  

Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our 

business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. 
Any failure to maintain or develop effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could 
harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial 
statements for prior periods. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could cause 
investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading 
price of our common stock. If we identify any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the future, or encounter problems or 
delays in the implementation of internal controls over financial reporting, we may be unable to conclude that our internal control over 
financial reporting is effective.

Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness  

Our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to 
react to changes in the economy or in our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt, and 
prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness.  

We are highly leveraged. As of June 30, 2018, we had $1,184.2 million of indebtedness. In addition, we had $854.2 million of 
availability under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated February 1, 2016, as amended by the First Amendment 
to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated August 3, 2017 (the “ABL Facility” and the “Credit Agreement”) after 
giving effect to $121.3 million of outstanding letters of credit and $12.1 million of lenders’ reserves.  

Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences for us, including:  
• 

requiring us to utilize a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, 
reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development activity, and other 
general corporate purposes;  
increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry, or competitive developments;  
exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates to the extent our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;  
making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with 
the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an 
event of default under the agreements governing our indebtedness;  
restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;  
limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt 
service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes; and  
limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a 
competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to 
take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.  

•

A substantial portion of our indebtedness is floating rate debt. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on such 

indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash 
available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. We may elect to enter into interest rate swaps to reduce our 
exposure to floating interest rates as described below under “—We may utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce our 
exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates on our variable rate indebtedness and we will be exposed to risks 
related to counterparty creditworthiness or non-performance of these instruments.” However, we may not maintain interest rate 
swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.  

Servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many 
factors, some of which are not within our control.  

Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to 

generate cash in the future. To a certain extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and 
other factors that are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and to meet our other 
commitments, we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, sell material assets or operations, or raise additional 
debt or equity capital. We may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, 
and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements. In addition, any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at a 
higher interest rate, and the terms of our existing or future debt arrangements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives. 
Our failure to make the required interest and principal payments on our indebtedness would result in an event of default under the 
agreement governing such indebtedness, which may result in the acceleration of some or all of our outstanding indebtedness.  

Despite our high indebtedness level, we and our subsidiaries will still be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt, 
which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.  

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the agreements 

governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number 
of significant qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in 
compliance with these restrictions could be substantial.

The agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our 
business.  

The agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified 

types of transactions. These covenants limit the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:  

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

incur, assume, or permit to exist additional indebtedness or guarantees;  
incur liens;  
make investments and loans;  
pay dividends, make payments, or redeem or repurchase capital stock;  
engage in mergers, liquidations, dissolutions, asset sales, and other dispositions (including sale leaseback transactions);  
amend or otherwise alter terms of certain indebtedness;  
enter into agreements limiting subsidiary distributions or containing negative pledge clauses;  
engage in certain transactions with affiliates;  
alter the business that we conduct;  
change our fiscal year; or  
engage in any activities other than permitted activities.  

As a result of these restrictions, we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt 

or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness 
we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these 
covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.  

A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of these agreements, including as a result of cross 

default provisions, and, in the case of our ABL Facility, permit the lenders to cease making loans to us.  

We may utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates on our 
variable rate indebtedness and we will be exposed to risks related to counterparty credit worthiness or non-performance of 
these instruments.  

We may enter into pay-fixed interest rate swaps to limit our exposure to changes in variable interest rates. Such instruments may 

result in economic losses should interest rates decline to a point lower than our fixed rate commitments. We will be exposed to credit-
related losses, which could affect the results of operations in the event of fluctuations in the fair value of the interest rate swaps due to 
a change in the credit worthiness or non-performance by the counterparties to the interest rate swaps.  

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock  

Our stock price may change significantly, and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price 
you paid or at all, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result.  

The trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile. The stock market routinely experiences periods of 

large or extreme volatility. This volatility often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular 
companies. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid due to a number of factors such as those listed in 
“—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry” above and the following:  

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

results of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;  
results of operations that vary from those of our competitors;  
changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates and investment 
recommendations by securities analysts and investors;  
declines in the market prices of stocks generally, particularly those of foodservice distribution companies;  
strategic actions by us or our competitors;  
announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new products, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, 
joint ventures, other strategic relationships, or capital commitments;

changes in general economic or market conditions or trends in our industry or markets;  
changes in business or regulatory conditions;  
future sales of our common stock or other securities;  
investor perceptions or the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment 
alternatives;  
the public’s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the 
SEC;  
announcements relating to litigation;  
guidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance, or our failure to meet this guidance;  
the development and sustainability of an active trading market for our stock;  
changes in accounting principles;  
occurrences of extreme or inclement weather; and  
other events or factors, including those resulting from natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism, or responses to these 
events.  

These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our 

actual operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock 
is low.  

In the past, following periods of market volatility, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation. If we were 

involved in securities litigation, it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of executive management from 
our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation.  

Because we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive 
any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.  

We intend to retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion, and debt repayment and have no current plans to 

pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. The declaration, amount, and payment of any future dividends on shares of common 
stock will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors may take into account general and economic 
conditions, our financial condition, and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital 
requirements, contractual, legal, tax, and regulatory restrictions, implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or 
by our subsidiaries to us, and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends 
is limited by covenants of our existing and outstanding indebtedness and may be limited by covenants of any future indebtedness we 
or our subsidiaries incur. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our 
common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.  

If securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock or our sector, our 
stock price and trading volume could decline.  

The trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish 

about us or our business. We do not control these analysts. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrades 
our stock or our industry, or the stock of any of our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the 
price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of the Company or fails to publish reports on us 
regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.  

Future sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our existing stockholders in the public market could cause the market 
price for our common stock to decline.  

The sale of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the 

prevailing market price of shares of our common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it 
more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.  

As of August 6, 2018, we had a total of 104,735,605 shares of common stock outstanding, which includes 1,460,287 shares of 

restricted stock.

Shares held by our directors, officers, employees, and other stockholders are eligible for resale, subject in certain cases to 

volume, manner of sale, and other limitations under Rule 144 of the Securities Act (“Rule 144”).  

As restrictions on resale end, the market price of our shares of common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these 

shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise 
additional funds through future offerings of our shares of common stock or other securities.  

A total of 2,511,977 shares are issuable upon the exercise of options, 115,506 shares are issuable pursuant to restricted stock 

units, and 2,028,343 shares are reserved for future issuance under the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan. These shares will become eligible 
for sale in the public market once those shares are issued, subject to various vesting agreements, lock-up agreements, and Rule 144, as 
applicable.  

In the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our 
common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding 
shares of our common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in 
additional dilution to you.  

Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control.  

Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have an anti-

takeover effect and may delay, defer, or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt, or other change of control 
transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the 
market price for the shares held by our stockholders.  

These provisions provide for, among other things:  
• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

a classified Board of Directors with staggered three-year terms;  
the ability of our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock;  
advance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at 
our annual meetings;  
certain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings;  
the removal of directors only for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the shares of 
common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; and  
that certain provisions may be amended only by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the shares of common stock 
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.  

These anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third-party’s offer may be 

considered beneficial by many of our stockholders. As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium 
for their shares.  

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole 
and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit 
our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or 
stockholders.  

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the 

State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for any (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of our Company, 
(ii) action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or stockholder of our Company to the Company 
or the Company’s stockholders, (iii) action asserting a claim against the Company or any director, officer or stockholder of the 
Company arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our amended and restated certificate of 
incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, or (iv) action asserting a claim against the Company or any director, officer or 
stockholder of the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any 
interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our amended and 
restated certificate of incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim 
in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such 
lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended 
and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or

Item 2. Properties  

As of June 30, 2018, we operated 70 distribution centers across our three reportable segments and three distribution centers 

through our Corporate and All Other segment. Of our 73 facilities, we owned 34 facilities and leased the remaining 39 facilities. Our 
Performance Foodservice segment operated 37 distribution centers and had an average square footage of approximately 200,000 
square feet per facility. Our PFG Customized segment operated eight distribution centers and had an average square footage of over 
200,000 square feet per facility. Our Vistar segment operated 25 distribution centers and had an average square footage of over 
100,000 square feet per facility. Our Corporate and All Other segment operated three distribution centers and had an average square 
footage of approximately 50,000 square feet per facility.

Our Performance Foodservice customers are generally located no more than 200 miles from one of our distribution facilities. Of 
the 37 Performance Foodservice distribution centers, eight have meat cutting operations that provide custom-cut meat products to our 
customers and one has a seafood processing operation that provides custom-cut and packed seafood to its customers and our other 
distribution centers. Our PFG Customized customers are generally located no more than 450 miles from one of our distribution 
facilities. In addition to the 25 distribution centers operated by Vistar, Vistar has seven cash-and-carry Merchant’s Mart facilities. 
Customer orders are typically assembled in our distribution facilities and then sorted, placed on pallets, and loaded onto trucks and 
trailers in delivery sequence. Deliveries are generally made in large tractor-trailers that we usually lease. We use integrated computer 
systems to design and track efficient route sequences for the delivery of our products.  

Our distribution center leases are on average 17.0 years in duration. Rent on our leases is typically set at a fixed annual rate, paid 

monthly.

Our properties also include a combined headquarters facility for our corporate offices and the Performance Foodservice segment 

that is located in Richmond, Virginia; a headquarters facility for PFG Customized that is located in Tennessee; and a headquarters 
facility for Vistar that is located in Colorado.  

Item 3. Legal Proceedings  

We are a party to various claims, lawsuits and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course and conduct of our 

business. We have insurance policies covering certain potential losses where such coverage is cost effective. For matters not 
specifically discussed below, although the outcomes of the claims, lawsuits and other legal proceedings to which we are a party are 
not determinable at this time, in our opinion, any additional liability that we might incur upon the resolution of the claims and lawsuits 
beyond the amounts already accrued is not expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our 
consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  

U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Lawsuit. In March 2009, the Baltimore Equal Employment Opportunity 

Commission (“EEOC”) Field Office served us with company-wide (excluding, however, our Vistar and Roma Foodservice 
operations) subpoenas relating to alleged violations of the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (“Title VII”), seeking 
certain information from January 1, 2004 to a specified date in the first fiscal quarter of 2009. In August 2009, the EEOC moved to 
enforce the subpoenas in federal court in Maryland, and we opposed the motion. In February 2010, the court ruled that the subpoena 
related to the Equal Pay Act investigation was enforceable company-wide but on a narrower scope of data than the original subpoena 
sought (the court ruled that the subpoena was applicable to the transportation, logistics, and warehouse functions of our broadline 
distribution centers only and not to our PFG Customized distribution centers). We cooperated with the EEOC on the production of 
information. In September 2011, the EEOC notified us that the EEOC was terminating the investigation into alleged violations of the 
Equal Pay Act. In determinations issued in September 2012 by the EEOC with respect to the charges on which the EEOC had based 
its company-wide investigation, the EEOC concluded that we engaged in a pattern of denying hiring and promotion to a class of 
female applicants and employees into certain positions within the transportation, logistics, and warehouse functions within our 
broadline division in violation of Title VII. In June 2013, the EEOC filed suit in federal court in Baltimore against us. The litigation 
concerns two issues: (1) whether we unlawfully engaged in an ongoing pattern and practice of failing to hire female applicants into 
operations positions; and (2) whether we unlawfully failed to promote one of the three individuals who filed charges with the EEOC 
because of her gender. The EEOC seeks the following relief in the lawsuit: (1) to permanently enjoin us from denying employment to 
female applicants because of their sex and denying promotions to female employees because of their sex; (2) a court order mandating 
that we institute and carry out policies, procedures, practices and programs which provide equal employment opportunities for 
females; (3) back pay with prejudgment interest and compensatory damages for a former female employee and an alleged class of 
aggrieved female applicants; (4) punitive damages; and (5) costs. The court bifurcated the litigation into two phases. In the first phase, 
the jury will decide whether we engaged in a gender-based pattern and practice of discrimination and the individual claims of one 
former employee. If the EEOC prevails on all counts in the first phase, no monetary relief would be awarded, except possibly for the 
single individual’s claims, which would be immaterial. The remaining individual claims would then be tried in the second phase. At 
this stage in the proceedings, the Company cannot estimate either the number of individual trials that could occur in the second phase 
of the litigation or the value of those claims. For these reasons, we are unable to estimate any potential loss or range of loss in the 
event of an adverse finding in the first and second phases of the litigation.  

In May 2018, the EEOC filed motions for sanctions against us alleging that we failed to preserve certain paper employment 

applications and e-mails during 2004 – 2009.  In the sanctions motions, the EEOC seeks a range of remedies, including but not limited 
to, a default judgment against us, or alternatively, an order barring us from filing for summary judgment on the EEOC’s pattern and 
practice claims. We are opposing the motions and will continue to vigorously defend ourselves.

At the close of business on August 6, 2018, there were approximately 158 holders of record of our shares of common stock. 

This stockholder figure does not include a substantially greater number of holders whose shares are held of record by banks, brokers 
and other financial institutions.  

Dividends  

We have no current plans to pay dividends on our common stock. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited by 

covenants in the agreements governing our existing indebtedness and may be further limited by the agreements governing other 
indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur in the future. See Part II, Item 7. — "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Financing Activities.” Any decision to declare and pay 
dividends in the future will be made at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our 
results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions, and other factors that our Board of Directors may 
deem relevant. Because we are a holding company, and have no direct operations, we will only be able to pay dividends from funds 
we receive from our subsidiaries.

(1) During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company purchased 1,716 shares of the Company’s common stock in transactions

unrelated to a publicly announced plan or program. These transactions consisted of acquisitions of shares of the Company’s
common stock via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with
the delivery of shares of the Company’s common stock under our incentive plans.

Stock Performance Graph 

The performance graph below compares the cumulative total shareholder return of the Company’s common stock since October 

1, 2015, the date the Company’s common stock began trading on the NYSE, with the cumulative total return for the same period of 
the S&P 500 index and the S&P 400 Midcap Index. The graph assumes the investment of $100 in our common stock and each of the 
indices as of the market close on October 1, 2015 and the reinvestment of dividends.  Performance data for the Company, the S&P 500 
index and the S&P 400 Midcap Index is provided as of the last trading day of each of our last three fiscal years. The stock price 
performance graph is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.

Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with Part II, 
Item 6. — “Selected Financial Data” and the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8. In 
addition to historical consolidated financial information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, 
estimates, and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described in Item 1A. Risk 
Factors of this Form 10-K. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. You should 
carefully read “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this Form 10-K.  

Our Company  

We market and distribute over 150,000 food and food-related products to customers across the United States from 

approximately 73 distribution facilities to over 150,000 customer locations in the “food-away-from-home” industry. We offer our 
customers a broad assortment of products including our proprietary-branded products, nationally-branded products, and products 
bearing our customers’ brands. Our product assortment ranges from “center-of-the-plate” items (such as beef, pork, poultry, and 
seafood), frozen foods, and groceries to candy, snacks, and beverages. We also sell disposables, cleaning and kitchen supplies, and 
related products used by our customers. In addition to the products we offer to our customers, we provide value-added services by 
allowing our customers to benefit from our industry knowledge, scale, and expertise in the areas of product selection and procurement, 
menu development, and operational strategy.  

We have three reportable segments: Performance Foodservice, PFG Customized, and Vistar. Our Performance Foodservice 

segment distributes a broad line of national brands, customer brands, and our proprietary-branded food and food-related products, or 
“Performance Brands.” Performance Foodservice sells to independent, or “Street,” and multi-unit, or “Chain,” restaurants and other 
institutions such as schools, healthcare facilities, and business and industry locations. Our PFG Customized segment has provided 
longstanding service to some of the most recognizable family and casual dining restaurant chains and recently expanded service into 
fast casual and quick service restaurant chains. Our Vistar segment specializes in distributing candy, snacks, beverages, and other 
items nationally to the vending, office coffee service, theater, retail, hospitality, and other channels. We believe that there are 
substantial synergies across our segments. Cross-segment synergies include procurement, operational best practices such as the use of 
new productivity technologies, and supply chain and network optimization, as well as shared corporate functions such as accounting, 
treasury, tax, legal, information systems, and human resources.  

The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to June 30th. This resulted in a 52-week year for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 

2017 and a 53-week year for fiscal 2016. References to “fiscal 2018” are to the 52-week period ended June 30, 2018, references to 
“fiscal 2017” are to the 52-week period ended July 1, 2017, and references to “fiscal 2016” are to the 53-week period ended July 2, 
2016.  

Recent Trends and Initiatives  

Our case volume has grown in each quarter over the comparable prior fiscal year quarter, starting in the second quarter of fiscal 
2010 and continuing through the most recent quarter. We believe that we gained industry share during fiscal 2018 given that we have 
grown our sales more rapidly than the industry growth rate forecasted by Technomic, a research and consulting firm serving the food 
and food related industry. Our Net income increased 106.3% and Adjusted EBITDA increased 9.2% from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018, 
primarily driven by case growth and improved gross margin. Case volume grew 3.0% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. Gross 
profit dollars rose 7.9% in fiscal 2018 versus the prior year, which was faster than case growth, primarily as a result of shifting our 
channel mix toward higher gross margin customers and shifting our product mix toward sales of Performance Brands. Our operating 
expenses in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 rose 6.6% as a result of increases in variable operational and selling expenses 
associated with the increase in case volume, as well as an increase in fuel expense and investments in selling, warehouse, and delivery 
personnel.  

Key Factors Affecting Our Business  

We believe that our performance is principally affected by the following key factors:  
• 

Changing demographic and macroeconomic trends. The share of consumer spending captured by the food-away-from-
home industry increased steadily for several decades and paused during the recession that began in 2008. Following the 
recession, the share has again increased as a result of increasing employment, rising disposable income, increases in the 
number of restaurants, and favorable demographic trends, such as smaller household sizes, an increasing number of dual 
income households, and an aging population base that spends more per capita at foodservice establishments. The

• 

• 

foodservice distribution industry is also sensitive to national and regional economic conditions, such as changes in 
consumer spending, changes in consumer confidence, and changes in the prices of certain goods.  
Food distribution market structure. The food distribution market consists of a wide spectrum of companies ranging from 
businesses selling a single category of product (e.g., produce) to large national and regional broadline distributors with 
many distribution centers and thousands of products across all categories. We believe our scale enables us to invest in our 
Performance Brands, to benefit from economies of scale in purchasing and procurement, and to drive supply chain 
efficiencies that enhance our customers’ satisfaction and profitability. We believe that the relative growth of larger 
foodservice distributors will continue to outpace that of smaller, independent players in our industry.  
Our ability to successfully execute our segment strategies and implement our initiatives. Our performance will continue to 
depend on our ability to successfully execute our segment strategies and to implement our current and future initiatives. 
The key strategies include focusing on independent sales and Performance Brands, pursuing new customers for all three of 
our reportable segments, expansion of geographies, utilizing our infrastructure to gain further operating and purchasing 
efficiencies, and making strategic acquisitions.  

How We Assess the Performance of Our Business  

In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key measures 

used by our management are discussed below. The percentages on the results presented below are calculated based on rounded 
numbers.  

Net Sales  

Net sales is equal to gross sales minus sales returns; sales incentives that we offer to our customers, such as rebates and 

discounts that are offsets to gross sales; and certain other adjustments. Our net sales are driven by changes in case volumes, product 
inflation that is reflected in the pricing of our products, and mix of products sold.  

Gross Profit  

Gross profit is equal to our net sales minus our cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold primarily includes inventory costs (net of 
supplier consideration) and inbound freight. Cost of goods sold generally changes as we incur higher or lower costs from our suppliers 
and as our customer and product mix changes.  

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA  

Management measures operating performance based on our EBITDA, defined as net income before interest expense, interest 

income, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 
(“U.S. GAAP”) and is not a measure of operating income, operating performance, or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. 
GAAP and is subject to important limitations. Our definition of EBITDA may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by 
other companies.  

We believe that the presentation of EBITDA enhances an investor’s understanding of our performance. We use this measure to 
evaluate the performance of our segments and for business planning purposes. We present EBITDA in order to provide supplemental 
information that we consider relevant for the readers of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, and 
such information is not meant to replace or supersede U.S. GAAP measures.  

In addition, our management uses Adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income before interest expense, interest income, income 
and franchise taxes, and depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude certain items that we do not consider part of our 
core operating results. Such adjustments include certain unusual, non-cash, non-recurring, cost reduction, and other adjustment items 
permitted in calculating covenant compliance under our credit agreement and indenture (other than certain pro forma adjustments 
permitted under our credit agreement and indenture relating to the Adjusted EBITDA contribution of acquired entities or businesses 
prior to the acquisition date). Under our credit agreement and indenture, our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring 
certain additional indebtedness, making certain investments, and making restricted payments is tied to ratios based on Adjusted 
EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement and indenture). Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as similarly 
titled measures used by other companies.  

28

PFG_10K_2018_FINAL_96pages.indd   28

8/28/18   11:59 AM

 

Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under U.S. GAAP and is subject to important limitations. We believe that the presentation of 

Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties, 
including our lenders under the ABL Facility and holders of our Notes (as defined below under “—Liquidity and Capital Resources”), 
in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies in industries similar to ours. In addition, targets based on Adjusted 
EBITDA are among the measures we use to evaluate our management’s performance for purposes of determining their compensation 
under our incentive plans.  

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or 

as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. For example, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:  

•  

•  

•  

• 

exclude certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us;  
do not reflect any cash capital expenditure requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to 
be replaced in the future;  
do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and  
do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements, necessary to service our debt.  

In calculating Adjusted EBITDA, we add back certain non-cash, non-recurring, and other items as permitted or required by our 

credit agreement and indenture. Adjusted EBITDA among other things:  

•  

•  

• 

does not include non-cash stock-based employee compensation expense and certain other non-cash charges;  
does not include cash and non-cash restructuring, severance, and relocation costs incurred to realize future cost savings 
and enhance our operations; and  
does not reflect management fees paid to Blackstone and Wellspring.  

We have included the calculations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented.

Consolidated Results of Operations  

Fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to fiscal year ended July 1, 2017  
Net Sales  

Net sales growth is primarily a function of case growth, pricing (which is primarily based on product inflation/deflation), and a 

changing mix of customers, channels, and product categories sold. Net sales increased $858.1 million, or 5.1%, in fiscal 2018 
compared to fiscal 2017. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to sales growth in Vistar, particularly in the theater and 
retail channels, case growth in Performance Foodservice, particularly in the independent channel, and recent acquisitions. Case 
volume increased 3.0% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017.

Gross Profit  

Gross profit increased $168.0 million, or 7.9%, for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
was 13.0% for fiscal 2018 compared to 12.7% for fiscal 2017.  The increase in gross profit was the result of growth in cases sold and a 
higher gross profit per case, which in turn was the result of selling an improved mix of channels and products. Within Performance 
Foodservice, case growth to independent customers positively affected gross profit per case. Independent customers typically receive 
more services from us, cost more to serve, and pay a higher gross profit per case than other customers. Also, in fiscal 2018, 
Performance Foodservice grew our Performance Brand sales, which have higher gross profit per case compared to the other brands we 
sell. See “—Segment Results—Performance Foodservice” below for additional discussion.  

Operating Expenses  

Operating expenses increased $125.5 million, or 6.6%, for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The increase in operating 

expenses was primarily driven by the increase in acquired case volume and the resulting impact on variable operational and selling 
expenses, as well as investments in selling, warehouse, and delivery personnel. Operating expenses also increased in fiscal 2018 as a 
result of increases in fuel expense of $15.7 million and stock-based compensation expense of $4.3 million, partially offset by a $2.6 
million decrease in advisory fees and a $1.8 million decrease in professional fees.  

Depreciation and amortization of intangible assets increased from $126.1 million in fiscal 2017 to $130.1 million in fiscal 2018, 

an increase of 3.2%. Depreciation of fixed assets increased as a result of capital outlays to support our growth, as well as recent 
acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by decreases in amortization since certain intangibles are now fully amortized 
compared to the prior year.  

Net Income  

Net income increased by $102.4 million, or 106.3%, to $198.7 million for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The increase in 

net income was attributable to the $42.5 million increase in operating profit and the $66.5 million decrease in income tax expense, 
partially offset by a $5.5 million increase in interest expense, and a $1.1 million decrease in other income.  

The increase in operating profit was a result of the increase in gross profit discussed above, partially offset by the increase in 

operating expenses. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of an increase in the average interest rate and higher 
average borrowings during fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017.  The $1.1 million decrease in other income related primarily to 
derivative activity.   

The decrease in income tax expense was primarily a result of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”).  Our effective 

tax rate in fiscal 2018 was -2.6% compared to 39.0% in fiscal 2017. The Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017.  Among its 
numerous changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate rate from 35% to 21%, which 
resulted in a blended U.S. federal statutory rate of approximately 28% for fiscal 2018 for the Company.  As a result of the Act, the 
Company revalued its net deferred tax liability, resulting in a decrease to the net deferred tax liability of $38.5 million with a 
corresponding net benefit to income tax expense for fiscal 2018.  As a result of a blended statutory rate for fiscal 2018, the Company 
recognized a tax benefit of $11.9 million for the rate differential related to temporary differences.  Additionally, in fiscal 2018, 
performance vesting criteria for certain stock-based compensation awards was met resulting in an excess tax benefit of $15.4 million.   

Fiscal year ended July 1, 2017 compared to fiscal year ended July 2, 2016  
Net Sales  

Net sales growth is primarily a function of case growth, pricing (which is primarily based on product inflation/deflation), and a 

changing mix of customers, channels, and product categories sold. Net sales increased $657.0 million, or 4.1%, in fiscal 2017 
compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to case growth in Performance Foodservice, particularly 
in the independent channel, and sales growth in Vistar, particularly in the retail, theater, vending, and hospitality channels partially 
offset by the 53rd week in fiscal year 2016. Net sales for the extra week in fiscal 2016 were approximately $312.4 million. Net sales 
growth was driven by case volume growth of 4.1% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week in 
fiscal 2016, case volume increased 6.2% compared to the prior year.

Gross Profit  

Gross profit increased $114.8 million, or 5.7%, for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in gross profit was the 

result of growth in cases sold and a higher gross profit per case, which in turn was the result of selling an improved mix of channels 
and products, partially offset by the 53rd week in fiscal 2016. Within Performance Foodservice, case growth to independent customers 
positively affected gross profit per case. Independent customers typically receive more services from us, cost more to serve, and pay a 
higher gross profit per case than other customers. Also, in fiscal 2017, Performance Foodservice grew our Performance Brand sales, 
which have higher gross profit per case compared to the other brands we sell. See “—Segment Results—Performance Foodservice” 
below for additional discussion. The Company estimates that the gross profit for the extra week in fiscal 2016 was approximately 
$40.1 million.  

Operating Expenses  

Operating expenses increased $106.0 million, or 5.9%, for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in operating 

expenses was primarily driven by the increase in case volume and the resulting impact on variable operational and selling expenses, as 
well as investments associated with expansion of geographies served in the dollar store channel, transition of business within PFG 
Customized and the opening of our automated retail facility within the Vistar segment. Additionally, operating expenses increased for 
fiscal year 2017 as a result of an $8.4 million increase in insurance expense primarily related to workers compensation and 
professional and legal fees including settlements of $3.0 million. The increase was partially offset by the 53rd week in fiscal 2016. 
Operating expenses for the extra week is fiscal 2016 were approximately $35.3 million.  

Depreciation and amortization of intangible assets increased from $118.6 million in fiscal 2016 to $126.1 million in fiscal 2017, 
an increase of 6.3%. Depreciation of fixed assets increased as a result of larger capital outlays to support our growth, as well as recent 
acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by decreases in amortization since certain intangibles are now fully amortized 
compared to the prior year.  

Net Income  

Net income increased by $28.0 million, or 41.0%, to $96.3 million for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in net 

income was attributable to an $8.8 million increase in operating profit, a $29.0 million decrease in interest expense, and a $5.4 million 
decrease in other expense, partially offset by a $15.2 million increase in income tax expense. The Company estimates that net income 
for the extra week in fiscal 2016 was approximately $2.1 million.  

The increase in operating profit was a result of the increase in gross profit discussed above, partially offset by the increase in 

operating expenses. The decrease in interest expense was primarily the result of lower average interest rates during fiscal 2017 
compared to fiscal 2016 and a $9.4 million loss on extinguishment of debt and $5.5 million of accelerated amortization of original 
issuance discount and deferred financing costs in fiscal 2016.  

The $5.4 million decrease in other expense related primarily to a $4.7 million decrease in expense related to settlements on our 
derivatives and a $2.0 million increase in income from hedge ineffectiveness in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. These increases 
were partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in non-cash income primarily related to the change in fair value of our derivatives for 
fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.  

The increase in income tax expense was primarily a result of the increase in income before taxes, partially offset by a decrease 

in the effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 was 39.0% compared to 40.3% in fiscal 2016. The decrease in the 
effective tax rate was a result of an increase in other permanent deductions and a reduction in non-deductible expenses and state 
income tax as a percentage of income before taxes. Since non-deductible expenses tend to be relatively constant, there is a favorable 
rate impact as income before taxes increases.   

Segment Results  

We have three reportable segments as described above—Performance Foodservice, PFG Customized, and Vistar. Management 

evaluates the performance of these segments based on their respective sales growth and EBITDA. For PFG Customized, EBITDA 
includes certain allocated corporate expenses that are included in operating expenses. The allocated corporate expenses are determined 
based on a percentage of total sales. This percentage is reviewed on a periodic basis to ensure that the allocation reflects a reasonable 
rate of corporate expenses based on their use of corporate services.

Corporate & All Other is comprised of unallocated corporate overhead and certain operations that are not considered separate 

reportable segments based on their size. This includes the operations of our internal logistics unit responsible for managing and 
allocating inbound logistics revenue and expense, as well as the operations of certain recent acquisitions.  

In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company reorganized its information technology department, and expenses associated 
with business application teams are now included in the segment results.  The EBITDA for Performance Foodservice, Vistar and 
Corporate & All Other for the fiscal years ended July 1, 2017 and July 2, 2016 have been adjusted to reflect this change.

Net Sales  

Net sales for Performance Foodservice increased $608.8 million, or 6.2%, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. The increase in net 
sales was attributable to growth in cases sold, as well as an increase in selling price per case as a result of inflation. Case growth in 
fiscal 2018 was driven by securing new independent customers and further penetrating existing customers. Securing new and 
expanded business with independent customers resulted in independent sales growth of approximately 8.4% in fiscal 2018 compared 
to fiscal 2017. For fiscal 2018, independent sales as a percentage of total segment sales were 45.2%.  

EBITDA  

EBITDA for Performance Foodservice increased $10.6 million, or 3.3%, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. This increase was the 

result of an increase in gross profit, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization. 
Gross profit increased by 6.0% in fiscal 2018, compared to the prior fiscal year, as a result of an increase in cases sold, as well as an 
increase in the gross profit per case. The increase in gross profit per case was driven by a favorable shift in the mix of cases sold 
toward independent customers and Performance Brands, as well as by an increase in procurement gains. Independent business has 
higher gross margins than Chain customers within this segment.  

Operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization for Performance Foodservice increased by $77.1 million, or 6.8%, 

from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. Operating expenses increased as a result of an increase in case volume and the resulting impact on 
variable operational and selling expenses, as well as investments in selling, warehouse, and delivery personnel. Operating expenses 
also increased as a result of a $10.3 million increase in fuel expense, which mostly occurred in the second half of fiscal 2018.

Depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment increased from $57.4 million in fiscal 
2017 to $58.7 million in fiscal 2018. This increase was a result of recent acquisitions, computer software, capital leases and warehouse 
expansion, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets since certain intangibles are now fully amortized.  

Fiscal year ended July 1, 2017 compared to fiscal year ended July 2, 2016  
Net Sales  

Net sales for Performance Foodservice increased $206.1 million, or 2.1%, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. This increase in net 

sales was attributable to growth in cases sold, partially offset by the 53rd week in fiscal 2016. Net sales for the extra week in fiscal 
2016 were approximately $188.0 million. Case growth in fiscal 2017 was driven by securing new independent customers and further 
penetrating existing customers. Securing new and expanded business with independent customers resulted in independent sales growth 
of approximately 4.6% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. For fiscal 2017, independent sales as a percentage of total segment 
sales were 44.4%.  

EBITDA  

EBITDA for Performance Foodservice increased $16.8 million, or 5.5%, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. This increase was the 

result of an increase in gross profit, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization. 
Gross profit increased by 4.4% in fiscal 2017, compared to the prior fiscal year, as a result of an increase in cases sold, as well as an 
increase in the gross profit per case, partially offset by gross profit of approximately $28.3 million in the extra week in fiscal 2016. 
The increase in gross profit per case was driven by a favorable shift in the mix of cases sold toward independent customers and 
Performance Brands, as well as by an increase in procurement gains. Independent business has higher gross margins than Chain 
customers within this segment.  

Operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for Performance Foodservice increased by $45.3 million, or 4.1%, 

from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. Operating expenses increased as a result of an increase in case volume and the resulting impact on 
variable operational and selling expenses, as well as cost of living and other increases in compensation and benefits and increase in 
costs associated with insurance expense primarily related to workers’ compensation and vehicle liability of $5.9 million. These 
increases were partially offset by the extra week in fiscal 2016. The Company estimates that operating expenses excluding 
depreciation and amortization were approximately $21.2 million in the 53rd week of fiscal 2016.  

Depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment decreased from $63.2 million in 

fiscal 2016 to $57.4 million in fiscal 2017, a decrease of 9.2%. These reductions were a result of a decrease in amortization of 
intangible assets since certain intangibles are now fully amortized.  

Segment Results—PFG Customized  

Fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to fiscal year ended July 1, 2017  
Net Sales  

Net sales for PFG Customized decreased $162.3 million, or 4.2%, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. The decrease in net sales was 

primarily a result of the Georgia facility that was closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.  Excluding the impact of the closed 
Georgia facility, net sales would have increased $65.0 million in fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year as a result of an increase in 
selling price per case driven by a favorable shift in customer mix.  

EBITDA  

EBITDA for PFG Customized increased $4.2 million, or 16.6%, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. Excluding the impact of the 

closed Georgia facility, an increase in gross profit was offset by an increase in operating expenses, excluding depreciation and

Operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, decreased by $9.4 million, or 4.5%, in fiscal 2018, compared to 

the prior year primarily as a result of the closed Georgia facility, partially offset by increases in personnel expenses and fuel expense.  

Depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment decreased from $16.1 million in 
fiscal 2017 to $14.6 million in fiscal 2018. This decrease is primarily a result of lower amortization expense for certain customer 
relationship intangible assets, which are now fully amortized.  

Fiscal year ended July 1, 2017 compared to fiscal year ended July 2, 2016  
Net Sales  

Net sales for PFG Customized increased $38.7 million, or 1.0%, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. The increase in net sales was 

driven by the new business with Red Lobster in fiscal 2017, partially offset by the 53rd week in fiscal 2016. Net sales for the extra 
week in fiscal 2016 were approximately $70.2 million.  

EBITDA  

EBITDA for PFG Customized decreased $8.8 million, or 25.8%, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily 
attributable to a decrease in gross profit of $5.1 million, or 2.1%, and an increase in operating expenses, excluding depreciation and 
amortization. Gross profit for PFG Customized decreased primarily as a result of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016 and planned exits of 
some customers to free up capacity for the addition of the new business with Red Lobster. The Company estimates that gross profit 
was approximately $4.4 million for the extra week in fiscal 2016. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we began providing distribution 
solutions to a portion of Red Lobster’s restaurants and completed the transition during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.  

Operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased by $3.7 million, or 1.8%, in fiscal 2017, compared to 

the prior year primarily driven by $5.2 million related to the closing of the Georgia facility, partially offset by $3.8 million of expense 
in the 53rd week in fiscal 2016.  

Depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment increased from $15.4 million in fiscal 

2016 to $16.1 million in fiscal 2017, an increase of 4.5%. The increase was primarily a result of the accelerated amortization of 
customer relationship intangible assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 due to volume declines for certain customers.   

Segment Results—Vistar  

Fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to fiscal year ended July 1, 2017  
Net Sales  

Net sales for Vistar increased $337.4 million, or 11.2%, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. This increase was driven by case sales 

growth in the segment’s theater and retail channels, as well as recent acquisitions.  

EBITDA  

EBITDA for Vistar increased $15.4 million, or 13.1%, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. Gross profit dollar growth of $72.5 

million, or 18.4% for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, was driven by an increase in the number of cases sold, as well as an 
increase in gross profit per case.  The increase in gross profit per case was driven by a favorable shift in channel mix, as well as by an 
increase in procurement gains. 

Operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased $57.7 million, or 20.9%, for fiscal 2018 compared to 
the prior year. Operating expenses increased primarily as a result of an increase in case volume and the resulting impact on variable 
operational and selling expenses, as well as cost of living and other increases in compensation and benefits.  Operating expenses also 
increased as a result of recent acquisitions.  

Depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment increased from $24.6 million in fiscal 

2017 to $27.4 million in fiscal 2018. Amortization of intangible assets increased as a result of recent acquisitions.

Fiscal year ended July 1, 2017 compared to fiscal year ended July 2, 2016 
Net Sales  

Net sales for Vistar increased $302.1 million, or 11.2%, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. This increase was driven by case sales 

growth in the segment’s retail, theater, vending, and hospitality channels and recent acquisitions, partially offset by net sales of 
approximately $54.1 million in the 53rd week in fiscal 2016.  

EBITDA  

EBITDA for Vistar increased $7.6 million, or 6.9%, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. This increase in EBITDA was the result of 

gross profit dollar growth increasing faster than operating expense dollar growth, excluding depreciation and amortization. Gross 
profit dollar growth of $39.2 million, or 11.0% for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, was driven by an increase in the number of 
cases sold and recent acquisitions, partially offset by gross profit of approximately $7.0 million in the 53rd week in fiscal 2016.  

Operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased $30.9 million, or 12.6%, for fiscal 2017. Operating 

expenses increased primarily as a result of investments associated with expansion of geographies served in the dollar store channel, 
additional expenses related to recent acquisitions and an increase associated with the fourth quarter fiscal 2016 opening of our 
automated retail facility, partially offset by the 53rd week in fiscal 2016. The Company estimates that operating expenses excluding 
depreciation and amortization were approximately $4.9 million in the 53rd week of fiscal 2016.  

Depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment increased from $18.2 million in fiscal 
2016 to $24.6 million in fiscal 2017, an increase of 35.2%. Amortization of intangible assets increased as a result of acquisitions over 
the past year. Depreciation of fixed assets increased as a result of capital outlays primarily related to fleet.

2017 to $29.4 million in fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily a result of amortization related to recent acquisitions.  

Fiscal year ended July 1, 2017 compared to fiscal year ended July 2, 2016 
Net Sales  

Net sales for Corporate & All Other increased $127.3 million from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily

fees including settlements.  

Depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment increased from $21.8 million in fiscal 

2016 to $28.0 million in fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily a result of amortization related to recent acquisitions.

Quarterly Results and Seasonality  

Historically, the food-away-from-home and foodservice distribution industries are seasonal, with lower profit in the first and 

third quarters of each calendar year. Consequently, we typically experience lower operating profit during our first and third fiscal 
quarters, depending on the timing of acquisitions, if any.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

We have historically financed our operations and growth primarily with cash flows from operations, borrowings under our credit 

facility, operating and capital leases, and normal trade credit terms. We have typically funded our acquisitions with additional 
borrowings under our credit facility. Our working capital and borrowing levels are subject to seasonal fluctuations, typically with the 
lowest borrowing levels in the third and fourth fiscal quarters and the highest borrowing levels occurring in the first and second fiscal 
quarters. We believe that our cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient both to meet our 
anticipated cash requirements over at least the next 12 months and to maintain sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes.  

At June 30, 2018, our cash balance totaled $17.8 million, including restricted cash of $10.3 million, as compared to a cash 

balance totaling $21.0 million, including restricted cash of $12.9 million, at July 1, 2017. This decrease in cash during fiscal 2018 was 
attributable to net cash used in investing activities and financing activities of $209.4 million and $160.8 million, respectively, which 
was partially offset by net cash provided by operating activities of $367.0 million. We borrow under the ABL Facility or pay it down 
regularly based on our cash flows from operating and investing activities. Our practice is to minimize interest expense while 
maintaining reasonable liquidity.  

 
As market conditions warrant, we may from time to time seek to repurchase our securities or loans in privately negotiated or 

open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Any such repurchases may be funded by incurring new debt, including 
additional borrowings under our ABL Facility.  In addition, depending on conditions in the credit and capital markets and other 
factors, we will, from time to time, consider other financing transactions, the proceeds of which could be used to refinance our 
indebtedness, make investments or acquisitions or for other purposes.  Any new debt may be secured debt. 

On October 6, 2015, we completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) of 16,675,000 shares of common stock for an offering 

price of $19.00 per share ($17.955 per share net of underwriting discounts), including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their 
option to purchase additional shares. We sold an aggregate of 12,777,325 shares of such common stock and certain selling 
stockholders sold 3,897,675 shares. The aggregate offering price of the amount of newly issued common stock was $242.8 million. In 
connection with the offering, we paid the underwriters a discount of $1.045 per share, for a total underwriting discount of 
$13.4 million. In addition, we incurred direct offering expenses consisting of legal, accounting, and printing costs of $5.8 million in 
connection with the IPO, of which $3.0 million was paid during fiscal 2016. We used the net proceeds to us from the IPO after 
deducting the underwriting discount and our direct offering expenses to repay $223.0 million aggregate principal amount of 
indebtedness under a credit agreement providing for a term loan facility (the “Term Facility”). We used the remainder of the net 
proceeds for general corporate purposes.  

On February 1, 2016, Performance Food Group, Inc. amended and restated the ABL Facility to increase the aggregate principal 
amount from $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, lower interest rates for LIBOR based loans, extend the maturity from May 2017 to February 
2021, and modify triggers and provisions related to certain reporting, financial, and negative covenants. The total size of the facility 
immediately increased the effective borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility since borrowing base assets exceeded the facility size 
prior to the amendment. Approximately $6.8 million of fees and expenses were incurred for the amendment, which were included as 
deferred financing costs and will be amortized over the remaining term of the ABL Facility. Of this amount, $6.6 million was paid 
during fiscal 2016. In connection with the closing of this amendment, Performance Food Group, Inc. borrowed $200.0 million under 
the ABL Facility and used the proceeds to repay $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of loans under the Term Facility.  

On May 17, 2016, Performance Food Group, Inc. issued and sold $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.500% 

Senior Notes due 2024 (the “Notes”), pursuant to an indenture dated as of May 17, 2016, that is jointly and severally guaranteed by 
PFGC, Inc. (“PFGC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and all domestic direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of 
PFGC (other than captive insurance subsidiaries and other excluded subsidiaries). The proceeds from the Notes were used to pay in 
full the remaining outstanding $306.4 million aggregate principal amount of loans under the Term Facility and to terminate the Term 
Facility; to temporarily repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility; and to pay the fees, expenses, and other 
transaction costs incurred in connection with the Notes. Approximately $7.2 million of fees and expenses were incurred and paid 
during fiscal 2016 in connection with the Notes. Of the amount of fees incurred, $2.5 was included as deferred financing costs and 
will be amortized over the remaining term of the Notes, $2.1 million was included in loss on extinguishment of debt within interest 
expense related to the portion of the Term Facility repayment deemed an extinguishment, and $2.6 million was recorded to Operating 
expenses for the portion of the Term Facility deemed a modification.  

On August 3, 2017, PFGC, Inc. and Performance Food Group, Inc., each a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered 
into the First Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Amendment”) with Wells Fargo Bank, National 
Association, as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, and the other lenders party thereto, which amended the ABL Facility. The 
Amendment amended the ABL Facility by, among other things, (i) increasing the aggregate principal amount under the ABL Facility 
from $1.6 billion to $1.95 billion by increasing Tranche A Commitments by $325.0 million and the Tranche A-1 Commitments by 

38

$25.0 million and (ii) maintaining the level of additional commitments permitted, excluding the additional commitments effected 
pursuant to the Amendment, at $800.0 million under uncommitted incremental facilities.  

Operating Activities  

Fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to fiscal year ended July 1, 2017 

During fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, our operating activities provided cash flow of $367.0 million and $201.7 million, 

respectively. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was largely driven by 
higher operating income, improved working capital management and lower taxes paid. 

Fiscal year ended July 1, 2017 compared to fiscal year ended July 2, 2016  

During fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, our operating activities provided cash flow of $201.7 million and $228.5 million, 

respectively.   

Fiscal 2016 cash flows provided by operating activities included a $25.0 million break-up fee payment received related to the 

terminated agreement to acquire 11 US Foods facilities from Sysco and US Foods. Excluding this fee, cash flows provided by 
operating activities during fiscal 2016 were $203.5 million. The remaining $1.8 million decrease, excluding the break-up fee payment, 
in cash flows provided by operating activities for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was largely driven by an increase in our net 
working capital investment, partially offset by lower cash income tax payments as a result of timing of the payments and lower cash 
interest payments as a result of debt pay down associated with the IPO and subsequent refinancings, as well as changes in the timing 
of payments. Our net working capital, which includes accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable and outstanding checks in 
excess of deposits, fluctuates with our sales growth.  

Investing Activities  

Cash used in investing activities totaled $209.4 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $332.0 million in fiscal 2017 and 

$157.6 million in fiscal 2016. These investments consisted primarily of capital purchases of property, plant, and equipment of 
$140.1 million, $140.2 million and $119.7 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and payments for business 
acquisitions of $71.1 million, $192.9 million and $39.0 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In fiscal 2018, 
purchases of property, plant, and equipment primarily consisted of equipment, transportation and information technology, as well as 
outlays for warehouse expansions and improvements.

As of June 30, 2018, the Company had commitments of $7.0 million for capital projects related to warehouse expansion and 

improvements, warehouse equipment and information technology equipment and software. The Company anticipates using cash flows 
from operations or borrowings from the ABL Facility to fulfill these commitments.  

Financing Activities  

During fiscal 2018, net cash used in financing activities was $160.8 million, which consisted primarily of $119.8 million in net 
payments under our ABL Facility and cash paid for shares withheld to cover taxes of $28.2 million related to restricted stock vestings. 
During fiscal 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $127.5 million, which consisted primarily of $134.9 million in 

net borrowings under our ABL Facility.  

During fiscal 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $76.5 million, which consisted primarily of payments of 

$736.9 million on our Term Loan Facility, partially offset by $350.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of Notes, $226.4 million in 
net proceeds from our IPO and $99.3 million in net borrowings under our ABL Facility.

The following describes our financing arrangements as of June 30, 2018:  

ABL Facility: PFGC, Inc. (“PFGC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a party to the ABL Facility, which has an 
aggregate principal amount of $1.95 billion and matures February 2021. The ABL Facility is secured by the majority of the tangible 
assets of PFGC and its subsidiaries. Performance Food Group, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of PFGC, is the lead borrower under 
the ABL Facility, which is jointly and severally guaranteed by PFGC and all material domestic direct and indirect wholly-owned 
subsidiaries of PFGC (other than captive insurance subsidiaries and other excluded subsidiaries). Availability for loans and letters of 
credit under the ABL Facility is governed by a borrowing base, determined by the application of specified advance rates against 
eligible assets, including trade accounts receivable, inventory, owned real properties, and owned transportation equipment. The 
borrowing base is reduced quarterly by a cumulative fraction of the real properties and transportation equipment values. Advances on 
accounts receivable and inventory are subject to change based on periodic commercial finance examinations and appraisals, and the 
real property and transportation equipment values included in the borrowing base are subject to change based on periodic appraisals. 
Audits and appraisals are conducted at the direction of the administrative agent for the benefit and on behalf of all lenders.  

Borrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest, at Performance Food Group, Inc.’s option, at (a) the Base Rate (defined as the 
greater of (i) the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such date plus 0.5%, (ii) the Prime Rate on such day, or (iii) one month LIBOR plus 
1.0%) plus a spread or (b) LIBOR plus a spread. The ABL Facility also provides for an unused commitment fee ranging from 0.25% 
to 0.375%.  

The following table summarizes outstanding borrowings, availability, and the average interest rate under the ABL Facility:

The ABL Facility contains covenants requiring the maintenance of a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio if 
excess availability falls below the greater of (i) $160.0 million and (ii) 10% of the lesser of the borrowing base and the revolving 
credit facility amount for five consecutive business days. The ABL Facility also contains customary restrictive covenants that include, 
but are not limited to, restrictions on PFGC’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, create liens, make investments or 
specified payments, and dispose of assets. The ABL Facility provides for customary events of default, including payment defaults and 
cross-defaults on other material indebtedness. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, amounts due under such agreement may 
be accelerated and the rights and remedies of the lenders under the ABL Facility may be exercised, including rights with respect to the 
collateral securing the obligations under such agreement.  

Senior Notes: On May 17, 2016, Performance Food Group, Inc. issued and sold $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 

5.500% Senior Notes due 2024 (the “Notes”), pursuant to an indenture dated as of May 17, 2016. The Notes are jointly and severally 
guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by PFGC and all domestic direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of PFGC (other than 
captive insurance subsidiaries and other excluded subsidiaries). The Notes are not guaranteed by Performance Food Group Company.  

The proceeds from the Notes were used to pay in full the remaining outstanding aggregate principal amount of the loans under 
the Company’s term loan facility and to terminate the facility; to temporarily repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the 
ABL Facility; and to pay the fees, expenses, and other transaction costs incurred in connection with the Notes.  

The Notes were issued at 100.0% of their par value. The Notes mature on June 1, 2024 and bear interest at a rate of 5.500% per 

year, payable semi-annually in arrears.  

Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event or upon the sale of certain assets in which Performance Food 

Group, Inc. does not apply the proceeds as required, the holders of the Notes will have the right to require Performance Food Group, 
Inc. to repurchase each holder’s Notes at a price equal to 101% (in the case of a change of control triggering event) or 100% (in the 
case of an asset sale) of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Performance Food Group, Inc. may redeem all or a 
part of the Notes at any time prior to June 1, 2019 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being 
redeemed plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. In addition, 
beginning on June 1, 2019, Performance Food Group, Inc. may redeem all or a part of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 
102.750% of the principal amount redeemed. The redemption price decreases to 101.325% and 100.000% of the principal amount 
redeemed on June 1, 2020 and June 1, 2021, respectively. In addition, at any time prior to June 1, 2019, Performance Food Group, Inc.

may redeem up to 40% of the Notes from the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 105.500% of the 
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  

The indenture governing the Notes contains covenants limiting, among other things, PFGC and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability 

to incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock; pay dividends and make other distributions on, or 
redeem or repurchase, capital stock; make certain investments; incur certain liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; consolidate, 
merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets; create certain restrictions on the ability of PFGC’s restricted 
subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to PFGC; designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and transfer 
or sell certain assets. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. The Notes also contain 
customary events of default, the occurrence of which could result in the principal of and accrued interest on the Notes to become or be 
declared due and payable.  

 
The ABL Facility and the indenture governing the Notes contain customary restrictive covenants under which all of the net 

assets of PFGC and its subsidiaries were restricted from distribution to Performance Food Group Company, except for approximately 
$486.0 million of restricted payment capacity available under such debt agreements, as of June 30, 2018. Such minimum estimated 
restricted payment capacity is calculated based on the most restrictive of our debt agreements and may fluctuate from period to period, 
which fluctuations may be material.  Our restricted payment capacity under other debt instruments to which the Company is subject 
may be materially higher than the foregoing estimate. 

As of June 30, 2018, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the ABL Facility and Notes.  

Unsecured Subordinated Promissory Note. In connection with an acquisition, Performance Food Group, Inc. issued a 

$6.0 million interest only, unsecured subordinated promissory note on December 21, 2012, bearing an interest rate of 3.5%. The 
$6.0 million promissory note was paid off in December 2017.

(1)  The amounts reflected in the table include the interest component of the lease payments.  
(2) 

Includes unrecognized tax benefits under accounting standards related to uncertain tax positions. As of June 30, 2018, we had a 
liability of $1.2 million for unrecognized tax benefits for all tax jurisdictions and less than $0.2 million for related interest that 
could result in cash payments. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments of the amount by which the 
liability will increase or decrease over time. Accordingly, we only reflected the balances we could reasonably estimate in the 
“Payments Due by Period” section of the table.  
Includes payments on our floating rate debt based on rates as of June 30, 2018, assuming the amount remains unchanged until 
maturity. The impact of our outstanding floating-to-fixed interest rate swap on the floating rate debt interest payments is 
included as well based on the floating rates in effect as of June 30, 2018.

(4)  For purposes of this table, purchase obligations include agreements for purchases related to capital projects and services in the 

normal course of business, for which all significant terms have been confirmed. The amounts included above are based on 
estimates. Purchase obligations also include amounts committed to various capital projects in process or scheduled to be 
completed in the coming year, as well as a minimum amount due for various Company meetings and conferences.

(5)  Represents the voluntary withdrawal liability recorded related to the withdrawal from the Central States Southeast and 

Southwest Areas Pension Fund (“Central States Pension Fund”) and excludes normal contributions required under our collective 
bargaining agreements. See Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies to our audited consolidated financial statements included 
in Item 8 for further discussion.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our 

financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or 
capital resources.  

Total assets by segment discussed below exclude intercompany receivables between segments.  

Total Assets by Segment  

Total assets for Performance Foodservice increased $106.7 million from $2,161.2 million as of July 1, 2017 to $2,267.9 million 

as of June 30, 2018. During this time period, this segment increased its property, plant, and equipment and inventory, which was 
partially offset by a decrease in intangible assets.  

Total assets for PFG Customized decreased $22.8 million from $667.1 million as of July 1, 2017 to $644.3 million as of June 

30, 2018. During this time period, this segment decreased its accounts receivable.  

Total assets for Vistar increased $84.5 million from $654.5 million as of July 1, 2017 to $739.0 million as of June 30, 2018. 

During this time period, this segment increased its accounts receivable, goodwill, and intangible assets, primarily due to acquisitions.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to portraying our financial position and results of 

operations. These policies require our most subjective or complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the effect of 
matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting policies and estimates include those that pertain to the allowance for 
doubtful accounts receivable, inventory valuation, insurance programs, income taxes, vendor rebates and promotional incentives, and 
goodwill and other intangible assets.  

Accounts Receivable  

Accounts receivable are primarily comprised of trade receivables from customers in the ordinary course of business, are 
recorded at the invoiced amount, and primarily do not bear interest. Receivables are recorded net of the allowance for doubtful 
accounts on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a 
combination of factors. We regularly analyze our significant customer accounts, and when we become aware of a specific customer’s 
inability to meet its financial obligations to us, such as a bankruptcy filing or a deterioration in the customer’s operating results or 
financial position, we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we reasonably believe is 
collectible. We also record reserves for bad debt for other customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the 
receivables are past due, macroeconomic considerations, and historical experience. If circumstances related to specific customers 
change, our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.  

Inventory Valuation  

Our inventories consist primarily of food and non-food products. We primarily value inventories at the lower of cost or market 

using the first-in, first-out method (“FIFO”). FIFO was used for approximately 91% of total inventories at June 30, 2018. The 
remainder of the inventory was valued using LIFO method using the link chain technique of the dollar value method. We adjust our 
inventory balances for slow-moving, excess, and obsolete inventories. These adjustments are based upon inventory category, 
inventory age, specifically identified items, and overall economic conditions.  

Insurance Programs  

We maintain high-deductible insurance programs covering portions of general and vehicle liability and workers’ compensation. 

The amounts in excess of the deductibles are insured by third-party insurance carriers, subject to certain limitations and exclusions. 

42 

42

PFG_10K_2018_FINAL_96pages.indd   42

8/28/18   11:59 AM

 
We also maintain self-funded group medical insurance. We accrue our estimated liability for these deductibles, including an estimate 
for incurred but not reported claims, based on known claims and past claims history. The estimated short-term portion of these 
accruals is included in Accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheets, while the estimated long-term portion of the accruals is 
included in Other long-term liabilities. The provisions for insurance claims include estimates of the frequency and timing of claims 
occurrence, as well as the ultimate amounts to be paid. These insurance programs are managed by a third party, and the deductibles for 
general and vehicle liability and workers compensation are primarily collateralized by letters of credit and restricted cash.  

Income Taxes  

We follow Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740-10, Income 

Taxes—Overall, which requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their reported amounts. Future tax benefits, including net operating loss carry-forwards, are recognized to the extent that 
realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light 
of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law, and closing of statutes of limitations. 
Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate.  

Vendor Rebates and Other Promotional Incentives  

We participate in various rebate and promotional incentives with our suppliers, either unilaterally or in combination with 

purchasing cooperatives and other procurement partners, that consist primarily of volume and growth rebates, annual and multi-year 
incentives, and promotional programs. Consideration received under these incentives is generally recorded as a reduction of cost of 
goods sold. However, in certain limited circumstances the consideration is recorded as a reduction of costs incurred by us. 
Consideration received may be in the form of cash and/or invoice deductions. Changes in the estimated amount of incentives to be 
received are treated as changes in estimates and are recognized in the period of change.  

Consideration received for volume and growth rebates, annual incentives, and multi-year incentives are recorded as a reduction 

of cost of goods sold. We systematically and rationally allocate the consideration for these incentives to each of the underlying 
transactions that results in progress by the Company toward earning the incentives. If the incentives are not probable and reasonably 
estimable, we record the incentives as the underlying objectives or milestones are achieved. We record annual and multi-year 
incentives when earned, generally over the agreement period. We use current and historical purchasing data, forecasted purchasing 
volumes, and other factors in estimating whether the underlying objectives or milestones will be achieved. Consideration received to 
promote and sell the supplier’s products is typically a reimbursement of marketing costs incurred by the Company and is recorded as a 
reduction of our operating expenses. If the amount of consideration received from the suppliers exceeds our marketing costs, any 
excess is recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold. We follow the requirements of FASB ASC 605-50-25-10, Revenue 
Recognition—Customer Payments and Incentives—Recognition—Customer’s Accounting for Certain Consideration Received from a 
Vendor and ASC 605-50-45-16, Revenue Recognition—Customer Payments and Incentives—Other Presentation Matters—Reseller’s 
Characterization of Sales Incentives Offered to Customers by Manufacturers.  

Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Assets  

We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. Our financial statements reflect the operations 

of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. Goodwill and other intangible assets represent the excess of 
cost of an acquired entity over the amounts specifically assigned to those tangible net assets acquired in a business combination. Other 
identifiable intangible assets typically include customer relationships, trade names, technology, non-compete agreements, and 
favorable lease assets. Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized. Intangibles with definite lives are amortized 
on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which generally range from two to eleven years. Annually, or when certain triggering 
events occur, the Company assesses the useful lives of its intangibles with definite lives. Certain assumptions, estimates, and 
judgments are used in determining the fair value of net assets acquired, including goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as 
determining the allocation of goodwill to the reporting units. Accordingly, we may obtain the assistance of third-party valuation 
specialists for significant tangible and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on 
future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain. Significant estimates and 
assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of 
future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), economic barriers to entry, a brand’s relative market position, 
and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which 
could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.  

We are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually or more often if 
circumstances indicate. Indicators of goodwill impairment include, but are not limited to, significant declines in the markets and 

43 

43

8/28/18   11:59 AM

 
industries that buy our products, changes in the estimated future cash flows of its reporting units, changes in capital markets, and 
changes in its market capitalization.  

We apply the guidance in FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2011-08 “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Testing 
Goodwill for Impairment,” which provides entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment (commonly referred to as “step 
zero”) to determine whether further quantitative analysis for impairment of goodwill is necessary. In performing step zero for our 
goodwill impairment test, we are required to make assumptions and judgments, including but not limited to the following: the 
evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as related to our business, industry and market trends, and the overall future financial 
performance of our reporting units and future opportunities in the markets in which they operate. If impairment indicators are present 
after performing step zero, we would perform a quantitative impairment analysis to estimate the fair value of goodwill.  

During fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, we performed the step zero analysis for our goodwill impairment test. As a result of our step 

zero analysis, no further quantitative impairment test was deemed necessary for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017. There were no 
impairments of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.  

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

Refer to Note 3 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in 

Item 8 for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and expected 
effects on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  

All of our market sensitive instruments are entered into for purposes other than trading.  

Interest Rate Risk  

We are exposed to interest rate risk related to changes in interest rates for borrowings under our ABL Facility. Although we 

hedge a portion of our interest rate risk through interest rate swaps, any borrowings under our ABL Facility in excess of the notional 
amount of the swaps will be subject to variable interest rates.  

As of June 30, 2018, our subsidiary, Performance Food Group, Inc., had eight interest rate swaps with a combined value of 

$650.0 million notional amount that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk. See Note 9 Derivatives and Hedging 
Activities within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 for further discussion of these interest rate swaps.  

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in 

accumulated other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted 
transaction impacts earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of derivatives is recognized directly in earnings. 
Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest 
payments are made on our variable-rate debt. During the next twelve months, we estimate that gains of approximately $4.1 million 
will be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense.  

Based on the fair values of these interest rate swaps as of June 30, 2018, a hypothetical 100 bps decrease in LIBOR would result 
in a loss of $9.0 million and a hypothetical 100 bps increase in LIBOR would result in a gain of $8.7 million within accumulated other 
comprehensive income.  

Assuming an average daily balance on our ABL Facility of approximately $950.0 million, approximately $350.0 million of our 

outstanding long-term debt is fixed through interest rate swap agreements over the next twelve months and approximately $600.0 
million represents variable-rate debt. A hypothetical 100 bps increase in LIBOR on our variable-rate debt would lead to an increase of 
approximately $6.0 million in annual cash interest expense.  

Fuel Price Risk  

We seek to minimize the effect of higher diesel fuel costs both by reducing fuel usage and by taking action to offset higher fuel 
prices. We reduce usage by designing more efficient truck routes and by increasing miles per gallon through on-board computers that 
monitor and adjust idling time and maximum speeds and through other technologies. In our PFG Customized segment, we have 
limited exposure to fuel costs since our sales contracts often transfer fuel price volatility to our customers. In our Performance 
Foodservice and Vistar segments, we seek to manage fuel prices through diesel fuel surcharges to our customers and through the use 
of costless collars.  

44 

44

PFG_10K_2018_FINAL_96pages.indd   44

8/28/18   11:59 AM

 

As of June 30, 2018, we had collars in place for approximately 13% of the gallons we expect to use over the twelve months 

following June 30, 2018. These fuel collars do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment for reasons discussed in Note 9. Derivatives 
and Hedging Activities within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Therefore, these collars are recorded 
at fair value as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet. Any changes in fair value are recorded in the period of the change as 
unrealized gains or losses on fuel hedging instruments.  A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in expected diesel fuel prices would 
result in an immaterial gain or loss for these derivative instruments.  

Our fuel purchases occur at market prices. Using published market price projections for diesel and estimates of fuel 

consumption, a 10% hypothetical increase in diesel prices from the market price would result in a potential increase of approximately 
$11.1 million in fuel costs included in Operating expenses. As discussed above, this increase in fuel costs would be partially offset by 
fuel surcharges passed through to our customers.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  

To the shareholders and Board of Directors of  
Performance Food Group Company  
 
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Performance Food Group Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) 
as of June 30, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, 
effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated 
Framework (2013) issued by COSO.  
 
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) 
(PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, of the Company and our report 
dated August 16, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 
 
Basis for Opinion  
 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of 
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal 
Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial 
reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with 
respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities 
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such 
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our 
opinion.  
 
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect 
on the financial statements.  
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections 
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  

To the shareholders and Board of Directors of  
Performance Food Group Company  

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Performance Food Group Company and subsidiaries (the 
“Company”) as of June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, 
shareholders’ equity and cash flows for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018, July 1, 2017 and July 2, 2016, and the related notes and 
the schedule listed in the Index at Item 8 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).  In our opinion, the financial 
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017, and the 
results of its operations and its cash flows for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018, July 1, 2017 and July 2, 2016, in conformity with 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) 
(PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2018, based on the criteria established in Internal 
Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our 
report dated August 16, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 

Basis for Opinion  

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to 
be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and 
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. 
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to 
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence 
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used 
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe 
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal years ended July 1, 2017 and July 2, 2016 have been adjusted to reflect the 
adoption of ASU 2016-08, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash.  The consolidated statements of cash flows explain the 
change during the periods in the total of cash and restricted cash. Therefore, restricted cash activity is included with cash when 
reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. Cash payments of $7.3 
million in fiscal 2016 related to insurance claims paid using restricted cash is classified as a change in Accrued expenses and other 
liabilities within Net cash provided by operating activities.  Refer to Note 3 for further discussion.

PERFORMANCE FOOD GROUP COMPANY  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

Summary of Business Activities  

1. 
Business Overview  

Performance Food Group Company (the “Company”), through its subsidiaries, markets and distributes national and company-

branded food and food-related products to customer locations across the United States. The Company serves both of the major 
customer types in the restaurant industry: (i) independent, or “Street” customers, and (ii) multi-unit, or “Chain” customers, which 
include regional and national family and casual dining restaurant chains, fast casual chains, and quick-service restaurants. The 
Company also serves schools, healthcare facilities, business and industry locations, and other institutional customers.  

Fiscal Years  

The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to June 30th. This resulted in a 52-week year for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 

2017 and a 53-week year for fiscal 2016. References to “fiscal 2018” are to the 52-week period ended June 30, 2018, references to 
“fiscal 2017” are to the 52-week period ended July 1, 2017, and references to “fiscal 2016” are to the 53-week period ended July 2, 
2016.  

Initial Public Offering  

On October 6, 2015, the Company completed a registered initial public offering (“IPO”) of 16,675,000 shares of common stock 

for a cash offering price of $19.00 per share ($17.955 per share net of underwriting discounts), including the exercise in full by 
underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. The Company sold an aggregate of 12,777,325 shares of such common 
stock and certain selling stockholders sold 3,897,675 shares (including the shares sold pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase 
additional shares). The Company’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “PFGC.”  

The aggregate offering price of the amount of newly issued common stock sold was $242.8 million. In connection with the 
offering, the Company paid the underwriters a discount of $1.045 per share, for a total underwriting discount of $13.4 million. In 
addition, the Company incurred direct offering expenses consisting of legal, accounting, and printing costs of $5.8 million in 
connection with the IPO, of which $3.0 million was paid during fiscal 2016.  

The Company used the net offering proceeds of the IPO, after deducting the underwriting discount and direct offering expenses, 

to repay $223.0 million aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under a credit agreement providing for a term loan facility (the 
“Term Facility”). The Company used the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.  

Secondary Offerings  

On May 24, 2016, certain selling stockholders of the Company sold 12,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at a 

public offering price of $24.25 per share in a secondary public offering (the “Offering”).  The selling stockholders granted the 
underwriters of the Offering an option to purchase an additional 1,800,000 shares at a price of $23.3406 per share.  The underwriters 
exercised their option in full and, on May 27, 2016, purchased an additional 1,800,000 shares from the selling stockholders.  The 
selling stockholders received all of the net proceeds from the Offering and the sale of the additional 1,800,000 shares.  No shares were 
sold by the Company.    

In November 2016, January 2017, February 2017, and May 2017 certain selling stockholders sold an aggregate of 47,592,206 

shares of the Company’s common stock in transactions registered under the Securities Act.  The Company did not receive any 
proceeds from these sales.  As a result of these sales, The Blackstone Group L.P. (“Blackstone”) no longer beneficially owns any 
shares of the Company’s common stock. 

In September 2017, November 2017 and December 2017 Wellspring Capital Management (“Wellspring”) sold an aggregate of 
16,272,914 shares of the Company’s common stock in transactions registered under the Securities Act.  The Company did not receive 
any proceeds from these sales. As a result of these sales, Wellspring no longer beneficially owns any shares of the Company’s 
common stock.

2.  
Principles of Consolidation  

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates  

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All inter-company balances and 

transactions have been eliminated.  

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue 
and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates used by management are related to the accounting for the 
allowance for doubtful accounts, reserve for inventories, impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets, acquisition 
accounting, reserves for claims and recoveries under insurance programs, vendor rebates and other promotional incentives, bonus 
accruals, depreciation, amortization, determination of useful lives of tangible and intangible assets, and income taxes. Actual results 
could differ from these estimates.  

Cash  

The Company maintains its cash primarily in institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). At 

times, the Company’s cash balance may be in amounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limits.  

Restricted Cash  

The Company is required by its insurers to collateralize a part of the deductibles for its workers’ compensation and liability 

claims. The Company has chosen to satisfy these collateral requirements primarily by depositing funds in trusts or by issuing letters of 
credit. All amounts in restricted cash at June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017 represent funds deposited in insurance trusts, and 
$10.3 million and $10.2 million, respectively, represent Level 1 fair value measurements.  

Accounts Receivable  

Accounts receivable are comprised of trade receivables from customers in the ordinary course of business, are recorded at the 
invoiced amount, and primarily do not bear interest. Accounts receivable also includes other receivables primarily related to various 
rebate and promotional incentives with the Company’s suppliers. Receivables are recorded net of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on a 
combination of factors. The Company regularly analyzes its significant customer accounts, and when it becomes aware of a specific 
customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, such as bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s 
operating results or financial position, the Company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the 
amount it reasonably believes is collectible. The Company also records reserves for bad debt for other customers based on a variety of 
factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, macroeconomic considerations, and historical experience. If 
circumstances related to specific customers change, the Company’s estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further 
adjusted. As of June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017, the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables was approximately 
$11.5 million and $11.0 million, respectively, and $7.8 million and $6.0 million, respectively related to other receivables. The 
Company recorded $12.1 million, $6.0 million, and $7.5 million in provision for doubtful accounts in fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, and 
fiscal 2016, respectively.  

Inventories  

The Company’s inventories consist primarily of food and non-food products. The Company values inventories primarily at the 
lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. At June 30, 2018, the Company’s inventory balance of $1,051.9 
million consists primarily of finished goods, $954.8 million of which was valued at FIFO. As of June 30, 2018, $97.1 million of the 
inventory balance was valued at last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) using the link chain technique of the dollar value method. At June 30, 2018 
and July 1, 2017, the LIFO balance sheet reserves were $6.9 million and $6.6 million, respectively. Costs in inventory include the 
purchase price of the product and freight charges to deliver the product to the Company’s warehouses and are net of certain 
consideration received from vendors in the amount of $24.3 million and $22.9 million as of June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017, 
respectively. The Company adjusts its inventory balances for slow-moving, excess, and obsolete inventories. These adjustments are 
based upon inventory category, inventory age, specifically identified items, and overall economic conditions. As of June 30, 2018 and 
July 1, 2017, the Company had adjusted its inventories by approximately $4.0 million and $4.5 million, respectively.

Property, Plant, and Equipment  

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment, including capital lease assets, is 
calculated primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from two to 39 years, and 
is included primarily in operating expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.  

Certain internal and external costs related to the development of internal use software are capitalized within property, plant, and 

equipment during the application development stage.  

When assets are retired or otherwise disposed, the costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts. 

The difference between the net book value of the asset and proceeds from disposition is recognized as a gain or loss. Routine 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, while costs of betterments and renewals are capitalized.  

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  

Long-lived assets held and used by the Company, including intangible assets with definite lives, are tested for recoverability 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of 
evaluating the recoverability of long-lived assets, the Company compares the carrying value of the asset or asset group to the 
projected, undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the long-lived asset or asset group. Based on the Company’s 
assessments, no impairment losses were recorded in fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, or fiscal 2016.  

Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Assets  

The Company accounts for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. The Company’s financial 

statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. Goodwill and other intangible 
assets represent the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts specifically assigned to those tangible net assets acquired in 
a business combination. Other identifiable intangible assets typically include customer relationships, trade names, technology, non-
compete agreements, and favorable lease assets. Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized. Intangibles with 
definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which generally range from two to eleven years. Annually, 
or when certain triggering events occur, the Company assesses the useful lives of its intangibles with definite lives. Certain 
assumptions, estimates, and judgments are used in determining the fair value of net assets acquired, including goodwill and other 
intangible assets, as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the reporting units. Accordingly, the Company may obtain the 
assistance of third-party valuation specialists for the valuation of significant tangible and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are 
based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but that are 
inherently uncertain. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace 
participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), economic 
barriers to entry, a brand’s relative market position, and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or 
macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.  

The Company is required to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, or more 

often if circumstances indicate. Indicators of goodwill impairment include, but are not limited to, significant declines in the markets 
and industries that buy the Company’s products, changes in the estimated future cash flows of its reporting units, changes in capital 
markets, and changes in its market capitalization. For goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company’s policy is to 
assess impairment at the end of each fiscal year.  

The Company applies the guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 
2011-08 “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Testing Goodwill for Impairment,” which provides entities with an option to perform a 
qualitative assessment (commonly referred to as “step zero”) to determine whether further quantitative analysis for impairment of 
goodwill is necessary. In performing step zero for the Company’s goodwill impairment test, the Company is required to make 
assumptions and judgments including but not limited to the following: the evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as related to the 
Company’s business, industry and market trends, and the overall future financial performance of its reporting units and future 
opportunities in the markets in which they operate. If impairment indicators are present after performing step zero, the Company 
would perform a quantitative impairment analysis to estimate the fair value of goodwill.  

During fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, the Company performed the step zero analysis for its goodwill impairment test. As a result 

of the Company’s step zero analysis, no further quantitative impairment test was deemed necessary for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017. 
There were no impairments of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives for fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, or fiscal 2016.

Insurance Program  

The Company maintains high-deductible insurance programs covering portions of general and vehicle liability and workers’ 

compensation. The amounts in excess of the deductibles are fully insured by third-party insurance carriers and subject to certain 
limitations and exclusions. The Company also maintains self-funded group medical insurance. The Company accrues its estimated 
liability for these deductibles, including an estimate for incurred but not reported claims, based on known claims and past claims 
history. The estimated short-term portion of these accruals is included in Accrued expenses on the Company’s consolidated balance 
sheets, while the estimated long-term portion of the accruals is included in Other long-term liabilities. The provisions for insurance 
claims include estimates of the frequency and timing of claims occurrence, as well as the ultimate amounts to be paid. These insurance 
programs are managed by a third party, and the deductibles for general and vehicle liability and workers compensation are primarily 
collateralized by letters of credit and restricted cash.  

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (“OCI”)  

Other comprehensive income (loss) is defined as all changes in equity during each period except for those resulting from net 
income (loss) and investments by or distributions to shareholders. Other comprehensive income (loss) consists primarily of gains or 
losses from derivative financial instruments that are designated in a hedging relationship. For derivative instruments that qualify as 
cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other 
comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings during the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects 
earnings.  

Revenue Recognition  

The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of a product when it is considered realized or realizable and earned. The 
Company determines these requirements to be met when the product has been delivered to the customer, the price is fixed and 
determinable, and there is reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds. The Company grants certain customers sales 
incentives such as rebates or discounts and treats these as a reduction of sales at the time the sale is recognized. The Company 
recognizes revenues net of applicable sales tax. Sales returns are recorded as reductions of sales.  

Revenue is accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 605-45, “Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an 

Agent” (“ASC 605-45”), which addresses reporting revenue either on a gross basis as a principal or a net basis as an agent depending 
upon the nature of the sales transactions. The Company recognizes revenue on a gross basis when the Company determines the sale 
meets the conditions of ASC 605-45. The Company weighs the following factors in making its determination:  

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

who is the primary obligor to provide the product or services desired by our customers;  
who has discretion in supplier selection;  
who has latitude in establishing price;  
who retains credit risk; and  
who bears inventory risk.  

When the Company determines that it does not meet the criteria for gross revenue recognition under ASC 605-45 on the basis of 

these factors, the Company reports the revenue on a net basis. When there is a change to an agreement with a customer or vendor, 
pursuant to the Company’s revenue recognition policy, the Company reevaluates the reporting of the revenue based on the factors 
outlined above to determine if there has been a change in the Company’s relationship in acting as the principal or an agent.  

Cost of Goods Sold  

Cost of goods sold includes amounts paid to manufacturers for products sold, the cost of transportation necessary to bring the 

products to the Company’s facilities, plus depreciation related to processing facilities and equipment.  

Operating Expenses  

Operating expenses include warehouse, delivery, occupancy, insurance, depreciation, amortization, salaries and wages, and 

employee benefits expenses.

Vendor Rebates and Other Promotional Incentives  

The Company participates in various rebate and promotional incentives with its suppliers, primarily including volume and 

growth rebates, annual and multi-year incentives, and promotional programs. Consideration received under these incentives is 
generally recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold. However, as described below, in certain limited circumstances the 
consideration is recorded as a reduction of operating expenses incurred by the Company. Consideration received may be in the form of 
cash and/or invoice deductions. Changes in the estimated amount of incentives to be received are treated as changes in estimates and 
are recognized in the period of change.  

Consideration received for incentives that contain volume and growth rebates and annual and multi-year incentives are recorded 

as a reduction of cost of goods sold. The Company systematically and rationally allocates the consideration for these incentives to 
each of the underlying transactions that results in progress by the Company toward earning the incentives. If the incentives are not 
probable and reasonably estimable, the Company records the incentives as the underlying objectives or milestones are achieved. The 
Company records annual and multi-year incentives when earned, generally over the agreement period. The Company uses current and 
historical purchasing data, forecasted purchasing volumes, and other factors in estimating whether the underlying objectives or 
milestones will be achieved. Consideration received to promote and sell the supplier’s products is typically a reimbursement of 
marketing costs incurred by the Company and is recorded as a reduction of the Company’s operating expenses. If the amount of 
consideration received from the suppliers exceeds the Company’s marketing costs, any excess is recorded as a reduction of cost of 
goods sold. The Company follows the requirements of FASB ASC 605-50-25-10, Revenue Recognition—Customer Payments and 
Incentives—Recognition—Customer’s Accounting for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor and ASC 605-50-45-16, 
Revenue Recognition—Customer Payments and Incentives—Other Presentation Matters—Reseller’s Characterization of Sales 
Incentives Offered to Customers by Manufacturers.  

Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs  

Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in net sales. Estimated shipping and handling costs incurred by the 

Company of $884.5 million, $807.7 million, and $752.0 million are recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of 
operations for fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2016, respectively.  

Stock-Based Compensation  

The Company participates in the Performance Food Group Company 2007 Management Option Plan (the “2007 Option Plan”) 

and the Performance Food Group Company 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2015 Incentive Plan”) and follows the fair value 
recognition provisions of FASB ASC 718-10-25, Compensation—Stock Compensation—Overall—Recognition. This guidance 
requires that all stock-based compensation be recognized as an expense in the financial statements. The Company recognizes expense 
for its stock-based compensation based on the fair value of the awards that are granted. The Company estimates the fair value of 
service-based options using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of service-based restricted stock, restricted stock 
with performance conditions and restricted stock units are based on the Company’s stock price on the date of grant. The Company 
estimates the fair value of options and restricted stock with market conditions using a Monte Carlo simulation. Compensation cost is 
recognized ratably over the requisite service period. For those options and restricted stock that have a performance condition, 
compensation expense is based upon the number of option or shares, as applicable, expected to vest after assessing the probability that 
the performance criteria will be met. The Company has made a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur.  

Income Taxes  

The Company follows FASB ASC 740-10, Income Taxes—Overall, which requires the use of the asset and liability method of 
accounting for deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of 
temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Future tax benefits, including net 
operating loss carry-forwards, are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Uncertain tax 
positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax 
audits, developments in case law, and closings of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as 
appropriate.  

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  

As required by FASB ASC 815-20, Derivatives and Hedging—Hedging—General, the Company records all derivatives on the 
balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, 
whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting, and whether the 
hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. The Company primarily uses derivative contracts 

59 

59

PFG_10K_2018_FINAL_96pages.indd   59

8/28/18   11:59 AM

 
to manage the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows. A portion of these derivatives is designated and qualify as cash 
flow hedges. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging 
instrument with the recognition of the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. The Company may 
enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risks, even though hedge accounting does not 
apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting under FASB ASC 815-20. In the event that the Company does not apply 
the provisions of hedge accounting, the derivative instruments are recorded as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
at fair value, and any changes in fair value are recorded as unrealized gains or losses and included in Other expense in the 
accompanying consolidated statement of operations. See Note 9 Derivatives and Hedging Activities for additional information on the 
Company’s use of derivative instruments.  

The Company discloses derivative instruments and hedging activities in accordance with FASB ASC 815-10-50, Derivatives 
and Hedging—Overall—Disclosure. FASB ASC 815-10-50 sets forth the disclosure requirements with the intent to provide users of 
financial statements with an enhanced understanding of: (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative 
instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under FASB ASC 815-20, and (c) how derivative instruments and related 
hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. FASB ASC 815-10-50 requires qualitative 
disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about the fair value of and gains and losses 
on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative instruments.  

Fair Value Measurements  

Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in 

an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The accounting guidance establishes a fair value 
hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are 
as follows:  

• 

• 

• 

Level 1—Observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;  
Level 2—Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly for 
substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and  
Level 3—Unobservable inputs in which there are little or no market data, which include management’s own assumption 
about the risk assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.  

The Company’s derivative instruments are carried at fair value and are evaluated in accordance with this hierarchy.  

Contingent Liabilities  

The Company records a liability related to contingencies when a loss is considered to be probable and a reasonable estimate of 

the loss can be made. This estimate would include legal fees, if applicable.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. This ASU 

requires an entity to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. When evidence exists that the net realizable 
value of inventory is lower than its cost, the difference shall be recognized as a loss in earnings in the period in which it occurs. The 
ASU is effective for public companies prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods 
within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this ASU as of the beginning of fiscal 2018 and concluded that it did not have a 
material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts 

and Cash Payments. This ASU addresses the classification of certain specific cash flow issues including debt prepayment or 
extinguishment costs, settlement of certain debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, 
proceeds from the settlement of certain insurance claims, and distributions received from equity method investees. This ASU is 
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption 
permitted. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period using the retrospective transition 
method. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2016-15 as of the beginning of fiscal 2018. Based on our review of the ASU, the 
Company concluded that it has historically classified the specified cash receipts and cash payments in accordance with the clarified 
guidance. This ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. This ASU requires 

that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally 
described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash 
equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total 
amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim 
periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The ASU requires a retrospective transition method for each period 
presented. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2016-18 as of the beginning of fiscal 2018. The statements of cash flows for 
the fiscal years ended July 1, 2017 and July 2, 2016 include restricted cash with cash when reconciling the beginning-of-period and 
end-of-period total amounts. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-18, cash payments of $7.3 million in fiscal 2016 related to 
insurance claims paid using restricted cash is classified as a change in Accrued expenses and other liabilities within Net cash provided 
by operating activities. 

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for 

Goodwill Impairment. This ASU eliminates Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which is performed by estimating the fair value of 
individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill. Instead, an entity will record a 
goodwill impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying value over its estimated fair value, not to exceed the 
carrying amount of goodwill. This ASU is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after 
December 15, 2019 and should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2017-
04 as of the beginning of fiscal 2018. Upon adoption of the ASU, the Company concluded that it did not have a material impact on its 
consolidated financial statements. The Company will apply ASU 2017-04 on a prospective basis when analyzing goodwill 
impairment.  

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): 

Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The ASU amends ASC 220, “Income 
Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income,” to allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained 
earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Act. In addition, under the ASU, an entity will be required to provide certain 
disclosures regarding stranded tax effects. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim 
periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2018-02 in the fourth 
quarter of fiscal 2018 on a prospective basis. This ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial 
statements.  

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted  

 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and has issued subsequent 

amendments to this guidance. This ASU is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize 
revenue that represents the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects 
to receive in exchange for those goods or services.  

 

The Company adopted this standard at the beginning of fiscal year 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. The 

Company has completed its analysis of the new standard and determined that the Company’s customer contracts include one 
performance obligation which is satisfied once the products are delivered to the customer. Revenue will be recognized at the point in 
time in which the Company transfers control of the products to the customer. This is consistent with the Company’s current practice of 
recognizing revenue upon delivery to the customer. For the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company will be required to make 
enhanced revenue disclosures, which will include relevant information about contracts with customers, disaggregated revenues, 
performance obligations and other items requiring significant judgments and estimates used to recognize revenue. The Company has 
revised its relevant policies and procedures, as applicable, to meet the new accounting, reporting and disclosure requirements of Topic 
606 and has updated internal controls accordingly. 

 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The ASU is a comprehensive new lease accounting 

model that requires companies to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about 
leasing arrangements. As part of the implementation of this new standard, the Company is in the process of reviewing current 
accounting policies and assessing the practical expedients allowed under this new guidance. The Company is currently evaluating the 
impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements, as well as on its systems, processes, and 
controls to properly account for its leases. The Company is in the process of identifying the complete population of leases affected and 
determining and gathering all the necessary information required to calculate the lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. In addition 
the Company is in the process of implementing software to assist with future reporting. For public entities, the ASU is effective for 
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company will adopt the 
guidance in fiscal 2020. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, which provided 
companies with an additional (and optional) transition method to adopt the new lease standard. Under this new transition method 

61 

61

PFG_10K_2018_FINAL_96pages.indd   61

8/28/18   11:59 AM

 
companies would apply the new lease standard at the date of adoption and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening 
balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. ASC 842, as originally issued, required companies to use a modified 
retrospective transition approach as of the beginning of the earliest comparable period presented in a company’s financial statements. 
The Company is in the process of determining which transition method to apply. The Company believes adoption of this standard will 
have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Information about our undiscounted future lease payments and the 
timing of those payments is in Note 12. Leases in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”).  

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit 

Losses on Financial Instruments. The pronouncement changes the impairment model for most financial assets and will require the use 
of an “expected loss” model for instruments measured at amortized cost. Under this model, entities will be required to estimate the 
lifetime expected credit loss on such instruments and record an allowance to offset the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, 
resulting in a net presentation of the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. This pronouncement is effective for fiscal 
years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company plans to adopt the new 
standard in fiscal 2021. Companies are required to apply the standard using a modified retrospective approach, with a cumulative-
effect adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings on the effective date. The Company is in the process of evaluating the 
impact of this ASU on our future consolidated financial statements.  

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. 

This ASU clarifies the definition of a business in order to assist companies in the evaluation of whether transactions should be 
accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The amended guidance also removes the existing evaluation of a 
market participant’s ability to replace missing elements and narrows the definition of output to achieve consistency with other 
topics. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years 
and should be applied on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material 
impact on the Company’s financial statements at the date of adoption.  

 
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting 

for Hedging Activities. This ASU expands hedge accounting for both financial and non-financial risk components to better align hedge 
accounting with a company’s risk management strategies, simplify the application of hedge accounting, and increase transparency as 
to the scope and results of hedging programs. It also amends the presentation and disclosure requirements and changes how companies 
assess effectiveness. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal 
years, with early adoption permitted. For cash flow hedges existing at the adoption date, the standard requires adoption on a modified 
retrospective basis with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the beginning of the year of adoption. 
The amendments to presentation guidance and disclosure requirements are required to be adopted prospectively. The Company elected 
to early adopt ASU 2017-12 as of the beginning of fiscal 2019. Upon adoption of the ASU, the Company concluded that it did not 
have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts 
receivable. The Company’s customer base includes a large number of individual restaurants, national and regional chain restaurants, 
and franchises and other institutional customers. The credit risk associated with accounts receivable is minimized by the Company’s 
large customer base and ongoing monitoring of customer creditworthiness.

PFGC, Inc. (“PFGC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a party to the Second Amended and Restated Credit 

Agreement dated February 1, 2016, as amended by the First Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated 
August 3, 2017 (the “ABL Facility”).  The ABL Facility has an aggregate principal amount of $1.95 billion and matures February 
2021. The ABL Facility is secured by the majority of the tangible assets of PFGC and its subsidiaries. Performance Food Group, Inc., 
a wholly-owned subsidiary of PFGC, is the lead borrower under the ABL Facility, which is jointly and severally guaranteed by PFGC 
and all material domestic direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of PFGC (other than captive insurance subsidiaries and other 
excluded subsidiaries). Availability for loans and letters of credit under the ABL Facility is governed by a borrowing base, determined 
by the application of specified advance rates against eligible assets, including trade accounts receivable, inventory, owned real 
properties, and owned transportation equipment. The borrowing base is reduced quarterly by a cumulative fraction of the real

properties and transportation equipment values. Advances on accounts receivable and inventory are subject to change based on 
periodic commercial finance examinations and appraisals, and the real property and transportation equipment values included in the 
borrowing base are subject to change based on periodic appraisals. Audits and appraisals are conducted at the direction of the 
administrative agent for the benefit and on behalf of all lenders.  

Borrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest, at Performance Food Group, Inc.’s option, at (a) the Base Rate (defined as the 
greater of (i) the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such date plus 0.5%, (ii) the Prime Rate on such day, or (iii) one month LIBOR plus 
1.0%) plus a spread or (b) LIBOR plus a spread. The ABL Facility also provides for an unused commitment fee ranging from 0.25% 
to 0.375%.

The ABL Facility contains covenants requiring the maintenance of a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio if 
excess availability falls below the greater of (i) $160.0 million and (ii) 10% of the lesser of the borrowing base and the revolving 
credit facility amount for five consecutive business days. The ABL Facility also contains customary restrictive covenants that include, 
but are not limited to, restrictions on PFGC’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, create liens, make investments or 
specified payments, and dispose of assets. The ABL Facility provides for customary events of default, including payment defaults and 
cross-defaults on other material indebtedness. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, amounts due under such agreement may 
be accelerated and the rights and remedies of the lenders under the ABL Facility may be exercised, including rights with respect to the 
collateral securing the obligations under such agreement.  

Senior Notes  

On May 17, 2016, Performance Food Group, Inc. issued and sold $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.500% 

Senior Notes due 2024 (the “Notes”), pursuant to an indenture dated as of May 17, 2016. The Notes are jointly and severally 
guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by PFGC and all domestic direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of PFGC (other than 
captive insurance subsidiaries and other excluded subsidiaries). The Notes are not guaranteed by Performance Food Group Company.  

The proceeds from the Notes were used to pay in full the remaining outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Term Facility 
and to terminate the facility; to temporarily repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility; and to pay the fees, 
expenses, and other transaction costs incurred in connection with the Notes.  

The Notes were issued at 100.0% of their par value. The Notes mature on June 1, 2024 and bear interest at a rate of 5.500% per 

year, payable semi-annually in arrears.  

Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event or upon the sale of certain assets in which Performance Food 

Group, Inc. does not apply the proceeds as required, the holders of the Notes will have the right to require Performance Food Group, 
Inc. to repurchase each holder’s Notes at a price equal to 101% (in the case of a change of control triggering event) or 100% (in the 
case of an asset sale) of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Performance Food Group, Inc. may redeem all or a 
part of the Notes at any time prior to June 1, 2019 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being 
redeemed plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. In addition, 
beginning on June 1, 2019, Performance Food Group, Inc. may redeem all or a part of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 
102.750% of the principal amount redeemed. The redemption price decreases to 101.325% and 100.000% of the principal amount 
redeemed on June 1, 2020 and June 1, 2021, respectively. In addition, at any time prior to June 1, 2019, Performance Food Group, Inc. 
may redeem up to 40% of the Notes from the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 105.500% of the 
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  

The indenture governing the Notes contains covenants limiting, among other things, PFGC and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability 

to incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock; pay dividends and make other distributions on, or 
redeem or repurchase, capital stock; make certain investments; incur certain liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; consolidate, 
merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets; create certain restrictions on the ability of PFGC’s restricted

subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to PFGC; designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and transfer 
or sell certain assets. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. The Notes also contain 
customary events of default, the occurrence of which could result in the principal of and accrued interest on the Notes to become or be 
declared due and payable.  
 

The ABL Facility and the indenture governing the Notes contain customary restrictive covenants under which all of the net 

assets of PFGC and its subsidiaries were restricted from distribution to Performance Food Group Company, except for approximately 
$486.0 million of restricted payment capacity available under such debt agreements, as of June 30, 2018. Such minimum estimated 
restricted payment capacity is calculated based on the most restrictive of our debt agreements and may fluctuate from period to period, 
which fluctuations may be material.  Our restricted payment capacity under other debt instruments to which the Company is subject 
may be materially higher than the foregoing estimate. 

Term Facility  

In fiscal 2016, the Company used the proceeds from its IPO, borrowings under the ABL Facility, and a portion of the proceeds 

from the Notes issuance to repay the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Term Facility and to terminate the facility. As a 
result of these payments, a $9.4 million loss on extinguishment and $5.5 million of accelerated amortization of original issuance 
discount and deferred financing costs was recorded in fiscal 2016.  

Unsecured Subordinated Promissory Note 

 
In connection with an acquisition, Performance Food Group, Inc. issued a $6.0 million interest only, unsecured subordinated 

promissory note on December 21, 2012. The $6.0 million promissory note was paid off in December 2017.

Capital and Finance Lease Obligations  

Performance Food Group, Inc. is a party to facility leases at two Performance Foodservice distribution facilities and several 

equipment leases that are accounted for as capital leases in accordance with FASB ASC 840-30, Leases—Capital Leases. The charge 
to income resulting from amortization of these leases is included with depreciation expense in the consolidated statement of 
operations. The gross and net book values of assets under capital leases on the balance sheet as of June 30, 2018 were $84.9 million 
and $52.3 million, respectively. The gross and net book values of assets under capital leases on the balance sheet as of July 1, 2017 
were $69.7 million and $41.8 million, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable capital lease obligations 
were as follows as of June 30, 2018:

During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, Performance Food Group, Inc. sold and simultaneously leased back a Vistar distribution 
facility for a period of two years. As a result of continuing involvement with the property, this transaction did not meet the criteria to 
qualify as a sale-leaseback. In accordance with FASB ASC 840-40, Leases—Sale Leaseback Transactions, the building and related 
assets subject to the lease continued to be reflected on the Company’s balance sheet and depreciated over their remaining useful lives. 
The proceeds received from the sale of the building were recorded as financing lease obligations. This lease ended during fiscal 2017, 
and, as a result, the net book value of the assets subject to the lease and the corresponding financing obligation was reversed.  

9.   Derivatives and Hedging Activities  
Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives  

The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company 

principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business 
activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, 
sources, and duration of its debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company enters into 
derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future 
known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates and diesel fuel costs. The Company’s 
derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company’s known or 
expected cash receipts and payments related to the Company’s borrowings and diesel fuel purchases.  

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are both designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is 

recorded in other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged transaction occurs. 
The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings.  

Hedges of Interest Rate Risk  

The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to 

interest rate movements. Since the Company has a substantial portion of its debt in variable-rate instruments, it accomplishes this 
objective with interest rate swaps. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts 
from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the 
underlying notional amount. All of the Company’s interest rate swaps are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges.

As interest payments are made on the Company’s variable rate debt, amounts are reclassified from Accumulated other 

comprehensive income to Interest expense. The Company recorded a loss of $0.1 million, a gain of $1.5 million, and a loss of $0.5 
million related to ineffectiveness on interest rate swaps during the fiscal years ended 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. During the 
twelve months ending June 29, 2019, the Company estimates that gains of approximately $4.1 million will be reclassified to interest 
expense.  

Hedges of Forecasted Diesel Fuel Purchases  

From time to time, Performance Food Group, Inc. enters into costless collar arrangements to manage its exposure to variability 
in cash flows expected to be paid for its forecasted purchases of diesel fuel. As of June 30, 2018, Performance Food Group, Inc. was a 
party to three such arrangements, with an aggregate 4.5 million gallon original notional amount. The 4.5 million gallon forecasted 
purchases of diesel fuel are expected to be made between July 1, 2018 and December 31, 2018.  

The fuel collar instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Accordingly, the derivative instruments are recorded as an asset 

or liability on the balance sheet at fair value and any changes in fair value are recorded in the period of change as unrealized gains or 
losses on fuel hedging instruments and included in Other, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

The Company does not currently have a payable or receivable related to cash collateral for its derivatives, and therefore it has 

not established an accounting policy for offsetting the fair value of its derivatives against such balances. The table below presents the

All of the Company’s derivative contracts are subject to a master netting arrangement with the respective counterparties that 
provide for the net settlement of all derivative contracts in the event of default or upon the occurrence of certain termination events. 
Upon exercise of termination rights by the non-defaulting party (i) all transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are valued and 
the positive value or “in the money” transactions are netted against the negative value or “out of the money” transactions, and (iii) the 
only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount.  

 

The Company has elected to present the derivative assets and derivative liabilities on the balance sheet on a gross basis for periods

The derivative instruments are the only assets or liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The fuel collars 

are exchange-traded commodities and their fair value is derived from valuation models based on certain assumptions regarding market 
conditions, some of which may be unobservable. Based on the lack of significance of these unobservable inputs, the Company has 
concluded that these instruments represent Level 2 on the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of the Company’s interest rate swap 
agreements are determined using a valuation model with several inputs and assumptions, some of which may be unobservable. A 
specific unobservable input used by the Company in determining the fair value of its interest rate swaps is an estimation of both the 
unsecured borrowing spread to LIBOR for the Company as well as that of the derivative counterparties. Based on the lack of 
significance of this estimated spread component to the overall value of the Company’s interest rate swaps, the Company has 
concluded that these swaps represent Level 2 on the hierarchy.  

There have been no transfers between levels in the hierarchy from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018.  

Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features  

The Company has agreements with each of its derivative counterparties that provide that if the Company either defaults or is 

capable of being declared in default on any of its indebtedness, the Company can also be declared in default on its derivative 
obligations.  

As of June 30, 2018, the aggregate fair value amount of all derivative instruments that contain contingent features were in a net 

asset position. 

10. 

Insurance Program Liabilities  
The Company maintains high-deductible insurance programs covering portions of general and vehicle liability, workers’ 
compensation, and group medical insurance. The amounts in excess of the deductibles are fully insured by third-party insurance 
carriers, subject to certain limitations. A summary of the activity in all types of deductible liabilities appears below:

11.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The carrying values of cash, accounts receivable, outstanding checks in excess of deposits, trade accounts payable, and accrued 

expenses approximate their fair values because of the relatively short maturities of those instruments. The derivative assets and 
liabilities are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet. The fair value of long-term debt, which has a carrying value of $1,123.0 
million and $1,247.7 million, is $1,126.7 million and $1,258.3 million at June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017, respectively, and is 
determined by reviewing current market pricing related to comparable debt issued at the time of the balance sheet date, and is 
considered a Level 2 measurement.

12.  Leases  

Subsidiaries of the Company lease various warehouse and office facilities and certain equipment under long-term operating 

lease agreements that expire at various dates. Rent expense for operating leases includes any rent increases, rent holidays, or landlord 
concessions on a straight-line basis over the lease term. As of June 30, 2018, subsidiaries of the Company are obligated under non-
cancelable operating lease agreements to make future minimum lease payments as follows:

Rent expense for operating leases was $119.9 million for fiscal 2018, $115.7 million for fiscal 2017, and $105.7 million for 

fiscal 2016. A subsidiary of the Company has posted letters of credit as collateral supporting certain leases. These letters of credit are 
included in the total outstanding letters of credit under the ABL Facility as discussed in Note 8, Debt.  

Subsidiaries of the Company have residual value guarantees to their lessors under certain of their operating leases. These 

guarantees are discussed in Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies. These residual value guarantees are not included in the above 
table of future minimum lease payments.  

A subsidiary of the Company is a party to several capital leases. See Note 8, Debt for discussion of these leases.

The determination of the Company’s overall effective tax rate requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the 

interpretation and application of complex tax laws.  The effective tax rate reflects the income earned and taxed in various United 
States federal and state jurisdictions. Tax law changes, increases and decreases in temporary and permanent differences between book 
and tax items, tax credits, and the Company’s change in income in each jurisdiction all affect the overall effective tax rate. It is the 
Company’s practice to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.  

On December 22, 2017, the Act was signed into law. The Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue 

Code including, but not limited to: reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; creating a new limitation on 
deductible interest expense; repealing the domestic production activity deduction; providing for bonus depreciation that will allow for 
full expensing of certain qualified property; and limiting other deductions.  

The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (“SAB 118”), which provides 

guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year 

71 

71

8/28/18   11:59 AM

 
from the Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). In 
accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Act for which the accounting under 
ASC 740 is complete.  To the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act is incomplete but it is able 
to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. If a company cannot determine a 
provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of 
the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the Act. The Company has not identified any items for which the 
income tax effects of the Act have not been substantially completed. 
 

The Company’s effective income tax rate for continuing operations for fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 was (2.6)%, 

39.0%, and 40.3%, respectively. As a result of the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35% under the Act, 
the Company has a blended federal statutory rate of 28% for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018.  Actual income tax (benefit) 
expense differs from the amount computed by applying the applicable U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate of 28% in fiscal 
2018 and 35% in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 to earnings before income taxes as follows:

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, performance vesting criteria for certain stock-based compensation awards was met 

resulting in a significant permanent tax deduction difference. The impact to the provision for stock-based compensation and the

The state net operating loss carry-forwards expire in fiscal years 2018 through 2037. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, 

the Company established a valuation allowance of $0.4 million, net of federal tax benefit, against deferred tax assets related to certain 
net operating losses which are not likely to be realized due to limitations on utilization.  

The Company records a liability for Uncertain Tax Positions in accordance with FASB ASC 740-10-25, Income Taxes—

General—Recognition. The following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits:

Included in the balance as of June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017, is $1.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax 
benefits that could affect the effective tax rate for continuing operations. The balance in unrecognized tax benefits relates primarily to 
transfer pricing and state tax issues.

As of June 30, 2018, substantially all federal, state and local, and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years 

through fiscal 2014.  The Company does not anticipate that changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve 
months will have a significant impact on its results of operations or financial position. 

It is the Company’s practice to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. 

Approximately $0.2 million and $0.1 million was accrued for interest related to uncertain tax positions as of June 30, 2018 and July 1, 
2017, respectively. Net interest expense of less than $0.1 million was recognized in tax expense for fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 
2016.   

14.  Retirement Plans  
Employee Savings Plans  

The Company sponsors the Performance Food Group Employee Savings Plan (the “PFG Savings Plan”). The PFG Savings Plan 
consists of two components: a defined contribution plan covering substantially all employees (the “401(k) Plan”) and a profit sharing 
plan. Under the latter, the Company can make a discretionary contribution in a given year, although there is no requirement to do so, 
and no such contribution was made in fiscal years 2018 or 2017. As of January 1, 2009, the 401(k) plan merged with the Self-Directed 
Tax Advantaged Retirement (STAR) Plan of PFGC, Inc. (the “STAR Plan”). Employees participating in the 401(k) Plan may elect to 
contribute between 1% and 50% of their qualified compensation, up to a maximum dollar amount as specified by the provisions of the 
Internal Revenue Code. The Company matched 100% of the first 3.5% of the employee contributions, resulting in matching 
contributions of $17.9 million for fiscal 2018, $16.5 million for fiscal 2017, and $16.0 million for fiscal 2016. Associates that were 
eligible for the annual STAR Plan contribution (an annual amount based on the employee’s salary and years of service) as of 
December 31, 2008 remained eligible to receive STAR Plan contributions under the merged PFG Savings Plan. STAR Plan 
contributions made by the Company were $3.9 million for fiscal 2018, $3.9 million for fiscal 2017, and $4.2 million for fiscal 2016.  

15.  Commitments and Contingencies  
Purchase Obligations  

The Company had outstanding contracts and purchase orders for capital projects and services totaling $26.4 million at June 30, 

2018. Amounts due under these contracts were not included on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2018.  

Withdrawn Multiemployer Pension Plans  

Until May 2013, Performance Food Group, Inc. participated in the Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund 
(“Central States Pension Fund”), a multiemployer pension plan administered by the Teamsters Union, pursuant to which Performance 
Food Group, Inc. was required to make contributions on behalf of certain union employees. The Central States Pension Fund is 
underfunded and is in critical status as determined by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. In connection with a renegotiation of 
the collective bargaining agreement that had previously required the Company’s participation in the Central States Pension Fund, the 
Company negotiated the termination of its participation in the Central States Pension Fund and the Company has withdrawn. As of 
June 30, 2018, the outstanding withdrawal liability totaled $5.1 million.  

Guarantees  

Subsidiaries of the Company have entered into numerous operating leases, including leases of buildings, equipment, tractors, 
and trailers. Certain of the leases for tractors, trailers, and other vehicles and equipment, provide for residual value guarantees to the 
lessors. Circumstances that would require the subsidiary to perform under the guarantees include either (1) default on the leases with 
the leased assets being sold for less than the specified residual values in the lease agreements, or (2) decisions not to purchase the 
assets at the end of the lease terms combined with the sale of the assets, with sales proceeds less than the residual value of the leased 
assets specified in the lease agreements. Residual value guarantees under these operating lease agreements typically range between 7% 
and 20% of the value of the leased assets at inception of the lease. These leases have original terms ranging from 4 to 8 years and 
expiration dates ranging from 2018 to 2025. As of June 30, 2018, the undiscounted maximum amount of potential future payments for 
lease guarantees totaled approximately $26.1 million, which would be mitigated by the fair value of the leased assets at lease 
expiration. The assessment as to whether it is probable that subsidiaries of the Company will be required to make payments under the 
terms of the guarantees is based upon their actual and expected loss experience. Consistent with the requirements of FASB ASC 460-
10-50, Guarantees-Overall-Disclosure, the Company has recorded $0.3 million of the potential future guarantee payments on its 
consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2018.  

The Company participates in a purchasing alliance that was formed to obtain better pricing, to expand product options, to reduce 

internal costs, and to achieve greater inventory turnover. The Company has entered into an agreement to guarantee a portion of the 

74 

74

PFG_10K_2018_FINAL_96pages.indd   74

8/28/18   11:59 AM

 
trade payables for such purchasing alliance to their various suppliers as an inducement for these suppliers to extend additional trade 
credit to the purchasing alliance. In the event of default by the purchasing alliance of their respective trade payables obligations, these 
suppliers may proceed directly against the Company to collect their trade payables. The terms of this guarantee have an expiration 
date of June 30, 2019. As of June 30, 2018, the undiscounted maximum amount of potential payments covered by this guarantee 
totaled $4.0 million. The Company believes that the likelihood of payment under this guarantee is remote and that any fair value 
attributable to this guarantee is immaterial; therefore, no liability has been recorded for this obligation in the Company’s consolidated 
balance sheets.  

In addition, the Company from time to time enters into certain types of contracts that contingently require it to indemnify 

various parties against claims from third parties. These contracts primarily relate to: (i) certain real estate leases under which 
subsidiaries of the Company may be required to indemnify property owners for environmental and other liabilities and other claims 
arising from their use of the applicable premises; (ii) certain agreements with the Company’s officers, directors, and employees under 
which the Company may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their employment relationship; and 
(iii) customer agreements under which the Company may be required to indemnify customers for certain claims brought against them 
with respect to the supplied products.  

Generally, a maximum obligation under these contracts is not explicitly stated. Because the obligated amounts associated with 

these types of agreements are not explicitly stated, the overall maximum amount of the obligation cannot be reasonably estimated. 
Historically, the Company has not been required to make payments under these obligations and, therefore, no liabilities have been 
recorded for these obligations in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.  

Litigation  

The Company is engaged in various legal proceedings that have arisen but have not been fully adjudicated. The likelihood of 

loss arising from these legal proceedings, based on definitions within contingency accounting literature, ranges from remote to 
reasonably possible to probable. When losses are probable and reasonably estimable, they have been accrued. Based on estimates of 
the range of potential losses associated with these matters, management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these 
proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the consolidated financial position or 
results of operations of the Company. However, the final results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and, if the 
Company failed to prevail in one or more of these legal matters, and the associated realized losses were to exceed the Company’s 
current estimates of the range of potential losses, the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations could be 
materially adversely affected in future periods.  

U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Lawsuit. In March 2009, the Baltimore Equal Employment Opportunity 

Commission (“EEOC”) Field Office served us with company-wide (excluding, however, our Vistar and Roma Foodservice 
operations) subpoenas relating to alleged violations of the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (“Title VII”), seeking 
certain information from January 1, 2004 to a specified date in the first fiscal quarter of 2009. In August 2009, the EEOC moved to 
enforce the subpoenas in federal court in Maryland, and we opposed the motion. In February 2010, the court ruled that the subpoena 
related to the Equal Pay Act investigation was enforceable company-wide but on a narrower scope of data than the original subpoena 
sought (the court ruled that the subpoena was applicable to the transportation, logistics, and warehouse functions of our broadline 
distribution centers only and not to our PFG Customized distribution centers). We cooperated with the EEOC on the production of 
information. In September 2011, the EEOC notified us that the EEOC was terminating the investigation into alleged violations of the 
Equal Pay Act. In determinations issued in September 2012 by the EEOC with respect to the charges on which the EEOC had based 
its company-wide investigation, the EEOC concluded that we engaged in a pattern of denying hiring and promotion to a class of 
female applicants and employees into certain positions within the transportation, logistics, and warehouse functions within our 
broadline division in violation of Title VII. In June 2013, the EEOC filed suit in federal court in Baltimore against us. The litigation 
concerns two issues: (1) whether we unlawfully engaged in an ongoing pattern and practice of failing to hire female applicants into 
operations positions; and (2) whether we unlawfully failed to promote one of the three individuals who filed charges with the EEOC 
because of her gender. The EEOC seeks the following relief in the lawsuit: (1) to permanently enjoin us from denying employment to 
female applicants because of their sex and denying promotions to female employees because of their sex; (2) a court order mandating 
that we institute and carry out policies, procedures, practices and programs which provide equal employment opportunities for 
females; (3) back pay with prejudgment interest and compensatory damages for a former female employee and an alleged class of 
aggrieved female applicants; (4) punitive damages; and (5) costs. The court bifurcated the litigation into two phases. In the first phase, 
the jury will decide whether we engaged in a gender-based pattern and practice of discrimination and the individual claims of one 
former employee. If the EEOC prevails on all counts in the first phase, no monetary relief would be awarded, except possibly for the 
single individual’s claims, which would be immaterial. The remaining individual claims would then be tried in the second phase. At 
this stage in the proceedings, the Company cannot estimate either the number of individual trials that could occur in the second phase 
of the litigation or the value of those claims. For these reasons, we are unable to estimate any potential loss or range of loss in the 
event of an adverse finding in the first and second phases of the litigation.

In May 2018, the EEOC filed motions for sanctions against us alleging that we failed to preserve certain paper employment 

applications and e-mails during 2004 – 2009. In the sanctions motions, the EEOC seeks a range of remedies, including but not limited 
to, a default judgment against us, or alternatively, an order barring us from filing for summary judgment on the EEOC’s pattern and 
practice claims. We are opposing the motions and will continue to vigorously defend ourselves.  

Tax Liabilities  

The Company is subject to customary audits by authorities in the jurisdictions where it conducts business in the United States, 

which may result in assessments of additional taxes.  

16.  Related-Party Transactions  
Transaction and Advisory Fee Agreement  

The Company was a party to an advisory fee agreement pursuant to which affiliates of Blackstone and Wellspring provided 

management certain strategic and structuring advice and certain monitoring, advising, and consulting services to the Company. The 
advisory fee agreement provided for the payment by the Company of an annual advisory fee and the reimbursement of out of pocket 
expenses.  The payments made under this agreement totaled $3.0 million, $5.6 million and $5.0 million for fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, 
and fiscal 2016, respectively.  

Under its terms, this agreement terminated on October 6, 2017.  

Other  

The Company participates in and has an equity method investment in a purchasing alliance that was formed to obtain better 

pricing, to expand product options, to reduce internal costs, and to achieve greater inventory turnover. The Company’s investment in 
the purchasing alliance was $4.3 million as of June 30, 2018 and $4.6 million as of July 1, 2017. For fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, and 
fiscal 2016, the Company recorded purchases of $827.9 million, $802.8 million, and $514.8 million, respectively, through the 
purchasing alliance.  

 

17.  Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) 

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-

average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is calculated using the weighted-average number of 
common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. In computing diluted EPS, the average closing 
stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased with the proceeds from the exercise of 
stock options under the treasury stock method. For fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, potential common shares of 0.7 million and 0.6 
million, respectively, were not included in computing diluted earnings per share because the effect would have been antidilutive.  

 

 

A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators for the basic and diluted EPS computations is as follows:

18.  Stock-based Compensation  

Performance Food Group Company provides compensation benefits to employees and non-employee directors under share-

based payment arrangements. These arrangements are designed to promote the long-term growth and profitability of the Company by 
providing employees and consultants who are or will be involved in the Company’s growth with an opportunity to acquire an 
ownership interest in the Company, thereby encouraging them to contribute to and participate in the success of the Company.  

The Performance Food Group Company 2007 Management Option Plan (the “2007 Option Plan”)  

The 2007 Option Plan allowed for the granting of awards to employees, officers, directors, consultants, and advisors of the 

Company or its affiliates in the form of nonqualified options. The terms and conditions of awards granted under the 2007 Option Plan 
were determined by the Board of Directors. The contractual term of the options is ten years.  The Company no longer grants awards 
from this plan.  

Each of the employee awards under the 2007 Option Plan is divided into three equal portions. Tranche I options are subject to 

time vesting. Tranche II and Tranche III options are subject to both time and performance vesting, including performance criteria 
based on the internal rate of return and sponsor cash inflows as outlined in the 2007 Option Plan.  

Because of the existence of the repurchase rights in the 2007 Option Plan, the weighted average service period initially exceeded 
the contractual term of the options. The repurchase option feature of this plan terminated upon the date of our IPO and the Company’s 
management determined that the requisite service period should be reduced from 10.7 years to the 5 year service vesting period. As a 
result, compensation costs of $3.8 million were recorded in fiscal 2016 related to this change for Tranche I awards. 

On July 30, 2015, the Company approved amendments to the 2007 Option Plan to modify the vesting terms of all of the Tranche 

II and Tranche III options granted pursuant to the 2007 Option Plan. Prior to this amendment, the Company’s assessment of the 
performance criteria indicated that satisfaction of the performance criteria was not probable and therefore, no compensation expense 
had been recognized for Tranche II and Tranche III options. The time-based vesting condition did not change and will continue to be 
satisfied with respect to 20% of the shares underlying these options annually, based on the participant’s continued employment with 
the Company. The performance-based vesting condition was reduced to reflect changes in the macro-economic conditions following 
the 2008 recession. In addition, as part of the amendments to the 2007 Option Plan, individuals holding these unvested time and 
performance-vesting options were allowed the right to exercise such options into restricted shares of the Company’s common stock 
and to receive a new grant of time and performance-vesting options. On September 30, 2015, 3.73 million options were exchanged for 
2.27 million restricted shares and 1.46 million new options.  

On December 7, 2017, Wellspring sold all of their remaining interest in shares of the Company’s common stock and the 

Company determined that the performance criteria for the Tranche II and III awards had been met, resulting in the vesting of 2.1 
million shares of restricted stock and 1.4 million options. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recognized approximately 
$6.3 million of accelerated compensation expense in connection with the vesting of the Tranche II and III awards. Based on the 
performance achieved, total compensation expense for the Tranche II and III awards was $24.9 million.                     

No Tranche I options were granted from the 2007 Option Plan in fiscal 2018 and 2017. The Company estimated the fair value of 

the Tranche I time vesting options granted in fiscal 2016 below using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following 
weighted average assumptions:

ended July 2, 2016	

  

1.72 % 
0.00 % 
38.00 % 

6.5   
8.99   

 

The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected holding period. The 
Company assumed a dividend yield of zero percent when valuing the grants in fiscal 2016 under the 2007 Option Plan because the 
Company announced that it did not intend to pay dividends on its common stock. Expected volatility is based on the expected 
volatilities of comparable peer companies that are publicly traded. The expected term represents the period of time that awards granted 
are expected to be outstanding. For grants in fiscal 2016, the Company elected to use the simplified method to estimate the expected 
holding period because we did not have sufficient information to understand post vesting exercise behavior.

The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected holding period. The 
Company assumed a dividend yield of zero percent when valuing the grants in fiscal 2016 under the 2007 Option Plan because the 
Company announced that it does not intend to pay dividends on its common stock. Expected volatility is based on the historical equity 
volatility of comparable peer companies that are publicly traded. This historical equity volatility was un-levered using the company 
specific capital structure of the comparable peer companies and was re-levered using the capital structure of the Company. The 
expected term represents the period of time that awards granted are expected to be outstanding, as determined with the assistance of a 
specialist based on the vesting term and contractual term.  

In total, compensation cost that has been charged against income for the Company’s 2007 Option Plan was $9.5 million, 

$6.7 million and $13.2 million for fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively, and it is included within operating expenses in 
the consolidated statements of operations. The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
was $3.1 million, $2.6 million and $5.1 million for fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. The total unrecognized 
compensation cost for all awards under the 2007 Option Plan is $0.8 million as of June 30, 2018. This cost is expected to be 
recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years.

The Performance Food Group Company 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2015 Incentive Plan”)  

In July 2015, the Company approved the 2015 Incentive Plan. The 2015 Incentive Plan allows for the granting of awards to 

current employees, officers, directors, consultants, and advisors of the Company. The terms and conditions of awards granted under 
the 2015 Option Plan are determined by the Board of Directors. There are 4,850,000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance 
under the 2015 Incentive Plan, including non-qualified stock options and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted 
shares (time-based and performance-based), and other equity based or cash-based awards. As of June 30, 2018, there are 2,024,518 
shares available for grant under the 2015 Incentive Plan. The contractual term of the options granted under the 2015 Incentive Plan is 
ten years.  

Options and time-based restricted shares vest ratably over four years from the date of grant. Performance-based restricted shares 

vest upon the achievement of a specified Return on Invested Capital (“ROIC”), a performance condition, and a specified Relative 
Total Shareholder Return (“Relative TSR”), a market condition, at the end of a three year performance period. Actual shares earned 
range from 0% to 150% of the initial grant, depending upon performance relative to the ROIC and Relative TSR goals.  

The fair values of time-based restricted shares and restricted shares with a performance condition were based on the Company’s 

stock price as of the date of grant. With the assistance of a specialist, the fair value of 59,779 restricted shares granted in fiscal 2018 
with a market condition was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation, which approximated 92% of the Company’s stock price on the 
date of grant.  

The Company estimated the fair value of options granted in the fiscal years below using a Black-Scholes option pricing model 

with the following weighted average assumptions:

The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected holding period. The 

Company assumed a dividend yield of zero percent when valuing the grants under the 2015 Incentive Plan because the Company 
announced that it does not intend to pay dividends on its common stock. Expected volatility is based on the expected volatilities of 
comparable peer companies that are publicly traded. The expected term represents the period of time that awards granted are expected 
to be outstanding. The Company elected to use the simplified method to estimate the expected holding period because we do not have 
sufficient information to understand post vesting exercise behavior. As such, we will continue to use this methodology until such time 
we have sufficient history to provide a reasonable basis on which to estimate the expected term.  

The compensation cost that has been charged against income for the Company’s 2015 Incentive Plan was $12.1 million for 

fiscal 2018, $10.6 million for fiscal 2017 and $4.0 million for fiscal 2016, and it is included within operating expenses in the 
consolidated statement of operations. The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
was $3.9 million in fiscal 2018, $4.1 million in fiscal 2017, and $1.6 million in fiscal 2016. Total unrecognized compensation cost for 
all awards under the 2015 Incentive Plan is $26.5 million as of June 30, 2018. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-
average period of 2.5 years.

19.  Segment Information  

The Company has three reportable segments, as defined by ASC 280 Segment Reporting. The Performance Foodservice (“PFS”) 

segment markets and distributes food and food-related products to independent restaurants, Chain restaurants, and other institutional 
“food-away-from-home” locations. The PFG Customized segment principally serves the family and casual dining channel but also 
serves fine dining, fast casual, and quick serve restaurant chains. The Vistar segment distributes candy, snack, beverage, and other 
products to customers in the vending, office coffee services, theater, retail, and other channels. The accounting policies of the 
segments are the same as those described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates. Intersegment sales 
represent sales between the segments, which are eliminated in consolidation. Management evaluates the performance of each 
operating segment based on various operating and financial metrics, including total sales and EBITDA. For PFG Customized, 
EBITDA includes certain allocated corporate charges that are included in operating expenses. The allocated corporate charges are 
determined based on a percentage of total sales. This percentage is reviewed on a periodic basis to ensure that the segment is allocated 
a reasonable rate of corporate expenses based on their use of corporate services.

Corporate & All Other is comprised of corporate overhead and certain operations that are not considered separate reportable 

segments based on their size. This includes the operations of the Company’s internal logistics unit responsible for managing and 
allocating inbound logistics revenue and expense, as well as the operations of certain recent acquisitions.  

In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company reorganized its information technology department, and expenses associated 
with business application teams are now included in the segment results.  The EBITDA for Performance Foodservice, Vistar, and 
Corporate & All Other for the fiscal years ended July 1, 2017 and July 2, 2016 has been adjusted to reflect this change.

Notes to Condensed Parent Company Only Financial Statements  
1. Description of Performance Food Group Company  

Performance Food Group Company (the “Parent”) was incorporated in Delaware on July 23, 2002 to effect the purchase of all 
the outstanding equity interests of PFGC, Inc. (“PFGC”). The Parent has no significant operations or significant assets or liabilities 
other than its investment in PFGC. Accordingly, the Parent is dependent upon distributions from PFGC to fund its obligations. 
However, under the terms of PFGC’s various debt agreements, PFGC’s ability to pay dividends or lend to the Parent is restricted, 
except that PFGC may pay specified amounts to the Parent to fund the payment of the Parent’s franchise and excise taxes and other 
fees, taxes, and expenses required to maintain its corporate existence.  

2. Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying condensed financial statements (parent company only) include the accounts of the Parent and its investment 

in PFGC, Inc. accounted for in accordance with the equity method, and do not present the financial statements of the Parent and its 
subsidiary on a consolidated basis. These parent company only financial statements should be read in conjunction with the 
Performance Food Group Company consolidated financial statements. The Parent is included in the consolidated federal and certain 
unitary, consolidated and combined state income tax returns with its subsidiaries. The Parent’s tax balances reflect its share of such 
filings.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures  
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Regulations under the Exchange Act, require public companies, including us, to maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” 
which are defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act to mean a company’s controls and other procedures 
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is 
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and 
procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our 
reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and 
principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required or 
necessary disclosures. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure 
controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the 
objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our 
management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls 
and procedures. In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K, an 
evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including its principal 
executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that 
evaluation, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls 
and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K, were effective.  

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. 
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, management, with the participation of the Company’s 
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria established 
in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (“COSO”).  

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, is a process 

designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes 
those policies and procedures that:  

i. 

ii. 

iii. 

pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of our assets;  
provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only 
in accordance with authorizations of management and our board of directors; and  
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of 
our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.  

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, 

even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  

Based on our assessment, under the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO, 

management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2018. In 
addition, the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2018 has been audited by 
Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report, which appears in 
Item 8.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the 

Exchange Act), that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to 
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

Refer to Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in 
the annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 for statements regarding our use of non-GAAP financial 
measures and the definitions of such non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the most directly comparable GAAP 
measure to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is net income. The following table reconciles EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net 
income for the periods presented:  

Net income ..............................................................
Interest expense ............................................
Income tax (benefit) expense ........................
