in 
Dollar  General  achieved  meaningful  milestones 
2017.  We  completed  over  2,000  real  estate  projects, 
celebrated  the  opening  of  our  14,000th  store,  began 
shipping from our 15th distribution center and executed 
nearly two billion customer transactions. All of this hard 
work helped Dollar General deliver its 28th consecutive 
year of same-store sales growth, and we believe that we 
are well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities 
over both the short and long term.

Highlights of 2017 Compared to 2016

•  Net sales increased by 6.8% to $23.5 billion and same-
store sales grew 2.7%. The 2016 53rd week negatively 
impacted the fiscal year 2017 net sales growth rate by 
approximately two percentage points.

•  We reported net income of $1.54 billion, or $5.63 per 

diluted share.

•  Cash  flows  from  operations  were  $1.8  billion,  an 

increase of 12.3%.

•  We returned $863 million to our shareholders through 
the combination of share repurchases and dividends.

•  We  opened  a  record  1,315  new  stores,  including  the 
acquisition of nearly 300 store sites from another retailer, 
and remodeled or relocated an additional 764 locations.

We believe that our strong performance in 2017 reflects 
the strategic investments we have made in our business 
and  our  people.  As  we  look  ahead,  we  are  building 
momentum  behind  key  strategic  initiatives  that  we 
believe  will  drive  sales  and  profit  growth  in  the  future. 
In 2018, we plan to invest in digital tools and resources 
to drive traffic to our stores and provide our customers 
with  a  more  personalized  and  convenient 
in-store 
shopping  experience.  This  will  allow  us  to  leverage  our 
more than 14,500 stores to further enhance the value and 
convenience proposition for our customers.

We  also  plan  to  begin  implementing  a  bold,  new  and 
expanded  assortment 
in  certain  non-consumable 
product  categories.  The  new  and  differentiated 
assortment at compelling prices is aimed at enhancing 
the  treasure-hunt  experience  for  our  customer,  as  well 
as  further  complementing  our  strong  and  growing 
consumables business.

In  addition  to  these  and  other  strategic  initiatives,  we 
remain  focused  on  delivering  sustainable  growth  and 
value  to  all  of  our  stakeholders  through  our  four  key 
operating priorities: 

1.  Driving  profitable  sales  growth:  We  intend  to 
drive  a  balance  of  top  and  bottom  line  growth 
by  continuing  to  grow  new  customer  trips,  in 
addition to capturing additional share with existing 

2.  Capturing  growth  opportunities:  Our  flexible 
real  estate  model  is  a  strategic  foundation  for  our 
continued  growth.  It  positions  us  well  to  invest  in 
new  store  growth,  enter  new  markets,  deliver  new 
formats  and  reinvest  in  our  mature  store  base.  In 
2018,  we  expect  to  open  900  new  stores,  remodel 
1,000  of  our  mature  store  locations  and  relocate 
approximately 100 stores. 

3.  Leveraging our position as a low cost operator: We 
remain  committed  to  controlling  expenses  through 
our  clear  and  defined  process.  In  2018,  we  have 
initiatives  in  place  to  focus  on  work  simplification 
and efficiency in the stores and at the store support 
center. We believe that these efforts will help control 
costs and focus spending on the customer and our 
key strategic initiatives.

4. 

Investing in our people as a competitive advantage: 
We know our employees are a competitive advantage, 
and  we  have  a  track  record  of  investment  in 
compensation and training to deliver on our ongoing 
commitment to their continued development. In 2017, 
we were proud to see the lowest level of store manager 
turnover in the past five years, and are pleased to note 
that over 10,000 of our current store managers were 
promoted internally. This year, we are introducing an 
expanded,  paid  parental  leave  policy  and  adoption 
assistance benefit as well as other training efforts to 
prepare employees for future success. 

Dollar  General’s  mission  to  serve  extends  to  the 
communities  we  call  home.  In  2017,  Dollar  General  and 
our foundations continued the legacy of the Company’s 
founder J. L. Turner in helping to improve people’s quality 
of  life  through  literacy  and  basic  education.  Together 
with the Dollar General Literacy Foundation, we donated 
a total of $20 million to literacy organizations and other 
important charitable causes.

I  am  grateful  to  our  nearly  130,000  employees  whose 
incredible  work  this  past  year  helped  create  value  for 
our  customers  and  shareholders  alike.  We  look  forward 
to capitalizing on our momentum in 2018 as we continue 
to execute our strategy, and remain focused on serving 
our customers with the value and convenience they know 
and expect from Dollar General. 

Thank you for your continued support.

Respectfully,

Todd J. Vasos

What is this document?

This document is the proxy statement of Dollar General Corporation for the Annual Meeting
of Shareholders to be held on Wednesday, May 30, 2018. We will begin mailing printed copies of this
document or the Notice of Internet Availability to shareholders on or about April 12, 2018. We are
providing this document to solicit your proxy to vote upon certain matters at the annual meeting.
We refer to our company as ‘‘we,’’ ‘‘us’’ or ‘‘Dollar General.’’ Unless otherwise noted or

required by context, ‘‘2018,’’ ‘‘2017,’’ ‘‘2016,’’ ‘‘2015,’’ and ‘‘2014,’’ refer to our fiscal years ending or
ended February 1, 2019, February 2, 2018, February 3, 2017, January 29, 2016, and January 30, 2015,
respectively.

What is a proxy, who is asking for it, and who is paying for the cost to solicit it?

A proxy is your legal designation of another person, called a ‘‘proxy,’’ to vote your stock. The

document that designates someone as your proxy is also called a proxy or a proxy card.

Dollar General will pay all solicitation expenses. Our directors, officers, and employees are

soliciting your proxy on behalf of our Board of Directors and will not receive additional remuneration
for doing so except reimbursement for any related out-of-pocket expenses they may incur. We may
reimburse custodians and nominees for their expenses in sending proxy materials to beneficial owners.
Solicitation of proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone, email and other electronic means,
advertisements and personal solicitation, or otherwise.

Who may attend the annual meeting?

Only shareholders, their proxy holders, and our invited guests may attend the meeting. If your
shares are registered in the name of a broker, trust, bank, or other nominee, you will need to bring a
proxy or a letter from that record holder or your most recent brokerage account statement that
confirms your ownership of those shares as of March 22, 2018. For security reasons, we also may
require photo identification for admission.

Where can I find directions to the annual meeting?

Directions to Goodlettsville City Hall, where we will hold the annual meeting, are posted on

the ‘‘Investor Information’’ section of our website located at www.dollargeneral.com.

VOTING MATTERS

How many votes must be present to hold the annual meeting?

A quorum, consisting of the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of

shares of our common stock outstanding on March 22, 2018, must exist to conduct any business at the
meeting.

What if a quorum is not present at the annual meeting?

If a quorum is not present at the meeting, any officer entitled to preside at or to act as

Secretary of the meeting shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum is
present.

What am I voting on?

You will be asked to vote on:

(cid:129)
(cid:129)

(cid:129)

the election of 9 directors listed in this proxy statement;
the approval on an advisory basis of our named executive officer compensation as disclosed
in this proxy statement; and
the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm
(the ‘‘independent auditor’’) for 2018.

May other matters be raised at the annual meeting?

We are unaware of other matters to be acted upon at the meeting. Under Tennessee law and

our governing documents, no other non-procedural business may be raised at the meeting unless proper
notice has been given to shareholders. If other business is properly raised, your proxies have authority
to vote as they think best, including to adjourn the meeting.

Who is entitled to vote at the annual meeting?

You may vote if you owned shares of Dollar General common stock at the close of business on

March 22, 2018. As of that date, there were 268,547,203 shares of Dollar General common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote. Each share is entitled to one vote on each matter.

What is the difference between a ‘‘shareholder of record’’ and a ‘‘street name’’ holder?

You are a ‘‘shareholder of record’’ if your shares are registered directly in your name with EQ
Shareowner Services, our transfer agent. You are a ‘‘street name’’ holder if your shares are held in the
name of a brokerage firm, bank, trust, or other nominee as custodian.

How do I vote?

If you are a shareholder of record, you may vote your proxy over the telephone or Internet or,

if you received printed proxy materials, by marking, signing, dating, and returning the printed proxy
card in the enclosed envelope. Please refer to the instructions on the Notice of Internet Availability or
proxy card, as applicable. Alternatively, you may vote in person at the meeting.

If you are a street name holder, your broker, bank, or other nominee will provide materials

and instructions for voting your shares. You may vote in person at the meeting if you obtain and bring

to the meeting a legal proxy from your broker, banker, trustee, or other nominee giving you the right
to vote the shares.

What if I receive more than one Notice of Internet Availability or proxy card?

You will receive multiple Notices of Internet Availability or proxy cards if you hold shares in
different ways (e.g., joint tenancy, trusts, custodial accounts, etc.) or in multiple accounts. Street name
holders will receive the Notice of Internet Availability or proxy card or other voting information, along
with voting instructions, from their brokers. Please vote the shares represented by each Notice of
Internet Availability or proxy card you receive to ensure that all your shares are voted.

How will my proxy be voted?

The persons named on the proxy card will vote your proxy as you direct or, if you return a

signed proxy card or complete the Internet or telephone voting procedures but do not specify how you
want to vote your shares: ‘‘FOR’’ all directors nominated in this proxy statement; ‘‘FOR’’ approval, on
an advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy
statement pursuant to the SEC’s compensation disclosure rules; and ‘‘FOR’’ ratification of Ernst &
Young LLP as our independent auditor for 2018.

Can I change my mind and revoke my proxy?

Yes. A shareholder of record may revoke a proxy given pursuant to this solicitation by:

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

signing a valid, later-dated proxy card and submitting it so that it is received before the
annual meeting in accordance with the instructions included in the proxy card;
at or before the annual meeting, submitting to our Corporate Secretary a written notice of
revocation dated later than the date of the proxy;
submitting a later-dated vote by telephone or Internet no later than 11:59 p.m., Eastern
time, on May 29, 2018; or
attending the annual meeting and voting in person.

(cid:129)
Your attendance at the annual meeting, by itself, will not revoke your proxy.
A street name holder may revoke a proxy given pursuant to this solicitation by following the

instructions of the bank, broker, trustee, or other nominee who holds his or her shares.

How many votes are needed to elect directors?

To be elected at the annual meeting, a nominee must receive the affirmative vote of a majority

of votes cast by holders of shares entitled to vote at the meeting. Under our Amended and Restated
Charter, the ‘‘affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast’’ means that the number of votes cast in favor
of a nominee’s election exceeds the number of votes cast against his or her election. You may vote in
favor of or against the election of each nominee, or you may elect to abstain from voting your shares.

What happens if a director fails to receive the required vote for election?

An incumbent director who does not receive the required vote for election at the annual

meeting must promptly tender a resignation as a director for the Board’s consideration pursuant to our
Board-approved director resignation policy outlined in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. Each
director standing for re-election at the annual meeting has agreed to resign, effective upon the Board’s
acceptance of such resignation, if he or she does not receive a majority vote. If the Board rejects the
offered resignation, the director will continue to serve until the next annual shareholders’ meeting and

Dollar General

until his or her successor is duly elected or his or her earlier resignation or removal in accordance with
our Bylaws. If the Board accepts the offered resignation, the Board, in its sole discretion, may fill the
resulting vacancy or decrease the size of the Board.

How many votes are needed to approve other matters?

The proposal to approve on an advisory basis the compensation of our named executive
officers and the proposal to ratify the appointment of our independent auditor for 2018 will be
approved if the votes cast in favor of the applicable proposal exceed the votes cast against it. The vote
on the compensation of our named executive officers is advisory and, therefore, not binding on Dollar
General, our Board of Directors, or its Compensation Committee. With respect to these proposals, and
any other matter properly brought before the annual meeting, you may vote in favor of or against the
proposal, or you may elect to abstain from voting your shares.

What are broker non-votes?

Although your broker is the record holder of any shares that you hold in street name, it must

vote those shares pursuant to your instructions. If you do not provide instructions, your broker may
exercise discretionary voting power over your shares for ‘‘routine’’ items but not for ‘‘non-routine’’
items. All matters described in this proxy statement, except for the ratification of the appointment of
our independent auditor, are considered to be non-routine matters.

‘‘Broker non-votes’’ occur when shares held of record by a broker are not voted on a matter
because the broker has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner and either lacks or
declines to exercise the authority to vote the shares in its discretion.

How will abstentions and broker non-votes be treated?

Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will be treated as shares that are present and entitled
to vote for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present but will not be counted as votes cast
either in favor of or against a particular proposal and will have no effect on the outcome of a
particular proposal.

election by shareholders at the annual meeting upon the recommendation of the Nominating and
Governance Committee (the ‘‘Nominating Committee’’). The nominees include 7 incumbent directors
who were elected at the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders and 2 incumbent directors who were

How are directors identified and nominated?

The Nominating Committee is responsible for identifying, evaluating, and recommending

director candidates to our Board, while our Board is responsible for nominating the director slate for
election by shareholders at the annual meeting. The Nominating Committee may use a variety of
methods to identify potential director candidates, such as recommendations by our directors,
management, shareholders or third-party search firms (see ‘‘Can shareholders nominate or recommend
directors?’’ below). Our Nominating Committee retained a third-party search firm to assist in
identifying potential Board candidates who meet our qualification and experience requirements and, for
any such candidate identified by such search firm, to compile and evaluate information regarding the
candidate’s qualifications, experience, and potential conflicts of interest, and to verify the candidate’s
education. Mr. Santana was identified as a candidate by the third party search firm, and such search
firm’s engagement terminated upon Mr. Santana’s appointment to our Board. Mr. McGuire was

7

7

recommended as a candidate by a non-management director. Each of Messrs. Santana and McGuire
was fully vetted by our Nominating Committee and our Board.

Our employment agreement with Mr. Vasos requires that we nominate him to serve as a

member of our Board each year that he is slated for re-election by our shareholders. Our failure to do
so could give rise to a claim for breach of contract and may constitute good reason for employment
termination by Mr. Vasos under the employment agreement.

How are nominees evaluated; what are the minimum qualifications?

Subject to Mr. Vasos’s employment agreement discussed above, the Nominating Committee is

charged with recommending to the Board of Directors only those candidates that it believes are
qualified to serve as Board members consistent with the criteria for selection of new directors adopted
from time to time by the Board and who have not achieved the age of 76, unless the Board has
approved an exception to this limit on a case by case basis. If a waiver is granted, it will be reviewed
annually.

The Nominating Committee assesses a candidate’s independence, background, and experience,
as well as the current Board’s skill needs and diversity. With respect to incumbent directors considered
for re-election, the Committee also assesses each director’s meeting attendance record and suitability
for continued service. In addition, the Committee determines that all nominees are in a position to
devote an adequate amount of time to the effective performance of director duties and possess the
following characteristics: integrity and accountability, informed judgment, financial literacy, a
cooperative approach, a record of achievement, loyalty, and the ability to consult with and advise
management. The Committee recommends candidates, including those submitted by shareholders, only
if it believes the candidate’s knowledge, experience, and expertise would strengthen the Board and that
the candidate is committed to representing the long-term interests of all Dollar General shareholders.

We have a written policy to endeavor to achieve a mix of Board members that represent a

diversity of background and experience in areas that are relevant to our business. To implement this
policy, the Committee assesses diversity by evaluating each candidate’s individual qualifications in the
context of how that candidate would relate to the Board as a whole and also considers more traditional
concepts of diversity. The Committee periodically assesses the effectiveness of this policy by considering
whether the Board as a whole represents such diverse experience and composition and by
recommending to the Board changes to the criteria for selection of new directors as appropriate.

What particular experience, qualifications, attributes, or skills led the Board of Directors to conclude
that each nominee should serve as a director of Dollar General?

Our Board of Directors believes that each of the nominees can devote an adequate amount of
time to the effective performance of director duties and possesses the minimum qualifications identified
above. The Board has determined that the nominees, as a whole, complement each other, meet the
Board’s skill needs, and represent diverse experience at policy-making levels in areas relevant to our
business. The Board also considered the following in determining that the nominees should serve as
directors of Dollar General:

Mr. Bryant has over 40 years of retail experience, including experience in marketing,

merchandising, operations, and finance. His substantial experience in leadership and policy-making
roles at other retail companies, together with his current and former experience as a board member for
certain other retailers, provides him with an extensive understanding of our industry, as well as with
valuable executive management skills and the ability to effectively advise our CEO.

Mr. Calbert has considerable experience in managing private equity portfolio companies and is
familiar with corporate finance and strategic business planning activities. As the former head of KKR’s

Retail industry team, Mr. Calbert has a strong background and extensive experience in advising and
managing companies in the retail industry, including evaluating business strategies, financial plans and
structures, and management teams. His former service on various private company boards in the retail
industry further strengthens his knowledge and experience within our industry. Mr. Calbert also has a
significant financial and accounting background evidenced by his prior experience as the chief financial
officer of a retail company and his 10 years of practice as a certified public accountant.

Ms. Cochran brings over 25 years of retail experience to Dollar General as a result of her

current and former roles at Cracker Barrel Old Country Store and her former roles at
Books-A-Million. This experience allows her to provide additional support and perspective to our CEO
and our Board. In addition, Ms. Cochran’s industry and executive experience provides leadership,
consensus-building, strategic planning, risk management, and budgeting skills. Ms. Cochran also has
significant financial experience, having served as the chief financial officer of two public companies and
as vice president, corporate finance of SunTrust Securities, Inc., and our Board has determined that she
qualifies as an audit committee financial expert.

Ms. Fili-Krushel’s background increases the breadth of experience of our Board as a result of

her extensive executive experience overseeing the business strategy, philanthropy, corporate social
responsibility, human resources, recruitment, employee growth and development, compensation and
benefits, and legal functions at large public companies in the media industry. In addition, her
understanding of consumer behavior based on her knowledge of viewership patterns and preferences
provides additional perspective to our Board in understanding our customer base.

Mr. McGuire brings valuable experience to our company after having served as a leader of

McKinsey’s global retail and consumer practice for almost 28 years. He has expertise in strategy, new
store/concept development, marketing and sales, operations, international expansion, big data and
advanced analytics. In addition, Mr. McGuire’s focus while at McKinsey on use of advanced analytics in
retail, developing and implementing growth strategies for consumer services, food, general-merchandise
and multi-channel retailers, developing new retail formats, the application of lean operations
techniques, the redesign of merchandise flows, supply-chain optimization efforts, and the redesign of
purchasing and supplier-management approaches, will bring new and extensive relevant perspectives to
our Board as it seeks to consult and advise our CEO and to shape our corporate strategy.

Ms. Price brings broad experience across finance, general management, and strategy gained
from her service in senior executive and management positions at major corporations across several
industries, including as Chief Financial Officer of Ahold USA before her retirement in 2014.
Ms. Price’s numerous years of experience as a certified public accountant, former chief financial officer
and former chief accounting officer provide our Board with valuable experience and insight into
accounting and finance matters, and consequently, our Board has determined that Ms. Price qualifies as
an audit committee financial expert. She also brings to our Board a valuable perspective as a member
of the faculty at the Harvard Business School and from her service as a board member of several
public companies.

Mr. Rhodes has over 20 years of experience in the retail industry, including extensive experience

in operations, supply chain, and finance, among other areas. This background serves as a strong
foundation for offering invaluable perspective and expertise to our CEO and our Board. In addition,
his experience as a board chairman and chief executive officer of a public retail company provides
leadership, consensus-building, strategic planning, and budgeting skills, as well as extensive
understanding of both short- and long-term issues confronting the retail industry. Mr. Rhodes also has
a strong financial background, and our Board has determined that he qualifies as an audit committee
financial expert.

Mr. Santana has 18 years of marketing experience spanning multiple technology and food and
beverage consumer packaged goods categories. His deep understanding of digital marketing and retail

Dollar General

shopper marketing, particularly in the area of consumer packaged goods, and his extensive experience
in shaping multi-cultural strategy, executing marketing programs, and making brands culturally relevant
will further enhance our Board’s ability to provide oversight and thoughtful counsel to management in
these important and evolving areas of our business.

Mr. Vasos has extensive retail experience, including over nine years with Dollar General. His

experience overseeing the merchandising, operations, marketing, advertising, procurement, supply chain,
store development, store layout, and space allocation functions of other retail companies bolsters
Mr. Vasos’s thorough understanding of all key areas of our business. In addition, Mr. Vasos’s service in
leadership and policy-making positions of other retail companies has provided him with the necessary
leadership skills to effectively guide and oversee the direction of Dollar General and with the
consensus-building skills required to lead our management team.

Acting upon the Nominating Committee’s recommendation, and after concluding that these

nominees possess the appropriate experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills, our Board has
unanimously nominated these individuals to be elected by our shareholders at our annual meeting.

Can shareholders nominate or recommend directors?

Yes. Shareholders can nominate directors by following the advance notice procedures outlined

in our Bylaws and summarized below. In addition, shareholders can recommend candidates for
consideration by our Nominating Committee by submitting such recommendations within the same
deadlines and providing the same information that is required for nominating candidates pursuant to
the advance notice provisions in our Bylaws; the Nominating Committee’s charter and our Corporate
Governance Guidelines require the Nominating Committee to consider candidates recommended by
our shareholders in this manner and to apply the same criteria to the evaluation of those shareholder-
recommended candidates as it applies to other director candidates.

In short, to nominate a director or to recommend candidates for consideration by our

Nominating Committee, the shareholder must deliver a written notice to our Corporate Secretary at
100 Mission Ridge, Goodlettsville, Tennessee 37072 for receipt no earlier than the close of business on
the 120th day and not later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the first anniversary of
the prior year’s annual meeting. However, if the meeting is held more than 30 days before or more
than 60 days after such anniversary date, the notice must be received no earlier than the close of
business on the 120th day and not later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the date of
such annual meeting. If the first public announcement of the annual meeting date is less than 100 days
prior to the date of such annual meeting, the notice must be received by the 10th day following the
public announcement date.

The notice must contain all information required by our Bylaws about the shareholder

proposing the nominee and about the nominee, which generally includes:

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (including the nominee’s written consent to being

the name and address of the shareholder proposing the nominee as they appear on our
record books, and the name and address of the beneficial holder (if applicable);

a description of all compensatory arrangements or understandings between the proposing
shareholder and each nominee; and
a description of all arrangements or understandings between the proposing shareholder and
each nominee and any other person pursuant to which the nomination is to be made by
the shareholder.

In addition, we have a ‘‘proxy access’’ provision in our Bylaws that permits eligible shareholders
to nominate candidates for election to our Board. Proxy access candidates will be included in our proxy
statement and ballot subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Article I, Section 12 of our
Bylaws. The proxy access provision in our Bylaws provides that holders of at least 3% of our
outstanding shares, held by up to 20 shareholders, holding the shares continuously for at least 3 years,
can nominate up to 20% of our Board for election at an annual shareholders’ meeting. A shareholder
who wishes to formally nominate a proxy access candidate must follow the procedures and comply with
the deadlines described in Article I, Section 12 of our Bylaws. For more specific information regarding
these deadlines in respect of the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders, see ‘‘Shareholder Proposals for
2019 Annual Meeting’’ below.

You should consult our Bylaws, posted on the ‘‘Investor Information—Corporate Governance’’

section of our website located at www.dollargeneral.com, for more detailed information regarding the
processes described above by which shareholders may nominate directors, as the information above is a
summary only. No shareholder nominees have been submitted for this year’s annual meeting.

What if a nominee is unwilling or unable to serve?

That is not expected to occur. If it does, the persons designated as proxies on the proxy card

are authorized to vote your proxy for a substitute designated by our Board of Directors.

Are there any familial relationships between any of the nominees?

There are no familial relationships between any of the nominees or between any of the

nominees and any of our executive officers.

What does the Board of Directors recommend?

Our Board unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the election of each of the director

nominees.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Does the Board of Directors have standing Audit, Compensation, and Nominating Committees?

Yes. Our Board of Directors has a standing Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and
Nominating Committee. The Board has adopted a written charter for each of these committees, which
are available on the ‘‘Investor Information—Corporate Governance’’ section of our website located at
www.dollargeneral.com. Current information regarding these committees is set forth below. The Board
also has established a subcommittee of our Compensation Committee consisting of Mr. Bryant and
Ms. Fili-Krushel for purposes of approving any compensation that may otherwise be subject to
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or Section 16 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In addition to the functions outlined below, each such committee
performs an annual self-evaluation, periodically reviews and reassesses its charter, and evaluates and
makes recommendations concerning shareholder proposals that are within the committee’s expertise.

Committee met 5, 5, 6, and 3 times, respectively. Each incumbent director attended at least 75% of the

Our Board of Directors has adopted a policy that all directors should attend annual

shareholders’ meetings unless attendance is not feasible due to unavoidable circumstances. All persons
serving as Board members at the time attended the 2017 annual shareholders’ meeting.

Does Dollar General separate the positions of Chairman and CEO?

Yes. Mr. Calbert, an independent director, serves as our Chairman of the Board. This decision

affords our CEO the opportunity to focus his time and energy on managing our business and allows
our Chairman to devote his time and attention to matters of Board oversight and governance. The
Board, however, recognizes that no single leadership model is right for all companies and at all times,
and the Board will review its leadership structure as appropriate to ensure it continues to be in the best
interests of Dollar General and our shareholders.

To further promote effective independent Board leadership, the Board has adopted a number

of additional governance practices, including:

(cid:129) Ensuring opportunity after each regularly scheduled Board meeting for executive sessions
of the independent directors and, if not all non-management directors are independent, of
the non-management directors. Mr. Calbert, as Chairman, presides over all such sessions.

(cid:129) Conducting annual performance evaluations of the CEO.
(cid:129) Conducting annual Board and committee self-evaluations.

Does the Board of Directors evaluate the performance of Board members?

Yes. As part of its responsibility for overseeing the evaluation of the Board of Directors, the

Nominating Committee approves an evaluation process to be followed by the Board and each standing
committee and encourages our directors to provide candid feedback on any Board member to the
Chairperson of the Nominating Committee or the Chairman of the Board. Such chairpersons meet at
least annually to review any such feedback and any other information related to individual director
performance and to discuss what, if any, response or follow-up action is appropriate and in Dollar
General’s best interests.

What is the Board of Director’s role in risk oversight?

Our Board of Directors and its committees have an important role in our risk oversight

process. Our Board regularly reviews with management our financial and business strategies, including
relevant material risks as appropriate. Our General Counsel also periodically provides information to
the Board regarding our insurance coverage and programs as well as litigation risks.

The Audit Committee discusses our risk assessment and risk management procedures, primarily

through oversight of our enterprise risk management program. Our Internal Audit department
coordinates that program, which entails review and documentation of our comprehensive risk
management practices. The program evaluates internal and external risks, identifies mitigation
strategies, and assesses any remaining residual risk. The program is updated through interviews with
senior management and our Board, review of strategic initiatives, review of upcoming legislative or
regulatory changes, review of certain internal metrics, and review of other outside information
concerning business, financial, legal, reputational, and other risks. The results are presented to the
Audit Committee at least annually, and categories with high residual risk, along with their mitigation
strategies, are reviewed quarterly. Our Audit Committee also quarterly reviews metrics and information
pertaining to cybersecurity risks and mitigation. Our Internal Audit department, as part of its audit plan
that is approved by the Audit Committee, conducts various cybersecurity audits as well as periodically
engages third parties to perform unannounced cybersecurity assessments. We also use third parties to
periodically benchmark our cybersecurity program and to assess how any identified vulnerabilities in the
industry might impact our company as well as the sufficiency of our response. The results generated
from these activities are reported to management and the Audit Committee, and management develops
action plans to address any identified opportunities for improvement and keeps the Audit Committee
apprised of the progress of such plans.

2018 Proxy Statement (cid:129) Corporate Governance

Our Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks relating
to our executive compensation program. As discussed under ‘‘Executive Compensation—Compensation
Risk Considerations’’ below, the Compensation Committee also participates in periodic assessments of
the risks relating to our overall compensation programs.

While the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee oversee the risk areas identified

above, the entire Board is regularly informed about risks through the committee reporting process, as
well as through special reports and updates from management and advisors. This enables the Board
and its committees to coordinate the risk oversight role, particularly with respect to risk
interrelationships. Our Board believes this division of risk management responsibilities effectively
addresses the material risks facing Dollar General. Our Board further believes that our leadership
structure, described above, supports the risk oversight function of the Board as it allows our
independent directors, through the three fully independent Board committees and in executive sessions
of independent directors led by our independent Chairman of the Board, to exercise effective oversight
of the actions of management in identifying risks and implementing effective risk management policies
and controls.

Does Dollar General have a management succession plan?

Yes. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require our Board of Directors to coordinate with

our CEO to ensure that a formalized process governs long-term management development and
succession. Our Board formally reviews our management succession plan at least annually. Our
comprehensive program encompasses not only our CEO and other executive officers but all employees
through the front-line supervisory level. The program focuses on key succession elements, including
identification of potential successors for positions where it has been determined that internal succession
is appropriate, assessment of each potential successor’s level of readiness, and preparation of individual
growth and development plans. With respect to CEO succession planning, our long-term business
strategy is also considered. In addition, we maintain at all times, and review with the Board
periodically, a confidential procedure for the timely and efficient transfer of the CEO’s responsibilities
in the event of an emergency or his sudden incapacitation or departure.

Are there share ownership guidelines and holding requirements for Board members and senior
officers?

Yes. Details of our share ownership guidelines and holding requirements for Board members

and senior officers are included in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. See ‘‘Compensation
Discussion and Analysis—Share Ownership Guidelines and Holding Requirements’’ and ‘‘Director
Compensation’’ for more information on such ownership guidelines and holding requirements for
senior officers and Board members, respectively.

How can I communicate with the Board of Directors?

Our Board-approved process for security holders and other interested parties to contact the

Board of Directors, a particular director, or the non-management directors or the independent
directors as a group is described on www.dollargeneral.com under ‘‘Investor Information—Corporate
Governance.’’

Where can I find more information about Dollar General’s corporate governance practices?

Our governance-related information is posted on www.dollargeneral.com under ‘‘Investor

Business Conduct and Ethics, the charter of each of the Audit Committee, the Compensation
Committee, and the Nominating Committee, and the name(s) of the person(s) chosen to lead the

In addition to the annual Board retainer, Messrs. Bryant, Rhodes, and Rickard also earned an annual retainer for service
as the Chairperson of the Compensation Committee, the Nominating Committee, and the Audit Committee, respectively, in
fiscal 2017. Mss. Cochran and Fili-Krushel became Chairpersons of the Nominating Committee and the Compensation
Committee, respectively, after the start of fiscal 2018 and accordingly did not earn annual chairperson retainers for fiscal
2017.

(2) Represents the grant date fair value of restricted stock units (‘‘RSUs’’) awarded to Mr. Calbert on February 6, 2017

($193,729) for his annual Chairman of the Board retainer, as well as to each director (including Mr. Calbert) on May 31,
2017 ($139,074), in each case computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. Information regarding assumptions made
in the valuation of these awards is included in Note 9 of the annual consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2018, filed with the SEC on March 23, 2018 (our ‘‘2017 Form 10-K’’).
As of February 2, 2018, each of the persons listed in the table above had the following total unvested RSUs outstanding
(including additional unvested RSUs credited as a result of dividend equivalents earned with respect to such RSUs): each
of Messrs. Bryant, Rhodes, and Rickard and Mss. Cochran, Fili-Krushel, and Price (1,912); and Mr. Calbert (4,628).

(3) There were no stock options awarded to any director listed in the table above during fiscal 2017, as the Board chose to

eliminate stock option awards as part of director compensation beginning in fiscal 2015. As of February 2, 2018, each of the
persons listed in the table above had the following total unexercised stock options outstanding (whether or not then
exercisable): each of Messrs. Bryant, Calbert, and Rhodes (21,756); Ms. Cochran (13,120); Ms. Fili-Krushel (12,892);
Ms. Price (4,795); and Mr. Rickard (21,513).

the annual shareholders’ meeting and to any new director appointed thereafter but before February 1
of a given year. The RSUs are scheduled to vest on the first anniversary of the grant date subject to
certain accelerated vesting conditions. Directors may defer receipt of shares underlying the RSUs.

In addition to the fees outlined above, the Chairman of the Board receives an annual retainer
delivered in the form of RSUs, payable in shares of our common stock under our Stock Incentive Plan
and scheduled to vest on the first anniversary of the grant date, subject to certain accelerated vesting
conditions, having an estimated value of $200,000.

The forms and amounts of director compensation as outlined above were recommended by the
Compensation Committee, and approved by the Board, after taking into account market benchmarking
data, recommendations of the Committee’s compensation consultant, and, for the additional equity
award to the Chairman, the amount of time anticipated to be devoted to services to the Company.

Up to 100% of cash fees earned for Board services in a fiscal year may be deferred under the

Non-Employee Director Deferred Compensation Plan. Benefits are payable upon separation from
service in the form, as elected by the director at the time of deferral, of a lump sum distribution or
monthly payments for 5, 10, or 15 years. Participating directors can direct the hypothetical investment
of deferred fees into funds identical to those offered in our 401(k) Plan and will be credited with the
deemed investment gains and losses. The amount of the benefit will vary depending on the fees the
director has deferred and the deemed investment gains and losses. Benefits upon death are payable to
the director’s named beneficiary in a lump sum. In the event of a director’s disability (as defined in the
Non-Employee Director Deferred Compensation Plan), the unpaid benefit will be paid in a lump sum.
Participant deferrals are not contributed to a trust, and all benefits are paid from Dollar General’s
general assets.

Our non-employee directors are subject to share ownership guidelines, expressed as a multiple

of the annual cash retainer payable for service on our Board, and holding requirements. The current
ownership guideline is 5 times and should be acquired within 5 years of election to the Board. When
the ownership guideline is increased, incumbent non-employee directors are allowed an additional year
to acquire the incremental multiple. Each non-employee director is required to retain ownership of
50% of all net after-tax shares granted by Dollar General until the share ownership target is reached.
Please see our Corporate Governance Guidelines for additional information. Administrative details
pertaining to these matters are established by the Compensation Committee.

DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE

Is Dollar General subject to the NYSE governance rules regarding director independence?

Yes. A majority of our directors must satisfy the independence requirements set forth in the
NYSE listing standards. The Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Nominating
Committee also must consist solely of independent directors to comply with NYSE listing standards
and, in the case of the Audit Committee, with SEC rules. The NYSE listing standards define specific
relationships that disqualify directors from being independent and further require that the Board
affirmatively determine that a director has no material relationship with Dollar General in order to be
considered ‘‘independent.’’ The SEC’s rules and NYSE listing standards contain separate definitions of
independence for members of audit committees and compensation committees, respectively.

How does the Board of Directors determine director independence?

The Board of Directors determines the independence of each director and director nominee in
accordance with guidelines it has adopted, which include all elements of independence set forth in the
NYSE listing standards and SEC rules as well as certain Board-adopted categorical independence
standards. These guidelines are found in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are posted on
the ‘‘Investor Information—Corporate Governance’’ section of our website located at
www.dollargeneral.com.

The Board first considers whether any director or nominee has a relationship covered by the

NYSE listing standards that would prohibit an independence finding for Board or committee purposes.
The Board then analyzes any relationship of the remaining eligible directors and nominees with Dollar
General or our management that falls outside the parameters of the Board’s separately adopted
categorical independence standards to determine if that relationship is material. The Board may
determine that a person who has a relationship outside such parameters is nonetheless independent
because the relationship is not considered to be material. Any director who has a material relationship
with Dollar General or its management is not considered to be independent. Absent special
circumstances, the Board does not consider or analyze any relationship that management has
determined to fall within the parameters of the Board’s separately adopted categorical independence
standards.

Are all of the directors and nominees independent?

No. Our Board of Directors consists of Warren F. Bryant, Michael M. Calbert, Sandra B.

Cochran, Patricia D. Fili-Krushel, Timothy I. McGuire, Paula A. Price, William C. Rhodes, III,
David B. Rickard, Ralph E. Santana, and Todd J. Vasos. Messrs. Rickard, Bryant, and Rhodes and
Mss. Cochran and Price serve on our Audit Committee, Ms. Fili-Krushel and Messrs. Bryant and
McGuire serve on our Compensation Committee, and Mss. Cochran and Fili-Krushel and
Messrs. Rhodes and Santana serve on our Nominating Committee. Mr. Rhodes also served on our
Compensation Committee until February 12, 2018.

Our Board has affirmatively determined that Messrs. Bryant, Calbert, McGuire, Rhodes,

Rickard, and Santana, and Mss. Cochran, Fili-Krushel, and Price, but not Mr. Vasos, are independent
from our management under both the NYSE listing standards and our additional independence
standards. Except as described below, any relationship between an independent director and Dollar
General or our management fell within the Board-adopted categorical standards and, accordingly, was
not reviewed or considered by our Board in making independence decisions. The Board also has
determined that the members of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the
Nominating Committee meet the independence requirements for membership on those committees set

18 Dollar General

2018 Proxy Statement (cid:129) Director Independence

18

forth in the NYSE listing standards, our additional standards and, as to the Audit Committee, SEC
rules.

In reaching the determination that Ms. Cochran is independent, the Board considered that

Ms. Cochran’s brother, Stephen Brophy, has been employed by the Company since 2009 and currently
serves in a non-officer position, as described in more detail under ‘‘Transactions with Management and
Others.’’ Ms. Cochran does not serve on the Compensation Committee which approves decisions
pertaining to Mr. Brophy’s compensation and she does not participate in his performance evaluations.
Mr. Brophy’s cash compensation and equity awards are approved by the Compensation Committee
pursuant to our related-party transactions approval policy.

In reaching the determination that Mr. McGuire is independent, the Board considered his

former relationship with McKinsey & Company (‘‘McKinsey’’), which has provided management
consulting services to Dollar General as described in more detail under ‘‘Transactions with
Management and Others.’’ Mr. McGuire retired from McKinsey in August 2017.

TRANSACTIONS WITH MANAGEMENT AND OTHERS

Does the Board of Directors have a related-party transactions approval policy?

Yes. Our Board of Directors has adopted a written policy for the review, approval, or

ratification of ‘‘related party’’ transactions. A ‘‘related party’’ for this purpose includes our directors,
director nominees, executive officers, and greater than 5% shareholders, and any of their immediate
family members, and a ‘‘transaction’’ includes one in which (1) the total amount may exceed $120,000,
(2) Dollar General is a participant, and (3) a related party will have a direct or indirect material
interest (other than as a director or a less than 10% owner of another entity, or both).

The policy requires prior Board approval for known related party transactions, subject to

certain exceptions identified below. In addition, at least annually after receiving a list of immediate
family members and affiliates from our directors and executive officers, relevant internal departments
determine if any transactions were unknowingly entered into with a related party and the Board is
presented with a list of any such transactions, subject to the exceptions identified below, for review.
The related party may not participate in any approval of the transaction and must provide to the Board
all material information concerning the transaction.

Each of our Chairman and our CEO is authorized to approve a related party transaction in

which he is not involved if the total anticipated amount is less than $1 million and he informs the
Board of the transaction. In addition, the transactions below are deemed pre-approved without Board
review or approval:

(cid:129) Transactions involving a total amount that does not exceed the greater of $1 million or 2%

of the entity’s annual consolidated revenues (total consolidated assets in the case of a
lender) if no related party who is an individual participates in the actual provision of
services or goods to, or negotiations with, us on the entity’s behalf or receives special
compensation or benefit as a result.

(cid:129) Charitable contributions if the total amount does not exceed 2% of the recipient’s total

annual receipts and no related party who is an individual participates in the grant decision
or receives any special compensation or benefit as a result.

(cid:129) Transactions where the interest arises solely from share ownership in Dollar General and

all of our shareholders receive the same benefit on a pro rata basis.

(cid:129) Transactions where the rates or charges are determined by competitive bid.
(cid:129) Transactions for services as a common or contract carrier or public utility at rates or

charges fixed in conformity with law or governmental authority.

(cid:129) Transactions involving services as a bank depositary of funds, transfer agent, registrar,

trustee under a trust indenture, or similar services.

(cid:129) Compensatory transactions available on a nondiscriminatory basis to all salaried employees

generally, ordinary course business travel expenses and reimbursements, or compensatory
arrangements to directors, director nominees or officers or any other related party that
have been approved by the Board or an authorized committee.

2018 Proxy Statement (cid:129) Transactions with Management and Others

20

What related-party transactions existed in 2017 or are planned for 2018?

Ms. Cochran’s brother, Stephen Brophy, has been employed by the Company since 2009 and

currently serves in a non-officer position. For 2017, Mr. Brophy earned from Dollar General total cash
compensation (comprised of his base salary and bonus compensation) of less than $285,000 and
received an annual equity award consisting of 1,763 non-qualified stock options and 440 RSUs. In
March 2018, Mr. Brophy received an annual equity award consisting of 1,287 non-qualified stock
options and 335 RSUs. All equity awards were granted on terms consistent with the annual equity
awards received by all Dollar General employees at the same job grade level as Mr. Brophy and on
terms substantially similar to the forms of award agreements on file with the SEC. We expect
Mr. Brophy’s total cash compensation for 2018 to not exceed $295,000. Mr. Brophy also is eligible to
participate in employee benefits plans and programs available to our other full-time employees.
Ms. Cochran does not serve on the Compensation Committee which approves decisions

pertaining to Mr. Brophy’s compensation and she does not participate in his performance evaluations.
Mr. Brophy’s cash compensation and equity awards are approved by the Compensation Committee
pursuant to our related-party transactions approval policy.

Until his retirement on August 31, 2017, Mr. McGuire served as an employee of McKinsey,

which has provided management consulting services to Dollar General, and as such he may be deemed
to have had an indirect interest in the relationship between our company and McKinsey. While
employed by McKinsey, Mr. McGuire led the team that provided the consulting services to Dollar
General. For 2017, we paid McKinsey $2 million for the management consulting services.

LTI—Long-Term Equity Incentive (stock options and performance share units)

The following payouts were earned as a result of strong performance versus the financial

targets used for our 2017 performance-based compensation:

(cid:129) Teamshare Bonus Program: Each named executive officer earned a payout under our

annual Teamshare bonus program of 113.03% of his or her target payout level based on
achieving adjusted EBIT (as defined and calculated for purposes of the Teamshare bonus
program) of $2.089 billion, or 101.3% of the adjusted EBIT target (see ‘‘Short-Term Cash
Incentive Plan’’).

(cid:129) Performance Share Units: The portion of the awards granted in March 2017 subject to

2017 adjusted EBITDA performance were earned at 108.2% of target, based on achieving
adjusted EBITDA of $2.484 billion, or 100.8% of the adjusted EBITDA target, and, for the
portion subject to 2017 adjusted ROIC performance, 204.0% of target based on achieving
adjusted ROIC of 18.69%, or 102.9% of the adjusted ROIC one-year 2017 target, in each
case as defined and calculated in the PSU award agreements (see ‘‘Significant
Compensation-Related Actions’’ and ‘‘Long-Term Equity Incentive Program’’).

Significant Compensation-Related Actions. The most significant recent compensation-related

actions pertaining to our named executive officers include:

(cid:129) Beginning with the 2017 annual equity awards and Teamshare bonus program, the clawback

of performance-based incentive compensation paid or awarded to a named executive
officer is allowed in the case of a material financial restatement of our consolidated
financial statements resulting from fraud or intentional misconduct on the part of the
executive officer.

(cid:129) Beginning with the March 2017 equity grant, a portion of the vesting of performance share
units is based upon the achievement of multi-year financial performance goals, moving the
equity incentive program towards a longer-term performance focus.

(cid:129) Beginning in 2017, our long-term equity incentive program differentiates among individual
performance levels by increasing or decreasing each named executive officer’s grant value
from a baseline target value based on a subjective assessment of a variety of factors.

Shareholder Response. The most recent shareholder advisory vote on our named executive

officer compensation was held on May 31, 2017 (our ‘‘2017 annual meeting’’), based on the three-year
frequency approved by our shareholders in 2011. Excluding abstentions and broker non-votes, 94.69%
of total votes were cast in support of the program. Because we view this outcome as overwhelmingly
supportive of our compensation policies and practices, we do not believe the vote requires
consideration of changes to the program. Nonetheless, because market practices and our business needs
continue to evolve, we continually evaluate our program and make changes when warranted.

At our 2017 annual meeting, our shareholders expressed a preference that advisory votes on
executive compensation occur every year. Consistent with this preference, our Board implemented an
annual advisory vote on executive compensation, with the next such advisory vote to be held at our
2018 annual meeting, until the next advisory vote on the frequency of shareholder votes on executive
compensation, which will occur no later than our 2023 annual meeting of shareholders.

Philosophy and Objectives

We strive to attract, retain, and motivate persons with superior ability, to reward outstanding

performance, and to align the long-term interests of our named executive officers with those of our
shareholders. The material compensation principles applicable to the compensation of our named
executive officers are outlined below:

(cid:129)

In determining total compensation, we consider the reasonable range of the median of
total compensation of comparable positions at companies within our market comparator
group, while accounting for distinct circumstances not reflected in the market data such as
unique job descriptions as well as our particular niche in the retail sector and the impact
that a particular officer may have on our ability to meet business objectives. For
competitive or other reasons, our levels of total compensation or any component of
compensation may exceed or be below the median range of our market comparator group.

(cid:129) We set base salaries to reflect the responsibilities, experience, performance, and

contributions of the named executive officers and the salaries for comparable benchmarked
positions, while maintaining an appropriate balance between base salary and incentive
compensation.

(cid:129) We reward named executive officers who enhance our performance by linking cash and

equity incentives to the achievement of our financial goals.

(cid:129) We promote share ownership to align the interests of our named executive officers with

(cid:129)

those of our shareholders.
In approving compensation arrangements, we consider recent compensation history,
including special or unusual compensation payments.

We have employment agreements with the named executive officers to promote executive

continuity, aid in retention, and secure valuable protections for Dollar General, such as non-compete,
non-solicitation, and confidentiality obligations, as well as to facilitate implementation of our clawback
policy.

Oversight and Process

Oversight. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, consisting entirely of

independent directors, determines and approves the compensation of our named executive officers. The
independent members of our Board are provided the opportunity to ratify the Committee’s
determinations pertaining to the level of CEO compensation.

Use of Outside Advisors. The Compensation Committee has selected Pearl Meyer to serve as
its compensation consultant and has determined that Pearl Meyer is independent and that its work has
not raised any conflicts of interest. When requested by the Committee, a Pearl Meyer representative
attends Committee meetings and participates in private sessions with the Committee, and Committee
members are free to consult directly with Pearl Meyer as desired.

The Committee (or its Chairman) determines the scope of Pearl Meyer’s services and has

approved a written agreement that details the terms under which Pearl Meyer will provide independent
advice to the Committee. The approved scope of Pearl Meyer’s work generally includes the
performance of analyses and provision of independent advice related to our executive and
non-employee director compensation programs and related matters in support of the Committee’s
decisions, and more specifically, includes performing preparation work associated with Committee
meetings, providing advice in areas such as compensation philosophy, compensation risk assessment,
market comparator group, incentive plan design, executive compensation disclosure, emerging best
practices and changes in the regulatory environment, and providing competitive market studies. Pearl
Meyer, along with management, also prepares benchmarking data for consideration by the Committee
in making decisions on items such as base salary, the Teamshare bonus program, and the long-term
incentive program.

Management’s Role. Financial performance targets used in our incentive compensation

programs typically are derived from our annual financial plan prepared by our executive management
team and reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors, and, at the Committee’s request, members
of our finance department assist the Committee in developing these financial performance targets.
Messrs. Vasos and Ravener and non-executive members of the human resources group provide
assistance to the Compensation Committee and Pearl Meyer regarding executive compensation matters,
including conducting research, compiling data and making recommendations regarding compensation
amount, mix, and program structure alternatives, market comparator group composition and
compensation-related governance practices, as well as providing information to and coordinating with
Pearl Meyer as requested. Additionally, Ms. Taylor may provide legal advice to the Committee
regarding executive compensation and related governance and legal matters and contractual
arrangements from time to time. Although these recommendations may impact each of such officers’
compensation to the extent they participate in the plans and programs, none of such officers make
recommendations to the Committee regarding their specific compensation. For the role of management
in named executive officers’ performance evaluations, see ‘‘Use of Performance Evaluations’’ below.
Although the Committee values and solicits management’s input, it retains and exercises sole authority
to make decisions regarding named executive officer compensation.

Use of Performance Evaluations. The Compensation Committee, together with the Chairman

of the Board, assesses the performance of the CEO, and the CEO evaluates and reports to the
Committee on the performance of each of the other named executive officers, in each case versus
previously established goals. The Committee also has input into each named executive officer’s
performance evaluation. These evaluations are subjective; no objective criteria or relative weighting is
assigned to any individual goal or factor.

Performance ratings serve as an eligibility threshold for base salary increases and directly

impact the amount of a named executive officer’s annual base salary increase. The Committee starts
with the percentage base salary increase that equals the overall budgeted increase for our U.S.-based
employee population and approves differing merit increases to base salary based upon each named
executive officer’s individual performance rating. The Committee then considers whether additional
adjustments are necessary to reflect performance, responsibilities or qualifications; to bring pay within a
reasonable range of the market comparator group; due to a change in role or duties; to achieve a
better balance between base salary and incentive compensation; or for other reasons the Committee
believes justify a variance from the merit increase.

Dollar General

25

2018 Proxy Statement (cid:129) Executive Compensation 25

Performance evaluation results have the potential to affect the amount of Teamshare bonus

payout because the Committee is allowed to adjust payments downward within certain limitations
depending upon the named executive officer’s performance rating. The Committee did not exercise any
such negative discretion for the 2017 Teamshare payouts to named executive officers.

An unsatisfactory performance rating will reduce the number of, or completely eliminate, stock

options awarded to the named executive officer in the following year. None of the named executive
officers received an unsatisfactory performance rating for 2016 or 2017. In addition, beginning in 2017,
to allow for differentiation among performance levels of the named executive officers, individual
performance, along with other factors including company performance, department performance,
retention, and succession, were used as part of a subjective assessment to determine whether each
named executive officer’s equity award value should be increased or decreased from the baseline target
that is derived from benchmarking information.

Use of Market Benchmarking Data. The Compensation Committee approves, periodically

reviews, and utilizes a market comparator group when making compensation decisions (see ‘‘Philosophy
and Objectives’’). The market comparator group data typically is considered annually for base salary
adjustments, target equity award values, Teamshare target bonus opportunities, and total direct
compensation, and periodically when considering structural changes to our executive compensation
program. The Committee most recently updated our market comparator group in December 2015 to
include several retail and distribution companies with a broad range of products and to exclude certain
companies focused on apparel.

Our market comparator group consists of companies selected according to their similarity to
our operations, services, revenues, markets, availability of information, and any other information the
Committee deems appropriate. Such companies are likely to have executive positions comparable in
breadth, complexity, and scope of responsibility to ours. Thus, our market comparator group for 2017
compensation decisions consisted of:

Aramark
AutoZone
Bed, Bath & Beyond
Best Buy
Dicks Sporting Goods
Pearl Meyer annually provides market data for the CEO, to ensure that the Committee is

Sysco
TJX Companies
Tractor Supply
Yum! Brands

Dollar Tree
Kohl’s
L Brands
Office Depot

Rite Aid
Ross Stores
Staples
Starbucks

aware of any significant movement in CEO compensation levels within the market comparator group,
and biennially for each named executive officer position below CEO. In alternating years, the
Committee uses the prior year data after applying an aging factor recommended by Pearl Meyer. For
2017 CEO and non-CEO compensation decisions, the Committee considered non-aged data provided
by Pearl Meyer from the market comparator group.

Elements of Named Executive Officer Compensation

We provide compensation in the form of base salary, short-term cash incentives, long-term
equity incentives, benefits, and limited perquisites. We believe each of these elements is a necessary
component of the total compensation package and is consistent with compensation programs at
companies with whom we compete both for business and talent.

Mr. Vasos’s 2017 Compensation Generally. The Compensation Committee considered the base
salary, short-term incentive, and long-term incentive components of Mr. Vasos’s compensation, as well
as his total compensation, in each case in comparison to the market comparator group (see ‘‘Use of
Market Benchmarking Data’’) and in light of both his fiscal 2016 performance and experience level, as
well as our pay for performance philosophy and the other relevant compensation principles (see

26 Dollar General

2018 Proxy Statement (cid:129) Executive Compensation

26

‘‘Philosophy and Objectives’’). As a result of such considerations, the Committee determined that the
most appropriate way to reward Mr. Vasos for his 2016 overall performance and continue to move him
closer to the median of the market comparator group benchmarking data in 2017 was to increase his
target short-term incentive bonus opportunity and the target grant value of his 2017 equity award. The
Committee agreed that these changes resulted in a 2017 target total compensation opportunity that was
within a reasonable range of the market comparator group data in light of Mr. Vasos’s overall 2016
performance in the CEO role and his years of experience in the role as compared to other CEOs in
the market comparator group.

2017 Compensation of Named Executive Officers Other than Mr. Vasos Generally. The

Compensation Committee considered the base salary, short-term incentive, and long-term incentive
components, and total compensation of the non-CEO named executive officers, in each case in
comparison to the market comparator group (see ‘‘Use of Market Benchmarking Data’’), as well as
each such officer’s performance (see ‘‘Use of Performance Evaluations’’). As a result of such
considerations, for each non-CEO named executive officer the Committee approved an increase in the
short-term incentive target from 65% to 75% of base salary and in the long-term incentive grant value
target, before adjustments based on individual performance, from $1.1 million to $1.5 million in order
to improve the competitiveness of total compensation as compared to the market comparator group,
while maintaining an appropriate balance between short-term incentive compensation, long-term
incentive compensation, and base salary. However, in order to allow for differentiation among
individual performance levels of the non-CEO named executive officers, the Committee then approved
adjustments to the $1.5 million target long-term incentive grant value based on each such officer’s
subjective performance evaluation results which took into account a variety of factors, including
company performance, department performance, individual performance, retention, and succession (see
‘‘Use of Performance Evaluations’’).

The Committee further approved base salary merit increases in accordance with each non-CEO

named executive officer’s 2016 performance rating within the limitations of the overall U.S. merit
budget increase for 2017 of 3.0%, and after reviewing the proposed total target compensation,
excluding the long-term incentive grant value adjustments based on performance, of each such officer
against the market comparator group data, the Committee determined that total compensation for each
such officer other than Mr. Garratt remained within a reasonable range of the market comparator
group median and reflected the responsibilities of the position and the experience and contributions of
the individual. However, to better reflect the responsibilities of his position, his experience and
contributions, and to more closely align his total target compensation with the market comparator
group median, the Committee approved an additional base salary adjustment for Mr. Garratt.

Base Salary. Base salary promotes our recruiting and retention objectives by reflecting the
salaries for comparable positions in the competitive marketplace, rewarding strong performance, and
providing a stable and predictable income source for our executives. Our employment agreements with
the named executive officers set forth minimum base salary levels, but the Compensation Committee
retains sole discretion to increase these levels from time to time. The Committee routinely considers
annual base salary adjustments in March.

(a) Salary Adjustment for Mr. Vasos. The Compensation Committee determined that

Mr. Vasos should receive a 3.0% base salary increase, resulting in a base salary of $1,133,000, effective
April 1, 2017. The Committee determined that this increase was consistent with the overall budgeted
merit increase for U.S. employees and appropriate in light of the sizable annual equity grant value
increase he received in 2017, the significant increase to his 2017 short-term incentive bonus
opportunity, and the significant increase to his base salary received in conjunction with his promotion
to CEO in May 2015 and again on April 1, 2016.

Dollar General

27

2018 Proxy Statement (cid:129) Executive Compensation 27

(b) Salary Adjustments for Named Executive Officers Other than Mr. Vasos. For the reasons

outlined above under ‘‘2017 Compensation of Named Executive Officers Other than Mr. Vasos
Generally,’’ Mr. Garratt received a 19.46% base salary increase, Mr. Owen and Ms. Taylor received a
2.69% base salary increase, and Mr. Ravener received a 3.69% base salary increase (see ‘‘Use of
Performance Evaluations’’ and ‘‘Use of Market Benchmarking Data’’). In each case, the salary
adjustment became effective on April 1, 2017.

Short-Term Cash Incentive Plan. For 2017, our short-term cash incentive plan, called

Teamshare, was established under the shareholder-approved Amended and Restated Dollar General
Corporation Annual Incentive Plan (‘‘Annual Incentive Plan’’). The Teamshare program provides an
opportunity to receive a cash bonus payment equal to a certain percentage of base salary based upon
Dollar General’s achievement of one or more pre-established financial performance targets.
Accordingly, Teamshare fulfills an important part of our pay for performance philosophy while aligning
the interests of our named executive officers and our shareholders.

(a)

2017 Teamshare Structure. The Compensation Committee uses adjusted EBIT as the
Teamshare financial performance measure because it is a comprehensive measure of our corporate
performance that the Committee believes aligns with our shareholders’ interests. For purposes of the
2017 Teamshare program, adjusted EBIT is defined as our operating profit as calculated in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, but excludes the impact of (a) costs, fees and
expenses directly related to consideration, negotiation, preparation, or consummation of any transaction
that results in a Change in Control (within the meaning of our Stock Incentive Plan) or to any
securities offering; (b) disaster-related charges; (c) gains or losses associated with our LIFO
computation; and (d) unless the Committee disallows any such item, (i) any unbudgeted loss as a result
of the resolution of a legal matter or (ii) any unplanned loss(es), net of related unplanned gains, of a
non-recurring nature, provided that in the case of each of (i) and (ii) such amount equals or exceeds
$1 million for a single loss or net loss, as applicable, and $10 million in the aggregate.

The Committee used an adjusted EBIT performance goal of approximately $2.062 billion as

the target for the 2017 Teamshare program, which was derived from our 2017 financial plan but
adjusted to appropriately account for matters that were not contemplated at the time the 2017 financial
plan was approved by the Board, including adjustments necessary as a result of the Committee’s
deviation from historical adjustment authorization practices. The Committee retained the threshold
(below which no bonus may be earned) and maximum (above which no further bonus may be earned)
performance levels at 90% and 120% of the target level, respectively. These threshold and maximum
performance levels were again used, as they appropriately align pay and performance and are
reasonably consistent with the practices of our market comparator group. Payouts for financial
performance are based on actual results and are interpolated on a straight-line basis between threshold
and target and between target and maximum.

The bonus payable to each named executive officer upon achieving the target level of financial

performance is equal to the applicable percentage of base salary shown in the table below, subject to
the Committee’s exercise of negative discretion based on the individual’s performance (see ‘‘Use of
Performance Evaluations’’). These percentages for each non-CEO named executive officer increased
from those in effect at the end of the prior year (65%) for the reasons outlined under ‘‘2017
Compensation of Named Executive Officers Other than Mr. Vasos Generally.’’ Mr. Vasos’s percentage

(b)

2017 Teamshare Results. The Compensation Committee certified the adjusted EBIT

performance result at $2.089 billion (101.3% of target) resulting in 2017 Teamshare payouts to each of
the named executive officers of 113.03% of the target percentages set forth in the table above. Such
amounts are reflected in the ‘‘Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation’’ column of the Summary
Compensation Table.

Long-Term Equity Incentive Program. Long-term equity incentives are an important part of our

pay for performance philosophy and are designed to motivate named executive officers to focus on
long-term success for shareholders while rewarding them for a long-term commitment to us. The
Compensation Committee considers annual equity awards each March at its regular quarterly meeting
and considers special equity awards as necessary in connection with one-time events such as a new hire,
promotion, or special performance. Equity awards are made under our shareholder-approved Stock
Incentive Plan.

(a)

2017 Equity Award for Mr. Vasos. After considering the market comparator group data
pertaining to long-term incentive compensation, the Compensation Committee determined to provide
Mr. Vasos with a $6.0 million target grant value for his 2017 equity grant. The Committee believed the
$6.0 million target grant value of this equity award was within a reasonable range of the market
comparator group data in light of Mr. Vasos’s time in the CEO role as compared to other CEOs in the
market comparator group and in light of his total target compensation given his increase in Teamshare
bonus opportunity for 2017. The Committee further determined that Mr. Vasos’s annual equity grant
should reflect a mix of 50% stock options and 50% PSUs, as this mix remained reasonably well aligned
with the practices of the market comparator group, and approved the award in accordance with the
terms outlined in ‘‘2017 Annual Equity Awards for Named Executive Officers Other than Mr. Vasos’’
below.

(b)

2017 Annual Equity Awards for Named Executive Officers Other than Mr. Vasos. Each

year, the Compensation Committee determines a targeted equity award value for each named executive
officer derived from benchmarking information and the appropriate mix of vehicles in which to deliver
such targeted value (see ‘‘Use of Market Benchmarking Data’’), but then adjusts that value up or down
based on a subjective assessment of a variety of factors including company performance, department
performance, individual performance, retention, and succession. In 2017, the equity mix was delivered
50% in options and 50% in PSUs, as this mix remained reasonably well aligned with the practices of
the market comparator group. For the reasons outlined above in ‘‘2017 Compensation of Named
Executive Officers Other than Mr. Vasos Generally,’’ the grant value target for each non-CEO named
executive officer, before adjustments based on individual performance, was increased from $1.1 million
to $1.5 million, and then the Committee approved individual adjustments to the $1.5 million target
based on a subjective assessment of the factors listed above. As a result, the non-CEO named executive
officers received the following targeted grant values: Messrs. Garratt and Owen ($1.4 million),
Mr. Ravener ($1.5 million), and Ms. Taylor ($1.45 million).

Dollar General

29

2018 Proxy Statement (cid:129) Executive Compensation 29

The options are granted with a per share exercise price equal to the fair market value of one

share of our common stock on the grant date. The options vest 25% annually on April 1 of each of the
four fiscal years following the fiscal year in which the grant is made, subject to the named executive
officer’s continued employment with us and certain accelerated vesting provisions, and have a term of
ten years. The PSUs can be earned if specified performance goals are achieved during the applicable
performance periods and if certain additional vesting requirements are met as discussed more
specifically below.

For PSUs the Committee selects and sets targets for financial performance measures, then

establishes threshold and maximum levels of performance derived from those targets. The number of
PSUs earned depends on the level of financial performance achieved versus the goals. The Committee
selected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted ROIC as the financial performance measures for the 2017
PSUs. Half of the award is subject to adjusted EBITDA performance and half of the award is subject
to adjusted ROIC performance. The Committee believes that these financial measures and the mix
between them appropriately balance the emphasis placed upon earnings performance as well as
rigorous capital management over the long-term.

For the 2017 PSU grant, a one-year performance period corresponding to our 2017 fiscal year

was established for the portion of the PSUs which are subject to the adjusted EBITDA performance
measure in order to incent maximization of earnings each year relative to the revenue environment.
The adjusted EBITDA performance goal of approximately $2.464 billion was derived from our 2017
financial plan, but adjusted to appropriately account for matters that were not contemplated at the time
the 2017 financial plan was approved by the Board. The portion of the PSUs which are subject to an
adjusted ROIC performance measure were divided into three equal parts, each subject to its own
performance goal and performance period, in order to include a longer-term performance focus and
more closely align with the market comparator group practice. The three performance goals are subject
to one-year, two-year, and three-year performance periods, each beginning the first day of our 2017
fiscal year and extending through the last day of our 2017, 2018, and 2019 fiscal years, respectively, and
are based on the average of adjusted ROIC for each fiscal year within the applicable performance
period. The first performance goal (18.17%) was derived from our 2017 financial plan, but adjusted to
appropriately account for matters that were not contemplated at the time the 2017 financial plan was
approved by the Board, and the 2nd and 3rd performance goals (each 18.18%) were derived from our
three-year financial plan as it existed at the time the PSUs were awarded (including adjustments for the
2017 financial plan outlined above). The Committee believes this use of adjusted ROIC incentivizes a
focus on continued strong return on invested capital as our company continues to grow.

Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as income (loss) from continuing operations before cumulative

effect of change in accounting principles plus interest and other financing costs, net, provision for
income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, but excludes the impact of all items excluded from
the 2017 Teamshare program adjusted EBIT calculation outlined above. Adjusted ROIC for each
performance period, as applicable, is calculated as (a) the result of (x) the sum of (i) our operating
income, plus (ii) depreciation and amortization, plus (iii) minimum rentals for 2017 and 2018 and single
lease cost for 2019, minus (y) taxes, divided by (b) the result of (x) the sum of the averages of: (i) total
assets, excluding any assets associated with the adoption of new lease accounting standards in 2019,
plus (ii) accumulated depreciation and amortization, minus (y) (i) cash, minus (ii) goodwill, minus
(iii) accounts payable, minus (iv) other payables, minus (v) accrued liabilities, plus (vi) 8x minimum
rentals for 2017 and 2018 and 8x single lease cost for 2019 (with all of the foregoing terms determined
per our financial statements for each fiscal year within the applicable performance period) but excludes
the impact of all items excluded from the 2017 Teamshare program adjusted EBIT calculation outlined
above, as well as, in 2019, impacts related to changes to lease accounting rules. For 2017, when
calculating performance, the Committee additionally exercised its inherent negative discretion under
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code to adjust ROIC for the material positive impact of the

30 Dollar General

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act driven by both the benefit associated with the remeasurement of deferred tax
assets and liabilities and for the ongoing federal corporate tax rate reduction that went into effect near
the end of the Company’s 2017 fiscal year.

The following table shows how the PSUs would be earned at each of the threshold, target, and

maximum performance levels for the three performance periods. PSUs earned for financial
performance between these levels are interpolated in a manner similar to that used for our 2017
Teamshare bonus program, and the number of PSUs earned could vary between 0% and 300% of the
target award. The following tables also show the actual results of the 2017 financial performance
measures and the actual number of PSUs earned.

Each senior officer is required to retain ownership of 50% of all net after-tax shares issuable

upon vesting or exercise of compensatory awards until he or she reaches the target ownership level.
Administrative details pertaining to these matters are established by the Compensation Committee.

(d) Policy Against Hedging and Pledging Transactions. Our policy prohibits Board members

and executive officers from (1) pledging Dollar General securities as collateral, (2) holding Dollar
General securities in a margin account, and (3) hedging their ownership of Dollar General stock, such
as entering into or trading prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, puts, calls, options
(other than those granted by us) or other derivative instruments related to Dollar General stock.

Benefits and Perquisites. Our named executive officers participate in certain benefits on the

same terms that are offered to all of our salaried employees. We also provide them with limited
additional benefits and perquisites for retention and recruiting purposes, to replace benefit
opportunities lost due to regulatory limits, and to enhance their ability to focus on our business. We do
not provide tax gross-up payments on any benefits and perquisites other than relocation-related items.
The primary additional benefits and perquisites include the following:

(cid:129) We provide a Compensation Deferral Plan (the ‘‘CDP’’) and, for named executive officers
hired or promoted prior to May 28, 2008, a defined contribution Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan (the ‘‘SERP,’’ and together with the CDP, the ‘‘CDP/SERP Plan’’).

(cid:129) We pay the premiums for a life insurance benefit equal to 2.5 times base salary up to a

maximum of $4 million.

(cid:129) We provide a salary continuation program that provides income replacement for up to

26 weeks at 100% of base salary for the first three weeks and 70% of base salary
thereafter. In addition to the income replacement benefit, we also pay administrative fees
associated with the program. We also pay the premiums under a group long-term disability
plan that provides 60% of base salary up to a maximum monthly benefit of $20,000.
(cid:129) We provide a relocation assistance program under a policy applicable to officer-level

employees.

(cid:129) We provide personal financial and estate planning and tax preparation services through a

third party.

Severance Arrangements

As noted above, we have an employment agreement with each of our named executive officers

that, among other things, provides for such executive’s rights upon a termination of employment in
exchange for valuable business protection provisions for us. We believe that reasonable severance
benefits are appropriate to protect the named executive officer against circumstances over which he or
she does not have control and as consideration for the promises of non-disclosure, non-competition,
non-solicitation, and non-interference, as well as the clawback rights, that we require in our
employment agreements. A change in control, by itself (‘‘single trigger’’), does not trigger any severance
provision applicable to our named executive officers, except for the provisions related to outstanding

32 Dollar General

2018 Proxy Statement (cid:129) Executive Compensation

32

equity awards granted prior to 2016. Equity awards granted in or after 2016 do not provide for single
trigger vesting acceleration but rather require a termination event within a certain period of time
following a change in control to accelerate vesting of such equity awards.

Considerations Associated with Regulatory Requirements

Under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, we generally may not take a tax

deduction for individual compensation over $1 million paid in any taxable year to each of the persons
that meet the definition of a covered employee under Section 162(m). For fiscal 2017, covered
employees were those who were, at the end of the fiscal year, our CEO or one of the other named
executive officers (other than our Chief Financial Officer, or ‘‘CFO’’). As a result of U.S. tax law
changes, for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, an individual who is a covered employee
for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016 will continue to be a covered employee for all
subsequent taxable years, and the definition of covered employee will include, in addition to those who
were, at the end of the fiscal year, one of our named executive officers (other than the CEO or CFO),
anyone who held the position of CEO or CFO at any time during the fiscal year.

Prior to the U.S. tax law changes, certain performance-based compensation was exempt from

the Section 162(m) deduction limit. The PSUs and stock options granted prior to 2018 under our Stock
Incentive Plan, as well as the 2017 Teamshare cash incentive program under our Annual Incentive Plan,
were intended to meet the requirements of this performance-based compensation exemption. However,
for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the performance-based compensation exemption will
be eliminated unless the compensation qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements
in place as of November 2, 2017. At this time, we do not believe that the PSUs granted in 2017 and a
portion of our 2017 Teamshare program will qualify for the exemption from the deduction limit under
the transition relief provisions.

The Compensation Committee continues to view the tax deductibility of executive

compensation as one of many factors to be considered in the context of its overall compensation
philosophy and therefore reserves the right to approve compensation that may not be deductible in
situations it deems appropriate.

Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal 2017

The table below shows each named executive officer’s fiscal 2017 Teamshare bonus opportunity
under ‘‘Estimated Possible Payouts Under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards.’’ Actual amounts earned
under the fiscal 2017 Teamshare program are shown in the Summary Compensation Table and, for
those who received such payments, represent prorated payment on a graduated scale for financial
performance between the target and maximum performance levels. See ‘‘Short-Term Cash Incentive
Plan’’ in ‘‘Compensation Discussion and Analysis’’ for discussion of such Teamshare program.

The table below also shows information regarding equity awards made to our named executive

officers for fiscal 2017, all of which were granted pursuant to our Stock Incentive Plan. The awards
listed under ‘‘Estimated Future Payouts Under Equity Incentive Plan Awards’’ include the threshold,
target, and maximum number of PSUs which could be earned by each named executive officer based
upon the level of achievement of the applicable financial performance measures. The awards listed
under ‘‘All Other Option Awards’’ include non-qualified stock options that vest over time based upon
the applicable named executive officer’s continued employment by Dollar General. See ‘‘Long-Term
Equity Incentive Program’’ in ‘‘Compensation Discussion and Analysis’’ above for further discussion of
these awards. We have omitted from this table the column for ‘‘All Other Stock Awards’’ because it is

(1) Of the reported amounts, the following amounts are reported in the Summary Compensation Table as ‘‘Salary’’ for 2017:

Mr. Vasos ($56,377); Mr. Garratt ($29,863); Mr. Owen ($31,526); Mr. Ravener ($27,918); and Ms. Taylor ($27,720).

(2) Reported as ‘‘All Other Compensation’’ in the Summary Compensation Table.

(3) The amounts shown are not reported in the Summary Compensation Table because they do not represent above-market or

preferential earnings.

(4) Of the amounts reported, the following were previously reported as compensation to the named executive officer for years

prior to 2017 in a Summary Compensation Table: Mr. Vasos ($641,465); Mr. Garratt ($53,834); Mr. Owen ($48,073);
Mr. Ravener ($70,634); and Ms. Taylor ($162,822).

Pursuant to the CDP, each named executive officer may annually elect to defer up to 65% of

his or her base salary if his or her compensation exceeds the limit set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the
Internal Revenue Code, and up to 100% of his or her bonus pay if his or her compensation equals or
exceeds the highly compensated limit under Section 414(q)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code. We
currently match base pay deferrals at a rate of 100%, up to 5% of annual salary, with annual salary
offset by the amount of match-eligible salary under the 401(k) Plan. All named executive officers are
100% vested in all compensation and matching deferrals and earnings on those deferrals.

Pursuant to the SERP, we make an annual contribution equal to a certain percentage of a

participant’s annual salary and bonus to eligible participants who are actively employed in an eligible
job grade on January 1 and continue to be employed as of December 31 of a given year. The
contribution percentage is based on age, years of service, and job grade. Persons hired after May 27,
2008 are not eligible to participate in the SERP. The fiscal 2017 contribution percentage was 7.5% for
Ms. Taylor, and she is 100% vested in her SERP account. No other named executive officer was
eligible to participate in the SERP in 2017.

The amounts deferred or contributed to the CDP/SERP Plan are credited to a liability account,
which is then invested at the participant’s option in an account that mirrors the performance of a fund
or funds selected by the Compensation Committee or its delegate. These funds are identical to the
funds offered in our 401(k) Plan.

For a participant who ceases employment with at least 10 years of service or after reaching
age 50 and whose CDP account balance or SERP account balance exceeds certain dollar thresholds,
the account balance will be paid by (a) lump sum, (b) monthly installments over a 5, 10 or 15-year
period or (c) a combination of lump sum and installments, pursuant to the participant’s election.
Otherwise, payment is made in a lump sum. The vested amount will be payable at the time designated

Dollar General

39

2018 Proxy Statement (cid:129) Executive Compensation 39

by the CDP/SERP Plan upon the participant’s termination of employment. A participant’s CDP/SERP
benefit normally is payable in the following February if employment ceases during the first 6 months of
a calendar year or is payable in the following August if employment ceases during the last 6 months of
a calendar year. However, participants may elect to receive an in-service lump sum distribution of
vested amounts credited to the CDP account, provided that the date of distribution is no sooner than
5 years after the end of the year in which the amounts were deferred. In addition, a participant who is
actively employed may request an ‘‘unforeseeable emergency hardship’’ in-service lump sum distribution
of vested amounts credited to the participant’s CDP account. Account balances are payable in cash.
As a result of our change in control which occurred in 2007, the CDP/SERP Plan liabilities
through July 6, 2007 were fully funded into an irrevocable rabbi trust. We also funded into the rabbi
trust deferrals into the CDP/SERP Plan between July 6, 2007 and October 15, 2007. All CDP/SERP
Plan liabilities incurred on or after October 15, 2007 are unfunded.

Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control

Our agreements with our named executive officers and certain plans and programs in which
our named executive officers participate, in each case as in effect at the end of our 2017 fiscal year,
provide for benefits or payments upon certain employment termination or change in control events.
These benefits and payments are discussed below except to the extent a benefit or payment is available
generally to all salaried employees and does not discriminate in favor of our executive officers or to the
extent already discussed under ‘‘Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Fiscal 2017’’ above.

Payments Upon Termination Due to Death or Disability

Pre-2012 Equity Awards. Mr. Ravener and Ms. Taylor have options outstanding that were

granted prior to 2012. All such options are fully vested and generally may be exercised for a period of
one year from termination of employment due to death or disability (as defined in the applicable award
agreement) unless such options have expired earlier.

Post-2011 Equity Awards.

If a named executive officer’s employment with us terminates due to

death or disability (as defined in the applicable award agreement):

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

Stock Options. Any outstanding unvested stock option shall become immediately vested
and exercisable with respect to 100% of the shares subject to the option immediately prior
to such event, and such vested options may be exercised until the first anniversary of the
employment termination date but no later than the 10th anniversary of the grant date.
Performance Share Units. The following discusses outstanding PSUs awarded in fiscal 2015
(‘‘2015 PSUs’’), fiscal 2016 (‘‘2016 PSUs’’), and fiscal 2017 (‘‘2017 PSUs’’) to each named
executive who was employed by us at the time of the applicable award. Except as described
below, unearned or unvested PSUs from such awards shall be forfeited and cancelled on
the date of the termination of employment or the last day of the performance period, as
applicable.

 2015 PSUs and 2016 PSUs. If such termination occurs after April 1, 2016 for the

2015 PSUs or after April 1, 2017 for the 2016 PSUs, any remaining earned but
unvested PSUs from such awards shall become vested and nonforfeitable as of the
date of such event and shall be paid within 30 days thereafter.

 2017 PSUs. If such termination occurs before February 2, 2018 for the portion of

the 2017 PSUs subject to the one-year Adjusted EBITDA goal (the ‘‘2017
Adjusted EBITDA PSUs’’), a pro-rata portion (based on months employed during
the one-year performance period) of one-third of the 2017 Adjusted EBITDA
PSUs earned based on performance during the entire performance period shall

40 Dollar General

2018 Proxy Statement (cid:129) Executive Compensation

40

become vested and nonforfeitable (unless previously vested or forfeited), and shall
be paid, on April 1, 2018. If such termination occurs on or after February 2, 2018,
any earned but unvested 2017 Adjusted EBITDA PSUs shall become vested and
nonforfeitable as of the date of the termination (unless previously vested or
forfeited) but shall be paid at the same time as if no termination had occurred.
The portion of the 2017 PSUs subject to the Adjusted ROIC goals (the ‘‘2017
Adjusted ROIC PSUs’’) are allocated to three performance periods of varying
lengths: one year, two years, and three years (each an ‘‘ROIC performance
period’’). For the 2017 Adjusted ROIC PSUs allocated to each ROIC performance
period, a pro-rata portion (based on months employed during the applicable
performance period) of the 2017 Adjusted ROIC PSUs earned based on
performance during the entire applicable ROIC performance period shall become
vested and nonforfeitable (unless previously vested or forfeited) as of the last day
of the applicable vesting period and shall be paid at the same time as if no
termination had occurred (i.e., on the April 1 immediately following the end of
the applicable ROIC performance period). If such termination occurs on or after
the end of the applicable ROIC performance period, any remaining earned but
unvested 2017 Adjusted ROIC PSUs attributable to such ROIC performance
period shall become vested and nonforfeitable as of the date of the termination
but shall be paid at the same time as if no termination had occurred.

(cid:129) Restricted Stock Units. Any outstanding RSUs will become fully vested and nonforfeitable
upon such death or disability and will be paid within 90 days following the date of death or
disability. No RSUs were granted to named executive officers in 2016 or 2017.

Other Payments.

In the event of death, a named executive officer’s beneficiary will receive

payments under our group life insurance program in an amount, up to a maximum of $4 million, equal
to 2.5 times such officer’s annual base salary. In addition, in the event of disability (as defined in the
governing document), a named executive officer would receive 60% of covered monthly earnings up to
a $20,000 monthly benefit under our long-term disability insurance program. In the event of death or
disability (as defined in the CDP/SERP Plan), a named executive officer’s CDP/SERP Plan benefit will
be payable in a lump sum within 60 days after the end of the calendar quarter in which such
termination event occurs, provided that we may delay payment in the event of disability until as soon as
reasonably practicable after receipt of the disability determination by the Social Security
Administration. Additionally, in the event of death on or after the last day of a fiscal year, a named
executive officer will receive payment for his or her incentive bonus earned for that fiscal year under
the terms of our Teamshare program (which otherwise generally requires that a participant remain
employed on the payment date to be entitled to any incentive bonus earned for that fiscal year).

Payments Upon Termination Due to Retirement

Except as provided immediately below with respect to stock options, PSUs and RSUs awarded
after 2011, retirement (as defined in the applicable governing document) is not treated differently from
any other voluntary termination without good reason (as defined in the relevant agreements, and as
discussed below under ‘‘Payments Upon Voluntary Termination’’) under any of our plans or agreements
for named executive officers.

In the event a named executive officer retires:
(cid:129)

Stock Options. The portion of the stock options granted after 2011 that would have
become vested and exercisable within the one-year period following the retirement date if
such officer had remained employed with us shall remain outstanding for a period of one
year following the retirement date and shall become vested and exercisable on the

Dollar General

41

2018 Proxy Statement (cid:129) Executive Compensation 41

anniversary of the grant date that falls within the one year period following the retirement
date (but only to the extent such portion has not otherwise terminated or become
exercisable). However, if during such one-year period the officer dies or incurs a disability
or, for options granted prior to 2016, a change in control occurs, such portion shall instead
become immediately vested and exercisable (but only to the extent such portion has not
otherwise terminated) upon such death, disability or change in control. Otherwise, any
option which is unvested and unexercisable on the termination date shall immediately
expire without payment. The officer may exercise the option to the extent vested and
exercisable any time prior to the fifth anniversary of the retirement date, but no later than
the 10th anniversary of the grant date.
Performance Share Units.

(cid:129)

 Except as described below, any unearned or unvested PSUs from the 2015, 2016,

and 2017 PSU awards shall be forfeited and cancelled on the retirement date.

 2015 PSUs and 2016 PSUs. If such retirement occurs after April 2, 2017 but before

April 1, 2018 for the 2016 PSUs, an additional one-third of earned PSUs from
such award would become vested and nonforfeitable and would be paid on the
retirement date. If such retirement occurs after April 2, 2017 but before April 1,
2018 for the 2015 PSUs, or after April 2, 2018 but before April 1, 2019 for the
2016 PSUs, an additional one-third of earned PSUs from such awards would
become vested and nonforfeitable and would be paid on the retirement date.

 2017 PSUs. If such retirement occurs before February 2, 2018 for the 2017

Adjusted EBITDA PSUs, a pro-rata portion (based on months employed during
the one-year performance period) of one-third of the 2017 Adjusted EBITDA
PSUs earned based on performance during the entire performance period shall
become vested and nonforfeitable (unless previously vested or forfeited), and shall
be paid, on April 1, 2018. If such retirement occurs on or after February 2, 2018
but before the next April 1 vesting date, one-third of the earned PSUs that would
have become vested on the next vesting date shall become vested and
nonforfeitable as of such retirement (unless previously vested or forfeited) but
shall be paid at the same time as if no termination had occurred. For the 2017
Adjusted ROIC PSUs, the vesting and payment of PSUs from such award is
identical to the vesting and payment of PSUs in the death and disability scenarios
discussed above for the 2018 Adjusted ROIC PSUs during these respective time
periods.

 See ‘‘Payments After a Change in Control’’ for a discussion of treatment of the

2017 PSUs if a named executive officer terminates employment due to retirement
within two years following a change in control.

(cid:129) Restricted Stock Units. The one-third of the outstanding RSUs that would have become
vested and nonforfeitable on the next vesting date if such officer had remained employed
through such date will become vested and nonforfeitable upon such retirement (provided
that if the retirement occurs on a vesting date no accelerated vesting will occur, but rather
the officer shall be entitled only to the portion of the RSUs that were scheduled to vest on
such vesting date) and will be paid six months and one day following the retirement date.

Payments Upon Voluntary Termination

The payments to be made to a named executive officer upon voluntary termination vary

depending upon whether the resignation occurs with or without ‘‘good reason’’ (as defined in each

42 Dollar General

2018 Proxy Statement (cid:129) Executive Compensation

42

named executive officer’s employment agreement or award agreement, as applicable) or after our
failure to offer to renew, extend or replace the applicable employment agreement under certain
circumstances.

Voluntary Termination with Good Reason or After Failure to Renew the Employment Agreement.

If a named executive officer resigns with good reason (as defined in the applicable equity award
agreement), he or she will forfeit all then unvested equity awards and generally may exercise any vested
options up to 90 days following the resignation date, but no later than the 10th anniversary of the grant
date. Solely with respect to the special stock option awards granted to Mr. Vasos on June 3, 2015 and
March 16, 2016, Mr. Vasos will be required to hold any net shares acquired upon exercise for a period
of time ending on the fifth anniversary of the applicable grant date. If a named executive officer resigns
under the circumstances described in (2) below, his or her equity will be treated as described under
‘‘Voluntary Termination without Good Reason’’ below. See ‘‘Payments After a Change in Control’’ for a
discussion of treatment of equity awards if a named executive officer resigns with good reason within
two years following a change in control.

If a named executive officer resigns (1) with good reason (as defined in the applicable

employment agreement) after giving 30 days (90 days in the case of Mr. Vasos) written notice within
30 days after the event purported to give rise to the claim for good reason and opportunity for us to
cure any such claimed event within 30 days after receiving such notice, or (2) within 60 days (90 days in
the case of Mr. Vasos) of our failure to offer to renew, extend or replace his or her employment
agreement before, at or within 6 months (one year in the case of Mr. Vasos) after the end of the
agreement’s term (unless we enter into a mutually acceptable severance arrangement or the resignation
is a result of the named executive officer’s retirement or termination other than for good reason), then
in each case the named executive officer will receive the following benefits generally on or beginning
on the 60th day after termination of employment but contingent upon the execution and effectiveness of
a release of certain claims against us and our affiliates in the form attached to the employment
agreement:

(cid:129) Continuation of base salary, generally as in effect immediately before the termination, for
24 months payable in accordance with our normal payroll cycle and procedures. With the
exception of Mr. Vasos, the amount of any payment or entitlement to payment of the base
salary continuation shall be forfeited or, if paid, subject to recovery if and to the extent any
base salary is earned as a result of subsequent employment during the 24 months after the
termination date.

(cid:129) A lump sum payment of two times the amount of the average percentage of the named

executive officer’s target bonus paid or to be paid to employees at the same job grade level
as the named executive officer (if any) under the annual bonus program for officers for the
two fiscal years immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the termination date occurs
(for Mr. Vasos, such lump sum payment instead will equal two times his annual target
bonus in respect of the fiscal year in which his termination occurs). Mr. Vasos also will
receive a lump sum payment, payable when annual bonuses are paid to our other senior
executives, of a pro-rata portion of the annual bonus, if any, that he would have been
entitled to receive for the fiscal year of termination, if such termination had not occurred,
based on our performance for the fiscal year in which his employment terminates,
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during which he
was employed by us in the fiscal year and the denominator of which is 365.

(cid:129) A lump sum payment of two times our annual contribution that would have been made in
respect of the plan year in which such termination occurs for the named executive officer’s
participation in our pharmacy, medical, dental, and vision benefits programs.

(cid:129) Reasonable outplacement services for one year or, if earlier, until subsequent employment.

Dollar General

43

2018 Proxy Statement (cid:129) Executive Compensation 43

Note that any amounts owed to a named executive officer in the form of salary continuation

that would otherwise have been paid during the 60-day period after employment termination will
instead be payable in a single lump sum on the 60th day after such termination date and the remainder
will be paid in the form of salary continuation payments over the remaining 24-month period as set
forth above.

However, in certain cases, some or all of the payments and benefits provided on termination of

employment may be delayed for six months following termination to comply with the requirements of
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Any payment required to be delayed would be paid at the
end of the six-month period in a lump sum, and any payments due after the six-month period would be
paid at the normal payment date provided for under the applicable employment agreement.

The named executive officer will forfeit any unpaid severance amounts, and we retain any

other rights we have available under law or equity, upon a material breach of any continuing obligation
under the applicable employment agreement or the release, which include the following business
protection provisions:

(cid:129) The named executive officer must maintain the confidentiality of, and refrain from

disclosing or using, our (a) trade secrets for any period of time as the information remains
a trade secret under applicable law and (b) confidential information for a period of two
years following the employment termination date.

(cid:129) For a period of two years after the employment termination date, the named executive
officer may not accept or work in a ‘‘competitive position’’ within any state in which we
maintain stores at the time of his or her termination date or any state in which we have
specific plans to open stores within six months of that date. For this purpose, ‘‘competitive
position’’ means any employment, consulting, advisory, directorship, agency, promotional or
independent contractor arrangement between the named executive officer and any person
engaged wholly or in material part in the business in which we are engaged (including, but
not limited to, those entities identified in the applicable employment agreement), or any
person then planning to enter the discount consumable basics retail business, if the named
executive officer is required to perform services which are substantially similar to those he
or she provided or directed at any time while employed by us.

(cid:129) For a period of two years after the employment termination date, the named executive

officer may not actively recruit or induce any of our exempt employees to cease
employment with us.

(cid:129) For a period of two years after the employment termination date, the named executive

officer may not solicit or communicate with any person or entity who has a business
relationship with us and with whom the named executive officer had contact while
employed by us, if it would likely interfere with our business relationships or result in an
unfair competitive advantage over us.

Voluntary Termination without Good Reason.

If a named executive officer resigns without good

reason, he or she will forfeit all then unvested equity awards as well as all vested but unexercised
options that were granted prior to 2012. The named executive officer generally may exercise any vested
options that were granted after 2011 up to 90 days following the resignation date, but no later than the
10th anniversary of the grant date. Solely with respect to the special stock option awards granted to
Mr. Vasos on June 3, 2015 and March 16, 2016, Mr. Vasos will be required to hold any net shares
acquired upon exercise for a period of time ending on the fifth anniversary of the applicable grant date.

Payments Upon Involuntary Termination

The payments to be made to a named executive officer upon involuntary termination vary

depending upon whether termination is with or without ‘‘cause’’ (as defined in each named executive
officer’s employment agreement or equity award agreement, as applicable).

Involuntary Termination with Cause. Upon an involuntary termination with cause, a named
executive officer will forfeit all unvested equity grants, all vested but unpaid PSUs and all vested but
unexercised options.

stock option awards granted to Mr. Vasos on June 3, 2015 and March 16, 2016, Mr. Vasos
will be required to hold any net shares acquired upon exercise for a period of time ending
on the fifth anniversary of the applicable grant date.

(cid:129) Will receive the same severance payments and benefits on the same terms and conditions

(except for the notice and cure provisions) as described under ‘‘Voluntary Termination with
Good Reason or After Failure to Renew the Employment Agreement’’ above.

See ‘‘Payments After a Change in Control’’ for a discussion of treatment of equity awards if a

named executive officer is involuntarily terminated without cause within two years following a change in
control.

Payments After a Change in Control

Upon a change in control (as defined under the applicable governing document), regardless of

whether the named executive officer’s employment terminates:

(cid:129)

(cid:129) All options awarded prior to 2016 will vest and become immediately exercisable as to
100% of the shares subject to such options immediately prior to the change in control.
If the change in control occurs on or before the completion of the applicable performance
period, and the named executive officer has remained continuously employed until the
change in control, all unvested PSUs that have not previously been forfeited will
immediately be deemed earned at the target level and, for PSUs awarded prior to 2016,
shall vest, become nonforfeitable and be paid upon the change in control.
If the change in control occurs after completion of the applicable performance period, and
the named executive officer has remained continuously employed until the change in
control, all previously earned but unvested PSUs awarded prior to 2016 that have not
previously been forfeited will immediately vest, become nonforfeitable, and be paid upon
the change in control.

(cid:129)

(cid:129) All outstanding RSUs will become vested and nonforfeitable and will be paid upon the

change in control.

A named executive officer will have one year from the termination date (but no later than the
10th anniversary of the grant date) in which to exercise vested options that were granted after 2011 but
prior to 2016 if he or she resigns or is involuntarily terminated within two years following the change in
control under any scenario other than retirement or involuntary termination with cause, in which
respective cases, he or she will have five years from the retirement date (but no later than the

Dollar General

45

2018 Proxy Statement (cid:129) Executive Compensation 45

10th anniversary of the grant date) to exercise such vested options and will forfeit any vested but
unexercised options held at the time of the termination with cause.

Upon the named executive officer’s ‘‘qualifying termination,’’ which includes involuntary

termination without cause (as defined in the applicable equity award agreement) or resignation with
good reason as defined in the applicable equity award agreement (unless cause to terminate exists), as
well as voluntary resignation due to retirement as defined in the applicable equity award agreement
(unless cause to terminate exists) in the case of 2017 PSUs, in each case within two years following a
change in control (provided that the officer was continuously employed by us until the change in
control) and in the case of 2017 PSUs if the termination of employment also constitutes a ‘‘separation
from service’’ within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, (1) all of his or her
options awarded after 2015 will immediately vest and become exercisable as to 100% of the shares
subject to such options on the termination date (but only to the extent such options have not otherwise
terminated) and the officer may exercise any vested options up to three years following the termination
date, but no later than the 10th anniversary of the grant date; and (2) all of his or her previously
earned, or deemed earned, but unvested PSUs awarded after 2015 that have not been previously
forfeited will immediately vest, become nonforfeitable, and be paid on the termination date subject, in
the case of the 2017 PSUs, to a six-month delay if applicable, to comply with Section 409A of the
Internal Revenue Code. To qualify as a resignation with good reason for this purpose, the officer must
have provided written notice of the existence of the circumstances providing grounds for resignation
with good reason within 30 days of the initial existence of such grounds and must have given Dollar
General at least 30 days from receipt of such notice to cure such condition. In addition, the resignation
must have become effective no later than one year after the initial existence of the condition
constituting good reason.

Except as otherwise described above with respect to equity awards, upon an involuntary

termination without cause or a resignation with good reason following the change in control, a named
executive officer will receive the same severance payments and benefits as described above under
‘‘Voluntary Termination with Good Reason or After Failure to Renew the Employment Agreement.’’

In the event of a change in control as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code,

each named executive officer’s employment agreement provides for capped payments (taking into
consideration all payments and benefits covered by Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code) of $1
less than the amount that would trigger the ‘‘golden parachute’’ excise tax under federal income tax
rules (the ‘‘excise tax’’) unless he or she signs a release and the after-tax benefit would be at least
$50,000 more than it would be without the payments being capped. In such case, such officer’s
payments and benefits would not be capped and such officer would be responsible for the payment of
the excise tax. We would not pay any additional amount to cover the excise tax. The table below
reflects the uncapped amounts, subject to reduction in the circumstances described in this paragraph.

The following table reflects potential payments to each named executive officer in various

termination and change in control scenarios based on compensation, benefit, and equity levels in effect
on, and assuming the scenario was effective as of, February 2, 2018. For stock valuations, we have used
the closing price of our stock on the NYSE on February 2, 2018 ($99.44). The table below reports only
amounts that are increased, accelerated or otherwise paid or owed as a result of the applicable scenario
and, as a result, exclude earned but unpaid base salary through the employment termination date and
equity awards and CDP/SERP Plan benefits that had vested prior to the event. For more information
regarding the CDP/SERP Plan benefits, see ‘‘Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Fiscal 2017’’ above.
The table also excludes any amounts that are available generally to all salaried employees and do not
discriminate in favor of our executive officers. The amounts shown are merely estimates. We cannot
determine actual amounts to be paid until a termination or change in control scenario occurs.

2018 Proxy Statement (cid:129) Executive Compensation 47

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

Each of Messrs. Bryant and Rhodes and Ms. Fili-Krushel was a member of our Compensation
Committee during 2017. None of these persons (1) was at any time during 2017 an officer or employee
of Dollar General or any of our subsidiaries; (2) was at any time prior to 2017 an officer of Dollar
General or any of our subsidiaries; or (3) had any relationship requiring disclosure under the section of
this document entitled ‘‘Transactions with Management and Others.’’ Also, none of our executive
officers serves, or in the past fiscal year has served, as a director of, or as a member of the
compensation committee (or other board committee performing equivalent functions) of, any entity
that has one or more of its executive officers serving as a director of Dollar General or as a member of
our Compensation Committee.

Compensation Risk Considerations

In March 2018, our Compensation Committee, with input from its compensation consultant

and management, reviewed our compensation policies and practices for all employees, including
executive officers, to assess the risks that may arise from our compensation programs. The assessment
included a review of our compensation programs for certain design features which could potentially
encourage excessive risk-taking or otherwise generate risk to Dollar General. As a result of that
assessment, the Compensation Committee concluded, after considering the degree to which identified
risk-aggravating factors were offset by risk-mitigating factors, that the net risks created by our overall
compensation policies and practices were not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on
Dollar General.

Pay Ratio Disclosure

As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer

Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about
the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation
of our Chief Executive Officer (our ‘‘CEO’’). This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a
manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology
described below.

We determined that the 2017 annual total compensation of the median compensated employee
(who is a part-time store associate) of our temporary, part-time, and full-time employee base who were
employed as of February 2, 2018, other than our CEO, was $13,387; our CEO’s 2017 annual total
compensation was $8,806,409; and the ratio of these amounts is 1:658.

As of February 2, 2018, our total population consisted of 123,227 compensated employees. Of

those employees, 69 were located in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Pursuant to SEC rules, we excluded all
69 non-U.S. employees from the following countries: Hong Kong (17); China (50); Mexico (1); and
Turkey (1). After applying this exemption, the employee population used for purposes of identifying the
median employee consisted of 123,158 temporary, part-time, and full-time employees located solely in
the United States.

To identify the median compensated employee, we used W-2 Box 5 Medicare wages for the

period from February 4, 2017 through February 2, 2018, with such amounts annualized for those
permanent employees who did not work for the full year.

The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio

based on that employee’s annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of
methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that
reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be
comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and
compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates, and assumptions
in calculating their own pay ratios.

PROPOSAL 2:
ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

In accordance with Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we

provide our shareholders each year with an opportunity to vote on an advisory basis on compensation
paid to our named executive officers. Accordingly, we are asking our shareholders to provide an
advisory, nonbinding vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers as we have
described it in ‘‘Compensation Discussion and Analysis’’ and in the accompanying compensation tables
and related narrative discussion in the ‘‘Executive Compensation’’ section of this proxy statement.
As discussed in detail in the ‘‘Compensation Discussion and Analysis’’ section above, the

Compensation Committee actively oversees our executive compensation program, adopting changes to
the program and awarding compensation as appropriate to reflect Dollar General’s circumstances and
to promote the main objectives of the program. Our compensation programs are designed to attract,
retain, and motivate persons with superior ability, to reward outstanding performance, and to align the
long-term interests of our named executive officers with those of our shareholders. Under these
programs, our named executive officers are rewarded for the achievement of specific annual and
long-term goals and the realization of increased shareholder value. We firmly believe that the
information we have provided in this proxy statement demonstrates that our executive compensation
program was designed appropriately and is working to ensure that management’s interests are aligned
with our shareholders’ interests to support long-term value creation.

Our Board of Directors is asking our shareholders to indicate their support for our named

executive officer compensation as described in this proxy statement in accordance with SEC rules by
voting for this proposal. Because the vote on this proposal is advisory in nature, it will not affect any
compensation already paid or awarded to any named executive officer and will not be binding on or
overrule any decisions by the Compensation Committee or the Board. This vote is not intended to
address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive
officers. This advisory vote is not a vote on the compensation of our Board of Directors or on our
compensation policies as they relate to risk management, as described under ‘‘Compensation Risk
Considerations’’ in the ‘‘Executive Compensation’’ section above.

Although the vote we are asking shareholders to cast is advisory and is not binding, our Board

and the Compensation Committee value the views of our shareholders and intend to consider the
outcome of the vote, along with other relevant factors, when making future compensation decisions for
our named executive officers.

Our Board unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the compensation of

our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to Item 402 of
Regulation S-K, including the ‘‘Compensation Discussion and Analysis’’ and the accompanying
compensation tables and related narrative discussion in the ‘‘Executive Compensation’’ section of this
proxy statement.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT

The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has:
(cid:129)

reviewed and discussed with management the audited financial statements for the fiscal
year ended February 2, 2018,
discussed with Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, the
matters required to be discussed by the Statement on Auditing Standards No. 1301,
Communications with Audit Committees, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board,
received the written disclosures and the letter from Ernst & Young LLP required by
applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the
independent registered public accounting firm’s communications with the Audit Committee
concerning independence, and
discussed with Ernst & Young LLP its independence from Dollar General and its
management.

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

Based on these reviews and discussions, the Audit Committee unanimously recommended to
the Board of Directors that Dollar General’s audited financial statements be included in the Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

While the Audit Committee has the responsibilities and powers set forth in its charter, the

Audit Committee does not have the duty to plan or conduct audits or to determine that Dollar
General’s financial statements are complete, accurate, or in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Dollar General’s management and independent auditor have this responsibility.

This report has been furnished by the members of the Audit Committee:

PROPOSAL 3:
RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF AUDITORS

Who is responsible for the selection of the independent auditor?

The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and

oversight of the independent auditor that is retained to audit our financial statements.

Was the Audit Committee involved in the lead audit partner selection process?

Yes. Prior to the selection of the current lead audit partner, the Chairman of the Audit

Committee interviewed the lead audit partner candidates, and the Audit Committee discussed with
management such candidates’ qualifications and experience.

Does the Audit Committee evaluate the independent auditor and the lead audit partner?

Yes. The Audit Committee annually evaluates the lead audit partner, as well as the

independent auditor’s qualifications, performance, and independence. The evaluation, which includes
the input of management, entails consideration of a broad range of factors, including the quality of
services and sufficiency of resources that have been provided; the skills, knowledge, and experience of
the firm and the audit team; the effectiveness and sufficiency of communications and interactions;
independence and level of objectivity and professional skepticism; reasonableness of fees; and other
factors.

Who has the Audit Committee selected as the independent registered public accounting firm?

After conducting the evaluation process discussed above, the Audit Committee selected

Ernst & Young LLP as our independent auditor for the 2018 fiscal year. Ernst & Young LLP has
served in that capacity since October 2001. The Audit Committee and the Board of Directors believe
that the continued retention of Ernst & Young LLP is in the best interests of Dollar General and our
shareholders.

Will representatives of Ernst & Young LLP attend the annual meeting?

Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP have been requested and are expected to attend the

annual meeting. These representatives will have the opportunity to make a statement if they so desire
and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions.

What does the Board of Directors recommend?

Our Board unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the ratification of Ernst &

Young LLP as our independent auditor for the 2018 fiscal year. The Audit Committee is not bound by
a vote either for or against the firm. If the shareholders do not ratify this appointment, our Audit
Committee will consider that result in selecting our independent auditor in the future.

2017 and 2016, respectively, for work related to work opportunity tax credit assistance and foreign sourcing offices’
tax compliance, as well as state tax credit assistance in 2017. The remaining tax fees for each such year are for tax
advisory services related to inventory.

(4)

2017 and 2016 fees are for a subscription fee to an on-line accounting research tool.

How does the Audit Committee pre-approve services provided by the independent auditor?

The Audit Committee pre-approves all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by

our independent auditor. Where feasible, the Committee considers and, when appropriate,
pre-approves services at regularly scheduled meetings after disclosure by management and the
independent auditor of the nature of the proposed services, the estimated fees (when available), and
their opinions that the services will not impair the independence of the independent auditor. The
Committee’s Chairman (or any Committee member if the Chairman is unavailable) may pre-approve
such services between Committee meetings, and must report to the Committee at its next meeting with
respect to all services so pre-approved. The Committee pre-approved 100% of the services provided by
Ernst & Young LLP during 2017 and 2016.

REPORTING COMPLIANCE

The U.S. securities laws require our executive officers, directors, and greater than 10%

shareholders to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership on Forms 3, 4, and 5 with the SEC.
Based solely upon a review of these reports furnished to us during and with respect to 2017, or written
representations that no Form 5 reports were required, we believe that each of those persons filed, on a
timely basis, the reports required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.

All shareholder proposals and notices discussed below must be mailed to Corporate Secretary,

Dollar General Corporation, 100 Mission Ridge, Goodlettsville, Tennessee 37072. Shareholder

2019 annual meeting of shareholders (the ‘‘2019 Annual Meeting’’), eligible shareholders must submit

shareholder, or a group of up to 20 shareholders, owning 3% or more of our stock continuously for at

INTRODUCTION 

This report contains references to years 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, and 2013, which represent fiscal 
years ending or ended February 1, 2019, February 2, 2018, February 3, 2017, January 29, 2016, January 30, 2015, 
and January 31, 2014, respectively. Our fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to January 31. Our 2016 fiscal year 
consisted of 53 weeks, while each of the remaining years listed are or were 52-week years. All of the discussion 
and analysis in this report should be read with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the Consolidated Financial 
Statements and related notes. 

 
Solely for convenience, our trademarks and tradenames may appear in this report without the ® or TM 

symbol which is not intended to indicate that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our 
rights or the right to these trademarks and tradenames. 
 
Cautionary Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 

We include “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws throughout 

this report, particularly under the headings “Business,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations,” and “Note 7 – Commitments and Contingencies,” among others. You can 
identify these statements because they are not limited to historical fact or they use words such as “may,” “will,” 
“should,” “could,” “can,” “would,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “project,” “plan,” “expect,” “estimate,” “forecast,” 
“goal,” “seek,” “ensure,” “potential,” “opportunity,” “objective,” “intend,” “predict,” “committed,” “likely to,” 
“continue,” “scheduled to,” “focused on,” or “subject to” and similar expressions that concern our strategy, plans, 
initiatives, intentions or beliefs about future occurrences or results. For example, all statements relating to, among 
others, our estimated and projected expenditures, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and 
liquidity; our plans and objectives for, and expectations regarding future operations, economic and competitive 
market conditions, growth or initiatives including but not limited to the number of planned store openings, 
remodels and relocations and planned opening dates for new distribution centers, progress of merchandising and 
other initiatives, trends in sales of consumable and non-consumable products, and the level of future costs and 
expenses; potential future stock repurchases and cash dividends; anticipated borrowing under our credit facilities 
and commercial paper program; or the expected outcome or effect of legislative or regulatory changes or 
initiatives, and our responses thereto, or of pending or threatened litigation or audits are forward-looking 
statements.  

 
All forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our 
actual results to differ materially from those which we expected. Many of these statements are derived from our 
operating budgets and forecasts, which are based on many detailed assumptions that we believe are reasonable. 
However, it is very difficult to predict the effect of known factors, and we cannot anticipate all factors that could 
affect future results.  

 
Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in or 
implied in our forward-looking statements are disclosed under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in 
this document (including, without limitation, in conjunction with the forward-looking statements themselves and 
under the heading “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates”). All forward-looking statements are qualified in 
their entirety by these and other cautionary statements that we make from time to time in our other SEC filings 
and public communications. You should evaluate forward-looking statements in the context of these risks and 
uncertainties and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements. These factors may not contain all 
of the factors that are important to you. We cannot assure you that we will realize the results or developments we 
expect or anticipate or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the consequences or affect us or our 
operations in the way we expect. Forward-looking statements in this report are made only as of the date hereof. 
We undertake no obligation, and specifically disclaim any duty, to update or revise any forward-looking statement 
as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law.

 PART I 

 
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS 
 
General 
 

 

Our History 

We are among the largest discount retailers in the United States by number of stores, with 14,609 stores 
located in 44 states as of March 2, 2018, with the greatest concentration of stores in the southern, southwestern, 
midwestern and eastern United States. We offer a broad selection of merchandise, including consumables, 
seasonal items, home products and apparel. Our merchandise includes national brands from leading 
manufacturers, as well as our own private brand selections with prices at substantial discounts to national brands. 
We offer our customers these national brand and private brand products at everyday low prices (typically $10 or 
less) in our convenient small-box locations. 

 
J.L. Turner founded our Company in 1939 as J.L. Turner and Son, Wholesale. We were incorporated as a 

Kentucky corporation under the name J.L. Turner & Son, Inc. in 1955, when we opened our first Dollar General 
store. We changed our name to Dollar General Corporation in 1968 and reincorporated in 1998 as a Tennessee 
corporation. Our common stock was publicly traded from 1968 until July 2007, when we merged with an entity 
controlled by investment funds affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., or KKR. In November 2009 
our common stock again became publicly traded, and in December 2013 the entity controlled by investment funds 
affiliated with KKR sold its remaining shares of our common stock.  
 
Our Business Model 
 

Our long history of profitable growth is founded on a commitment to a relatively simple business model: 
providing a broad base of customers with their basic everyday and household needs, supplemented with a variety 
of general merchandise items, at everyday low prices in conveniently located, small-box stores. We continually 
evaluate the needs and demands of our customers and modify our merchandise selections and pricing accordingly, 
while remaining focused on increasing profitability, cash generation and returns for our shareholders. 

 
Our long-term operating priorities remain: 1) driving profitable sales growth, 2) capturing growth 

opportunities, 3) enhancing our position as a low-cost operator, and 4) investing in our people as a competitive 
advantage.  For more information on these operating priorities, see the “Executive Overview” section of 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in Part II, 
Item 7 of this report.  

 
In fiscal year 2017, we achieved our 28th consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth. We 

believe that this growth, which has taken place in a variety of economic conditions, is a result of our compelling 
value and convenience proposition, although no assurances can be given that we will achieve positive same-store 
sales growth in any given year.  

 
Compelling Value and Convenience Proposition.  Our ability to deliver highly competitive prices in 

convenient locations and our easy “in and out” shopping format create a compelling shopping experience that we 
believe distinguishes us from other discount retailers as well as convenience, drug, grocery, online and mass 
merchant retailers. Our slogan “Save time. Save money. Every day!” summarizes our appeal to customers. We 
believe our ability to effectively deliver both value and convenience allows us to succeed in small markets with 
limited shopping alternatives, as well as in larger and more competitive markets. Our value and convenience 
proposition is evidenced by the following attributes of our business model: 

 
• 

Convenient Locations.  Our stores are conveniently located in a variety of rural, suburban and 
urban communities. We seek to locate our stores in close proximity to our customers, which 

 
4  Dollar General        2017 Form 10-K 

 
 

 
• 

 
• 

helps drive customer loyalty and trip frequency and makes us an attractive alternative to large 
discount and other large-box retail and grocery stores. 

Time-Saving Shopping Experience.  We strive to provide customers with a highly convenient, 
easy to navigate shopping experience. Our small-box stores make it easier to get in and out 
quickly. Our product offering includes most necessities, such as basic packaged and refrigerated 
food and dairy products, cleaning supplies, paper products, health and beauty care items, 
greeting cards and other stationery items, basic apparel, housewares, hardware and automotive 
supplies, among others. Our convenient hours and broad merchandise offering allow our 
customers to fulfill their routine shopping requirements and minimize their need to shop 
elsewhere. 

Everyday Low Prices on Quality Merchandise.  Our research indicates that we offer a price 
advantage over most food and drug retailers and that our prices are competitive with even the 
largest discount retailers. Our ability to offer everyday low prices on quality merchandise is 
supported by our low-cost operating structure and our strategy to maintain a limited number of 
items per merchandise category, which we believe helps us maintain strong purchasing power. 
We offer nationally advertised brands at these everyday low prices in addition to offering our 
own private brands at substantially lower prices. 

 

Substantial Growth Opportunities.  We believe we have substantial long-term growth potential in the 

U.S. We have identified significant opportunities to add new stores in both existing and new markets. In addition, 
we have opportunities to relocate or remodel locations within our existing store base to better serve our customers. 
Our attractive store economics, including a relatively low initial investment and simple, low-cost operating model 
have allowed us to grow our store base to current levels and provide us significant opportunities to continue our 
profitable store growth strategy. 

 

Our Merchandise 

 
We offer a focused assortment of everyday necessities, which we believe helps to drive frequent 
customer visits, and key items in a broad range of general merchandise categories. Our product assortment 
provides the opportunity for our customers to address most of their basic shopping needs with one trip. We offer a 
wide selection of nationally advertised brands from leading manufacturers. Additionally, our private brand 
products offer even greater value with options to purchase products that we believe to be of comparable quality to 
national brands as well as value items, each at substantial discounts to the national brands. 

 
Consumables is our largest merchandise category and has become a larger percentage of our total sales in 

recent years as indicated in the table below. Consumables include paper and cleaning products (such as paper 
towels, bath tissue, paper dinnerware, trash and storage bags, laundry and other home cleaning supplies); 
packaged food (such as cereals, canned soups and vegetables, condiments, spices, sugar and flour); perishables 
(such as milk, eggs, bread, refrigerated and frozen food, beer and wine); snacks (such as candy, cookies, crackers, 
salty snacks and carbonated beverages); health and beauty (such as over-the-counter medicines and personal care 
products including soap, body wash, shampoo, dental hygiene and foot care products); pet (such as pet supplies 
and pet food); and tobacco products. 

 
Seasonal products include decorations, toys, batteries, small electronics, greeting cards, stationery, 

prepaid phones and accessories, gardening supplies, hardware, automotive and home office supplies. 

 
Home products include kitchen supplies, cookware, small appliances, light bulbs, storage containers, 

frames, candles, craft supplies and kitchen, bed and bath soft goods. 

 
Apparel includes casual everyday apparel for infants, toddlers, girls, boys, women and men, as well as 

socks, underwear, disposable diapers, shoes and accessories.

Our seasonal and home products categories typically account for the highest gross profit margins, and the 

consumables category typically accounts for the lowest gross profit margin. 

The Dollar General Store 
 

The typical Dollar General store is operated by a store manager, one or more assistant store managers, 

and three or more sales associates. Our stores generally feature a low-cost, no frills building with limited 
maintenance capital, low operating costs, and a focused merchandise offering within a broad range of categories, 
allowing us to deliver low retail prices while generating strong cash flows and capital investment returns. Our 
stores average approximately 7,400 square feet of selling space and approximately 75% of our stores are located 
in towns of 20,000 or fewer people. We generally have had good success in locating suitable store sites in the past, 
and we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets. In addition, we 
believe we have significant opportunities available for our relocation and remodel programs. 

 
Our store growth over the past three years is summarized in the following table:

Our Customers 
 

Our customers seek value and convenience. Depending on their financial situation and geographic 

proximity, customers’ reliance on Dollar General varies from fill-in shopping, to making periodic trips to stock up 
on household items, to making weekly or more frequent trips to meet most essential needs. We generally locate 
our stores and plan our merchandise selections to best serve the needs of our core customers, the low and fixed 
income households often underserved by other retailers, and we are focused on helping them make the most of 
their spending dollars. At the same time, however, loyal Dollar General shoppers from a wide range of income 
brackets and life stages appreciate our quality merchandise as well as our attractive value and convenience 
proposition. 
 
Our Suppliers 

 
We purchase merchandise from a wide variety of suppliers and maintain direct buying relationships with 
many producers of national brand merchandise. Despite our broad offering, we maintain only a limited number of 
items per category, allowing us to keep our average costs low. Our largest and second largest suppliers each 
accounted for approximately 8% of our purchases in 2017. Our private brands come from a diversified supplier 
base. We directly imported approximately 5% of our purchases at cost in 2017.  

 

 

 

 
6  Dollar General        2017 Form 10-K 

 
 

We have consistently managed to obtain sufficient quantities of core merchandise and believe that, if one 

or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable, we generally would be able to obtain alternative 
sources; however, such alternative sources could increase our merchandise costs or reduce the quality of our 
merchandise, and an inability to obtain alternative sources could adversely affect our sales. 

Distribution and Transportation 
 

Our stores are currently supported by fifteen distribution centers located strategically throughout our 

geographic footprint. Our sixteenth and seventeenth distribution centers in Longview, Texas and Amsterdam, New 
York, respectively, are under construction and each is expected to be completed in 2019. We lease additional 
temporary warehouse space as necessary to support our distribution needs. We continually analyze and rebalance 
the network to ensure that it remains efficient and provides the service levels our stores require. 
See “— Properties” below for additional information pertaining to our distribution centers. 

 
Most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers and is delivered to our stores by third-

party trucking firms, utilizing our trailers. We also own 79 semi-trailer trucks with which we transport our 
merchandise. In addition, vendors or third-party distributors ship certain food items and other merchandise 
directly to our stores. 
 
Seasonality 
 

Our business is somewhat seasonal. Generally, our most profitable sales mix occurs in the fourth quarter, 

which includes the Christmas selling season. In addition, our quarterly results can be affected by the timing of 
certain holidays, the timing of new store openings and store closings, and the amount of sales contributed by new 
and existing stores. We typically purchase substantial amounts of inventory in the third quarter and incur higher 
shipping and payroll costs in the third quarter in anticipation of increased sales activity during the fourth quarter. 
See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 
Our Competition 

 
We operate in the basic discount consumer goods market, which is highly competitive with respect to 

price, store location, merchandise quality, assortment and presentation, in-stock consistency, and customer 
service. We compete with discount stores and with many other retailers, including mass merchandise, warehouse 
club, grocery, drug, convenience, variety, online, and certain specialty stores. These other retail companies operate 
stores in many of the areas where we operate, and many of them engage in extensive advertising and marketing 
efforts. Our direct competitors include Family Dollar, Dollar Tree, Big Lots, Fred’s, 99 Cents Only and various 
local, independent operators, as well as Walmart, Target, Kroger, Aldi, Lidl, Walgreens, CVS, and RiteAid, 
among others. Certain of our competitors have greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than 
we do. Competition has intensified and we believe it will continue to do so as competitors move into or increase 
their presence in our geographic and product markets and increase the availability of mobile, web-based and other 
digital technology to facilitate a more convenient and competitive customer online and in-store shopping 
experience. 

 
We believe that we differentiate ourselves from other forms of retailing by offering consistently low 

prices in a convenient, small-store format. We believe that our prices are competitive due in part to our low-cost 
operating structure and the relatively limited assortment of products offered. Purchasing large volumes of 
merchandise within our focused assortment in each merchandise category allows us to keep our average costs low, 
contributing to our ability to offer competitive everyday low prices to our customers. See “—Our Business 
Model” above for further discussion of our competitive situation.

Our Employees 

 
As of March 2, 2018, we employed approximately 129,000 full-time and part-time employees, including 
divisional and regional managers, district managers, store managers, other store personnel and distribution center 
and administrative personnel. We have increasingly focused on recruiting, training, motivating and retaining 
employees, and we believe that the quality, performance and morale of our employees continue to be an important 
part of our success in recent years. We believe our overall relationship with our employees is good.

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS 

 
You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this 

report and other filings that we make from time to time with the SEC, including our consolidated financial 
statements and accompanying notes. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our 
business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. These risks are not the only risks we face. Our 
business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity could also be adversely affected by additional 
factors that apply to all companies generally or by risks not currently known to us or that we currently view to be 
immaterial. We can provide no assurance and make no representation that our risk mitigation efforts, although we 
believe they are reasonable, will be successful. 
 

Economic conditions and other economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance and 

other aspects of our business by negatively impacting our customers’ disposable income or discretionary 
spending, affecting our ability to plan and execute our strategic initiatives, increasing our costs of goods sold 
and selling, general and administrative expenses, and adversely affecting our sales or profitability. 

 
We believe many of our customers have fixed or low incomes and generally have limited discretionary 
spending dollars. Any factor that could adversely affect that disposable income would decrease our customers’ 
confidence, spending, and number of trips to our stores, and could cause our customers to shift their spending to 
products other than those sold by us or to our less profitable product choices, all of which could result in lower net 
sales, decreases in inventory turnover, greater markdowns on inventory, a change in the mix of products we sell, 
and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins. Factors that could reduce our customers’ disposable income 
and over which we exercise no influence include but are not limited to adverse economic conditions such as 
increased or sustained high unemployment or underemployment levels, inflation, increases in fuel or other energy 
costs and interest rates, lack of available credit, consumer debt levels, higher tax rates and other changes in tax 
laws, uncertainty regarding government mandated participation in health insurance programs, increasing 
healthcare and housing costs, and decreases in, or elimination of, government subsidies such as unemployment 
and food assistance programs. 

 
Many of the factors identified above that affect disposable income, as well as commodity rates, 

transportation costs (including the costs of fuel), costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, foreign exchange rate 
fluctuations, lease costs, measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade 
(including increased import duties or tariffs), or changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors, 
also affect our ability to plan and execute our strategic initiatives, our cost of goods sold, our selling, general and 
administrative expenses, and our real estate costs, and may have other adverse consequences which we are unable 
to fully anticipate or control, all of which may adversely affect our sales or profitability. We have limited or no 
ability to control many of these factors. 

 
Our plans depend significantly on strategies and initiatives designed to increase sales and profit and 

improve the efficiencies, costs and effectiveness of our operations, and failure to achieve or sustain these plans 
could affect our performance adversely. 
 

We have short-term and long-term strategies and initiatives (such as those relating to merchandising, 

marketing, real estate and new store development, digital, sourcing, shrink, private brand, inventory management, 
distribution and transportation, store operations, store formats, budgeting and expense reduction, and technology) 
in various stages of testing, evaluation, and implementation, upon which we expect to rely to continue to improve 
our results of operations and financial condition and to achieve our financial plans. These initiatives are inherently 
risky and uncertain, even when tested successfully, in their application to our business in general. It is possible 
that successful testing can result partially from resources and attention that cannot be duplicated in broader 
implementation, particularly in light of the diverse geographic locations of our stores and the decentralized nature 
of our field management. General implementation also may be negatively affected by other risk factors described 
herein. Successful systemwide implementation relies on consistency of training, stability of workforce, ease of 
execution, and the absence of offsetting factors that can influence results adversely. Failure to achieve successful 

 
 

 

Dollar General        2017 Form 10-K 

9

implementation of our initiatives or the cost of these initiatives exceeding management’s estimates could 
adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

The success of our merchandising initiatives, particularly those with respect to non-consumable 

merchandise and store-specific products and allocations, depends in part upon our ability to predict consistently 
and successfully the products that our customers will demand and to identify and timely respond to evolving 
trends in demographic mixes in our markets and consumer preferences, expectations and needs. If we are unable 
to select products that are attractive to customers, to timely obtain such products at costs that allow us to sell them 
at an acceptable profit, or to effectively market such products, our sales, market share and profitability could be 
adversely affected. If our merchandising efforts in the non-consumables area or the higher margin areas within 
consumables are unsuccessful, we could be further adversely affected by our inability to offset the lower margins 
associated with our consumables business.  
 

If we cannot open, relocate or remodel stores profitably and on schedule, our planned future growth 

will be impeded, which would adversely affect sales. 

 
Our ability to open, relocate and remodel profitable stores is a key component of our planned future 

growth. Our ability to timely open stores and to expand into additional market areas depends in part on the 
following factors: the availability of attractive store locations; the absence of entitlement process or occupancy 
delays; the ability to negotiate acceptable lease and development terms; the ability to hire and train new personnel, 
especially store managers, in a cost effective manner; the ability to identify customer demand in different 
geographic areas; general economic conditions; and the availability of capital funding for expansion. Many of 
these factors also affect our ability to successfully relocate stores, and many of them are beyond our control. 

 
Delays or failures in opening new stores or completing relocations or remodels, or achieving lower than 

expected sales in these projects, could materially adversely affect our growth and/or profitability. We also may not 
anticipate all of the challenges imposed by the expansion of our operations and, as a result, may not meet our 
targets for opening new stores, remodeling or relocating stores or expanding profitably. In addition, our 
construction costs could increase as a result of economic factors discussed above. 

 
Some new stores and future new store opportunities may be located in areas, including but not limited to 
new states or metro urban areas, where we have limited or no meaningful experience or brand recognition. Those 
areas may have different competitive and market conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns 
than our existing markets, as well as higher cost of entry. These factors may cause our new stores to be initially 
less successful than stores in our existing markets, which could slow future growth in these areas. 

 
Many new stores will be located in areas where we have existing stores. Although we have experience in 

these areas, increasing the number of locations in these markets may result in inadvertent oversaturation and 
temporarily or permanently divert customers and sales from our existing stores, thereby adversely affecting our 
overall financial performance. 

 
We face intense competition that could limit our growth opportunities and adversely impact our 

financial performance. 
 

The retail business is highly competitive with respect to price, store location, merchandise quality, 

product assortment and presentation, in-stock consistency, customer service, promotional activity, customers, 
market share, and employees. We compete with discount stores and with many other retailers, including mass 
merchandise, warehouse club, grocery, drug, convenience, variety, online retailers, and certain specialty stores. 
This competitive environment subjects us to the risk of adverse impact to our financial performance because of the 
lower prices, and thus the lower margins, that may be required to maintain our competitive position. Also, as a 
discount retailer, due to customer demographics and other factors, we may have limited ability to increase prices 
in response to increased costs without losing competitive position. This limitation may adversely affect our 
margins and financial performance. Certain of our competitors have greater financial, distribution, marketing and 
other resources than we do and may be able to secure better arrangements with suppliers than we can. If we fail to 

 
10  Dollar General        2017 Form 10-K 

 
 

respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets, it could adversely affect our 
financial performance. 

Competition for customers has intensified as competitors have moved into, or increased their presence in, 

our geographic and product markets and increased the availability of mobile, web-based and other digital 
technology to facilitate a more convenient and competitive customer online and in-store shopping experience. We 
expect this competition to continue to increase. We remain vulnerable to the marketing power and high level of 
consumer recognition of larger competitors and to the risk that these competitors or others could venture into our 
industry in a significant way, including through the introduction of new store formats. Further, consolidation 
within the retail industry could significantly alter the competitive dynamics of the retail marketplace. This 
consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to 
merchandise, greater market penetration and other improvements in their competitive positions, as well as result in 
the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by these consolidated companies, 
which could adversely affect our financial performance. 

 
Our profitability may be negatively affected by inventory shrinkage. 
 
We are subject to the risk of inventory loss and theft. We experience significant inventory shrinkage and 

cannot be sure that incidences of inventory loss and theft will decrease in the future or that the measures we are 
taking will effectively reduce the problem of inventory shrinkage. Although some level of inventory shrinkage is 
an unavoidable cost of doing business, if we were to experience higher rates of inventory shrinkage or incur 
increased security or other costs to combat inventory theft, our results of operations and financial condition could 
be affected adversely. 

 
Our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected if we are not successful in managing our 

inventory balances. 
 

Our inventory balance represented approximately 52% of our total assets exclusive of goodwill and other 

intangible assets as of February 2, 2018. Efficient inventory management is a key component of our business 
success and profitability. To be successful, we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate 
product mix to meet our customers’ demands without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the 
costs to store and hold the goods unduly impacts our financial results or that subjects us to the risk of increased 
inventory shrinkage. If our buying decisions do not accurately predict customer trends, we inappropriately price 
products or our expectations about customer spending levels are inaccurate, we may have to take unanticipated 
markdowns to dispose of the excess inventory, which also can adversely impact our financial results. We continue 
to focus on ways to reduce these risks, but we cannot make assurances that we will be successful in our inventory 
management. If we are not successful in managing our inventory balances, our cash flows from operations may be 
negatively affected. 

 
Any failure to maintain the security of information we hold relating to proprietary business 
information or our customers, employees and vendors, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or 
otherwise, could expose us to litigation, government enforcement actions and costly response measures, and 
could materially disrupt our operations and harm our reputation and sales. 

 
In connection with sales, we transmit confidential credit and debit card information. We also have access 

to, collect or maintain certain private or confidential information regarding our customers, employees and 
vendors, as well as our business. Some of this information is stored digitally in connection with our e-commerce 
website and our mobile applications, some of which may leverage third-party service providers. Additionally, 
under certain circumstances, we may share information with vendors that assist us in conducting our business (for 
example, third-party service providers assist us in the transmittal of credit and debit card information in 
connection with sales), as required by law, or otherwise in accordance with our privacy policy. While we have 
implemented procedures and technology intended to protect and safeguard our information and require 
appropriate controls of our service providers, it is possible that cyberattackers might compromise our security 
measures or those of our technology and other vendors or service providers in the future and obtain the personal 
information of our customers, employees and vendors that we hold or our business information, as cyberattacks  

 
 

 

Dollar General        2017 Form 10-K  11

are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other 
storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion. 
Moreover, employee error or malfeasance or other irregularities may result in a defeat of our or our third-party 
vendors’ security measures and breach our or our third-party vendors’ information systems. If customer passwords 
are obtained through unrelated third-party breaches, cyberattackers also could gain access to our customers’ 
accounts. 
 
Because we accept debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to industry data protection 

standards and protocols, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“PCI DSS”), issued by the 
Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. Additionally, we have implemented technology in our stores 
to allow for the acceptance of Europay, Mastercard and Visa (EMV) credit transactions and point-to-point 
encryption. Complying with PCI DSS standards and implementing related procedures, technology and information 
security measures require significant resources and ongoing attention. However, even as we comply with PCI DSS 
standards and offer EMV and point-to-point encryption technology in our stores, we may be vulnerable to, and 
unable to detect and appropriately respond to, data security breaches and data loss, including cybersecurity attacks 
or other breach of cardholder data.  

 
A security breach of any kind (whether experienced by us or one of our vendors), which could be 
undetected for a period of time, or any failure by us to comply with the applicable privacy and information 
security laws, regulations and standards could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation, government enforcement 
actions, fines or penalties, credit card brand assessments, and costly response measures (including, for example, 
providing notification to, and credit monitoring services for, affected customers, as well as further upgrades to our 
security measures) which may not be covered by or may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies, and 
could materially disrupt our operations. Any resulting negative media attention and publicity could significantly 
harm our reputation which could cause us to lose market share as a result of customers discontinuing the use of 
debit or credit cards in our stores or not shopping in our stores altogether and could have a material adverse effect 
on our business and financial performance. 

 
A significant disruption to our distribution network, to the capacity of our distribution centers or to the 

timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase our transportation costs, which would 
decrease our profits. 

 
We rely on our distribution and transportation network to provide goods to our stores in a timely and 

cost-effective manner. Using various modes of transportation, including ocean, rail, and truck, we and our vendors 
move goods from vendor locations to our distribution centers. Deliveries to our stores occur from our distribution 
centers or directly from our vendors. Any disruption, unanticipated or unusual expense or operational failure 
related to this process could affect store operations negatively. For example, delivery delays or increases in 
transportation costs (including through increased fuel costs, increased carrier rates or driver wages as a result of 
driver shortages, a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments, or work stoppages or slowdowns) 
could significantly decrease our ability to make sales and earn profits. Labor shortages or work stoppages in the 
transportation industry or long-term disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that 
lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries or which would necessitate our securing alternative labor or shipping 
suppliers could also increase our costs or otherwise negatively affect our business. 

 
We maintain a network of distribution facilities and are moving forward with plans to build new facilities 
to support our growth objectives. Delays in opening distribution centers could adversely affect our future financial 
performance by slowing store growth, which may in turn reduce revenue growth, or by increasing transportation 
costs. In addition, distribution-related construction or expansion projects entail risks that could cause delays and 
cost overruns, such as: shortages of materials or skilled labor; work stoppages; unforeseen construction, 
scheduling, engineering, environmental or geological problems; weather interference; fires or other casualty 
losses; and unanticipated cost increases. For these reasons, the completion date and ultimate cost of these projects 
could differ significantly from initial expectations, and we cannot guarantee that any project will be completed on 
time or within established budgets. 

 

 
12  Dollar General        2017 Form 10-K 

 
 

Risks associated with or faced by our suppliers could adversely affect our financial performance. 
 
The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, and we are 
dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner. In 2017, our largest and second 
largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 8% of our purchases. We have not experienced any difficulty 
in obtaining sufficient quantities of core merchandise and believe that, if one or more of our current sources of 
supply became unavailable, we would generally be able to obtain alternative sources. However, such alternative 
sources could increase our merchandise costs, result in a temporary reduction in store inventory levels, and reduce 
the quality of our merchandise, and an inability to obtain alternative sources could adversely affect our sales. 
Additionally, if a supplier fails to deliver on its commitments, whether due to financial difficulties or other 
reasons, we could experience merchandise out-of-stocks that could lead to lost sales and damage to our reputation. 

 
We directly imported approximately 5% of our purchases (measured at cost) in 2017, but many of our 
domestic vendors directly import their products or components of their products. Changes to the prices and flow 
of these goods for any reason, such as political unrest or acts of war, currency fluctuations, disruptions in maritime 
lanes, port labor disputes, and economic conditions and instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are 
located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers’ failure to meet our standards, issues with labor practices of 
our suppliers or labor problems they may experience (such as strikes, stoppages or slowdowns, which could also 
increase labor costs during and following the disruption), the availability and cost of raw materials to suppliers, 
increased import duties, merchandise quality or safety issues, transport availability and cost, increases in wage 
rates and taxes, transport security, inflation, and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which 
they are located or from which they import, are beyond our control and could adversely affect our operations and 
profitability. While we are working to diversify our sources of imported goods and reduce the percentage of goods 
imported from China, a substantial amount of our imported merchandise still comes from China, and thus, a 
change in the Chinese leadership, economic and market conditions, internal economic stimulus actions, or 
currency or other policies, as well as increases in costs of labor and wage taxes, could negatively impact our 
merchandise costs. In addition, the United States’ foreign trade policies, duties, tariffs and other impositions on 
imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of 
goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade and 
port labor agreements are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to 
products could adversely affect our business and financial performance. As we increase our imports of 
merchandise from foreign vendors, the risks associated with these imports also will increase, and we may be 
exposed to additional or different risks as we increase imports of goods produced in countries other than China. 

 
Product liability, product recall or other product safety or labeling claims could adversely affect our 

business, reputation and financial performance. 

 
All of our vendors and their products must comply with applicable product safety laws and regulations 
(including those relating to product labeling), and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy 
comply with all applicable safety and labeling standards.  However, product liability, personal injury or other 
claims may be asserted against us relating to product contamination, product tampering, product expiration, 
mislabeling, recall and other safety or labeling issues with respect to the products that we sell. 

 
We seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from 

our vendors. If we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available, such claims could 
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to obtain 
indemnification from foreign vendors may be hindered by our ability to obtain jurisdiction over such vendors to 
enforce contractual indemnification obligations. Even with adequate insurance and indemnification, such claims 
could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in our products. Our litigation expenses could 
increase as well, which also could have a materially negative impact on our results of operations even if a product 
liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued.

Our private brands may not be successful in improving our gross profit rate and may increase certain 

of the risks we face. 
 

The sale of private brand items is an important component of our sales growth and gross profit rate 
enhancement plans. We have invested in our development and procurement resources and marketing efforts 
relating to these private brand offerings. We believe that our success in maintaining broad market acceptance of 
our private brands depends on many factors, including pricing, our costs, quality, customer perception and the 
timely development and introduction of new products. We may not achieve or maintain our expected sales for our 
private brands. The sale and expansion of our private brand offerings also subjects us to certain risks, such as: 
potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls; potential supply chain and distribution 
chain disruptions for raw materials and finished products; our ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights 
and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties; our ability to 
successfully administer and comply with applicable contractual obligations and legal and regulatory requirements; 
and other risks generally encountered by entities that source, sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail. 
An increase in sales of our private brands may also adversely affect sales of our vendors’ products, which, in turn, 
could adversely affect our relationship with certain of our vendors. Any failure to appropriately address some or 
all of these risks could have a significant adverse effect on our private brand initiatives and on our reputation, 
business, results of operations and financial condition. 

 
We are subject to governmental regulations, procedures and requirements. A significant change in, or 

noncompliance with, these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. 
 

Our business is subject to numerous and frequently changing federal, state and local laws and 

regulations. We routinely incur significant costs in complying with these regulations. The complexity of the 
regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are increasing due to additional 
legal and regulatory requirements, our expanding operations, and increased enforcement efforts. Further, 
uncertainties exist regarding the future application of certain of these legal requirements to our business. New 
laws, regulations, policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices, particularly those dealing 
with environmental compliance, product safety or labeling, food safety, information security and privacy, and 
labor and employment, among others, or changes in existing laws, regulations, policies and the related 
interpretations and enforcement practices, particularly those governing the sale of products or employee wages, 
may result in significant added expenses or may require extensive system and operating changes that may be 
difficult to implement and/or could materially increase our cost of doing business. Untimely compliance or 
noncompliance with applicable regulations or untimely or incomplete execution of a required product recall, can 
result in the imposition of penalties (including loss of licenses, eligibility to accept certain government benefits 
such as SNAP or significant fines or monetary penalties), class action litigation or other litigation, in addition to 
reputational damage. Additionally, changes in tax laws, the interpretation of existing laws, or our failure to sustain 
our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our overall effective tax rate. 

 
Litigation may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
Our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, consumers, suppliers, competitors, 

shareholders, government agencies and others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, 
regulatory actions or other litigation. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory 
actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or 
indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for 
substantial periods of time. In addition, certain of these lawsuits, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may 
result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if 
changes to our business operations are required. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant. There also 
may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our 
business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, 
litigation may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. See Note 7 to the 
consolidated financial statements for further details regarding certain of these pending matters.

Our current insurance program may expose us to unexpected costs and negatively affect our financial 

performance. 

 
Our insurance coverage reflects deductibles, self-insured retentions, limits of liability and similar 

provisions that we believe are prudent based on the dispersion of our operations. However, there are types of 
losses we may incur but against which we cannot be insured or which we believe are not economically reasonable 
to insure, such as losses due to acts of war, employee and certain other crime, certain wage and hour and other 
employment-related claims, including class actions, actions based on certain consumer protection laws, and some 
natural and other disasters or similar events. If we incur these losses and they are material, our business could 
suffer. Certain material events may result in sizable losses for the insurance industry and adversely impact the 
availability of adequate insurance coverage or result in excessive premium increases. To offset negative insurance 
market trends, we may elect to self-insure, accept higher deductibles or reduce the amount of coverage in response 
to these market changes. In addition, we self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers’ 
compensation, automobile liability, general liability (including claims made against certain of our landlords) and 
group health insurance programs. Unanticipated changes in any applicable actuarial assumptions and management 
estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these losses, including expected increases in medical and 
indemnity costs, could result in materially different expenses than expected under these programs, which could 
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Although we continue to 
maintain property insurance for catastrophic events at our store support center and distribution centers, we are 
effectively self-insured for other property losses. If we experience a greater number of these losses than we 
anticipate, our financial performance could be adversely affected. 

 
Natural disasters and unusual weather conditions (whether or not caused by climate change), 

pandemic outbreaks, terrorist acts, and global political events could disrupt business and result in lower sales 
and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance. 

 
The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes and 

earthquakes, unusual weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks, terrorist acts or disruptive global political events, 
such as civil unrest in countries in which our suppliers are located, or similar disruptions could adversely affect 
our business and financial performance. Uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect consumer 
shopping patterns, which could lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our 
short-term results of operations. To the extent these events result in the closure of one or more of our distribution 
centers, a significant number of stores, or our corporate headquarters or impact one or more of our key suppliers, 
our operations and financial performance could be materially adversely affected through an inability to make 
deliveries or provide other support functions to our stores and through lost sales. In addition, these events could 
result in increases in fuel (or other energy) prices or a fuel shortage, delays in opening new stores, the temporary 
lack of an adequate work force in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from 
some domestic and overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, delay or 
increased transportation costs in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores, the inability of 
customers to reach or have transportation to our stores directly affected by such events, the temporary reduction in 
the availability of products in our stores and disruption of our utility services or to our information systems. These 
events also can have indirect consequences such as increases in the costs of insurance if they result in significant 
loss of property or other insurable damage. 

 
Material damage or interruptions to our information systems as a result of external factors, staffing 

shortages or challenges or difficulties in maintaining or updating our existing technology or developing or 
implementing new technology could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. 

 
We depend on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of our business, 

including, without limitation the processing of transactions and the management of our employees, facilities, 
logistics, inventories, stores and customer-facing digital operations. We are continually improving our information 
processes and computer systems to better run our business. These technology initiatives may not deliver desired 
results or may do so on a delayed schedule. Additionally, such systems are subject to damage or interruption from 
power outages, facility damage, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cybersecurity 
breaches, cyber attacks (including malicious codes, worms, phishing and denial of service attacks, and  

 
 

 

Dollar General        2017 Form 10-K  15

ransomware), software upgrade failures or code defects, natural disasters and human error. Damage or interruption 
to, or defects of design related to, these systems may require a significant investment to fix or replace them, and 
we may suffer interruptions or disruptions in our operations in the interim, may experience loss or corruption of 
critical data and may receive negative publicity, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
or results of operations. 

 
We also rely heavily on our information technology staff. Failure to meet these staffing needs may 
negatively affect our ability to fulfill our technology initiatives while continuing to provide maintenance on 
existing systems. We rely on certain vendors and service providers to maintain and periodically upgrade many of 
these systems so that they can continue to support our business. The software programs supporting many of our 
systems were licensed to us by independent software developers. The inability of these vendors, developers or us 
to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs might disrupt or reduce the 
efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner 
and could expose us to greater risk of a cybersecurity breach or other cyber attack. In addition, costs and potential 
problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or 
with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our 
operations. 

 
Failure to attract, train and retain qualified employees while controlling labor costs, as well as other 

labor issues, could adversely affect our financial performance. 

 
Our future growth and performance, positive customer experience and regulatory compliance depends on 

our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate qualified employees, many of whom are in positions with 
historically high rates of turnover. Our ability to meet our labor needs, while controlling our labor costs, is subject 
to many external factors, including competition for and availability of qualified personnel in a given market, 
unemployment levels within those markets, wage rates within particular markets, minimum wage laws, health and 
other insurance costs, changes in employment and labor laws (including changes in the process for our employees 
to join a union) or other workplace regulations (including changes in employee benefit programs such as health 
insurance and paid leave programs), employee activism, and our reputation and relevance within the labor market. 
If we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of qualified employees, our operations, customer service 
levels and support functions could suffer. In addition, to the extent a significant portion of our employee base 
unionizes, or attempts to unionize, our labor costs could increase. Our ability to pass along labor costs to our 
customers is constrained by our everyday low price model, and we may not be able to offset such increased costs 
elsewhere in our business. 

 
Our success depends on our executive officers and other key personnel. If we lose key personnel or are 

unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our business may be harmed. 

 
Our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our executive 
officers and other key personnel. The unexpected loss of the services of any of our executive officers could have 
an adverse effect on our operations. There can be no assurance that our executive succession planning, retention or 
hiring efforts will be successful. Competition for skilled and experienced management personnel is intense, and 
our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, and a failure to attract 
and retain new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations.  

 
Because our business is somewhat seasonal, adverse events during the fourth quarter could materially 

affect our financial statements as a whole. 

 
Primarily because of sales of Christmas-related merchandise, our most profitable sales mix generally 

occurs in the fourth quarter.  In anticipation of this holiday, we purchase substantial amounts of seasonal 
inventory. Adverse events, such as deteriorating economic conditions, high unemployment rates, high gas prices, 
public transportation disruptions, or unusual or unanticipated adverse weather could result in lower-than-planned 
sales during the Christmas selling season, which in turn could reduce our operating profit. Additionally, an excess 
of seasonal merchandise inventory could result if our net sales during the Christmas selling season fall below  
 

 
16  Dollar General        2017 Form 10-K 

 
 

seasonal norms or expectations, which could adversely affect our financial performance and operating results as a 
result of unanticipated markdowns. 

 
Deterioration in market conditions or changes in our credit profile could adversely affect our business 

operations and financial condition. 

 
We rely on the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to the credit 
and capital markets to fund our operations, growth strategy, and return of cash to our shareholders through share 
repurchases and dividends. Changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited 
liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to these potential 
sources of future liquidity. Our continued access to these liquidity sources on favorable terms depends on multiple 
factors, including our operating performance and our credit ratings. Our debt securities currently have an 
investment grade rating, and a downgrade of this rating likely would negatively impact our access to the debt 
capital markets and increase our cost of borrowing. As a result, any disruptions or turmoil in the debt markets or 
any downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition and our 
ability to return cash to our shareholders. There can be no assurances that our ability to obtain additional financing 
through the debt markets will not be adversely impacted by economic conditions or that we will be able to 
maintain or improve our current credit ratings. 

 
New accounting guidance or changes in the interpretation or application of existing accounting 

guidance could adversely affect our financial performance. 

 
The implementation of new accounting standards could require certain systems, internal process and 

other changes that could increase our operating costs, and also will result in changes to our financial statements. In 
particular, the implementation of accounting standards related to leases, as issued by the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board (“FASB”) are requiring us to make significant changes to our lease management and other 
accounting systems, and will result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, the 
FASB has issued accounting standards related to intra-entity transfers that will result in changes to our financial 
statements.  

 
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation 

guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business involve 
many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in these rules or their 
interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could 
significantly change our reported or expected financial performance. The outcome of such changes could include 
litigation or regulatory actions which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of 
operations.

Most of our stores are located in leased premises. Individual store leases vary as to their terms, rental 

provisions and expiration dates. Many stores are subject to build-to-suit arrangements with landlords, which 
typically carry a primary lease term of up to 15 years with multiple renewal options. We also have stores subject 
to shorter-term leases and many of these leases have renewal options. A significant portion of our new stores are 
subject to build-to-suit arrangements.

open at the end of the reporting period. We include stores that have been remodeled, expanded or relocated in 
our same-store sales calculation. Changes in same-store sales are calculated based on the comparable 52 
calendar weeks in the current and prior years. 

 
(3)  Net sales per square foot was calculated based on total sales for the preceding 12 months as of the ending date 

of the reporting period divided by the average selling square footage during the period, including the end of 
the fiscal year, the beginning of the fiscal year, and the end of each of our three interim fiscal quarters.

This discussion and analysis should be read with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the Consolidated 

Financial Statements and the notes thereto. It also should be read in conjunction with the Cautionary Disclosure 
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and the Risk Factors disclosures set forth in the Introduction and in 
Item 1A of this report, respectively. 
 
Executive Overview 
 

We are among the largest discount retailers in the United States by number of stores, with 14,609 stores 
located in 44 states as of March 2, 2018, with the greatest concentration of stores in the southern, southwestern, 
midwestern and eastern United States. We offer a broad selection of merchandise, including consumable products 
such as food, paper and cleaning products, health and beauty products and pet supplies, and non-consumable 
products such as seasonal merchandise, home decor and domestics, and basic apparel. Our merchandise includes 
national brands from leading manufacturers, as well as our own private brand selections with prices at substantial 
discounts to national brands. We offer our customers these national brand and private brand products at everyday 
low prices (typically $10 or less) in our convenient small-box locations. 

 
Because the customers we serve are value-conscious, many with low or fixed incomes, we are intensely 

focused on helping them make the most of their spending dollars. We believe our convenient store formats, 
locations, and broad selection of high-quality products at compelling values have driven our substantial growth 
and financial success over the years and through a variety of macroeconomic environments. Like other retailers, 
we have been operating for several years in an environment with ongoing macroeconomic challenges and 
uncertainties. Our core customers are often among the first to be affected by negative or uncertain economic 
conditions, and are among the last to feel the effects of improving economic conditions particularly when, as in 
the recent past, trends are inconsistent and their duration unknown. The primary macroeconomic factors that affect 
our core customers include the unemployment rate, the underemployment rate, wage growth, fuel prices, and 
changes to certain government assistance programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. 
Additionally, our customers are impacted by increases in those expenses that generally comprise a large portion of 
their household budget, such as rent and healthcare.  We believe that at various times the overall effect of the 
factors listed above has negatively affected our customer traffic and could do so in the future. 

 
During 2017, we continued to make progress on certain strategic initiatives to pursue long-term growth 

opportunities. Such opportunities include leveraging existing and developing additional digital tools and 
technology to provide our customers with additional shopping access points and even greater convenience, as well 
as an in-depth analysis of and refreshed approach to our non-consumables product offerings. These growth 
initiatives will be ongoing priorities in 2018, while ensuring that we maintain our brand heritage and build upon 
our organizational capabilities.   

 
We remain committed to the following long-term operating priorities as we consistently strive to improve 

our performance while retaining our customer-centric focus: 1) driving profitable sales growth, 2) capturing 
growth opportunities, 3) enhancing our position as a low-cost operator, and 4) investing in our people as a 
competitive advantage. 

 
We seek to drive profitable sales growth through initiatives aimed at increasing customer traffic and 

average transaction amount, as well as an ongoing focus on enhancing our gross margins while maintaining both 
everyday low price and affordability. 

 
Historically, our sales of consumables, which tend to have lower gross margins, have been the key 
drivers of net sales and customer traffic, while sales of non-consumables, which tend to have higher gross 
margins, have contributed to profitable sales growth and an increase in average transaction amount.  In addition, 
throughout 2017, our sales mix continued to shift slightly toward consumables, and, within consumables, slightly 

 
 

 

Dollar General        2017 Form 10-K  27

toward lower margin departments such as perishables and tobacco. We expect the trends of consumables, and 
lower margin consumables, comprising an increasingly larger percentage of our sales than non-consumables to 
continue throughout at least the beginning of 2018. Certain of our initiatives, including those related to the non-
consumables categories, are intended to address these trends, although there can be no assurance we will be 
successful in their reversal. 

 
We believe same-store sales growth is key to achieving our financial objectives. Accordingly, our 
initiatives are designed to increase customer traffic and average transaction amounts. We made significant 
progress in 2017 on many of these initiatives, which included the continued expansion of coolers, the rollout of 
additional strategies across many of our merchandise departments, including a redesign of our Health and Beauty 
department to drive further product awareness and market share, a continued focus on improving our in-stock 
position and the addition of a queue line containing items intended to drive impulse purchases in a portion of our 
existing store base. In 2018, we plan to continue expanding the cooler count, as well as to launch a second phase 
of the Health and Beauty initiative. Additionally, we plan to implement a redesign of the snack and beverage aisle 
to enhance customer awareness, particularly in immediate consumption items. We also plan to test an expanded 
assortment of “better-for-you” food choices across a select group of stores. In non-consumables, the planned 
introduction of new and expanded product classes will provide increased opportunities for our customers to take 
advantage of our value and convenience offering. Many of these initiatives support our plans to continue investing 
in our existing store base, with a goal to drive increased customer traffic and average transaction amount and, as a 
result, our same-store sales. 

 
We demonstrate our commitment to the affordability needs of our core customer as more than 80% of 
our stock-keeping units were priced at $5 or less at the end of 2017.  Even as we work to provide everyday low 
prices and meet our customers’ affordability needs, we also remain focused on enhancing our margins through 
effective category management, inventory shrink reduction initiatives, private brands penetration, distribution and 
transportation efficiencies, global sourcing and pricing and markdown optimization. With respect to category 
management, we strive to maintain an appropriate mix of consumables and non-consumables sales because, as 
noted above, the mix of sales affects profitability due to the varying gross margins between, and even within, the 
consumables and non-consumables categories. We believe expanded and improved private brand offerings in 
2018 will provide increased value offerings for our customers in addition to improving the profitability of certain 
product categories. To support our efforts to reduce inventory shrink, in 2018 we expect to continue to implement 
in-store defensive merchandising and technology-based tools, including a significant increase in the number of 
stores utilizing Electronic Article Surveillance (“EAS”), as the results from stores in which EAS has been 
implemented suggest these measures help reduce shrink and improve our in-stock position. Increasing carrier and 
fuel rates pressured our overall gross margin in the latter half of 2017, and we anticipate that these negative 
impacts will continue into and throughout 2018. However, we continue to seek to reduce our stem miles and 
optimize shipment loads to improve distribution and transportation efficiencies. 

 
To support our other operating priorities, we remain focused on capturing growth opportunities. In 2017, 

we opened 1,315 new stores, along with remodeling or relocating 764 stores. For 2018, we plan to open 
approximately 900 new stores, remodel approximately 1,000 mature store locations, and relocate approximately 
100 stores for an approximate total of 2,000 real estate projects. 

 
We continue to innovate within our channel and are able to utilize the most productive of our various 
store formats based on the specific market opportunity.  We expect that our traditional 7,300 square foot store 
format will continue to be the primary store layout for new stores, relocations and remodels in 2018. We expect a 
significant number of the planned 1,000 remodels in 2018 to include a greater cooler count for increased selection 
of perishable items. In addition, our smaller format store (less than 6,000 square feet) allows us to capture growth 
opportunities in metropolitan areas as well as in rural areas with a low number of households. We continue to 
incorporate into our existing store base lessons learned from our various store formats and layouts with a goal of 
driving increased customer traffic, average transaction amount, same-store sales and overall store productivity.

To support our new store growth and drive productivity, we continue to make investments in our 

distribution center network. Our fifteenth distribution center in Jackson, Georgia began shipping in October 2017. 
We began construction on our sixteenth and seventeenth distribution centers in Longview, Texas and Amsterdam, 
New York, respectively, in 2017 to continue to support our growth. We expect both of these distribution centers to 
open in 2019. 

 
We have established a position as a low-cost operator, continuously seeking ways to reduce or control 

costs that do not affect our customers’ shopping experience. We plan to continue enhancing this position over time 
as we aim to continually streamline our business while also employing ongoing cost discipline to reduce certain 
expenses as a percentage of sales. Although we did not leverage Selling, General & Administrative (“SG&A”) 
expenses in 2017, as discussed in more detail below, it was largely because of specific planned investments such 
as store manager pay and training, and the increased store openings in the second half of the year, both of which 
will pressure SG&A comparisons in the first half of 2018. 

 
In 2017, we installed LED lighting in a significant number of stores, which reduces utilities and 

maintenance costs across our store base in addition to fostering a more customer and environmentally friendly 
shopping experience. We anticipate the remaining stores in the chain that are eligible for our LED lighting 
program will be completed in 2018. Over the long term, we believe actions such as these will support our goal of 
leveraging SG&A expenses at a lower same store sales growth percentage.  In addition, we remain committed to 
simplifying or eliminating store-level tasks and processes so that those time savings can be reinvested by our store 
managers and their teams in important areas such as enhanced customer service, higher in-stock levels and 
improved store standards.  

 
Our employees are a competitive advantage, and we are always searching for ways to continue investing 

in them.  We invest in our employees in an effort to create an environment that attracts and retains talented 
personnel, as we believe that, particularly at the store level, employees who are promoted from within our 
company generally have longer tenures and are greater contributors to improvements in our financial performance.  
Our store managers play an important role in our customer experience and individual store profitability, and 
beginning in March 2017 we implemented certain investments in compensation and training for this position in 
the form of increased SG&A expenses that we believe have already contributed to improved customer experience 
scores, higher sales and improved turnover metrics.   
 

To further enhance shareholder return, we continued to repurchase shares of our common stock and paid 

quarterly cash dividends throughout 2017. In 2018, we intend to continue our share repurchase activity, at a 
significantly greater dollar amount than in 2017, and to pay quarterly cash dividends, subject to Board discretion 
and approval. 

 
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was signed into law. Among other 
impacts, the Act reduces the federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% effective January 1, 2018. The Act 
reduced our effective tax rate in 2017 primarily as a result of the one-time remeasurement of the federal portion of 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities to a lower rate, accompanied by a reduction in the current year federal 
corporate tax rate to 33.7%, due to our fiscal year ending approximately one month after the effective date of the 
Act.  The Act will have a positive material impact on our effective tax rate in 2018 and subsequent years. 

 
A continued focus on our four operating priorities as discussed above, coupled with strong cash flow 

management and share repurchases resulted in solid overall operating and financial performance in 2017 as 
compared to 2016, as set forth below. Basis points, as referred to below, are equal to 0.01% as a percentage of net 
sales. 

 
• 

Net sales in 2017 increased 6.8% over 2016. Sales in same-stores increased 2.7%, due to an 
increase in average transaction amount and increased customer traffic. Average sales per square 
foot in 2017 were $227 compared to $229, including a $4 contribution from the 53rd week, in 
2016.  

 

 
 

 

Dollar General        2017 Form 10-K  29

Our gross profit rate decreased by 8 basis points due primarily to a greater proportion of sales of 
consumables compared to non-consumables, higher markdowns, and increased transportation 
costs.  

The increase in SG&A, as a percentage of sales, was due primarily to increases in retail labor 
costs, occupancy costs and store closures and related costs.  

The decrease in the effective income tax rate to 19.3% in 2017 from 36.3% in 2016 was due 
primarily to changes (some of which are nonrecurring) to the federal income tax laws pursuant 
to the Act. 

We reported net income of $1.54 billion, or $5.63 per diluted share, for 2017 compared to net 
income of $1.25 billion, or $4.43 per diluted share, for 2016. Reduced income tax expense in 
2017 due to the Act contributed to the increase in diluted earnings per share.  

We generated approximately $1.8 billion of cash flows from operating activities in 2017, an 
increase of 12.3% compared to 2016. We primarily utilized our cash flows from operating 
activities to invest in the growth of our business, repurchase our common stock, and pay 
quarterly cash dividends.  

Inventory turnover was 4.7 times on a rolling four-quarter basis. Inventories increased 1.5% on a 
per store basis compared to 2016. 

We repurchased approximately 7.1 million shares of our outstanding common stock for $580 
million. 

 
Readers should refer to the detailed discussion of our operating results below for additional comments on 

financial performance in the current year as compared with the prior years presented. 

Results of Operations 

 
Accounting Periods. The following text contains references to years 2017, 2016, and 2015, which 

represent fiscal years ended February 2, 2018, February 3, 2017, and January 29, 2016, respectively. Our fiscal 
year ends on the Friday closest to January 31. Fiscal year 2016 was a 53-week accounting period and fiscal years 
2017 and 2015 were 52-week accounting periods. 

 
Seasonality. The nature of our business is somewhat seasonal. Primarily because of sales of Christmas-
related merchandise, operating profit in our fourth quarter (November, December and January) has historically 
been higher than operating profit achieved in each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year. Expenses, and to a 
greater extent operating profit, vary by quarter. Results of a period shorter than a full year may not be indicative of 
results expected for the entire year. Furthermore, the seasonal nature of our business may affect comparisons 
between periods.

Net Sales. The net sales increase in 2017 reflects a same-store sales increase of 2.7% compared to 2016. 
Same-stores include stores that have been open for at least 13 months and remain open at the end of the reporting 
period. Changes in same-store sales are calculated based on the comparable calendar weeks in the prior year, and 
include stores that have been remodeled, expanded or relocated.  In 2017, our 13,150 same-stores accounted for 
sales of $21.9 billion. The increase in same-store sales was due to increases in average transaction amount and 
customer traffic relative to 2016. Same-store sales in 2017 increased in the consumables and seasonal categories, 
and declined in the home products and apparel categories, compared to 2016. Same-store sales results in 2017 for 
the three non-consumables categories, when aggregated, were positive. Net sales for the 53rd week of 2016 totaled 
$398.7 million. The 2017 net sales increase was positively affected by new stores, modestly offset by sales from 
closed stores. 

 
The net sales increase in 2016 reflects a same-store sales increase of 0.9% compared to 2015, primarily 
due to an increase in average transaction amount accompanied by customer traffic that was essentially unchanged 
as compared to the prior year. For 2016, there were 12,383 same-stores, which accounted for sales of $20.3 
billion. Same-store sales results in 2016 reflect positive results in the consumables and home products categories, 
partially offset by negative results in the apparel and seasonal categories, compared to 2015. The remainder of the 
2016 net sales increase was attributable to new stores, partially offset by sales from closed stores.

Of our four major merchandise categories, the consumables category, which generally has a lower gross 
profit rate than the other three categories, has grown most significantly over the past several years. Because of the 
impact of sales mix on gross profit, we continually review our merchandise mix and strive to adjust it when 
appropriate.  

 
Gross Profit. For 2017, gross profit increased by 6.5%, and as a percentage of net sales decreased by 8 
basis points to 30.8% compared to 2016.  A greater proportion of sales of consumables, which generally have a 
lower gross profit rate than our other product categories, and sales of lower margin products comprising a higher 
proportion of consumables sales, reduced the gross profit rate. Higher markdowns, which were primarily for 
promotional activities, and increases in transportation costs also reduced the gross profit rate, and these factors 
were partially offset by higher initial markups on inventory purchases and an improved rate of inventory 
shrinkage.  

 
For 2016, gross profit increased by 7.6%, and as a percentage of net sales decreased by 11 basis points to 
30.8% compared to 2015. The gross profit rate decrease in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily reflects increased 
markdowns which were driven by promotional and inventory clearance activity, sales of lower-margin 
consumables comprising a greater proportion of net sales, and increased inventory shrink, partially offset by 
higher initial inventory markups and lower transportation costs.  

 
SG&A. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22.2% in 2017 compared to 21.5% in 2016, an increase of 75 

basis points. The 2017 results reflect increased retail labor expenses, which includes our investment in store 
manager compensation, increased occupancy costs, and higher incentive compensation, each of which increased at 
a rate greater than the increase in net sales. Partially offsetting these increased expenses were reduced advertising 
costs, and costs that increased at a rate less than the increase in net sales, including utilities and waste management 
costs primarily resulting from our recycling efforts. The 2017 results include costs of $24.0 million related to 35 
underperforming stores closed prior to the end of the year, primarily expenses for remaining lease liabilities. The 
2017 results also reflect an increase in hurricane and other disaster-related expenses of approximately $18.0 
million compared to 2016. SG&A as a percentage of sales was favorably impacted in 2016 by increased sales 
including the 53rd week discussed above, among other factors.  

 
SG&A was 21.5% as a percentage of net sales in 2016, increasing by 3 basis points over 2015. The 2016 

results reflect increases in retail labor costs, which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales, 
partially offset by reductions in administrative payroll costs, incentive compensation expenses, and advertising 
costs. The 2016 results also reflect an increase in hurricane and other disaster-related expenses of $12.2 million 
over the comparable 2015 amounts.  

 
Interest Expense.  Interest expense decreased $0.8 million to $97.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016. 
Interest expense increased $10.9 million to $97.8 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase 
in average debt outstanding and higher average interest rates. See the detailed discussion under “Liquidity and 
Capital Resources” regarding the financing of various long-term obligations. 

 
We had consolidated outstanding variable-rate debt of $612.5 million and $924.3 million as of February 
2, 2018 and February 3, 2017, respectively.  The remainder of our outstanding indebtedness at February 2, 2018 
and February 3, 2017 was fixed rate debt.  

 
Other (income) expense. Other (income) expense in 2017 reflects expenses associated with the issuance 

and refinancing of long-term debt during the first quarter of 2017. 

 
Income Taxes. The effective income tax rates for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were expenses of 19.3%, 36.3% 

and 37.1%, respectively. 

 
Under accounting standards for income taxes, the impact of new tax legislation must be taken into 

account in the period in which the new legislation is enacted, including the remeasurement of deferred tax assets 

 
32  Dollar General        2017 Form 10-K 

 
 

and liabilities at the tax rates at which such items are expected to reverse in future periods. Subsequent to the 
signing of the Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, 
which allows companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one 
year after the enactment date while the accounting impact is still under analysis. Our 2017 provision for income 
taxes reflects such estimates due to the changes in income tax law, including a provisional tax benefit of $335 
million. The provisional tax benefit consists of $310.8 million related to the one-time remeasurement of the 
federal portion of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the 21% rate and $24.2 million related to the reduced 
statutory tax rate of 33.7%, compared to 35% in prior years. The ultimate impact may differ from these 
provisional amounts due to additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, 
additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of the Act. Any subsequent 
adjustments to provisional estimates will be reflected in our income tax provision during one or more periods in 
2018.   

 
The effective income tax rate for 2017 was 19.3% compared to a rate of 36.3% for 2016 which represents 

a net decrease of 17.0 percentage points. The effective income tax rate was lower in 2017 primarily due to the 
one-time remeasurement of the federal portions of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at 21%, accompanied by 
the changes in the federal income tax laws pursuant to the Act that lowered our statutory federal tax rate to 33.7% 
for the 2017 fiscal year, compared to 35% in 2016.  

 
The effective income tax rate for 2016 was 36.3% compared to a rate of 37.1% for 2015 which represents 

a net decrease of 0.8 percentage points. The effective income tax rate was lower in 2016 due principally to the 
early adoption of a change in accounting guidance related to employee share-based payments requiring the 
recognition of excess tax benefits in the statement of income rather than in the balance sheet, as reported in prior 
years.  

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

 
We are not party to any material off balance sheet arrangements. 
 

Effects of Inflation 

 
In 2016, we experienced product cost deflation reflecting reductions in commodity costs primarily related 

to food products. We experienced minimal overall commodity cost inflation or deflation in 2017 and 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
Current Financial Condition and Recent Developments 

 
During the past three years, we have generated an aggregate of approximately $4.8 billion in cash flows 
from operating activities and incurred approximately $1.7 billion in capital expenditures. During that period, we 
expanded the number of stores we operate by 2,745, representing growth of approximately 23%, and we 
remodeled or relocated 2,551 stores, or approximately 22% of the stores we operated as of the beginning of the 
period. In 2018, we intend to continue our current strategy of pursuing store growth, remodels and relocations. 

 
At February 2, 2018, we had a $1.4 billion unsecured credit agreement (the “Facilities”), $2.4 billion 

aggregate principal amount of senior notes, and a commercial paper program that may provide borrowing 
availability of up to $1.0 billion. At February 2, 2018, we had total outstanding debt (including the current portion 
of long-term obligations) of $3.0 billion, which includes balances under the Term Facility (as defined below), 
commercial paper, and senior notes, all of which are described in greater detail below. Our borrowing availability 
under the unsecured credit agreement may be effectively limited by borrowings under the commercial paper 
program as further described below. The information contained in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 
contained in Part II, Item 8 of this report is incorporated herein by reference.  

 

 

 

 
 

 

Dollar General        2017 Form 10-K  33

We believe our cash flow from operations, including anticipated increases resulting from the Act, and our 

existing cash balances, combined with availability under the Facilities (as defined below), the commercial paper 
program and access to the debt markets will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations, projected 
working capital requirements, capital spending and anticipated dividend payments for a period that includes the 
next twelve months as well as the next several years.  However, our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity may be 
affected by numerous factors, many of which are outside of our control.  Depending on our liquidity levels, 
conditions in the capital markets and other factors, we may from time to time consider the issuance of debt, equity 
or other securities, the proceeds of which could provide additional liquidity for our operations. 

 
For fiscal 2018, we anticipate potential borrowings under the unsecured revolving credit facility 

described below and our commercial paper program to be a maximum of approximately $800 million outstanding 
at any one time, including any anticipated borrowings to fund repurchases of common stock. 

 

Credit Facilities 

 
On February 22, 2017, we entered into the Facilities, which consist of a $175.0 million senior unsecured 

term loan facility (the “Term Facility”) and a $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the 
“Revolving Facility”) of which up to $175.0 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit. The Term 
Facility is scheduled to mature on October 20, 2020, and the Revolving Facility is scheduled to mature on 
February 22, 2022.  

 
Borrowings under the Facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable interest rate margin plus, at 
our option, either (a) LIBOR or (b) a base rate (which is usually equal to the prime rate). The applicable interest 
rate margin for borrowings as of February 2, 2018 was 1.10% for LIBOR borrowings and 0.10% for base-rate 
borrowings. We must also pay a facility fee, payable on any used and unused commitment amounts of the 
Facilities, and customary fees on letters of credit issued under the Revolving Facility. As of February 2, 2018, the 
commitment fee rate was 0.15%. The applicable interest rate margins for borrowings, the facility fees and the 
letter of credit fees under the Facilities are subject to adjustment from time to time based on our long-term senior 
unsecured debt ratings. The weighted average all-in interest rate for borrowings under the Facilities was 2.7% as 
of February 2, 2018. 
 

The Facilities can be voluntarily prepaid in whole or in part at any time without penalty. There is no 

required principal amortization under the Facilities. The Facilities contain a number of customary affirmative and 
negative covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our (including our 
subsidiaries’) ability to: incur additional liens; sell all or substantially all of our assets; consummate certain 
fundamental changes or change in our lines of business; and incur additional subsidiary indebtedness. The 
Facilities also contain financial covenants that require the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
and a maximum leverage ratio.  As of February 2, 2018, we were in compliance with all such covenants.  The 
Facilities also contain customary events of default.  
 

As of February 2, 2018, the entire balance of the Term Facility was outstanding, and under the Revolving 

Facility, we had no outstanding borrowings, outstanding letters of credit of $9.1 million, and borrowing 
availability of $1.2 billion that, due to our intention to maintain borrowing availability related to the commercial 
paper program described below, could contribute incremental liquidity of $624.7 million at February 2, 2018. In 
addition, as of February 2, 2018 we had outstanding letters of credit of $37.5 million which were issued pursuant 
to separate agreements. 
 
Commercial Paper 
 

As of February 2, 2018, we had outstanding unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) of 
$616.2 million, $186 million of which were held by a wholly-owned subsidiary.  The consolidated balance of 
$430.2 million was classified as long-term obligations on the consolidated balance sheet due to our intent and 
ability to refinance these obligations as long-term debt. Under this program, we may issue the CP Notes from time 

 
34  Dollar General        2017 Form 10-K 

 
 

to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1.0 billion outstanding at any time.  The CP Notes may have 
maturities of up to 364 days from the date of issue and rank equal in right of payment with all of our other 
unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.  We intend to maintain available commitments under the Revolving 
Facility in an amount at least equal to the amount of CP Notes outstanding at any time.  As of February 2, 2018, 
the outstanding CP Notes had a weighted average borrowing rate of 1.8%.  
 
Senior Notes 
 

In April 2013 we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.875% senior notes due 2018 (the 

“2018 Senior Notes”) at a discount of $0.5 million, which are scheduled to mature on April 15, 2018 and $900.0 
million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% senior notes due 2023 (the “2023 Senior Notes”) at a discount of 
$2.4 million, which are scheduled to mature on April 15, 2023. In October 2015 we issued $500.0 million 
aggregate principal amount of 4.150% senior notes due 2025 (the “2025 Senior Notes”) at a discount of $0.8 
million, which are scheduled to mature on November 1, 2025. In April 2017 we issued $600.0 million aggregate 
principal amount of 3.875% senior notes due 2027 (the “2027 Senior Notes”) at a discount of $0.4 million, which 
are scheduled to mature on April 15, 2027. Collectively, the 2018 Senior Notes, the 2023 Senior Notes, 2025 
Senior Notes, and 2027 Senior Notes comprise the “Senior Notes”, each of which were issued pursuant to an 
indenture as supplemented and amended by supplemental indentures relating to each series of Senior Notes (as so 
supplemented and amended, the “Senior Indenture”). Interest on the 2018 Senior Notes, the 2023 Senior Notes, 
and the 2027 Senior Notes is payable in cash on April 15 and October 15 of each year. Interest on the 2025 Senior 
Notes is payable in cash on May 1 and November 1 of each year. We expect to refinance the 2018 Senior Notes 
on or prior to their maturity utilizing proceeds from the issuance of additional senior notes, revolver borrowings or 
the issuance of commercial paper. 
 

We may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at any time at redemption prices set forth in the Senior 
Indenture. Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event, which is defined in the Senior Indenture, 
each holder of our Senior Notes has the right to require us to repurchase some or all of such holder’s Senior Notes 
at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, 
to, but excluding, the repurchase date. 
 

The Senior Indenture contains covenants limiting, among other things, our ability (subject to certain 
exceptions) to consolidate, merge, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and our 
ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee indebtedness secured by liens on any shares of 
voting stock of significant subsidiaries. 
 

The Senior Indenture also provides for events of default which, if any of them occurs, would permit or 
require the principal of and accrued interest on our Senior Notes to become or to be declared due and payable, as 
applicable. 

Rating Agencies 

 
Our senior unsecured debt is rated “Baa2,” by Moody’s with a stable outlook and “BBB” by Standard & 

Poor’s with a stable outlook, and our commercial paper program is rated “P-2” by Moody’s and “A-2” by 
Standard and Poor’s. Our current credit ratings, as well as future rating agency actions, could (i) impact our ability 
to finance our operations on satisfactory terms; (ii) affect our financing costs; and (iii) affect our insurance 
premiums and collateral requirements necessary for our self-insured programs. There can be no assurance that we 
will maintain or improve our current credit ratings.

projected interest on variable rate long-term debt, using 2017 year end rates and balances. Variable rate long-
term debt includes the Revolving Facility (although such facility had a balance of zero as of February 2, 
2018), the CP Notes (which had a balance of $430.2 million as of February 2, 2018, net of $186 million held 
by a wholly-owned subsidiary), the balance of an outstanding tax increment financing of $7.3 million, and the 
balance of the Term Facility of $175 million. 

 
(b)  We retain a significant portion of the risk for our workers’ compensation, employee health, general liability, 

property loss, automobile, and third-party landlord claims exposures. As these obligations do not have 
scheduled maturities, these amounts represent undiscounted estimates based upon actuarial assumptions. 
Substantially all amounts are reflected on an undiscounted basis in our consolidated balance sheets. 

 
(c)  Operating lease obligations are inclusive of amounts included in deferred rent in our consolidated balance 

 
(d)  Commercial commitments include information technology license and support agreements, supplies, fixtures, 

letters of credit for import merchandise, and other inventory purchase obligations. 

 
(e)  Purchase obligations include legally binding agreements for software licenses and support, supplies, fixtures, 

and merchandise purchases (excluding such purchases subject to letters of credit). 

 
(f)  We have potential payment obligations associated with uncertain tax positions that are not reflected in these 

totals. We are currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the 
taxing authorities for the $2.5 million of reserves for uncertain tax positions. 

sheets. 

 
Share Repurchase Program 

 
Our existing common stock repurchase program had a total remaining authorization of approximately 
$354 million at February 2, 2018. Our Board of Directors increased by $1.0 billion the authorization available 
under this common stock repurchase program on March 14, 2018. Under the authorization, purchases may be 
made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time subject to market and other  

 
36  Dollar General        2017 Form 10-K 

 
 

conditions. The authorization has no expiration date and may be modified or terminated from time to time at the 
discretion of our Board of Directors. For more detail about our share repurchase program, see Note 11 to the 
consolidated financial statements. 

 

Other Considerations 
 

On March 14, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.29 per share which 
is payable on or before April 24, 2018 to shareholders of record of our common stock on April 10, 2018. We paid 
quarterly cash dividends of $0.26 per share in 2017. Although the Board currently expects to continue regular 
quarterly cash dividends, the declaration and amount of future cash dividends are subject to the Board’s sole 
discretion and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, cash requirements, financial 
condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that our Board may deem relevant in its sole discretion. 

 
Our inventory balance represented approximately 52% of our total assets exclusive of goodwill and other 

intangible assets as of February 2, 2018. Our ability to effectively manage our inventory balances can have a 
significant impact on our cash flows from operations during a given fiscal year. Inventory purchases are often 
somewhat seasonal in nature, such as the purchase of warm-weather or Christmas-related merchandise. Efficient 
management of our inventory has been and continues to be an area of focus for us. 

 
As described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, we are involved in a number of legal 
actions and claims, some of which could potentially result in material cash payments. Adverse developments in 
those actions could materially and adversely affect our liquidity. We also have certain income tax-related 
contingencies as disclosed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. Future negative developments could 
have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.  

 

Cash Flows 

 
Cash flows from operating activities. Cash flows from operating activities were $1.8 billion in 2017, 
which represents a $197.1 million increase compared to 2016. Net income increased by $287.8 million in 2017 
over 2016, offset by changes in merchandise inventories which resulted in a $348.4 million decrease in 2017 as 
compared to a decrease of $171.9 million in 2016. Changes in accounts payable resulted in a $427.9 million 
increase in 2017 compared to a $56.5 million increase in 2016, due primarily to the timing of receipts and 
payments which was partially impacted by certain changes in payment terms.  

 
Cash flows from operating activities were $1.6 billion in 2016, an increase of $213.4 million compared to 

2015. Significant components of the increase in cash flows from operating activities in 2016 compared to 2015 
include increased net income due primarily to increased sales and operating profit in 2016 as described in more 
detail above under “Results of Operations.” Changes in merchandise inventories resulted in a reduction in working 
capital usage in 2016 compared to 2015 as described in greater detail below. Accounts payable increased by $56.5 
million in 2016 compared to a $105.6 million increase in 2015, due primarily to the timing of merchandise 
receipts and related payments which were impacted by certain changes in payment terms.  

 
On an ongoing basis, we closely monitor and manage our inventory balances, and they may fluctuate 

from period to period based on new store openings, the timing of purchases, and other factors. Merchandise 
inventories increased by 11% in 2017, by 6% in 2016, and by 10% in 2015. Inventory levels in the consumables 
category increased by $322.9 million, or 16%, in 2017, by $54.5 million, or 3% in 2016, and by $218.4 million, or 
13%, in 2015. The seasonal category increased by $14.9 million, or 2%, in 2017, by $79.5 million, or 15%, in 
2016, and by $63.2 million, or 13%, in 2015. The home products category increased by $10.6 million, or 3%, in 
2017, by $40.8 million, or 14%, in 2016, and by $12.8 million, or 5%, in 2015. The apparel category increased by 
$1.9 million, or 1%, in 2017, increased by $9.9 million, or 3%, in 2016, and decreased by $2.7 million, or 1%, in 
2015.

Cash flows from investing activities. Significant components of property and equipment purchases in 

2017 included the following approximate amounts: $231 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and 
relocations of existing stores; $203 million for new leased stores; $176 million for distribution and transportation-
related projects; and $30 million for information systems upgrades and technology-related projects. The timing of 
new, remodeled and relocated store openings along with other factors may affect the relationship between such 
openings and the related property and equipment purchases in any given period. During 2017, we opened 1,315 
new stores and remodeled or relocated 764 stores.  

 
Significant components of property and equipment purchases in 2016 included the following 

approximate amounts: $201 million for distribution and transportation-related projects; $168 million for 
improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $120 million for new leased stores; $38 
million for stores purchased or built by us; and $26 million for information systems upgrades and technology-
related projects. During 2016, we opened 900 new stores and remodeled or relocated 906 stores.  

 
Significant components of property and equipment purchases in 2015 included the following 

approximate amounts: $168 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $144 
million for distribution and transportation-related projects; $99 million for new leased stores; $53 million for 
stores built by us; and $34 million for information systems upgrades and technology-related projects. During 
2015, we opened 730 new stores and remodeled or relocated 881 stores.  

 
Capital expenditures during 2018 are projected to be in the range of $725 to $800 million. We anticipate 
funding 2018 capital requirements with a combination of some or all of the following: existing cash balances, cash 
flows from operations, availability under our Revolving Facility and/or the issuance of additional senior notes or 
CP Notes. We plan to continue to invest in store growth and development of approximately 900 new stores and 
approximately 1,100 stores to be remodeled or relocated. Capital expenditures in 2018 are anticipated to support 
our store growth as well as our remodel and relocation initiatives, including capital outlays for leasehold 
improvements, fixtures and equipment; the construction of new stores; costs to support and enhance our supply 
chain initiatives including new and existing distribution center facilities and our private fleet; technology 
initiatives; as well as routine and ongoing capital requirements. 

 
Cash flows from financing activities. In 2017, we had net proceeds from the issuance of the 2027 Senior 
Notes of $599.6 million, we redeemed the 2017 Senior Notes for $500.0 million, and made a principal payment on 
the Term Facility of $250.0 million. We had a net decrease in consolidated commercial paper borrowings in 2017 
of $60.3 million and had no borrowings or repayments under the Revolving Facility. We repurchased 7.1 million 
outstanding shares of our common stock in 2017 at a total cost of $579.7 million, and paid cash dividends of 
$282.9 million. 

 
In 2016, we repurchased 12.4 million outstanding shares of our common stock at a total cost of $990.5 

million.  Net repayments under the 2015 Revolving Facility during 2016 were $251.0 million. We had net 
commercial paper borrowings during 2016 of $490.5 million. We also paid cash dividends of $281.1 million. 

 
In 2015, we repurchased 17.6 million outstanding shares of our common stock at a total cost of $1.3 
billion. We made repayments of $500.0 million on our term loan facilities, and had proceeds of $499.2 million 
from the issuance of senior notes.  Net borrowings under our revolving credit facilities during 2015 were $251.0 
million. We also paid cash dividends of $258.3 million. 

 

Accounting Standards 

 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued comprehensive new 

accounting standards related to the recognition of revenue, which specified an effective date for annual reporting 
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB 
deferred the effective date to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with earlier adoption 
permitted only for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The new guidance allows 

 
38  Dollar General        2017 Form 10-K 

 
 

companies to use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach in the adoption of this guidance. 
We formed a project team to assess and implement the standard by compiling a list of the applicable revenue 
streams, evaluating relevant contracts and comparing our current accounting policies to the new standard. As a 
result of the efforts of this project team, we identified customer incentives and gross versus net considerations as 
the areas in which we would most likely be affected by the new guidance. We have assessed the impacts of the 
new standard and the related design of internal control over financial reporting. Based upon the terms of our 
agreements and the materiality of our transactions related to customer incentives and gross versus net 
considerations, the adoption had no effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash 
flows. We adopted this guidance on February 3, 2018. 

 
In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to lease accounting, which when effective will 

require a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee will account for leases as finance leases or 
operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use asset 
and a corresponding lease liability on its balance sheet, with differing methodology for income statement 
recognition. This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those 
years, beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. Currently, a modified retrospective 
approach is required for all leases existing or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in 
the consolidated financial statements. The FASB has proposed guidance which would allow companies to record 
the cumulative effect of applying the new standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings, 
although such guidance has not yet been formally issued. We formed a project team to assess and implement the 
standard, which is evaluating existing contractual arrangements for embedded leases, and comparing our current 
accounting policies to the new standard. As a result of the efforts of this project team, we have identified store 
leases as the area in which we would most likely be affected by the new guidance. Our assessment of the impact 
that adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements is ongoing and we are 
anticipating a material impact because we are party to a significant number of lease contracts for our stores. 

 
In October 2016, the FASB issued amendments to existing guidance related to accounting for intra-entity 

transfers of assets other than inventory. These amendments require an entity to recognize the income tax 
consequences of such transfers when the transfer occurs and affects our historical accounting for intra-entity 
transfers of certain intangible assets. This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and 
interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted subject to 
certain guidelines. The amendments should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-
effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. We adopted this 
guidance on February 3, 2018 which will result in an increase in deferred income tax liabilities and a decrease in 
retained earnings of approximately $33.6 million in the first quarter of 2018. 

 
In January 2017, the FASB issued amendments to existing guidance related to the subsequent 

measurement of goodwill. These amendments modify the concept of impairment from the condition that exists 
when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value to the condition that exists when the carrying 
amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Subsequent to adoption, an entity will perform its annual, or 
interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and 
recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair 
value. This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those 
years, beginning after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill 
impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.  The amendments should be applied on a 
prospective basis. An entity is required to disclose the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle 
upon transition.  Our assessment of the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated 
financial statements is ongoing, but we do not anticipate a material effect on our consolidated results of 
operations, financial position or cash flows.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

 
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in 
the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported 
amounts and related disclosures. In addition to the estimates presented below, there are other items within our 
financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined below. We believe these 
estimates are reasonable and appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other 
considerations used, the resulting changes could have a material effect on the financial statements taken as a 
whole. 
 

Management believes the following policies and estimates are critical because they involve significant 
judgments, assumptions, and estimates. Management has discussed the development and selection of the critical 
accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed 
the disclosures presented below relating to those policies and estimates. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial 
statements for a detailed discussion of our principal accounting policies. 

 
Merchandise Inventories. Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (“LCM”) 

with cost determined using the retail last in, first out (“LIFO”) method.  We use the retail inventory method 
(“RIM”) to calculate gross profit and the resulting valuation of inventories at cost, which are computed utilizing a 
calculated cost-to-retail inventory ratio at an inventory department level. We apply the RIM to these departments, 
which are groups of products that are fairly uniform in terms of cost, selling price relationship and turnover. The 
RIM will result in valuing inventories at LCM if permanent markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the 
retail value of inventories. Inherent in the retail inventory method calculation are certain management judgments 
and estimates that may impact the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as the gross profit recognized. These 
judgments include ensuring departments consist of similar products, recording estimated shrinkage between 
physical inventories, and timely recording of markdowns needed to sell inventory.   

 
We perform an annual LIFO analysis whereby all merchandise units are considered for inclusion in the 

index formulation. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method is made at the end of each year based 
on the inventory levels and costs at that time. In contrast, interim LIFO calculations are based on management’s 
annual estimates of sales, the rate of inflation or deflation, and year-end inventory levels. We also perform 
analyses for determining obsolete inventory, adjusting inventory on a quarterly basis to an LCM value based on 
various management assumptions including estimated below cost markdowns not yet recorded, but required to 
liquidate such inventory in future periods. 

 
Factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand based on 
changes in competitors’ practices, consumer preferences, consumer spending and unseasonable weather patterns. 
Certain of these factors are outside of our control and may result in greater than estimated markdowns to entice 
consumer purchases of excess inventory. The amount and timing of markdowns may vary significantly from year 
to year. 
 

We perform physical inventories in virtually all of our stores on an annual basis. We calculate our shrink 

provision based on actual physical inventory results during the fiscal period and an accrual for estimated shrink 
occurring subsequent to a physical inventory through the end of the fiscal reporting period. This accrual is 
calculated as a percentage of sales at each retail store, at a department level, based on the store’s most recent 
historical shrink rate. To the extent that subsequent physical inventories yield different results than the estimated 
accrual, our effective shrink rate for a given reporting period will include the impact of adjusting to the actual 
results.  

 
We believe our estimates and assumptions related to the application of the RIM results in a merchandise 

inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost on a consistent basis.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The qualitative and quantitative assessments related to the 

valuation and any potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets are each subject to judgments 
and/or assumptions. The analysis of qualitative factors may include determining the appropriate factors to 
consider and the relative importance of those factors along with other assumptions. If required, judgments in the 
quantitative testing process may include projecting future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates, 
correctly applying valuation techniques, correctly computing the implied fair value of goodwill if necessary, and 
other assumptions. Future cash flow projections are based on management’s projections and represent best 
estimates taking into account recent financial performance, market trends, strategic plans and other available 
information, which in recent years have been materially accurate. Changes in these estimates and assumptions 
could materially affect the determination of fair value or impairment, however, such a conclusion is not indicated 
by recent analyses. Future indicators of impairment could result in an asset impairment charge. If these judgments 
or assumptions are incorrect or flawed, the analysis could be negatively impacted. 

 
Our most recent evaluation of our goodwill and indefinite lived trade name intangible assets was 

completed during the third quarter of 2017. No indicators of impairment were evident and no assessment of or 
adjustment to these assets was required. We are not currently projecting a decline in cash flows that could be 
expected to have an adverse effect such as a violation of debt covenants or future impairment charges. 
 

Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are recorded at cost. We group our assets into 

relatively homogeneous classes and generally provide for depreciation on a straight-line basis over the estimated 
average useful life of each asset class, except for leasehold improvements, which are amortized over the lesser of 
the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. Certain store and warehouse fixtures, when fully 
depreciated, are removed from the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts. The 
valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of depreciable lives involves judgments and the use 
of estimates, which we believe have been materially accurate in recent years. 

 
Impairment of Long-lived Assets. Impairment of long-lived assets results when the carrying value of the 

assets exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by the assets. Our estimate of undiscounted 
future store cash flows is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future profitability which 
encompasses many factors that are subject to variability and are difficult to predict. If our estimates of future cash 
flows are not materially accurate, our impairment analysis could be impacted accordingly. If a long-lived asset is 
found to be impaired, the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value 
and the asset’s estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated based primarily upon projected future cash flows 
(discounted at our credit adjusted risk-free rate) or other reasonable estimates of fair market value. Although not 
currently anticipated, changes in these estimates, assumptions or projections could materially affect the 
determination of fair value or impairment. 

 
Insurance Liabilities. We retain a significant portion of the risk for our workers’ compensation, employee 

health, general liability, property loss, automobile and third-party landlord claim exposures. These represent 
significant costs primarily due to our large employee base and number of stores. Provisions are made for these 
liabilities on an undiscounted basis. Certain of these liabilities are based on actual claim data and estimates of 
incurred but not reported claims developed using actuarial methodologies based on historical claim trends, which 
have been and are anticipated to continue to be materially accurate. If future claim trends deviate from recent 
historical patterns, or other unanticipated events affect the number and significance of future claims, we may be 
required to record additional expenses or expense reductions, which could be material to our future financial 
results. 
 

Contingent Liabilities – Income Taxes. Income tax reserves are determined using the methodology 

established by accounting standards relating to uncertainty in income taxes. These standards require companies to 
assess each income tax position taken using a two-step process. A determination is first made as to whether it is 
more likely than not that the position will be sustained, based upon the technical merits, upon examination by the 
taxing authorities. If the tax position is expected to meet the more likely than not criteria, the benefit recorded for 
the tax position equals the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement of 

 
 

 

Dollar General        2017 Form 10-K  41

the respective tax position. Uncertain tax positions require determinations and liabilities to be estimated based on 
provisions of the tax law which may be subject to change or varying interpretation. If our determinations and 
estimates prove to be inaccurate, the resulting adjustments could be material to our future financial results. 

 
Contingent Liabilities - Legal Matters. We are subject to legal, regulatory and other proceedings and 
claims. We establish liabilities as appropriate for these claims and proceedings based upon the probability and 
estimability of losses and to fairly present, in conjunction with the disclosures of these matters in our financial 
statements and SEC filings, management’s view of our exposure. We review outstanding claims and proceedings 
with external counsel, as needed, to assess probability and estimates of loss, which includes an analysis of whether 
such loss estimates are probable, reasonably possible, or remote. We re-evaluate these assessments on a quarterly 
basis or as new and significant information becomes available to determine whether a liability should be 
established or if any existing liability should be adjusted. The actual cost of resolving a claim or proceeding 
ultimately may be substantially different than the amount of the recorded liability. In addition, because it is not 
permissible under U.S. GAAP to establish a litigation liability until the loss is both probable and estimable, in 
some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a liability prior to the actual incurrence of the loss (upon 
verdict and judgment at trial, for example, or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement). 

 
Lease Accounting and Excess Facilities. Many of our stores are subject to build-to-suit arrangements 
with landlords, which typically carry a primary lease term of up to 15 years with multiple renewal options. We 
also have stores subject to shorter-term leases and many of these leases have renewal options. Certain of our stores 
have provisions for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of defined sales volume. We recognize contingent 
rental expense when the achievement of specified sales targets is considered probable. We record minimum rental 
expense on a straight-line basis over the base, non-cancelable lease term commencing on the date that we take 
physical possession of the property from the landlord, which normally includes a period prior to store opening to 
make necessary leasehold improvements and install store fixtures. When a lease contains a predetermined fixed 
escalation of the minimum rent, we recognize the related rent expense on a straight-line basis and record the 
difference between the recognized rental expense and the amounts payable under the lease as deferred rent. Tenant 
allowances, to the extent received, are recorded as deferred incentive rent and amortized as a reduction to rent 
expense over the term of the lease. We reflect as a liability any difference between the calculated expense and the 
amounts actually paid. Improvements of leased properties are amortized over the shorter of the life of the 
applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.  

 
Share-Based Payments. Our stock option awards are valued on an individual grant basis using the Black-

Scholes-Merton closed form option pricing model. We believe that this model fairly estimates the value of our 
stock option awards. The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental in the 
valuation of stock options, which affects compensation expense related to these options. These assumptions 
include the term that the options are expected to be outstanding, the historical volatility of our stock price, 
applicable interest rates and the dividend yield of our stock. Other factors involving judgments that affect the 
expensing of share-based payments include estimated forfeiture rates of share-based awards. Historically, these 
estimates have been materially accurate; however, if our estimates differ materially from actual experience, we 
may be required to record additional expense or reductions of expense, which could be material to our future 
financial results. 

 
Fair Value Measurements. Accounting standards for the measurement of fair value of assets and 

liabilities establish a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on 
market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within 
Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions 
(unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy). Therefore, Level 3 inputs are typically based on 
an entity’s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity, and thus require the use of significant 
judgment and estimates. Currently, we have no assets or liabilities that are valued based solely on Level 3 inputs. 

 
Our fair value measurements are primarily associated with our outstanding debt instruments. We use 

various valuation models in determining the values of these liabilities. We believe that in recent years these 
methodologies have produced materially accurate valuations.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
Financial Risk Management 
 

We are exposed to market risk primarily from adverse changes in interest rates, and to a lesser degree 

commodity prices. To minimize this risk, we may periodically use financial instruments, including derivatives. All 
derivative financial instrument transactions must be authorized and executed pursuant to approval by the Board of 
Directors. As a matter of policy, we do not buy or sell financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes, 
and any such derivative financial instruments are intended to be used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying 
economic exposure. Our objective is to correlate derivative financial instruments and the underlying exposure 
being hedged, so that fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal 
changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure. 

 

Interest Rate Risk 

 
We manage our interest rate risk through the strategic use of fixed and variable interest rate debt and, 
from time to time, derivative financial instruments. Our principal interest rate exposure relates to outstanding 
amounts under our unsecured debt facilities as well as our commercial paper program. As of February 2, 2018, we 
had variable rate borrowings of $175 million under our Term Facility, consolidated borrowings of $430.2 million 
under our commercial paper program, and no borrowings outstanding under our Revolving Facility. In order to 
mitigate a portion of the variable rate interest exposure under the credit facilities, in prior years we have entered 
into various interest rate swaps. As of February 2, 2018, no such interest rate swaps were outstanding and, as a 
result, we are exposed to fluctuations in variable interest rates under the credit facilities and our commercial paper 
program. For a detailed discussion of our credit facilities and our commercial paper program, see Note 5 to the 
consolidated financial statements. 

 
A change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pre-tax earnings and cash flows; whereas a 

change in interest rates on fixed rate debt impacts the economic fair value of debt but not our pre-tax earnings and 
cash flows. Based on our variable rate borrowing levels as of February 2, 2018 and February 3, 2017, the 
annualized effect of a one percentage point increase in variable interest rates would have resulted in a pretax 
reduction of our earnings and cash flows of approximately $6.1 million in 2017 and $9.2 million in 2016.

ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 
 

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of 
Dollar General Corporation 
 
Opinion on the Financial Statements 

 

 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dollar General Corporation and 

subsidiaries (the Company) as of February 2, 2018 and February 3, 2017, the related consolidated statements of 
income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period 
ended February 2, 2018, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).  
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position 
of the Company at February 2, 2018 and February 3, 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for 
each of the three years in the period ended February 2, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted 
accounting principles.  

 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 

Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2018, 
based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated March 23, 2018, expressed 
an unqualified opinion thereon. 

Basis for Opinion 

 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm 
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with 
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and the PCAOB.  

 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that 
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the 
risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing 
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting 
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of 
the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

DOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 

 

1. Basis of presentation and accounting policies 
 
Basis of presentation 
 

These notes contain references to the years 2017, 2016, and 2015, which represent fiscal years ended 

February 2, 2018, February 3, 2017, and January 29, 2016, respectively. The Company had a 53-week accounting 
period in 2016, while 2017 and 2015 were each 52-week accounting periods. The Company’s fiscal year ends on 
the Friday closest to January 31. The consolidated financial statements include all subsidiaries of the Company, 
except for its not-for-profit subsidiary which the Company does not control. Intercompany transactions have been 
eliminated. 

 
The Company sells general merchandise on a retail basis through 14,534 stores (as of February 2, 2018) 
in 44 states with the greatest concentration of stores in the southern, southwestern, midwestern and eastern United 
States. The Company has owned distribution centers (“DCs”) in Scottsville, Kentucky; South Boston, Virginia; 
Alachua, Florida; Zanesville, Ohio; Jonesville, South Carolina; Marion, Indiana; Bessemer, Alabama; Bethel, 
Pennsylvania; San Antonio, Texas; Janesville, Wisconsin; and Jackson, Georgia, and leased DCs in Ardmore, 
Oklahoma; Fulton, Missouri; Indianola, Mississippi; and Lebec, California. 
 
Cash and cash equivalents 
 

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and 

original maturities of three months or less when purchased. Such investments primarily consist of money market 
funds, bank deposits, certificates of deposit, and commercial paper. The carrying amounts of these items are a 
reasonable estimate of their fair value due to the short maturity of these investments. 

 
Payments due from processors for electronic tender transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents 

totaled approximately $90.4 million and $73.9 million at February 2, 2018 and February 3, 2017, respectively. 

 

Investments in debt and equity securities 
 

The Company accounts for investments in debt and marketable equity securities as held-to-maturity, 

available-for-sale, or trading, depending on their classification. Debt securities categorized as held-to-maturity are 
stated at amortized cost. Debt and equity securities categorized as available-for-sale are stated at fair value, with 
any unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported as a component of Accumulated other 
comprehensive loss. Trading securities are stated at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded as a component 
of Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense.  The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific 
identification method. 
 
Merchandise inventories 
 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (“LCM”) with cost determined using the retail last-

in, first-out (“LIFO”) method as this method results in a better matching of costs and revenues. Under the 
Company’s retail inventory method (“RIM”), the calculation of gross profit and the resulting valuation of 
inventories at cost are computed by applying a calculated cost-to-retail inventory ratio to the retail value of sales at 
a department level. The use of the RIM will result in valuing inventories at LCM if markdowns are currently taken 
as a reduction of the retail value of inventories. Costs directly associated with warehousing and distribution are 
capitalized into inventory.

The excess of current cost over LIFO cost was approximately $78.5 million and $80.7 million at 

February 2, 2018 and February 3, 2017, respectively. Current cost is determined using the RIM on a first-in, first-
out basis. Under the LIFO inventory method, the impacts of rising or falling market price changes increase or 
decrease cost of sales (the LIFO provision or benefit). The Company recorded a LIFO provision (benefit) of $(2.2) 
million in 2017, $(12.2) million in 2016, and $(2.3) million in 2015, which is included in cost of goods sold in the 
consolidated statements of income. 

 
The Company purchases its merchandise from a wide variety of suppliers. The Company’s largest and 

second largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 8% of the Company’s purchases in 2017. 

Vendor rebates 

 
The Company accounts for all cash consideration received from vendors in accordance with applicable 

accounting standards pertaining to such arrangements. Cash consideration received from a vendor is generally 
presumed to be a rebate or an allowance and is accounted for as a reduction of merchandise purchase costs as 
earned. However, certain specific, incremental and otherwise qualifying SG&A expenses related to the promotion 
or sale of vendor products may be offset by cash consideration received from vendors, in accordance with 
arrangements such as cooperative advertising, when earned for dollar amounts up to but not exceeding actual 
incremental costs. 

Prepaid expenses and other current assets 

 
Prepaid expenses and other current assets include prepaid amounts for rent, maintenance, business 

licenses, advertising, and insurance, and amounts receivable for certain vendor rebates (primarily those expected 
to be collected in cash) and coupons. 

Property and equipment 

 
In 2007, the Company’s property and equipment was recorded at estimated fair values as the result of a 

 

 

 

 

 

merger transaction. Property and equipment acquired subsequent to the merger has been recorded at cost. The 
Company records depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis over the assets’ estimated useful lives. The 
Company’s property and equipment balances and depreciable lives are summarized as follows:

Impairment of long-lived assets 
 

When indicators of impairment are present, the Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived 

assets, excluding goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, in relation to the operating performance and 
future cash flows or the appraised values of the underlying assets. Generally, the Company’s policy is to review 
for impairment stores open more than three years for which current cash flows from operations are negative. 
Impairment results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows expected to 
be generated by the assets. The Company’s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is based upon historical 
operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability which encompasses many factors that are subject 
to variability and difficult to predict. If a long-lived asset is found to be impaired, the amount recognized for 
impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset’s estimated fair value. The fair 
value is estimated based primarily upon estimated future cash flows over the asset’s remaining useful life 
(discounted at the Company’s credit adjusted risk-free rate) or other reasonable estimates of fair market value. 
Assets to be disposed of are adjusted to the fair value less the cost to sell if less than the book value. 

 
The Company recorded impairment charges included in SG&A expense of approximately $7.8 million in 

2017, $6.3 million in 2016 and $5.9 million in 2015, to reduce the carrying value of certain of its stores’ assets. 
Such action was deemed necessary based on the Company’s evaluation that such amounts would not be 
recoverable primarily due to insufficient sales or excessive costs resulting in the carrying value of the assets 
exceeding the estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by the assets at these locations. 
 
Goodwill and other intangible assets 

 
The Company amortizes intangible assets over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are deemed 

indefinite. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually or more 
frequently if indicators of impairment are present. Definite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment if 
indicators of impairment are present. Impaired assets are written down to fair value as required. No impairment of 
intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented. 

 
In accordance with accounting standards for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, an entity has 
the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more 
likely than not that goodwill or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If after such assessment an entity 
concludes that the asset is not impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action. However, if an entity 
concludes otherwise, then it is required to determine the fair value of the asset using a quantitative impairment 
test, and if impaired, the associated assets must be written down to fair value as described in further detail below. 

 
The quantitative goodwill impairment test is a two-step process that would require management to make 

judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation. The first step of the process consists of 
estimating the fair value of an entity’s reporting units based on valuation techniques (including a discounted cash 
flow model using revenue and profit forecasts) and comparing that estimated fair value with the recorded carrying 
value, which includes goodwill. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, a second step is 
performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an “implied fair value” of goodwill. The 
determination of the implied fair value of goodwill would require the entity to allocate the estimated fair value of 
its reporting unit to its assets and liabilities. Any unallocated fair value would represent the implied fair value of 
goodwill, which would be compared to its corresponding carrying value. 

 
The quantitative impairment test for intangible assets compares the fair value of the intangible asset with 

its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is 
recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

Included in other accrued expenses are liabilities for utilities, interest, maintenance, freight expense and 

credit card processing fees.  
 
Insurance liabilities 
 

The Company retains a significant portion of risk for its workers’ compensation, employee health, 

general liability, property, automobile, and third-party landlord liability claim exposures. Accordingly, provisions 
are made for the Company’s estimates of such risks. The undiscounted future claim costs for the workers’ 
compensation, general liability, landlord liability, and health claim risks are derived using actuarial methods and 
are recorded as self-insurance reserves pursuant to Company policy. To the extent that subsequent claim costs 
vary from those estimates, future results of operations will be affected as the reserves are adjusted. 

 
Ashley River Insurance Company (“ARIC”), a Tennessee-based wholly owned captive insurance 

subsidiary of the Company, charges the operating subsidiary companies premiums to insure the retained workers’ 
compensation, medical stop-loss, and non-property general liability exposures. Pursuant to Tennessee insurance 
regulations, ARIC maintains certain levels of cash and cash equivalents related to its self-insured exposures.  
 
Operating leases and related liabilities 
 

Rent expense is recognized over the term of the lease. The Company records minimum rental expense on 

a straight-line basis over the base, non-cancelable lease term commencing on the date that the Company takes 
physical possession of the property from the landlord, which normally includes a period prior to the store opening 
to make necessary leasehold improvements and install store fixtures. When a lease contains a predetermined fixed 
escalation of the minimum rent, the Company recognizes the related rent expense on a straight-line basis and 
records the difference between the recognized rental expense and the amounts payable under the lease as deferred 
rent. Tenant allowances, to the extent received, are recorded as deferred incentive rent and are amortized as a 
reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease. The difference between the calculated expense and the 
amounts paid result in a liability classified in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, and 
totaled approximately $65.9 million and $61.1 million at February 2, 2018 and February 3, 2017, respectively. 

 
The Company recognizes contingent rental expense when the achievement of specified sales targets is 

considered probable. The amount expensed but not paid as of February 2, 2018 and February 3, 2017 was 
approximately $2.7 million and $3.5 million, respectively, and is included in Accrued expenses and other in the 
consolidated balance sheets.

Fair value accounting 

 
The Company utilizes accounting standards for fair value, which include the definition of fair value, the 
framework for measuring fair value, and disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is a market-based 
measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined 
based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for 
considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, fair value accounting standards establish a 
fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained 
from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the 
hierarchy) and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs 
classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy). 

 
Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that 
the Company has the ability to access. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that 
are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar 
assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than 
quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves that are observable at commonly 
quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are based on an entity’s 
own assumptions, as there is little, if any, observable market activity. In instances where the fair value 
measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value 
hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant 
to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to 
the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 

Other comprehensive income 

 
The Company previously recorded a loss on the settlement of treasury locks associated with the issuance 

of long-term debt in 2013 which was deferred to other comprehensive income and is being amortized as an 
increase to interest expense over the 10-year period of the debt’s maturity.  

Revenue and gain recognition 

 
The Company recognizes retail sales in its stores at the time the customer takes possession of 

merchandise. All sales are net of discounts and are presented net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities 
that are imposed concurrent with those sales. The Company records gain contingencies when realized. 

 
The Company recognizes gift card sales revenue at the time of redemption. The liability for gift cards is 
established for the cash value at the time of purchase of the gift card. The liability for outstanding gift cards was 
approximately $4.2 million and $3.4 million at February 2, 2018 and February 3, 2017, respectively, and is 
recorded in Accrued expenses and other liabilities. Estimated breakage revenue, a percentage of gift cards that will 

 

 

 
54  Dollar General        2017 Form 10-K 

 
 

never be redeemed based on historical redemption rates, is recognized over time in proportion to actual gift card 
redemptions. The Company recorded breakage revenue of $0.6 million, $0.5 million and $0.6 million in 2017, 
2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Advertising costs 

 
Advertising costs are expensed upon performance, “first showing” or distribution, and are reflected in 

SG&A expenses net of earned cooperative advertising amounts provided by vendors which are specific, 
incremental and otherwise qualifying expenses related to the promotion or sale of vendor products for dollar 
amounts up to but not exceeding actual incremental costs. Advertising costs were $68.8 million, $82.7 million and 
$89.3 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These costs primarily include promotional circulars, targeted 
circulars supporting new stores, television and radio advertising, in-store signage, and costs associated with the 
sponsorships of certain automobile racing activities in 2016 and 2015. Vendor funding for cooperative advertising 
offset reported expenses by $33.8 million, $35.9 million and $36.7 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Share-based payments 

 
The Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based compensation based on the fair value of 
the awards on the grant date. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of valuation and reduce expense ratably over the 
vesting period. This estimate may be adjusted periodically based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or 
are expected to differ, from the prior estimate. The forfeiture rate is the estimated percentage of share-based 
awards granted that are expected to be forfeited or canceled before becoming fully vested. The Company bases 
this estimate on historical experience or estimates of future trends, as applicable. An increase in the forfeiture rate 
will decrease compensation expense. 

 
The fair value of each option grant is separately estimated and amortized into compensation expense on a 

straight-line basis between the applicable grant date and each vesting date. The Company has estimated the fair 
value of all stock option awards as of the grant date by applying the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing 
valuation model. The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly 
sensitive in the determination of compensation expense. 

 
The Company calculates compensation expense for restricted stock, share units and similar awards as the 

difference between the market price of the underlying stock or similar award on the grant date and the purchase 
price, if any. Such expense is recognized on a straight-line basis for time-based awards and generally on an 
accelerated basis for performance awards over the period in which the recipient earns the awards. 

 

 

 

 
Pre-opening costs related to new store openings and the related construction periods are expensed as 

Store pre-opening costs 

incurred. 
 

Income taxes 

 
Under the accounting standards for income taxes, the asset and liability method is used for computing the 

future income tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial 
statements or income tax returns. Deferred income tax expense or benefit is the net change during the year in the 
Company’s deferred income tax assets and liabilities. 

 
The Company includes income tax related interest and penalties as a component of the provision for 

income tax expense. 

 
Income tax reserves are determined using a methodology which requires companies to assess each 

income tax position taken using a two-step process. A determination is first made as to whether it is more likely 

 
 

 

Dollar General        2017 Form 10-K  55

than not that the position will be sustained, based upon the technical merits, upon examination by the taxing 
authorities. If the tax position is expected to meet the more likely than not criteria, the benefit recorded for the tax 
position equals the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the 
respective tax position. Uncertain tax positions require determinations and estimated liabilities to be made based 
on provisions of the tax law which may be subject to change or varying interpretation. If the Company’s 
determinations and estimates prove to be inaccurate, the resulting adjustments could be material to the Company’s 
future financial results. 

 

Management estimates 

 
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles 

generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the 
consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Accounting standards 

 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued comprehensive new 

accounting standards related to the recognition of revenue, which specified an effective date for annual reporting 
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB 
deferred the effective date to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with earlier adoption 
permitted only for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The new guidance allows 
companies to use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach in the adoption of this guidance. 
The Company formed a project team to assess and implement the standard by compiling a list of the applicable 
revenue streams, evaluating relevant contracts and comparing the Company’s current accounting policies to the 
new standard. As a result of the efforts of this project team, the Company has identified customer incentives and 
gross versus net considerations as the areas in which it would most likely be affected by the new guidance. The 
Company has assessed the impacts of the new standard and the related design of internal control over financial 
reporting. Based upon the terms of the Company’s agreements and the materiality of transactions related to 
customer incentives and gross versus net considerations, the adoption had no effect on the Company’s 
consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The Company adopted this guidance on 
February 3, 2018. 

 
In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to lease accounting, which when effective will 

require a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee will account for leases as finance leases or 
operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use asset 
and a corresponding lease liability on its balance sheet, with differing methodology for income statement 
recognition. This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those 
years, beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. Currently, a modified retrospective 
approach is required for all leases existing or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in 
the consolidated financial statements. The FASB has proposed guidance which would allow companies to record 
the cumulative effect of applying the new standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings, 
although such guidance has not yet been formally issued. The Company formed a project team to assess and 
implement the standard, which is evaluating existing contractual arrangements for embedded leases, and 
comparing the Company’s current accounting policies to the new standard. As a result of the efforts of this project 
team, the Company has identified its store leases as the area in which it would most likely be affected by the new 
guidance. The Company’s assessment of the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated 
financial statements is ongoing and the Company is anticipating a material impact because it is party to a 
significant number of lease contracts for its stores.  

 
In October 2016, the FASB issued amendments to existing guidance related to accounting for intra-entity 

transfers of assets other than inventory. These amendments require an entity to recognize the income tax 

 
56  Dollar General        2017 Form 10-K 

 
 

consequences of such transfers when the transfer occurs and affects the Company’s historical accounting for intra-
entity transfers of certain intangible assets. This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, 
and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted 
subject to certain guidelines. The amendments should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a 
cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The 
Company adopted this guidance on February 3, 2018 which resulted in an increase in deferred income tax 
liabilities and a decrease in retained earnings of approximately $33.6 million. 
 

In January 2017, the FASB issued amendments to existing guidance related to the subsequent 

measurement of goodwill. These amendments modify the concept of impairment from the condition that exists 
when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value to the condition that exists when the carrying 
amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Subsequent to adoption, an entity will perform its annual, or 
interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and 
recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair 
value. This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those 
years, beginning after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill 
impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.  The amendments should be applied on a 
prospective basis. An entity is required to disclose the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle 
upon transition.  The Company’s assessment of the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on its 
consolidated financial statements is ongoing, but the Company currently does not anticipate a material effect on 
consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
 
Reclassifications 
 

Certain financial disclosures relating to prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current 

year presentation where applicable.  

 

2. Goodwill and other intangible assets 

 
The Company’s other intangible assets primarily consist of trade names and trademarks of $1.2 billion 
which have an indefinite life. The Company’s goodwill balance has an indefinite life and is not expected to be 
deductible for tax purposes.

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares 

of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is determined based on the dilutive effect 
of share-based awards using the treasury stock method. 

 
Share-based awards that were outstanding at the end of the respective periods, but were not included in 
the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect of exercising such options would be antidilutive, 
were 2.1 million, 1.7 million and 1.3 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was signed into law.  Among other 

changes, the Act reduces the federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% effective January 1, 2018, including a 
reduction in the Company’s current year federal corporate tax rate for 2017 to 33.7% as a result of the Company’s 
2017 fiscal year ending approximately one month after the effective date of the Act.   

 
Under accounting standards for income taxes, the impact of new tax legislation must be taken into 

account in the period in which the new legislation is enacted, including the remeasurement of deferred tax assets 
and liabilities at the tax rates that such items are expected to reverse in future periods. Subsequent to the Act, the 
Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, allowing companies to 
record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to exceed one year after the enactment date while the 
accounting impact remains under analysis. The Company’s 2017 provision for income taxes reflects such 
estimates due to the changes in income tax law, including a provisional tax benefit of $335 million. The 
provisional tax benefit consists of $310.8 million related to the one-time remeasurement of the federal portion of 
the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities at the 21% rate and $24.2 million related to the reduced statutory 
tax rate of 33.7%, compared to 35% in prior years.  The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional 
amounts due to additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, additional 
regulatory guidance that may be issued and actions the Company may take as a result of the Act. Any subsequent 
adjustments to provisional estimates will be reflected in the Company’s income tax provision during one or more 
periods in 2018.   

 
The effective income tax rate for 2017 was 19.3% compared to a rate of 36.3% for 2016 which represents 
a net decrease of 17 percentage points. The effective income tax rate was lower in 2017 primarily due to the one-
time remeasurement of the federal portion of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities at 21%, and the 
changes in the federal income tax laws pursuant to the Act that lowered the Company’s federal statutory tax rate to 
33.7% for 2017, compared to 35% in 2016. 

 
The 2016 effective tax rate was an expense of 36.3%. This expense was greater than the federal statutory 

tax rate of 35% due primarily to the inclusion of state income taxes in the total effective tax rate. The effective 
income tax rate was lower in 2016 due principally to the adoption of a change in accounting guidance related to 
employee share-based payments, requiring the recognition of excess tax benefits in the statement of income rather 
than in the balance sheet, as reported in prior years. 

 
The 2015 effective tax rate was an expense of 37.1%. This expense was greater than the federal statutory 

tax rate of 35% primarily due to the inclusion of state income taxes in the total effective tax rate.

The Company has state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $10.6 million that will expire 

beginning in 2022 through 2027 and the Company has approximately $17.6 million of state apportioned net 
operating loss carryforwards, which will begin to expire in 2033 and will continue through 2038. 

 
The Company established a valuation allowance for the state tax credit carryforwards, in the amount of 

$4.4 million (net of federal benefit) increasing income tax expense in 2017. Management believes that results 
from operations will not generate sufficient taxable income to realize certain state tax credits before they expire. In 
2016, the Company reversed all of the previously recorded valuation allowance for state tax credit carryforwards 
in the amount of $1.5 million, which was recorded as a reduction in income tax expense.  

 
Based upon expected future income, management believes that it is more likely than not that the results 

of operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the remaining deferred tax assets.  

 
The Company’s 2013 and earlier tax years are not open for further examination by the Internal Revenue 
Service (“IRS”). The IRS, at its discretion, may choose to examine the Company’s 2014 through 2017 fiscal year 
income tax filings. The Company has various state income tax examinations that are currently in progress. 
Generally, with few exceptions, the Company’s 2014 and later tax years remain open for examination by the 
various state taxing authorities. 

 
As of February 2, 2018, accruals for uncertain tax benefits, interest expense related to income taxes and 

potential income tax penalties were $1.0 million, $0.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively, for a total of $2.5 
million. This total amount is reflected in noncurrent Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.

million. This total amount is reflected in noncurrent Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. 

 
The Company’s reserve for uncertain tax positions will not be reduced in the coming twelve months as a 
result of expiring statutes of limitations. As of February 2, 2018, approximately $1.0 million of the uncertain tax 
positions would impact the Company’s effective income tax rate if the Company were to recognize the tax benefit 
for these positions.

At February 2, 2018, the Company’s senior unsecured credit facilities (the “Facilities”) consisted of a 

$175.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility (the “Term Facility”) and a $1.25 billion senior unsecured 
revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”) that provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to 
$175.0 million. The Term Facility is scheduled to mature on October 20, 2020, and the Revolving Facility is 
scheduled to mature on February 22, 2022.  

 
Borrowings under the Facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable interest rate margin plus, at 

the Company’s option, either (a) LIBOR or (b) a base rate (which is usually equal to the prime rate). The 
applicable interest rate margin for borrowings as of February 2, 2018 was 1.10% for LIBOR borrowings and 
0.10% for base-rate borrowings. The Company is also required to pay a facility fee, payable on any used and 
unused commitment amounts of the Facilities, and customary fees on letters of credit issued under the Revolving 
Facility.  As of February 2, 2018, the commitment fee rate was 0.15%. The applicable interest rate margins for 
borrowings, the facility fees and the letter of credit fees under the Facilities are subject to adjustment from time to 
time based on the Company’s long-term senior unsecured debt ratings. The weighted average all-in interest rate 
for borrowings under the Facilities was 2.7% as of February 2, 2018. 

 
The Facilities can be voluntarily prepaid in whole or in part at any time without penalty. There is no 

required principal amortization under the Facilities.  The Facilities contain a number of customary affirmative and 
negative covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the Company’s ability to: incur 
additional liens; sell all or substantially all of the Company’s assets; consummate certain fundamental changes or 
change in the Company’s lines of business; and incur additional subsidiary indebtedness. The Facilities also 
contain financial covenants which require the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a 
maximum leverage ratio. As of February 2, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants.  The 
Facilities also contain customary events of default. 

 
As of February 2, 2018, the entire balance of the Term Facility was outstanding and, under the Revolving 
Facility, the Company had no outstanding borrowings, outstanding letters of credit of $9.1 million, and borrowing

availability of $1.2 billion that, due to its intention to maintain borrowing availability related to the commercial 
paper program described below, could contribute incremental liquidity of $624.7 million. In addition, the 
Company had outstanding letters of credit of $37.5 million which were issued pursuant to separate agreements. 

 
As of February 2, 2018, the Company had a commercial paper program under which the Company may 
issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed 
$1.0 billion outstanding at any time. The CP Notes have maturities of up to 364 days from the date of issue and 
rank equal in right of payment with all of the Company’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The 
Company intends to maintain available commitments under the amended and restated revolving credit facilities in 
an amount at least equal to the amount of CP Notes outstanding at any time. As of February 2, 2018, the 
Company’s consolidated balance sheet reflected outstanding CP notes of $430.2 million, which were classified as 
long-term obligations due to the Company’s intent and ability to refinance these obligations as long-term debt. An 
additional $186 million of outstanding CP Notes were held by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and are 
therefore not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet. The weighted average interest rate for borrowings under 
the commercial paper program was 1.8% as of February 2, 2018. 

 
On April 11, 2017, the Company issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.875% senior 

notes due 2027 (the “2027 Senior Notes”), at a discount of $0.4 million, which are scheduled to mature on April 
15, 2027. Interest on the 2027 Senior Notes is payable in cash on April 15 and October 15 of each year, and 
commenced on October 15, 2017. The Company incurred $5.2 million of debt issuance costs associated with the 
issuance of the 2027 Senior Notes. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2027 Senior Notes were used to repay all 
of the Company’s outstanding senior notes due in 2017 as discussed below and for general corporate purposes. 
Collectively, the 2027 Senior Notes and the Company’s other Senior Notes due 2018, 2023 and 2025 as reflected 
in the table above comprise the “Senior Notes”, each of which were issued pursuant to an indenture as 
supplemented and amended by supplemental indentures relating to each series of Senior Notes (as so 
supplemented and amended, the “Senior Indenture”). 

 
On April 27, 2017, the Company redeemed $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 

4.125% senior notes due 2017 (the “2017 Senior Notes”), resulting in a pretax loss of $3.4 million which is 
reflected in Other (income) expense in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended February 2, 2018.  

 
The Company may redeem some or all of its Senior Notes at any time at redemption prices set forth in 
the Senior Indenture. Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event, which is defined in the Senior 
Indenture, each holder of the Senior Notes has the right to require the Company to repurchase some or all of such 
holder’s Senior Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and 
unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date. 

 
The Senior Indenture contains covenants limiting, among other things, the ability of the Company and its 
subsidiaries to (subject to certain exceptions): consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially 
all of the Company’s assets; and to incur or guarantee indebtedness secured by liens on any shares of voting stock 
of significant subsidiaries. 

 
The Senior Indenture also provides for events of default which, if any of them occurs, would permit or 
require the principal of and accrued interest on the Senior Notes to become or to be declared due and payable, as 
applicable. 

 
Scheduled debt maturities at February 2, 2018, including capital lease obligations, for the Company’s 
fiscal years listed below are as follows (in thousands): 2018 - $831,545; 2019 - $1,950; 2020 - $176,958; 2021 -

 7. Commitments and contingencies 
 
Leases 
 

As of February 2, 2018, the Company was committed under operating lease agreements for most of its 

retail stores. Many of the Company’s stores are subject to build-to-suit arrangements with landlords which 
typically carry a primary lease term of up to 15 years with multiple renewal options. The Company also has stores 
subject to shorter-term leases and many of these leases have renewal options. Certain of the Company’s leased 
stores have provisions for contingent rent based upon a specified percentage of defined sales volume. 

 
The land and buildings of the Company’s DCs in Missouri, Mississippi and California are subject to 
operating lease agreements and the leased Oklahoma DC is subject to a financing arrangement. Certain leases 
contain restrictive covenants, and as of February 2, 2018, the Company is not aware of any material violations of 
such covenants. 

 
The Company is accounting for the Oklahoma DC as a financing obligation as a result of, among other 

things, the lessor’s ability to put the property back to the Company under certain circumstances. The property and 
equipment, along with the related lease obligation associated with this transaction are recorded in the consolidated 
balance sheets. The Company is the owner of a secured promissory note (the “Ardmore Note”) which represents 
debt issued by the third party entity from which the Company leases the Oklahoma DC and therefore the 
Company holds the debt instrument pertaining to its lease financing obligation. Because a legal right of offset 
exists, the Company is accounting for the Ardmore Note as a reduction of its outstanding financing obligation in 
its consolidated balance sheets.

financing obligations at February 2, 2018 and February 3, 2017, was $36.2 million and $29.8 million, 
respectively. Accumulated depreciation on property and equipment under capital leases and financing obligations 
at February 2, 2018 and February 3, 2017, was $12.4 million and $14.3 million, respectively.

Legal proceedings 
 

From time to time, the Company is a party to various legal matters involving claims incidental to the 

conduct of its business, including actions by employees, consumers, suppliers, government agencies, or others.  
The Company has recorded accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the 
Company’s consolidated financial statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot 
be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made. 

Except as described below, the Company believes, based upon information currently available, that such 

matters, both individually and in the aggregate, will be resolved without a material adverse effect on the 
Company’s consolidated financial statements as a whole. However, litigation and other legal matters involve an 
element of uncertainty. Future developments could cause these actions or claims to have a material adverse effect 
on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. In addition, certain of these matters, if 
decided adversely to the Company or settled by the Company, may result in liability material to the Company’s 
financial position or may negatively affect operating results if changes to the Company’s business operation are 
required. 

Wage and Hour Litigation 

The Company is defending the following wage and hour matters (collectively the “Wage/Hour 

Litigation”): 

•  California Wage/Hour Litigation: Plaintiffs allege, on behalf of themselves and other similarly 

situated current and former “key carriers”, that the Company failed to comply with California law, 
including the Private Attorney General Act (the “PAGA”), in one or more of the following ways: 
failure to provide meal and rest periods, failure to pay for all time worked, failure to pay timely 
wages, and failure to provide accurate wage statements and termination pay. The plaintiffs seek to 
recover alleged unpaid wages, injunctive relief, consequential damages, pre-judgment interest, 
statutory penalties and attorneys’ fees and costs. 

 
 

 

Dollar General        2017 Form 10-K  65

•  Pennsylvania Wage/Hour Litigation: Plaintiff alleges that he and other similarly situated current and 
former hourly employees were subjected to unlawful policies and practices and were denied regular 
and overtime wages in violation of federal and Pennsylvania law. The plaintiff seeks to proceed on a 
nationwide collective basis under federal law and a statewide class basis under Pennsylvania law and 
to recover alleged unpaid wages, liquidated damages, statutory damages, and attorneys’ fees and 
costs. 

•  Tennessee Wage/Hour Litigation: Plaintiffs allege that they and other similarly situated current and 

former “key holders” were not paid for all hours worked in violation of federal, Illinois and 
Tennessee law. The plaintiffs seek to proceed on a nationwide collective basis under federal law and 
a statewide class basis under Tennessee and Illinois law and to recover alleged unpaid wages, 
statutory and common law damages, liquidated damages, pre- and post-judgment interest and 
attorneys’ fees and costs.  The Company has reached a preliminary agreement with the plaintiffs, 
which must be submitted to and approved by the Court, to resolve this matter for an amount not 
material to the Company’s financial statements as a whole.  

The Company is vigorously defending the Wage/Hour Litigation and believes that its policies and 

practices comply with federal and state laws and that these actions are not appropriate for class or similar 
treatment.  At this time, it is not possible to predict whether these matters will be permitted to proceed as a class or 
other similar action, or the size of any putative class or classes. Likewise, except as to the resolution of the 
Tennessee Wage/Hour Litigation, at this time it is not possible to estimate the value of the claims asserted, and no 
assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in its defense of these matters on the merits or 
otherwise.  For these reasons, except as to the resolution of the Tennessee Wage/Hour Litigation, the Company is 
unable to estimate any potential loss or range of loss in these matters; however, if the Company is not successful 
in its defense efforts, the resolution of these actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s 
consolidated financial statements as a whole.

•  California Suitable Seating Litigation: The plaintiff alleges that the Company failed to provide her and 
other current and former California store employees with “suitable seats” in violation of California law.  
The plaintiff seeks to recover penalties under the PAGA, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees and costs.   

•  EEOC Litigation:  The United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) filed suit 
against the Company alleging the Company’s use of post offer, pre-employment physical assessments, as 
applied to candidates for the general warehouse position in the Bessemer, Alabama distribution center, 
violates the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act.   

The Company is vigorously defending the Employment Litigation and believes that its employment 
policies and practices comply with federal and state law and that these matters are not appropriate for class or

class or in a similar fashion, or the size of any putative class or classes.  Likewise, at this time, it is not possible to

Consumer/Product Litigation 

 
In December 2015 the Company was first notified of several lawsuits in which the plaintiffs allege 

violation of state consumer protection laws relating to the labeling, marketing and sale of certain Dollar General 
private-label motor oil. Each of these lawsuits, as well as additional, similar lawsuits filed after December 2015, 
was filed in, or removed to, various federal district courts of the United States (collectively “the Motor Oil 
Lawsuits”).  

 
 On June 2, 2016, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (“JPML”) granted the 

Company’s motion to centralize the Motor Oil Lawsuits in a matter styled In re Dollar General Corp. Motor Oil 
Litigation, Case MDL No. 2709, before the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri 
(“Motor Oil MDL”).  Subsequently, the plaintiffs in the Motor Oil MDL filed a consolidated amended complaint, 
in which they seek to certify two nationwide classes and multiple statewide sub-classes and for each putative class 
member some or all of the following relief: compensatory damages, injunctive relief, statutory damages, punitive 
damages and attorneys’ fees.  The Company’s motion to dismiss the allegations raised in the consolidated 
amended complaint was granted in part and denied in part. To the extent additional consumer lawsuits alleging 
violation of laws relating to the labeling, marketing and sale of Dollar General private-label motor oil have been 
or will be filed, the Company expects that such lawsuits will be transferred to the Motor Oil MDL. 

 
 In May 2017, the Company received a Notice of Proposed Action from the Office of the New Mexico 

Attorney General (the “New Mexico AG”) which alleges that the Company’s labeling, marketing and sale of 
certain Dollar General private-label motor oil violated New Mexico law (the “New Mexico Motor Oil Matter”).  
The State is represented in connection with this matter by counsel for the plaintiffs in the Motor Oil MDL. 

 
On May 25, 2017, in response to the Notice of Proposed Action, the Company filed an action in New 
Mexico federal court seeking a declaratory judgment that the New Mexico AG is prohibited by, among other 
things, the United States Constitution, from pursuing the New Mexico Motor Oil Matter and an order enjoining 
the New Mexico AG from pursuing such an action.  (Dollar General Corporation v. Hector H. Balderas, D.N.M., 
Case No. 1:17-cv-00588). Thereafter, on June 20, 2017, the New Mexico AG filed an action in the First Judicial 
District Court, County of Santa Fe, New Mexico pertaining to the New Mexico Motor Oil Matter.  (Hector H. 
Balderas v. Dolgencorp, LLC, Case No. D-101-cv-2017-01562).  The Company removed this matter to New 
Mexico federal court on July 26, 2017, and filed a motion to dismiss the action. The matter was transferred to the 
Motor Oil MDL and the New Mexico AG has moved to remand it to state court. (Hector H. Balderas v. 
Dolgencorp, LLC, D.N.M., Case No. 1:17-cv-772). The Company’s and the New Mexico AG’s above-referenced 
motions are pending. 

 
On September 1, 2017, the Mississippi Attorney General (the “Mississippi AG”), who also is represented 
by the counsel for the plaintiffs in the Motor Oil MDL, filed an action in the Chancery Court of the First Judicial 
District of Hinds County, Mississippi which alleges that the Company’s labeling, marketing and sale of certain 
Dollar General private-label motor oil violated Mississippi law. (Jim Hood v. Dollar General Corporation, Case 
No. G2017-1229 T/1) (the “Mississippi Motor Oil Matter”). The Company removed this matter to Mississippi 
federal court on October 5, 2017, and filed a motion to dismiss the action. The matter was transferred to the Motor 
Oil MDL and the Mississippi AG moved to remand it to state court. (Jim Hood v. Dollar General Corporation, 
N.D. Miss., Case No. 3:17-cv-801-LG-LRA).  The Company’s and the Mississippi AG’s above-referenced 
motions are pending. 

 
On January 30, 2018, the Company received a Civil Investigative Demand (“CID”) from the Office of 
the Louisiana Attorney General (“Louisiana AG”) requesting information concerning the Company’s labeling, 
marketing and sale of certain Dollar General private-label motor oil (the “Louisiana Motor Oil Matter”). In 
response to the CID, the Company filed a petition for a protective order on February 20, 2018 in the 19th Judicial 
District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana seeking to set aside the Louisiana AG’s CID. (In re 
Dollar General Corp. and Dolgencorp, LLC, Case No. 666499).  The Company’s petition is pending. 
 

A mediation held in the Motor Oil MDL on February 26, 2018, was unsuccessful. 
 
 

 
 

 

Dollar General        2017 Form 10-K  67

The Company is vigorously defending these matters and believes that the labeling, marketing and sale of 

its private-label motor oil comply with applicable federal and state requirements and are not misleading.  The 
Company further believes that these matters are not appropriate for class or similar treatment.  At this time, 
however, it is not possible to predict whether these matters will be permitted to proceed as a class or in a similar 
fashion, whether on a statewide or nationwide basis, or the size of any putative class or classes.  Likewise, at this 
time, it is not possible to estimate the value of the claims asserted, and no assurances can be given that the 
Company will be successful in its defense of these matters on the merits or otherwise.  For these reasons, the 
Company is unable to estimate the potential loss or range of loss in these matters; however, if the Company is not 
successful in its defense efforts, the resolution of the Motor Oil MDL, the New Mexico Motor Oil Matter, the 
Mississippi Motor Oil Matter or the Louisiana Motor Oil Matter could have a material adverse effect on the 
Company’s consolidated financial statements as a whole. 

Shareholder Litigation 

 
The Company is defending litigation filed in January and February 2017 in which the plaintiffs, on behalf 
of themselves and a putative class of shareholders, allege that between March 10, 2016 and December 1, 2016, the 
Company and certain of its officers (the “Individual Defendants”) violated federal securities laws by 
misrepresenting the impact to sales of changes to certain federal programs that provide supplemental nutritional 
assistance to individuals. (Iron Workers Local Union No. 405 Annuity Fund v. Dollar General Corporation, et al., 
M.D. Tenn., Case No. 3:17-cv-00063; Julia Askins v. Dollar General Corporation, et al., M.D. Tenn., Case No. 
3:17-cv-00276; Bruce Velan v. Dollar General Corporation, et al., M.D. Tenn., Case No. 3:17-cv-00275) 
(collectively “the Shareholder Litigation”).  The plaintiffs in the Shareholder Litigation seek the following relief: 
compensatory damages, unspecified equitable relief, pre- and post-judgment interest and attorneys’ fees and 
expenses. The court has consolidated the cases, appointed a lead plaintiff and entered a preliminary scheduling 
order. On March 8, 2018, the court granted the Company’s and the Individual Defendants’ motion to dismiss the 
Shareholder Litigation and entered judgment in the Company’s and the Individual Defendants’ favor. The 
plaintiffs have 30 days from the entry of the dismissal order within which to file an appeal with the federal appeals 
court. 

 
The Company believes that the statements at issue in the Shareholder Litigation complied with the 
federal securities laws and intends to vigorously defend this matter.  At this time, it is not possible to predict 
whether the Shareholder Litigation will be permitted to proceed as a class or the size of any putative class.  
Likewise, at this time, it is not possible to estimate the value of the claims asserted in this action, and no 
assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in its defense on the merits or otherwise.  For these 
reasons, the Company is unable to estimate the potential loss or range of loss in this matter; however if the 
Company is not successful in its defense efforts, the resolution of the Shareholder Litigation could have a material 
adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as a whole. 

 
The Company is also defending shareholder derivative actions filed in April, July and August 2017, in 

which each plaintiff asserts, purportedly on behalf of the Company, some or all of the following claims against the 
Company’s board of directors and certain of its officers based upon factual allegations substantially similar to 
those in the Shareholder Litigation: alleged breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, violation of federal 
securities laws, abuse of control, and gross mismanagement.  (Robert Anderson v. Todd Vasos, et al., M.D. Tenn., 
Case No. 3:17-cv-00693; Sharon Shaver v. Todd J. Vasos, et al., Chancery Court for the Twentieth Judicial 
District of Davidson County, Tennessee, Case No. 17-797-I; Glenn Saito v. Todd Vasos, et al., M.D. Tenn., Case 
No. 3:17-cv-01138) (collectively “the Derivative Litigation”). The plaintiffs in the Derivative Litigation seek, 
purportedly on behalf of the Company, some or all of the following relief: compensatory damages, injunctive 
relief, disgorgement, restitution and attorneys’ fees and expenses. The Anderson and Saito cases have been 
consolidated and stayed pending resolution of the motion to dismiss in the Shareholder Litigation, and a similar 
stay has been ordered in the Shaver action. At this time, the stays in the Derivative Litigation have not been lifted.

8. Benefit plans 

 
The Dollar General Corporation 401(k) Savings and Retirement Plan, which became effective on 

January 1, 1998, is a safe harbor defined contribution plan and is subject to the Employee Retirement and Income 
Security Act (“ERISA”). 

 
A participant’s right to claim a distribution of his or her account balance is dependent on the plan, ERISA 
guidelines and Internal Revenue Service regulations. All active participants are fully vested in all contributions to 
the 401(k) plan. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company expensed approximately $17.5 million, $16.0 million 
and $15.0 million, respectively, for matching contributions. 

 
The Company also has a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan (“SERP”) and compensation deferral 
plan (“CDP”), known as the Dollar General Corporation CDP/SERP Plan, for a select group of management and 
other key employees. The Company incurred compensation expense for these plans of approximately $0.7 million, 
$0.7 million and $1.1 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

 
The CDP/SERP Plan assets are invested in accounts selected by the Company’s Compensation 

Committee or its delegate, and the associated deferred compensation liability is reflected in the consolidated 
balance sheets as further disclosed in Note 6. 
 
9. Share-based payments 

 
The Company accounts for share-based payments in accordance with applicable accounting standards, 
under which the fair value of each award is separately estimated and amortized into compensation expense over 
the service period. The fair value of the Company’s stock option grants are estimated on the grant date using the 
Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are 
judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of compensation expense. The fair value of the Company’s 
other share-based awards discussed below are estimated using the Company’s closing stock price on the grant 
date. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of valuation and reduce expense ratably over the vesting period. 

 
On July 6, 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, which plan 
was subsequently amended and restated on several occasions (as so amended and restated, the “Plan”). The Plan 
allows the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, and other stock-based awards or dividend 
equivalent rights to key employees, directors, consultants or other persons having a service relationship with the 
Company, its subsidiaries and certain of its affiliates. The number of shares of Company common stock 
authorized for grant under the Plan is 31,142,858.  

 
Since May 2011, most of the share-based awards issued by the Company have been in the form of stock 
options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units. With limited exceptions, stock options 
and restricted stock units granted to employees generally vest ratably on an annual basis over four-year and three-
year periods, respectively.  Awards granted to board members generally vest over a one-year period. The number 
of performance share units earned are based on performance criteria measured in the year of grant or over a period 
of two or three years, and such awards generally vest over a three-year period. With limited exceptions, the 
performance share unit and restricted stock unit awards are payable in shares of common stock on the vesting 
date. At February 2, 2018, the Company also had a limited number of outstanding stock options issued prior to 
June 2011 (“Old Options”).

Expected dividend yield - This is an estimate of the expected dividend yield on the Company’s stock. An 

increase in the dividend yield will decrease compensation expense. 

 
Expected stock price volatility - This is a measure of the amount by which the price of the Company’s 

common stock has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate. An increase in the expected volatility will increase 
compensation expense. 

Weighted average risk-free interest rate - This is the U.S. Treasury rate for the week of the grant having a 

term approximating the expected life of the option. An increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase 
compensation expense. 

Expected term of options - This is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to 

remain outstanding. The Company has estimated the expected term as the mid-point between the vesting date and 
the contractual term of the option. An increase in the expected term will increase compensation expense.

11. Common stock transactions 

 
On August 29, 2012, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase program, 
which the Board has since increased on several occasions. On March 14, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors 
authorized a $1.0 billion increase to the existing common stock repurchase program and as of such date, a 
cumulative total of $6.0 billion had been authorized under the program since its inception. The repurchase 
authorization has no expiration date and allows repurchases from time to time in the open market or in privately 
negotiated transactions. The timing and number of shares purchased depends on a variety of factors, such as price, 
market conditions, compliance with the covenants and restrictions under the Company’s debt agreements and 
other factors. Repurchases under the program may be funded from available cash or borrowings including under 
the Company’s Facilities and issuance of CP Notes discussed in further detail in Note 5.  

 
During the years ended February 2, 2018, February 3, 2017, and January 29, 2016, the Company 

repurchased approximately 7.1 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $0.6 billion, approximately 
12.4 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $1.0 billion, and approximately 17.6 million shares of its 
common stock at a total cost of $1.3 billion, respectively, pursuant to its common stock repurchase programs. 

 
The Company paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.26 per share in 2017. On March 14, 2018, the 

Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.29 per share, which is payable on or 
before April 24, 2018 to shareholders of record on April 10, 2018. The amount and declaration of future cash 
dividends is subject to the sole discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and will depend upon, among 
other things, the Company’s results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions 
and other factors that the Board may deem relevant in its sole discretion.

In 2017, the Company purchased 15 retail store locations and assumed the lease obligations on 

approximately 300 retail store locations, and relocated certain of its existing stores to the acquired locations.  As a 
result, the Company incurred expenses, primarily related to costs for remaining lease liabilities, of $7.3 million 
($4.4 million net of tax, or $0.02 per diluted share), which was recognized in Selling, general, and administrative 
expense in the second quarter of 2017. 

 
In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company closed an incremental 35 stores as result of a strategic review 
process. The Company incurred $28.3 million of costs ($17.6 million net of tax, or $0.07 per diluted share) related 
to these store closings, most of which was in the form of SG&A expenses for remaining lease liabilities. 

 
In 2016, the Company acquired 42 retail store locations and closed 40 of its own locations as part of 

relocating stores to the purchased locations. As a result, the Company incurred expenses, primarily related to costs 
for remaining lease liabilities, of $11.0 million ($6.7 million net of tax, or $0.02 per diluted share), which was 
recognized in SG&A expense in the third quarter of 2016. 

 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company sold or assigned the leases for 12 of its own locations which 

were closed as part of the relocation process to the acquired locations. As a result, the Company incurred a 
reduction of expenses of $4.5 million ($2.8 million net of tax, or $0.01 per diluted share), which was recognized in 
SG&A expense.

ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

 
(a)  Disclosure Controls and Procedures.  Under the supervision and with the participation of our 

management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation 
of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated 
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based on this evaluation, our 
principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and 
procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 

 
(b)  Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  Our management 

prepared and is responsible for the consolidated financial statements and all related financial information 
contained in this report. This responsibility includes establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over 
financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over 
financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with United States generally accepted 
accounting principles. 

 
To comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management 

designed and implemented a structured and comprehensive assessment process to evaluate the effectiveness of its 
internal control over financial reporting. Such assessment was based on criteria established in 
Internal Control— Integrated Framework (2013 Framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over 
financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. 
Management regularly monitors our internal control over financial reporting, and actions are taken to correct any 
deficiencies as they are identified. Based on its assessment, management has concluded that our internal control 
over financial reporting is effective as of February 2, 2018. 

 
Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated 

financial statements, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. Such 
attestation report is contained below.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

 

 

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of 
Dollar General Corporation 
 
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 

 

 

We have audited Dollar General Corporation and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as 

of February 2, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In 
our opinion, Dollar General Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, 
effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2018, based on the COSO criteria.  

 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 

Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2017 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated 
March 23, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.  

Basis for Opinion 

 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial 
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the 
accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is 
to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a 
public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the 
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  

 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we 

plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial 
reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

   
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the 

risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal 
control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the 
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable 

assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external 
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial 
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of

Long-Term Incentive Program: 2018 Annual Equity Grants 

 
On March 21, 2018, a subcommittee of the Company’s Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) 

awarded 157,197 non-qualified stock options (“Options”) and 40,924 performance share units (“PSUs”) to 
Mr. Vasos, 27,510 Options and 7,162 PSUs to Mr. Garratt and Ms. Taylor and 29,475 Options and 7,673 PSUs to 
Messrs. Owen and Ravener on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the form of Option award 
agreement (“Form Option Agreement”) and form of PSU award agreement (“Form PSU Agreement”) attached 
hereto as Exhibit 10.7 and Exhibit 10.15, respectively (collectively, the “Form Award Agreements”), and subject 
to the terms and conditions of the previously filed Dollar General Corporation Amended and Restated 2007 Stock 
Incentive Plan.   

   
The Options, which were granted on terms substantially similar to the prior year, have a term of ten years 

and, subject to earlier forfeiture or accelerated vesting under certain circumstances described in the Form Option 
Agreement, generally will vest in four equal annual installments beginning on April 1, 2019.  

   
The PSUs represent a target number of units that can be earned if certain performance measures are 

achieved during the applicable performance periods and if certain additional vesting requirements are met. Fifty 
percent of the target number of PSUs is subject to an adjusted EBITDA performance measure with a performance 
period of the Company’s fiscal year 2018.  The other fifty percent of the target number of PSUs is subject to an 
adjusted ROIC performance measure which is the average of adjusted ROIC for the Company’s fiscal years 2018, 
2019 and 2020.  All performance measures were established by the Committee on the grant date. The number of 
PSUs earned will vary between 0% and 300% of the target amount based on actual performance compared to 
target performance on a graduated scale, with performance at the target level resulting in 100% of the target 
number of PSUs being earned. At the conclusion of each applicable performance period, the Committee will 
determine the level of achievement of each performance goal measure and the corresponding number of PSUs 
earned by each grantee. Subject to certain pro-rata vesting conditions, one-third of the PSUs earned by each 
grantee for adjusted EBITDA performance will vest in equal installments on April 1, 2019, April 1, 2020 and 
April 1, 2021, in each case subject to the grantee’s continued employment with the Company and certain 
accelerated vesting provisions described in the Form PSU Agreement.  Subject to certain pro-rata vesting 
conditions, the PSUs earned by each grantee for adjusted ROIC performance will vest on April 1, 2021, subject to 
the grantee’s continued employment with the Company and certain accelerated vesting provisions described in the 
Form PSU Agreement.   

   
The foregoing descriptions of all Options and PSU awards and the Form Award Agreements are 

summaries only, do not purport to be complete, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the filed Form 
Option Agreement and Form PSU Agreement attached hereto as Exhibits 10.7 and 10.15, respectively.

Short-Term Incentive Program: 2018 Teamshare 

On March 21, 2018, the Committee approved the Company’s 2018 short-term incentive bonus program 

applicable to the Company’s named executive officers (“2018 Teamshare”) on the terms and subject to the 
conditions set forth in the 2018 Teamshare bonus program document attached hereto as Exhibit 10.35.  

The Committee selected adjusted EBIT as the Company-wide performance measure for 2018 Teamshare 
and established the target level of adjusted EBIT consistent with adjusted EBIT in the Company’s fiscal year 2018 
financial plan previously approved by the Board of Directors in January 2018.  The Committee determined that 
adjusted EBIT shall mean the Company’s Operating Profit as calculated in accordance with United States 
generally accepted accounting principles, but shall exclude the impact of (a) any costs, fees and expenses directly 
related to the consideration, negotiation, preparation, or consummation of any asset sale, merger or other 
transaction that results in a Change in Control (within the meaning of the Dollar General Corporation Amended 
and Restated 2007 Stock Incentive Plan) of the Company or any offering of Company common stock or other 
security; (b) disaster-related charges; (c) any gains or losses associated with the Company’s LIFO computation; 
and (d) unless the Committee disallows any such item, (i) any unbudgeted loss as a result of the resolution of a 
legal matter or (ii) any unplanned loss(es) or gain(s) related to the implementation of accounting or tax legislative 
changes or (iii) any unplanned loss(es) or gain(s) of a non-recurring nature, provided that in the case of each of (i), 
(ii) and (iii) such amount equals or exceeds $1 million from a single loss or gain, as applicable, and $10 million in 
the aggregate.  The Committee established the threshold below which no bonus may be paid under 2018 
Teamshare at 90% of the target level of the adjusted EBIT performance measure and the maximum above which 
no additional bonus may be paid at 120% of the target level of the adjusted EBIT performance measure.  The 
amount of bonus paid to named executive officers will vary between 0% and 300% of the target bonus payment 
amount based on actual Company performance compared to target performance on a graduated scale, with 
performance at the target level resulting in 100% of the target bonus amount being earned, subject to individual 
eligibility requirements and additional individual performance factors.  If a named executive officer is determined 
to be eligible to receive a 2018 Teamshare bonus payout in accordance with the eligibility rules, adjustments to 
bonus payouts may be made upward or downward, as applicable, to a level from 100%-120% if rated “Exceeds 
Expectations,” to a level from 80%-100% if rated “Meets Expectations” and to a level from 0%-80% if rated 
“Below Expectations".  Mr. Vasos’s target percentage of base salary payout for 2018 Teamshare is 150%, and 
Messrs. Garratt, Owen and Ravener and Ms. Taylor’s target percentage of base salary payout for 2018 Teamshare 
is 75%.  

The foregoing description of 2018 Teamshare is a summary only, does not purport to be complete, and is 

qualified in its entirety by reference to the filed 2018 Teamshare Bonus Program document attached hereto as 
Exhibit 10.35.
