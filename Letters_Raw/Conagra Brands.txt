FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS

Fiscal 2017 marked our second full year of transformation.  
Looking back, we’ve accomplished a lot. We reshaped 
our company and portfolio of brands – exiting non-core 
businesses including Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings® and 
JM Swank.® We flawlessly executed the Lamb Weston® 
spin-off. We’ve also modernized our portfolio through the 
acquisition of on-trend brands like Frontera,® Duke’s® and 
BIGS,® and our transformation continues with the pending 
sale of the Wesson® brand. 

At the same time, we took aggressive action to reduce 
costs, upgrade the quality of our revenue base and 
jumpstart innovation across the company. In short, we’ve 
overhauled our culture, growth capabilities and shareholder 
value focus behind a new management team and an 
energized new corporate headquarters.  

Our actions have led to stronger, more consistent 
performance. In fiscal year 2017:

•  Adjusted gross margin¹ increased

180 basis points to 30.2%.

•  Adjusted operating margin¹ increased

310 basis points to 15.8%.

•  Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations¹

increased 33.8% to $1.74.

•  We repurchased $1 billion of stock and

paid $415 million in dividends.

Clearly, we’ve been busy – but our work is not finished. 
We are seeing a healthier, less promotional business 
emerge. But we still have a lot of opportunity to build 
margins and improve our growth prospects.  

We will continue to innovate and strengthen existing 
brands with contemporary attributes most wanted and 
demanded by consumers. Our innovation capabilities are 
accelerating, and you will see our new products hit the 
market throughout fiscal 2018. We’ll also continue to further 
renovate our brand portfolio by acquiring new assets and 
potentially divesting assets that no longer fit. We expect 
that, over time, a greater percentage of our sales will come 
from loyal households and generate higher margins.

Execution excellence will also remain a hallmark of our 
culture. We will continue to drive unnecessary cost out  
of our business, and drive ongoing efficiencies throughout 
our operations. 

We are optimistic our plans and strategies will generate 
strong cash flows and create shareholder value. That’s  
why your board of directors approved a new $1 billion 
share repurchase program to complement our current  
solid dividend payout.

Before closing, I want to note one thing that hasn’t 
and won’t change: the priority we place on corporate 
citizenship. Fiscal 2017 marked the sixth consecutive  
year that Conagra Brands was included in the  
Dow Jones SustainabilityTM North America Index, 
one of the world’s most recognizable sustainability 
indices. Conagra Brands employees around the world 
are delivering our financial results while making our 
communities a better place to live and work – by personally 
volunteering thousands of hours, and by developing and 
implementing projects that save the company millions of 
dollars while diverting thousands of tons of waste from 
landfills, conserving hundreds of million gallons of water 
and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by thousands  
of metric tons.  

These are exciting times for Conagra Brands, and I want 
to thank our talented and dedicated Conagra Brands 
employees, who continue to embrace change and execute 
our strategy while serving our customers with excellence. 

Thank you for your continued support of Conagra Brands.

Sincerely, 

Sean M. Connolly
President and Chief Executive Officer

Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Actual results, performance

looking statements, please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors and Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations below. 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General Development of Business

Conagra Brands, Inc., a Delaware corporation, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company",
"we", "our", or "us"), is one of North America's leading branded food companies. Guided by an entrepreneurial spirit, the
Company combines a rich heritage of making great food with a sharpened focus on innovation. The Company's portfolio is
evolving to satisfy people's changing food preferences. Its iconic brands such as Marie Callender's®, Reddi-wip®, Hunt's®,
Healthy Choice®, Slim Jim®, Orville Redenbacher's®, as well as emerging brands, including Alexia®, Blake's®, and Frontera®,
offer choices for every occasion.

We began as a Midwestern flour-milling company and entered other commodity-based businesses throughout our history.
We were initially incorporated as a Nebraska corporation in 1919 and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in December
1975. Over time, we transformed into the branded, pure-play consumer packaged goods food company we are today. We
achieved  this  through  various  acquisitions,  including  consumer  food  brands  such  as  Banquet®,  Chef  Boyardee®,  Marie
Callender’s®, Alexia®, Blake's®, Frontera®, Duke’s®, BIGS®, and divestitures. We have divested our Lamb Weston business,
Private Brands business, Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings business, JM Swank business, milling business, dehydrated and fresh
vegetable operations, and a trading and merchandising business, among others. Growing our food businesses has also been
fueled by innovation, organic growth of our brands, and expansion into adjacent categories. We are focused on delivering
sustainable, profitable growth with strong and improving returns on our invested capital.

On November 9, 2016, we completed the spinoff of Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. ("Lamb Weston") through a distribution
of 100% of our interest in Lamb Weston to holders of outstanding shares of our common stock (the "Spinoff"). The transaction
effecting this change was structured as a tax-free spinoff. 

In January 2013, we acquired Ralcorp Holdings, Inc. ("Ralcorp"), a manufacturer of private branded food. Since the
acquisition of Ralcorp, we focused on addressing executional shortfalls and customer service issues intended to improve
operating performance for our Private Brands business. However, after further review of the Private Brands business, we
changed our strategic direction and divested the Private Brands business in the third quarter of fiscal 2016.  

In  fiscal  2017,  we  completed  the  relocation  of  our  corporate  headquarters  to  Chicago,  Illinois.  Our  efficiency  and
effectiveness initiatives continue to be implemented with a high degree of customer focus, food safety and quality, and
commitment to our people.

Financial Information about Reporting Segments

In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, in anticipation of the Spinoff, we reorganized our reporting segments. We now reflect
our results of operations in five reporting segments: Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, Foodservice,
and Commercial. The contributions of each reporting segment to net sales, operating profit, and identifiable assets are set
forth in Note 21 "Business Segments and Related Information" to the consolidated financial statements.

Narrative Description of Business

We compete throughout the food industry and focus on adding value for our customers who operate in the retail food and

foodservice channels.

Our operations, including our reporting segments, are described below. Our locations, including manufacturing facilities,

within each reporting segment, are described in Item 2, Properties.

1

Reporting Segments

Our reporting segments are as follows:

Grocery & Snacks

The Grocery & Snacks reporting segment principally includes branded, shelf stable food products sold in various retail

channels in the United States.

Refrigerated & Frozen

The Refrigerated & Frozen reporting segment principally includes branded, temperature controlled food products sold

in various retail channels in the United States.

International

The International reporting segment principally includes branded food products, in various temperature states, sold in

various retail and foodservice channels outside of the United States.

Foodservice

The Foodservice reporting segment includes branded and customized food products, including meals, entrees, sauces,
and a variety of custom-manufactured culinary products packaged for sale to restaurants and other foodservice establishments
in the United States.

Commercial Foods

The Commercial reporting segment included commercially branded and private label food and ingredients, which were
sold primarily to commercial, restaurant, foodservice, food manufacturing, and industrial customers. The segment's primary
food items included a variety of vegetable, spice, and frozen bakery goods, which were sold under brands such as Spicetec
Flavors & Seasonings®. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we sold our Spicetec and JM Swank businesses. These businesses
comprise the entire Commercial segment following the presentation of Lamb Weston as discontinued operations.

Unconsolidated Equity Investments

We have three unconsolidated equity investments. Our most significant equity method investment is a milling business

(see "Formation of Ardent Mills" below).

Acquisitions

In March 2017, we acquired protein-based snacking businesses Thanasi Foods LLC, maker of Duke’s® meat snacks, and

BIGS LLC, maker of BIGS® seeds. These businesses are included in the Grocery & Snacks segment.

In September 2016, we acquired the operating assets of Frontera Foods, Inc. and Red Fork LLC, including the Frontera®,
Red Fork®, and Salpica® brands (the "Frontera acquisition"). These businesses make authentic, gourmet Mexican food products
and contemporary American cooking sauces. These businesses are reflected principally within the Grocery & Snacks segment,
and to a lesser extent within the Refrigerated & Frozen and International segments.

In May 2015, we acquired Blake's All Natural Foods, a family-owned company specializing in frozen meals, including

pot pies, casseroles, pasta dishes, and other entrees. This business is included in the Refrigerated & Frozen segment. 

Divestitures

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our Wesson® oil business. The sale

remains subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals.

2

On November 9, 2016, we completed the Spinoff of our Lamb Weston business.  As of such date, we did not beneficially
own any equity interest in Lamb Weston and no longer consolidated Lamb Weston into our financial results. We reflected the
results of this business as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of the Lamb Weston
business have been reclassified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations within our Consolidated Balance Sheets
for the period presented prior to the Spinoff.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we completed the sales of our Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings business ("Spicetec")
and our JM Swank business for combined proceeds of $489.0 million. The results of operations of Spicetec and JM Swank
are included in the Commercial segment.

On February 1, 2016, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2015, we completed the disposition
of our Private Brands operations to TreeHouse Foods, Inc. ("Treehouse"). The Private Brands assets and liabilities have been
reclassified as held for sale for all periods presented prior to the divestiture and the results of operations have been classified
as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Formation of Ardent Mills

On May 29, 2014, the Company, Cargill, Incorporated ("Cargill"), and CHS Inc. ("CHS"), completed the formation of
Ardent Mills, which combined the North American flour milling operations and related businesses operated through the
ConAgra Mills division of ConAgra Foods and the Horizon Milling joint venture of Cargill and CHS. We reflected the
operating results of our legacy milling business as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Our equity in the earnings
of Ardent Mills is reflected in our continuing operations.

General

The following comments pertain to all of our reporting segments.

Conagra Brands is a branded consumer packaged goods food company that operates in many sectors of the food industry,
with a significant focus on the sale of branded, private branded, and value-added consumer food, as well as foodservice items
and ingredients. We use many different raw materials, the bulk of which are commodities. The prices paid for raw materials
used in making our food generally reflect factors such as weather, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations,
tariffs, and the effects of governmental agricultural programs. Although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate
as a result of these factors, we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous
sources. From time to time, we have faced increased costs for many of our significant raw materials, packaging, and energy
inputs. We seek to mitigate higher input costs through productivity and pricing initiatives, and the use of derivative instruments
used to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption.

We experience intense competition for sales of our food items in our major markets. Our food items compete with widely
advertised, well-known, branded food, as well as private branded and customized food items. Some of our competitors are
larger and have greater resources than we have. We compete primarily on the basis of quality, value, customer service, brand
recognition, and brand loyalty.

Demand for certain of our food items may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons, or other annual events.

We manufacture primarily for stock and fill our customer orders from finished goods inventories. While at any given
time there may be some backlog of orders, such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales, and the changes of
backlog orders from time to time are not significant.

Our trademarks are of material importance to our business and are protected by registration or other means in the United
States and most other markets where the related food items are sold. Some of our food items are sold under brands that have
been licensed from others. We also actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents, although no single patent is considered
material to the business as a whole. We have proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, processes, and other intellectual
property rights that are not registered.

Many of our facilities and products we make are subject to various laws and regulations administered by the United States
Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration,
and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the food safety and quality, sanitation, safety and
health matters, and environmental control. We believe that we comply with such laws and regulations in all material respects

3

and that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings, or
our competitive position.

Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 24%, 23%, and 20% of

consolidated net sales for fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.

At May 28, 2017, Conagra Brands and its subsidiaries had approximately 12,600 employees, primarily in the United
States. Approximately 47% of our employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements. Of the employees subject to
collective bargaining agreements, approximately 6% are parties to collective bargaining agreements scheduled to expire during
fiscal 2018. We believe our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good.

Research and Development

We employ processes at our principal manufacturing locations that emphasize applied research and technical services
directed at product improvement and quality control. In addition, we conduct research activities related to the development
of new products. Research and development expense was $44.6 million, $59.6 million, and $63.1 million in fiscal 2017, 2016,
and 2015, respectively.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks and uncertainties described below could
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and should be considered in evaluating
us. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional
risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely
affect our business, performance, or financial condition in the future.

Risks Relating to our Business

Deterioration of general economic conditions could harm our business and results of operations.

Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions,
including inflation, interest rates, availability of capital markets, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs
(including fuel surcharges), and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions.

Volatility in financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact our business

and operations in a variety of ways, including as follows:

•

•

•

•

•

consumers may shift purchases to more generic, lower-priced, or other value offerings, or may forego certain purchases
altogether during economic downturns, which could result in a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift
in our product mix to lower margin offerings adversely affecting the results of our operations;

decreased demand in the restaurant business, particularly casual and fine dining, which may adversely affect our
Foodservice operations;

volatility in commodity and other input costs could substantially impact our result of operations;

volatility in the equity markets or interest rates could substantially impact our pension costs and required pension
contributions; and

it may become more costly or difficult to obtain debt or equity financing to fund operations or investment opportunities,
or to refinance our debt in the future, in each case on terms and within a time period acceptable to us.

Increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits.

The food industry is highly competitive, and further consolidation in the industry would likely increase competition. Our
principal competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. Increased competition can reduce our sales
due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures. Competitive pressures
also may restrict our ability to increase prices, including in response to commodity and other cost increases. We sell branded,
private brand, and customized food products, as well as commercially branded foods. Our branded products have an advantage
over private brand products primarily due to advertising and name recognition, although private brand products typically sell
at a discount to those of branded competitors. In addition, when branded competitors focus on price and promotion, the
environment for private brand producers becomes more challenging because the price difference between private brand
products and branded products may become less significant. In most product categories, we compete not only with other
widely advertised branded products, but also with other private label and store brand products that are generally sold at lower
prices. A strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a consumer shift
towards more generic, lower-priced, or other value offerings, could result in us reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other
expenditures, or losing market share. Our margins and profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are
not counterbalanced with increased sales volume.

6

Increases in commodity costs may have a negative impact on profits.

We use many different commodities such as wheat, corn, oats, soybeans, beef, pork, poultry, and energy. Commodities
are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuations, external
conditions such as weather, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. Commodity price
increases will result in increases in raw material, packaging, and energy costs and operating costs. We may not be able to
increase our product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs; and increasing prices may result
in reduced sales volume, reduced margins, and profitability. We have experience in hedging against commodity price increases;
however, these practices and experience reduce, but do not eliminate, the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity
price increases. We do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and the risk management procedures that we use
may not always work as we intend.

Volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause
volatility in our gross margins and net earnings.

We utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredients and energy costs, including grains (wheat,
corn, and oats), oils, beef, pork, poultry, and energy. Changes in the values of these derivatives are generally recorded in
earnings currently, resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. These gains and losses are reported in cost of
goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and in unallocated general corporate expenses in our segment
operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process, at which time the gains and losses are
reclassified to segment operating profit. We may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments.

If we do not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive food industry, our profitability could decrease.

Our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and operate
efficiently in the highly competitive food industry, particularly in an environment of volatile input costs. We continue to
implement profit-enhancing initiatives that impact our supply chain and general and administrative functions. These initiatives
are focused on cost-saving opportunities in procurement, manufacturing, logistics, and customer service, as well as general
and administrative overhead levels. Gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time. Our failure to reduce
costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect our
profitability and weaken our competitive position. If we do not continue to effectively manage costs and achieve additional
efficiencies, our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease.

We may not realize the benefits that we expect from our Supply Chain and Administrative Efficiency Plan, or SCAE Plan.

In May 2013, we announced the Supply Chain and Administrative Efficiency Plan (the "SCAE Plan"), our plan to integrate
and  restructure  the  operations  of  our  Private  Brands  business,  improve  selling,  general  and  administrative  ("SG&A")
effectiveness and efficiencies, and optimize our supply chain network, manufacturing assets, dry distribution centers, and
mixing centers. In the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we announced plans to realize efficiency benefits by reducing SG&A
expenses and enhancing trade spend processes and tools, which plans were included in the SCAE Plan. Although we divested
the Private Brands business, we have continued to implement the SCAE Plan, including by working to optimize our supply
chain network, pursue cost reductions through our SG&A functions, enhance trade spend processes and tools, and improve
productivity. 

The successful design and implementation of the SCAE Plan presents significant organizational design and infrastructure
challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties, including labor organizations, suppliers,
business partners, and other stakeholders. In addition, the SCAE Plan may not advance our business strategy as expected.
Events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays, and unexpected costs may occur that could result
in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable.
If we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of the SCAE Plan, our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely
affected. Any failure to implement the SCAE Plan in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our financial
condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

In addition, the complexity of the SCAE Plan will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources.
Our  management  team  must  successfully  implement  administrative  and  operational  changes  necessary  to  achieve  the
anticipated benefits of the SCAE Plan. These and related demands on our resources may divert the organization's attention
from existing core businesses, integrating financial or other systems, have adverse effects on existing business relationships
with suppliers and customers, and impact employee morale. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, or cash
flows may be adversely affected.

7

We may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls, which could negatively impact our profitability.

We sell food products for human consumption, which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage, product
tampering, other adulteration of food products, mislabeling, and misbranding. We may be subject to liability if the consumption
of  any  of  our  products  causes  injury,  illness,  or  death.  In  addition,  we  will  voluntarily  recall  products  in  the  event  of
contamination or damage. We have issued recalls and have from time to time been and currently are involved in lawsuits
relating to our food products. A significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact
our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on the costs of the recall, the destruction of product inventory, product
availability, competitive reaction, customer reaction, and consumer attitudes. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful
or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could
adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image.

Additionally, as a manufacturer and marketer of food products, we are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration and other national, state, and local government agencies. The Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act, (the
"FDCA"),  and  the  Food  Safety  Modernization  Act  and  their  respective  regulations  govern,  among  other  things,  the
manufacturing, composition and ingredients, packaging, and safety of food products. Some aspects of these laws use a strict
liability standard for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior; meaning that no intent is required to be established. If we fail
to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls, or
seizures, as well as criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
or results of operations. 

We must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences.

Consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of our food products depends on our ability to identify the tastes
and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences, including concerns of consumers
regarding health and wellness, obesity, product attributes, and ingredients. Introduction of new products and product extensions
requires significant development and marketing investment. If our products fail to meet consumer preferences, or we fail to
introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and
our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in acquisitions, marketing, and innovation will be less successful.
Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the health effects of
ingredients such as sodium, trans fats, sugar, processed wheat, or other product ingredients or attributes.

Changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers could adversely affect us.

During fiscal 2017, our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 24% of
our net revenues. There can be no assurance that Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and other significant customers will continue to purchase
our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past, particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue
to demand lower pricing. The loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could
materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations.

The sophistication and buying power of our customers could have a negative impact on profits.

Our customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs, and food distributors, have continued to consolidate, resulting
in fewer customers on which we can rely for business. These consolidations, the growth of supercenters, and the growth of
on-line customers have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who
are more capable of resisting price increases and can demand lower pricing, increased promotional programs, or specialty
tailored products. In addition, larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced
inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands. These customers may also in the future use more of their shelf
space, currently used for our products, for their store brand products. We continue to implement initiatives to counteract these
pressures. However, if the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength and/or increased private
label or store brand competition, our profitability could decline.

Consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers' business operations or financial performance
will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us. For example, if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or
financing, then they may delay, decrease, or cancel purchases of our products, or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases.

If we are unable to complete proposed acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses, our financial results could be materially
and adversely affected.

From time to time, we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives. If we are unable
to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses, our financial results could be materially
and adversely affected. Moreover, we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that reduce our profitability.

Our acquisition activities may present financial, managerial, and operational risks. Those risks include diversion of
management attention from existing businesses, difficulties integrating personnel and financial and other systems, effective
and immediate implementation of control environment processes across our employee population, adverse effects on existing
business relationships with suppliers and customers, inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions
and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings, potential loss of customers or
key employees of acquired businesses, and indemnities and potential disputes with the sellers. Any of these factors could
affect our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations.

In fiscal 2017, we completed the Frontera acquisition, which included the Frontera®, Red Fork®, and Salpica® brands,
for $108.1 million in cash, net of cash acquired, and the Thanasi acquisition, which included the Duke’s® meat snacks and
BIGS® seeds brands, for $217.6 million in cash, net of cash acquired, subject to a working capital adjustment.

If we are unable to complete our proposed divestitures, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected.

From time to time, we may divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or
profitability targets. We may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us. Gains or losses
on the sales of, or lost operating income from, those businesses may affect our profitability and margins. Moreover, we may
incur asset impairment charges related to divestitures that reduce our profitability.

Our  divestiture  activities  may  present  financial,  managerial,  and  operational  risks. Those  risks  include  diversion  of
management attention from existing businesses, difficulties separating personnel and financial and other systems, possible
need for providing transition services to buyers, adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers
and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers. Any of these factors could adversely affect our product sales, financial
condition, and results of operations. 

In fiscal 2017, we completed the divestitures of two smaller, non-core businesses (Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings and
J.M. Swank) for combined proceeds of $489.0 million, as well as the separation of ConAgra Foods, Inc. into Conagra Brands
and Lamb Weston through the Spinoff of Lamb Weston. We also announced a definitive agreement with The J.M. Smucker
Company to divest the Wesson® oil business, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory
approvals.

Disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our ability to make, move, and sell our products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our supply chain,
including third-party manufacturing or transportation and distribution capabilities, due to weather, including any potential
effects of climate change, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics, strikes, government action, or other reasons
beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and business partners, could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our
products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage
such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location, could adversely affect our
business  or  financial  results.  In  addition,  disputes  with  significant  suppliers,  including  disputes  regarding  pricing  or
performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect
our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations.

9

Any damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

Maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our products. Product contamination or tampering, the failure
to maintain high standards for product quality, safety, and integrity, including with respect to raw materials and ingredients
obtained from suppliers, or allegations of product quality issues, mislabeling, or contamination, even if untrue, may reduce
demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. Our reputation could also be adversely impacted by
any of the following, or by adverse publicity (whether or not valid) relating thereto: the failure to maintain high ethical, social,
and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities; the failure to achieve our goals with respect to sodium
or saturated fat; our research and development efforts; or our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials,
packaging, energy use, and waste management. Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective
system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial information could also hurt our reputation. Damage to
our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased
demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations,
as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.

If we fail to comply with the many laws applicable to our business, we may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and
penalties.

Our business is subject to a variety of governmental laws and regulations, including food and drug laws, environmental
laws, laws related to advertising and marketing practices, accounting standards, taxation requirements, competition laws,
employment laws, and anti-corruption laws, among others, in and outside of the United States. Our facilities and products are
subject to many laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug
Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental
agencies relating to the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling, quality, and safety of food products,
the health and safety of our employees, and the protection of the environment. Our failure to comply with applicable laws
and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and
recalls of our products. Our operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by
the Environmental Protection Agency, which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and
disposition  of  wastes.  Failure  to  comply  with  these  regulations  can  have  serious  consequences,  including  civil  and
administrative penalties and negative publicity. Changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof,
including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern
over climate change, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other financial obligations for us,
which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products, which could affect our net
operating revenues.

We are increasingly dependent on information technology, and potential disruption, cyber attacks, security problems, and
expanding social media vehicles present new risks.

We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic
and financial information, to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory,
legal, and tax requirements. Our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third
parties, may be vulnerable to damage, interruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events,
natural disasters, fires, power outages, systems failures, telecommunications failures, security breaches, computer viruses,
hackers, employee error or malfeasance, and other causes. Increased cybersecurity threats pose a potential risk to the security
and viability of our information technology systems, as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored
on those systems. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology
infrastructure and to maintain and protect the related automated and manual control processes, we could be subject to billing
and collection errors, business disruptions, or damage resulting from security breaches. If any of our significant information
technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve
the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely
affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results. In addition, there is a risk of business interruption,
litigation  risks,  and  reputational  damage  from  leakage  of  confidential  information. Any  interruption  of  our  information
technology systems could have operational, reputational, legal, and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect
on our business.

In addition, the inappropriate use of certain media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage. Negative
posts or comments about the Company on any social networking web site could seriously damage its reputation. In addition,

10

the disclosure of non-public company sensitive information through external media channels could lead to information loss.
Identifying new points of entry as social media continues to expand presents new challenges. Any business interruptions or
damage to our reputation could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and the market price of our
common stock.

We rely on our management team and other key personnel.

We depend on the skills, working relationships, and continued services of key personnel, including our experienced
management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify, hire, train, and
retain qualified individuals. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel,
and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract, train, and retain other talented personnel. Any such loss or failure could
adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. 

In particular, our continued success will depend in part on our ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees.
If key employees terminate their employment, or if an insufficient number of employees is retained to maintain effective
operations, our business activities may be adversely affected and our management team's attention may be diverted. In addition,
we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave, or offer employment to potential
replacements on reasonable terms, all of which could adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating
results.

Our existing and future debt may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and could prevent
us from fulfilling our debt obligations.

As of May 28, 2017, we had a substantial amount of debt, including $2.6 billion aggregate principal amount of senior
notes. We have the ability under our existing revolving credit facility to incur substantial additional debt. Our level of debt
could have important consequences. For example, it could:

• make it more difficult for us to make payments on our debt; 

•

•

•

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, reducing
the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate
purposes; 

increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions; 

limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to enable us to react to changes in our business; or 

place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt. 

Additionally, any failure to meet required payments on our debt, or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments
governing our debt, could result in an event of default under the terms of those instruments and a downgrade to our credit
ratings. A downgrade in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial
paper. In the event of a default, the holders of our debt could elect to declare all the amounts outstanding under such instruments
to be due and payable. Any default under the agreements governing our debt and the remedies sought by the holders of such
debt could render us unable to pay principal and interest on our debt.

11

Impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangibles could result in the incurrence of impairment charges
and negatively impact our net worth.

As of May 28, 2017, we had goodwill of $4.3 billion and other intangibles of $1.2 billion. The net carrying value of
goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition
date (or subsequent impairment date, if applicable). The net carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of
trademarks, customer relationships, and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date (or subsequent impairment date,
if applicable), net of accumulated amortization. Goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely
to our cash flows are not amortized, but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment. Amortized
intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts
of these assets may not be recoverable. Impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets may be caused by factors outside
our control, such as the inability to quickly replace lost co-manufacturing business, increasing competitive pricing pressures,
lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates, changes in industry EBITDA multiples, changes in discount rates based
on changes in cost of capital (interest rates, etc.), or the bankruptcy of a significant customer and could result in the incurrence
of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth.

Our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension, labor, and people-related expenses.

Inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs, which could have a material
adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition. Our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits
in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, including pension, health and welfare, and severance benefits. Changes in interest rates,
mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates, investment returns, and the market value of plan assets can affect the
funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the future funding requirements of the plans. A significant
increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash
flows from operations. Additionally, the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of
collectively-bargained wage and benefit agreements.

Climate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business
and operations.

There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact
on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event
that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less
favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as corn, wheat, and potatoes. We may also
be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change, which could impact our
manufacturing and distribution operations. In addition, natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the
productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain. The increasing concern over climate change also may result
in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse
gases. In the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently
undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency, we may experience significant increases in our costs
of operation and delivery. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution
and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and
operations.

The termination or expiration of current co-manufacturing arrangements could reduce our sales volume and adversely
affect our results of operations.

Our businesses periodically enter into co-manufacturing arrangements with manufacturers of products. The terms of these
agreements vary but are generally for relatively short periods of time. Volumes produced under each of these agreements can
fluctuate significantly based upon the product's life cycle, product promotions, alternative production capacity, and other
factors, none of which are under our direct control. Our future ability to enter into co-manufacturing arrangements is not
guaranteed, and a decrease in current co-manufacturing levels could have a significant negative impact on sales volume.

Ardent Mills may not achieve the benefits that are anticipated from the joint venture.

The benefits that are expected to result from our Ardent Mills joint venture will depend, in part, on our ability to realize
the anticipated cost synergies in the transaction, Ardent Mills' ability to successfully integrate the ConAgra Mills and Horizon
Milling businesses and its ability to successfully manage the joint venture on a going-forward basis. It is not certain that we
will realize these benefits at all, and if we do, it is not certain how long it will take to achieve these benefits. If, for example,
we are unable to achieve the anticipated cost savings, or if there are unforeseen integration costs, or if Ardent Mills is unable
to operate the joint venture smoothly in the future, the financial performance of the joint venture may be negatively affected.

Actions of activist stockholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources,
and have an adverse effect on our business.

From time to time, we may be subject to proposals by stockholders urging us to take certain corporate actions.  If activist
stockholder activities ensue, our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and reacting to
other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of
management and our employees. For example, we may be required to retain the services of various professionals to advise
us on activist stockholder matters, including legal, financial and communications advisors, the costs of which may negatively
impact our future financial results. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership created
as a consequence of activist stockholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability
to attract new investors, customers, employee, and joint venture partners, and cause our stock price to experience periods of
volatility or stagnation.

Risks Relating to our Recently Completed Spinoff of Lamb Weston 

We may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Spinoff.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company completed the announced Spinoff of Lamb Weston. Although we
believe that separating the Lamb Weston business from the Company will provide financial, operational, managerial, and
other benefits to us and our stockholders, the Spinoff may not provide such results on the scope, scale, or timeline we anticipate,
and we may not realize the intended benefits of the Spinoff. In addition, we incurred one-time costs in connection with the
Spinoff that may negate some of the benefits we expect to achieve. If we do not realize these assumed benefits, we could
suffer a material adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, our operational and financial profile changed upon the
separation of the Lamb Weston business from the Company. As a result, the diversification of our revenue sources diminished,
and our results of operations, cash flows, working capital, and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility
as a result.

We may be exposed to claims and liabilities or incur operational difficulties as a result of the Spinoff.

The Spinoff continues to involve a number of risks, including, among other things, certain indemnification risks and risk
associated  with  the  provision  of  transitional  services.  In  connection  with  the  Spinoff,  we  entered  into  a  separation  and
distribution agreement and various other agreements (including a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement, an
employee matters agreement, and a trademark license agreement), which we refer to as the Lamb Weston agreements. The
Lamb Weston agreements govern the Spinoff and the relationship between the two companies going forward. They also provide
for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time. 

The Lamb Weston agreements provides for indemnification obligations designed to make Lamb Weston financially
responsible  for  certain  liabilities  that  may  exist  relating  to  its  business  activities,  whether  incurred  prior  to  or  after  the
distribution, including any pending or future litigation. It is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to
between us and Lamb Weston and require us to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to Lamb Weston. Third parties
could also seek to hold us responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations, and the indemnity rights we have under the
separation and distribution agreement may not be sufficient to fully cover all of these liabilities and obligations. Even if we
are successful in obtaining indemnification, we may have to bear costs temporarily. In addition, our indemnity obligations to
Lamb Weston may be significant. These risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

In addition, certain of the Lamb Weston agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the
benefit of the other for a period of time. As such, there is continued risk that management's and our employees' attention will
be significantly diverted by the provision of transitional services. The Lamb Weston agreements could also lead to disputes
over rights to certain shared property and rights and over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations. If
Lamb Weston is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, we could

13

incur losses. Our inability to effectively manage separation activities and related events could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, or results of operations. 

The Spinoff could result in substantial tax liability.

The Spinoff is intended to qualify for tax-free treatment to the Company and its stockholders under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code. Completion of the Spinoff was conditioned upon, among other
things, our receipt of an opinion from our tax advisors that the distribution of shares of Lamb Weston in the Spinoff will qualify
as tax-free to Lamb Weston, the Company, and our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and
368(a)(1)(D)  and  related  provisions  of  the  Code.  The  opinion  relied  on,  among  other  things,  various  assumptions  and
representations as to factual matters made by the Company and Lamb Weston. If such assumptions or representations are
inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, the conclusions reached by such advisor in its opinion could be jeopardized.
The opinion is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service, which we refer to as the IRS, or the courts, and there can be no
assurance that the IRS or the courts will not challenge the qualification of the Spinoff as a transaction under Sections 355 and
368(a) of the Code or that any such challenge would not prevail. 

If the Spinoff is determined to be taxable, the Company and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities, which

could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None. 

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Our headquarters are located in Chicago, Illinois. General offices are also located in Omaha, Nebraska, as well as certain
shared service centers, including a product development facility, enterprise business services center, and an information
technology center. We also lease a limited number of domestic sales offices. International general offices are located in Canada,
China, Columbia, Mexico, and Panama. 

We maintain a number of stand-alone distribution facilities. In addition, there are warehouses at most of our manufacturing

facilities.

Utilization of manufacturing capacity varies by manufacturing plant based upon the type of products assigned and the
level of demand for those products. Management believes that our manufacturing and processing plants are well maintained
and are generally adequate to support the current operations of the business. 

As of July 21, 2017, we have thirty domestic manufacturing facilities located in Arkansas, California, Georgia, Indiana,
Illinois,  Iowa,  Kentucky,  Michigan,  Minnesota,  Missouri,  Nebraska,  New  Hampshire,  Ohio,  Pennsylvania,  Tennessee,
Washington and Wisconsin. We also have international manufacturing facilities in Canada, Italy, and Mexico and interests in
ownership of international manufacturing facilities in India, Mexico, and the Philippines.

We own most of the manufacturing facilities. However, a limited number of plants and parcels of land with the related
manufacturing equipment are leased. Substantially all of our transportation equipment and forward-positioned distribution
centers containing finished goods are leased or operated by third parties. 

The majority of our manufacturing assets are shared across multiple reporting segments. Output from these facilities used

by each reporting segment can change over time. Therefore, it is impracticable to disclose them by segment.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are a party to various environmental proceedings and litigation, primarily related to our acquisition of Beatrice
Company ("Beatrice") in fiscal 1991. As a result of the acquisition of Beatrice and the significant pre-acquisition contingencies
of the Beatrice businesses and its former subsidiaries, our condensed consolidated post-acquisition financial statements reflect
liabilities  associated  with  the  estimated  resolution  of  these  contingencies.  Such  liabilities  include  various  litigation  and
environmental proceedings related to businesses divested by Beatrice prior to our acquisition of Beatrice. The litigation
proceedings include suits against a number of lead paint and pigment manufacturers, including ConAgra Grocery Products

14

Company, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("ConAgra Grocery Products"), and the Company as alleged
successors to W. P. Fuller Co., a lead paint and pigment manufacturer owned and operated by Beatrice until 1967. Although
decisions favorable to us have been rendered in Rhode Island, New Jersey, Wisconsin, and Ohio, we remain a defendant in
active suits in Illinois and California. The Illinois suit seeks class-wide relief for reimbursement of costs associated with the
testing of lead levels in blood. In California, a number of cities and counties joined in a consolidated action seeking abatement
of the alleged public nuisance. On September 23, 2013, a trial of the California case concluded in the Superior Court of
California for the County of Santa Clara, and on January 27, 2014, the court entered a judgment (the "Judgment") against
ConAgra Grocery Products and two other defendants, ordering the creation of a California abatement fund in the amount of
$1.15 billion. Liability is joint and several. The Company believes ConAgra Grocery Products did not inherit any liabilities
of W. P. Fuller Co. The Company will continue to vigorously defend itself in this case and has appealed the Judgment to the
Court of Appeal of the State of California Sixth Appellate District. The Company expects the appeal process will last several
years. The absence of any linkage between ConAgra Grocery Products and W. P. Fuller Co. is a critical issue (among others)
that the Company will continue to advance throughout the appeals process. It is not possible to estimate exposure in this case
or the remaining case in Illinois, which is based on different legal theories. If ultimately necessary, the Company will look to
its insurance policies for coverage; its carriers are on notice. However, the extent of insurance coverage is uncertain, and the
Company cannot absolutely assure that the final resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

The environmental proceedings associated with Beatrice include litigation and administrative proceedings involving
Beatrice's status as a potentially responsible party at 37 Superfund, proposed Superfund, or state-equivalent sites (the "Beatrice
sites"). These sites involve locations previously owned or operated by predecessors of Beatrice that used or produced petroleum,
pesticides, fertilizers, dyes, inks, solvents, PCBs, acids, lead, sulfur, tannery wastes, and/or other contaminants. Beatrice has
paid or is in the process of paying its liability share at 33 of these sites. Reserves for these Beatrice environmental proceedings
have been established based on our best estimate of the undiscounted remediation liabilities, which estimates include evaluation
of investigatory studies, extent of required clean-up, the known volumetric contribution of Beatrice and other potentially
responsible parties, and its experience in remediating sites. The accrual for Beatrice-related environmental matters totaled
$52.3 million as of May 28, 2017, a majority of which relates to the Superfund and state-equivalent sites referenced above.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, a final Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study was submitted for the Wells G&H-
Southwest Properties Superfund site, which is one of the Beatrice sites. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the
"EPA") has indicated that it will issue a Record of Decision for this site shortly and subsequently enter into negotiations with
potentially responsible parties to determine a final Remedial Design/Remedial Action plan for the site. While we believe that
it is unlikely, it is reasonably possible that the EPA's decision and negotiations relating thereto may result in material liability,
but we are, at this time, unable to estimate a range of potential outcomes.

 On October 21, 2015, we received a notice of violation from the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District (the
"District") alleging certain deficiencies in the risk management plan (the "RMP") of a manufacturing facility in Louisville,
Kentucky, which we acquired in connection with our fiscal 2013 purchase of Ralcorp Holdings, Inc. The notice alleged that
the facility failed to implement and maintain an RMP sufficient to comply with environmental regulations governing facilities
that manufacture, use or otherwise handle certain quantities of specified regulated substances. On January 18, 2017, the
District's  Board  adopted  an  order  resolving  the  alleged  violations  in  consideration  of  a  monetary  penalty  of  $225,000,
concluding the matter.

We are also party to a number of lawsuits and claims arising out of our ongoing business operations. These previously
included lawsuits, claims, and other proceedings related to the February 2007 recall of our peanut butter products, including
an investigation by the U.S. Attorney's office in Georgia and the Consumer Protection Branch of the Department of Justice.
In May 2015, we negotiated a resolution of this matter, which resulted in an executed plea agreement. On December 13, 2016,
ConAgra Grocery Products pleaded guilty to a single misdemeanor violation of the Food, Drug & Cosmetics Act. The U.S.
District Court for the Middle District of Georgia accepted the plea and imposed the agreed sentence pursuant to the terms of
the plea agreement. ConAgra Grocery Products has now made payments totaling $11.2 million to the federal government,
and the matter has been concluded.

In June 2009, an accidental explosion occurred at our manufacturing facility in Garner, North Carolina. This facility was
the primary production facility for our Slim Jim® branded meat snacks. In June 2009, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
Firearms and Explosives announced its determination that the explosion was the result of an accidental natural gas release,
and not a deliberate act. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we settled our property and business interruption claims
related to the Garner accident with our insurance providers. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, Jacobs Engineering
Group Inc., our engineer and project manager at the site ("Jacobs"), filed a declaratory judgment action against us seeking
indemnity for personal injury claims brought against it as a result of the accident. During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, our

15

motion for summary judgment was granted and the suit was dismissed without prejudice on the basis that the suit was filed
prematurely. In the third quarter of fiscal 2014, Jacobs refiled its action seeking indemnity. On March 25, 2016, a Douglas
County jury in Nebraska rendered a verdict in favor of Jacobs and against us in the amount of $108.9 million plus post
judgment interest. We filed our Notice of Appeal in September 2016. Although our insurance carriers have provided customary
notices of reservation of their rights under the policies of insurance, we expect any ultimate exposure in this case to be limited
to the applicable insurance deductible.

We are party to a number of putative class action lawsuits challenging various product claims made in the Company's
product labeling. These matters include Briseno v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., in which it is alleged that the labeling for Wesson®
oils as 100% natural is false and misleading because the oils contain genetically modified plants and organisms. In February
2015, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California granted class certification to permit plaintiffs to pursue
state law claims. The Company appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which affirmed class
certification in January 2017. While we cannot predict with certainty the results of this or any other legal proceeding, we do
not expect this matter to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or business.

After taking into account liabilities recognized for all of the foregoing matters, management believes the ultimate resolution
of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. It is
reasonably possible that a change of the estimates of any of the foregoing matters may occur in the future and, as noted, while
unlikely, the lead paint matter could result in a material final judgment.

divestitures, including the recent Spinoff of our Lamb Weston business and the announced divestiture of the Wesson® oil
business; general economic and industry conditions; our ability to successfully execute our long-term value creation strategy;
our ability to access capital; our ability to execute our operating and restructuring plans and achieve our targeted operating
efficiencies from cost-saving initiatives and to benefit from trade optimization programs; the effectiveness of our hedging
activities and our ability to respond to volatility in commodities; the competitive environment and related market conditions;
our ability to respond to changing consumer preferences and the success of our innovation and marketing investments; the
ultimate impact of any product recalls and litigation, including litigation related to the lead paint and pigment matters; actions
of governments and regulatory factors affecting our businesses; the availability and prices of raw materials, including any
negative effects caused by inflation or weather conditions; risks and uncertainties associated with intangible assets, including
any future goodwill or intangible assets impairment charges; the costs, disruption, and diversion of management's attention
associated with campaigns commenced by activist investors; and other risks described in this this and other reports we file
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). We caution readers not to place undue reliance on these forward-
looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We undertake no responsibility to update these statements.

The discussion that follows should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

Conagra Brands, Inc. (the "Company", "we", "us", or "our"), headquartered in Chicago, is one of North America's leading
branded food companies. Guided by an entrepreneurial spirit, the Company combines a rich heritage of making great food
with a sharpened focus on innovation. The Company's portfolio is evolving to satisfy people's changing food preferences. Its
iconic brands such as Marie Callender's®, Reddi-wip®, Hunt's®, Healthy Choice®, Slim Jim®, Orville Redenbacher's®, as well
as emerging brands, including Alexia®, Blake's®, Duke's®, and Frontera®, offer choices for every occasion. With an ongoing
commitment to corporate citizenship, the Company has been named to the Dow Jones Sustainability™ North America Index
for six consecutive years.

Fiscal 2017 performance reflected a higher gross profit in the Grocery & Snacks segment, offset by lower gross profits
in the Refrigerated & Frozen, Foodservice, and International segments. Fiscal 2017 results were also impacted by lower sales
volumes and the reduction of profits due to the divestitures of Spicetec and JM Swank in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The
improved operating performance reflected significantly lower selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses and
lower interest expense, in each case compared to fiscal 2016.

Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2017 was $1.46, including earnings of $1.25 per diluted share from continuing
operations and $0.21 per diluted share from discontinued operations. Diluted loss per share in fiscal 2016 was $1.56, including
earnings of $0.29 per diluted share from continuing operations and a loss of $1.85 per diluted share from discontinued

18

operations. Several significant items affect the comparability of year-over-year results of continuing operations (see "Items
Impacting Comparability" below).

In fiscal 2017, we completed the spinoff of Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. ("Lamb Weston") through a distribution of 100%
of our interest in Lamb Weston to holders of outstanding shares of our common stock (the "Spinoff"). The transaction effecting
this change was structured as a tax-free spinoff. We also completed several other acquisitions and divestitures during the year.
See "Acquisitions" below and "Divestitures and Formation of Ardent Mills Joint Venture" below. Finally, we completed the
relocation of our corporate headquarters to Chicago, Illinois in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, in anticipation of the Spinoff, we reorganized our reporting segments. We now reflect
our results of operations in five reporting segments: Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, Foodservice,
and Commercial. The results of operations for the Lamb Weston business have been reclassified to results of discontinued
operations for all periods presented, and the assets and liabilities of the Lamb Weston business have been reclassified to assets
and liabilities of discontinued operations for all periods prior to the Spinoff.

Segment presentation of gains and losses from derivatives used for economic hedging of anticipated commodity input
costs and economic hedging of foreign currency exchange rate risks of anticipated transactions is discussed in the segment
review below.

Acquisitions

In April 2017, we acquired protein-based snacking businesses Thanasi Foods LLC, maker of Duke’s® meat snacks, and
BIGS LLC, maker of BIGS® seeds, for $217.6 million in cash, net of cash acquired, subject to a working capital adjustment
(the "Thanasi acquisition"). Approximately $134.6 million has been classified as goodwill pending determination of the final
purchase price allocation, of which $70.9 million is deductible for income tax purposes. Approximately $81.2 million of the
purchase price has been allocated to other intangible assets. These businesses are included in the Grocery & Snacks segment.

In September 2016, we acquired the operating assets of Frontera Foods, Inc. and Red Fork LLC, including the Frontera®,
Red Fork®, and Salpica® brands (the "Frontera acquisition"). These businesses make authentic, gourmet Mexican food products
and contemporary American cooking sauces. We acquired the businesses for $108.1 million in cash, net of cash acquired.
Approximately $39.7 million has been classified as goodwill and $66.7 million has been classified as other intangible assets.
The amount allocated to goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. These businesses are included principally in the Grocery &
Snacks segment, and to a lesser extent within the Refrigerated & Frozen and International segments.

In May 2015, we acquired Blake's All Natural Foods, a family-owned company specializing in frozen meals, including
pot pies, casseroles, pasta dishes, and other entrees, for $20.7 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The purchase included
property and equipment associated with making frozen meals. This business is included in the Refrigerated & Frozen segment.

Divestitures and Formation of Ardent Mills Joint Venture

On November 9, 2016, we completed the Spinoff of Lamb Weston. The results of operations of the Lamb Weston business

have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we completed the sales of our Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings business ("Spicetec") and
our JM Swank business for combined proceeds of $489.0 million. The results of operations of Spicetec and JM Swank are
included in the Commercial segment.

On February 1, 2016, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2015, with TreeHouse Foods,
Inc. ("TreeHouse"), we completed the disposition of our Private Brands business to TreeHouse for $2.6 billion in cash on a
debt-free basis. The results of operations of the Private Brands business have been classified as discontinued operations for
all periods presented.

On May 29, 2014, the Company, Cargill, Incorporated ("Cargill"), and CHS, Inc. ("CHS") completed the formation of
Ardent Mills, a joint venture. In connection with the formation, we contributed all of the assets of ConAgra Mills, our milling
operations. We reflected the results of the ConAgra Mills operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Our
equity in the earnings of Ardent Mills is reflected in our continuing operations.

Restructuring Plans

In May 2013, we announced the Supply Chain and Administrative Efficiency Plan (the "SCAE Plan"), our plan to integrate
and restructure the operations of our Private Brands business, improve SG&A effectiveness and efficiencies, and optimize
our supply chain network, manufacturing assets, dry distribution centers, and mixing centers. In the second quarter of fiscal
2016, we announced plans to realize efficiency benefits by reducing SG&A expenses and enhancing trade spend processes
and tools, which plans were included as part of the SCAE Plan. Although we divested the Private Brands business, we have
continued to implement the SCAE Plan, including by working to optimize our supply chain network, pursue cost reductions
through our SG&A functions, enhance trade spend processes and tools, and improve productivity.

20

Although we remain unable to make good faith estimates relating to the entire SCAE Plan, we are reporting on actions
initiated through the end of fiscal 2017, including the estimated amounts or range of amounts for each major type of costs
expected to be incurred, and the charges that have resulted or will result in cash outflows. As of May 28, 2017, our Board of
Directors has approved the incurrence of up to $880.5 million of expenses in connection with the SCAE Plan. We have incurred
or expect to incur approximately $446.2 million of charges ($299.2 million of cash charges and $147.0 million of non-cash
charges) for actions identified to date under the SCAE plan. We recognized charges of $63.6 million, $281.8 million, and
$47.7 million in relation to the SCAE Plan related to our continuing operations in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
We expect to incur costs related to the SCAE Plan over a multi-year period. 

SEGMENT REVIEW

During fiscal 2017, we reorganized our reporting segments. We now reflect our results of operations in five reporting
segments:  Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, Foodservice, and Commercial. Prior periods have been
reclassified to conform to the revised segment presentation. 

In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we completed the Spinoff of the Lamb Weston business, which was previously
included in the Commercial Foods segment. The results of operations of the Lamb Weston business have been classified as
discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Grocery & Snacks

The Grocery & Snacks reporting segment principally includes branded, shelf stable food products sold in various retail

channels in the United States. 

Refrigerated & Frozen

The Refrigerated & Frozen reporting segment principally includes branded, temperature controlled food products sold

in various retail channels in the United States.

International

The International reporting segment principally includes branded, food products, in various temperature states, sold in

various retail and foodservice channels outside of the United States.

Foodservice

The Foodservice reporting segment includes branded and customized food products, including meals, entrees, sauces,
and a variety of custom-manufactured culinary products that are packaged for sale to restaurants and other foodservice
establishments in the United States. 

Commercial 

The Commercial reporting segment included commercially branded and private label food and ingredients that were sold
primarily to commercial, restaurant, foodservice, food manufacturing, and industrial customers. The segment's primary food
items included a variety of vegetable, spice, and frozen bakery goods sold under brands such as Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings®.
The Spicetec and JM Swank businesses were sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.

Presentation of Derivative Gains (Losses) from Economic Hedges of Forecasted Cash Flows in Segment Results

Derivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting
treatment. We believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions. As such, these derivatives
are generally recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate
expenses. The gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period
in  which  the  underlying  transaction  being  economically  hedged  is  included  in  earnings.  In  the  event  that  management
determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function
as an economic hedge, we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin
recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results, immediately. 

21

The following table presents the net derivative gains (losses) from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption
and the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions associated with continuing operations, under this methodology:

As of May 28, 2017, the cumulative amount of net derivative losses from economic hedges that had been recognized in
general corporate expenses and not yet allocated to reporting segments was $3.0 million. This amount reflected net losses of
$3.3 million incurred during the fiscal year ended May 28, 2017, as well as net gains of $0.3 million incurred prior to fiscal
2017. Based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items, we expect to reclassify to segment
operating results losses of $1.2 million in fiscal 2018 and losses of $1.8 million in fiscal 2019 and thereafter.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, management determined that certain derivatives that had been previously entered
into as an economic hedge of forecasted commodity purchases had ceased to function as economic hedges. We recognized
derivative losses of $10.8 million, $6.3 million, and $2.7 million, and derivative gains of $0.9 million within the operating
results of the Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, and Foodservice segments, respectively, during fiscal
2015 in connection with these derivatives. Management effectively exited these derivative positions in the third quarter of
fiscal 2015.

Overall, our net sales were $7.83 billion in fiscal 2017, a decrease of 10% compared to fiscal 2016.

Grocery & Snacks net sales for fiscal 2017 were $3.21 billion, a decrease of $168.3 million, or 5%, compared to fiscal
2016. Results reflected a decrease in volumes of approximately 5% in fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year. The decrease
in sales volumes was the result of reduced trade promotions and the planned exit of certain lower-performing products. Price/
mix was flat as the continued progress in pricing and trade productivity was fully offset by unfavorable sales mix. The reduced
trade promotions and selective base price increases are actions that are intended to build a higher quality revenue base. The
Frontera acquisition and the Thanasi acquisition collectively contributed $36.5 million, or 1%, to segment net sales during
fiscal 2017.

22

Refrigerated & Frozen net sales for fiscal 2017 were $2.65 billion, a decrease of $215.1 million, or 8%, compared to
fiscal 2016. Results for fiscal 2017 reflected a 9% decrease in volume and a 1% increase in price/mix compared to fiscal 2016.
The decrease in sales volumes and improvements in price/mix reflected reduced trade promotions and selective base price
increases, together with stock-keeping unit rationalization, which actions were intended to build a higher quality revenue base.
Net sales growth was also negatively affected by a transitory increase in the volume of Egg Beaters® in fiscal 2016 as the
Company's egg supply was not negatively impacted by last year’s avian influenza outbreak.

International net sales for fiscal 2017 were $816.0 million, a decrease of $30.6 million, or 4%, compared to fiscal 2016.
Results for fiscal 2017 reflected a 3% decrease in volume, a 3% decrease due to foreign exchange rates, and a 2% increase
in price/mix compared to fiscal 2016. The volume decrease for fiscal 2017 was driven by significant shipments in early fiscal
2016 due to recovery from the West Coast port disruptions during fiscal 2015, aggressive pricing actions, reduced trade
promotions, and the planned discontinuation of certain lower-margin products. 

Foodservice net sales for fiscal 2017 were $1.08 billion, a decrease of $26.2 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2016.
Results for fiscal 2017 reflected a 4% decrease in volume offset by a 2% increase in price/mix compared to fiscal 2016. The
decrease in volumes primarily reflected the impact of exiting a non-core business. 

In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we divested our Spicetec and JM Swank businesses. These businesses comprise the
entire Commercial segment following the presentation of Lamb Weston as discontinued operations. Accordingly, there were
no net sales in the Commercial segment after the first quarter of fiscal 2017. These businesses had net sales of $71.1 million
in fiscal 2017 prior to the completion of the divestitures. Net sales in the Commercial segment were $468.1 million in fiscal
2016.

SG&A Expenses (Includes general corporate expenses)

SG&A expenses totaled $1.42 billion for fiscal 2017, a decrease of $607.5 million compared to fiscal 2016. SG&A

expenses for fiscal 2017 reflected the following:

Grocery & Snacks operating profit for fiscal 2017 was $653.7 million, an increase of $60.8 million, or 10%, compared
to fiscal 2016. Gross profits were $36.5 million higher in fiscal 2017 than in fiscal 2016. The higher gross profit was driven
by reduced trade promotions, improved plant productivity, and lower commodity input costs, partially offset by lower sales
volumes, due in part to pricing actions on certain products. SG&A expenses decreased by $24.3 million in fiscal 2017, as
compared to fiscal 2016, largely as a result of cost reductions achieved through our restructuring plans, as well as a $5.6
million reduction in advertising and promotion expenses. Operating profit of the Grocery & Snacks segment was impacted
by charges totaling $68.3 million and $50.1 million, primarily for the impairment of our Chef Boyardee® brand asset in fiscal
2017 and 2016, respectively, $31.4 million in charges in fiscal 2017 related to the pending divestiture of the Wesson® oil
business, and charges of $25.3 million and $51.8 million in connection with our restructuring plans in fiscal 2017 and 2016,
respectively.

Refrigerated & Frozen operating profit for fiscal 2017 was $445.8 million, an increase of $25.4 million, or 6%, compared
to fiscal 2016. Gross profits were $24.7 million lower in fiscal 2017 than in fiscal 2016, driven by decreased sales volumes
primarily associated with the transitory increase in the volume of Egg Beaters® in fiscal 2016, discussed above, partially offset
by the impact of lower commodity input costs, increased net pricing primarily as a result of reduced trade promotions, and
improved plant productivity. SG&A expenses decreased by $50.1 million in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, largely
as a result of cost reductions achieved through our restructuring plans, as well as a $8.9 million reduction in advertising and
promotion expenses. Operating profit of the Refrigerated & Frozen segment was impacted by charges totaling approximately
$7.7 million in fiscal 2017 related to a product recall, as well as charges of $6.2 million and $21.1 million in connection with
our restructuring plans in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.

International incurred an operating loss for fiscal 2017 of $168.9 million and earned an operating profit of $66.7 million
in fiscal 2016. The operating loss in fiscal 2017 includes charges totaling $235.9 million for the impairment of goodwill and
an intangible brand asset in our Canadian and Mexican operations. Gross profits were $8.5 million lower in fiscal 2017 than
in fiscal 2016, driven by the impact of foreign exchange rates. Operating profits were negatively impacted by $9.9 million
from the impact of foreign exchange rates in fiscal 2017 relative to fiscal 2016.

24

Foodservice operating profit for fiscal 2017 was $105.1 million, an increase of $7.4 million, or 8%, compared to fiscal
2016. Gross profits were $5.6 million lower in fiscal 2017 than in fiscal 2016, driven by volume declines and product supply
shortfalls. This was offset by an inventory write-down in fiscal 2016 at a foreign non-core popcorn business that we have
since exited. Operating profit of the Foodservice segment was impacted by charges of $1.8 million in fiscal 2017 in connection
with our restructuring plans.

Commercial operating profit was $202.6 million in fiscal 2017 and $45.4 million in fiscal 2016. The Company sold the
Spicetec and JM Swank businesses in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, recognizing pre-tax gains totaling $197.4 million. The
Spicetec and JM Swank businesses comprise the entire Commercial segment following the presentation of Lamb Weston as
discontinued operations. There are no further operations in the Commercial segment. 

Interest Expense, Net

In fiscal 2017, net interest expense was $195.5 million, a decrease of $100.3 million, or 34%, from fiscal 2016. The
decrease reflects the repayment of $2.2 billion, $550 million, and $473 million of debt in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the
first quarter of fiscal 2017, and the third quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively, as well as the exchange of $1.4 billion of debt in
connection with the Spinoff of Lamb Weston during the second quarter of 2017. For more information about the debt exchange,
please see Note 6 "Discontinued Operations and Other Divestitures" to the consolidated financial statements contained in
this report.

Income Taxes

Our income tax expense was $254.7 million and $46.4 million in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. The effective tax
rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income from continuing operations, inclusive of equity method
investment earnings) was approximately 32% and 27% for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. 

The effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 reflects the following:

•

•

•

•

•

additional tax expense associated with non-deductible goodwill sold in connection with the divestitures of the Spicetec
and JM Swank businesses,

additional tax expense associated with non-deductible goodwill in our Mexican and Canadian businesses, for which
an impairment charge was recognized,

an income tax benefit for the adjustment of a valuation allowance associated with the planned divestiture of the
Wesson® oil business,

an income tax benefit for excess tax benefits allowed upon the vesting/exercise of employee stock compensation
awards by our employees, beyond that which is attributable to the original fair value of the awards upon the date of
grant, and

an income tax benefit associated with a tax planning strategy that allowed us to utilize certain state tax attributes and
certain foreign incentives.

The effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 reflects the following:

•

•

•

additional tax expense related to legal entity changes for a business retained from the Private Brands business, 

a charge for the prior year implementation of a new tax position, and

an income tax benefit of normal, recurring, income tax credits and deductions combined with a lower pre-tax level
of earnings (due in large part to the impact of the write-off of $348.5 million of actuarial losses under our method of
accounting for pension benefits).

We expect our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018, exclusive of any unusual transactions or tax events, to be approximately

32.5%-33.5%.

25

Equity Method Investment Earnings

We include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates. Our
most significant affiliate is the Ardent Mills joint venture. Our share of earnings from our equity method investment earnings
were $71.2 million and $66.1 million for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increases are reflective of higher profits from
the Ardent Mills joint venture due to more favorable wheat market conditions as well as improved operational effectiveness.

Results of Discontinued Operations

Our discontinued operations generated after-tax income of $102.0 million in fiscal 2017 and an after-tax loss of $794.4
million in fiscal 2016. Results reflected the operations of Lamb Weston through the date of its Spinoff in November 2016, as
well as the results of the Private Brands business prior to its divestiture in the second half of fiscal 2016. We incurred significant
costs associated with effecting the Spinoff. These costs are included in results of discontinued operations. We recognized a
pre-tax charge of $1.92 billion ($1.44 billion after-tax) in fiscal 2016, to write-down the goodwill and long-lived assets of the
Private Brands business to the final sales price, less costs to sell, and to recognize the final loss.

Earnings (Loss) Per Share

Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2017 was $1.46, including earnings of $1.25 per diluted share from continuing
operations and $0.21 per diluted share from discontinued operations. Diluted loss per share in fiscal 2016 was $1.56, including
earnings of $0.29 per diluted share from continuing operations and a loss of $1.85 per diluted share from discontinued
operations. See "Items Impacting Comparability" above as several significant items affected the comparability of year-over-
year results of operations. 

Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015 

Our fiscal year end falls on the last Sunday of May each year. As a result, fiscal 2016 included 52 weeks of results, while
fiscal 2015 included 53 weeks of results. The exclusion in fiscal 2016 of one additional week of results than what was included
in fiscal 2015 impacted our fiscal 2016 results of operations relative to our fiscal 2015 results of operations. Such impacts are
noted below.

Overall, our net sales were $8.66 billion in fiscal 2016, a decrease of 4% compared to fiscal 2015.

Grocery & Snacks net sales for fiscal 2016 were $3.38 billion, a decrease of $132.8 million, or 4%, compared to fiscal
2015. Results reflected a decrease in volume of approximately 5%, partially offset by an increase in price/mix of 1% in fiscal
2016. The decrease in volume was primarily due to the inclusion of an additional week of results that occurred in fiscal 2015,
volume declines on center store consumption, as well as the negative elasticity impact on volume from pricing actions, which
included  reductions  in  trade  spending  as  part  of  an  overall  company  strategy  change.  Price/mix  improved  due  to  the
implementation of a trade reduction strategy, increased prices to offset commodity inflation on select brands, and product/
mix related segmentation focus. 

Refrigerated & Frozen net sales for fiscal 2016 were $2.87 billion, a decrease of $118.8 million, or 4%, compared to
fiscal 2015. Results for fiscal 2016 reflected an 8% decrease in volume in fiscal 2016, primarily due to the inclusion of an
additional week of results in fiscal 2015, as well as negative elasticity impact on volume due to increased prices on Banquet®
and other pricing actions. The Avian Flu outbreak contributed to net sales growth on Egg Beaters® as competitors experienced

26

supply constraints. In addition, there was a 4% increase in price/mix compared to the prior-year period due to the implementation
of a trade reduction strategy.

International net sales for fiscal 2016 were $846.6 million, a decrease of $96.1 million, or 10%, compared to fiscal 2015.
Results for fiscal 2016 reflected a 1% decrease in volume, a 11% decrease due to foreign exchange rates, and a 2% increase
in price/mix compared to the prior year. The volume decrease for fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the inclusion of an additional
week of results in fiscal 2015.

Foodservice net sales for fiscal 2016 were $1.10 billion, a decrease of $15.6 million, or 1%, compared to fiscal 2015.
Results for fiscal 2016 reflected an increase in volumes of 4%, offset by a decrease in price/mix of 5% compared to the prior
year. The year over year decrease was driven by the impact of the inclusion of the additional week of results in fiscal 2015. 

Commercial net sales for fiscal 2016 were $468.1 million, a decrease of $6.6 million, or 1%, compared to fiscal 2015.

The decrease in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the exclusion of an additional week of results that occurred in 2015.

SG&A Expenses (Includes general corporate expenses)

SG&A expenses totaled $2.02 billion for fiscal 2016, an increase of $641.2 million compared to fiscal 2015. We estimate
that the inclusion of an extra week in the fiscal 2015 resulted in additional SG&A expenses in fiscal 2015 of approximately
$18.1 million.

SG&A expenses for fiscal 2016 reflected the following:

Grocery & Snacks operating profit for fiscal 2016 was $592.9 million, an increase of $3.0 million, or 1%, compared to
fiscal 2015. Gross profits were $53.9 million higher in fiscal 2016 than in fiscal 2015. The higher gross profit was driven by
lower commodity input costs, supply chain productivity, and net realized pricing gains. This was partially offset by the volume
profit impacts of the inclusion of an additional week of results in fiscal 2015, soft volume consumption, and negative elasticities
from pricing/trade actions. SG&A expenses increased by $50.9 million in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, including
a $9.4 million increase in advertising and promotion expenses. Operating profit of the Grocery & Snacks segment included
a charge of $50.1 million related to impairment of the Chef Boyardee® brand intangible asset. Grocery & Snacks operating
profit was impacted by charges of $51.8 million and $24.1 million in connection with our restructuring plans in fiscal 2016
and 2015, respectively.

Refrigerated & Frozen operating profit for fiscal 2016 was $420.4 million, an increase of $44.1 million, or 12%, compared
to fiscal 2015. Gross profits were $85.4 million higher in fiscal 2016 than in fiscal 2015, driven by pricing actions on key
brands, lower commodity input costs, and Supply Chain productivity. This was partially offset by the volume profit impacts
of the inclusion of an additional week of results in fiscal 2015, and negative elasticities from pricing/trade actions. SG&A
expenses increased by $41.3 million in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, including a $27.8 million increase in advertising
and promotion expenses. Operating profit of the Refrigerated & Frozen segment was impacted by charges totaling $21.1
million and $11.2 million in connection with our restructuring plans in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.

International operating profit for fiscal 2016 was $66.7 million, a decrease of $23.6 million, or 26%, compared to fiscal
2015. Gross profits were $41.6 million lower in fiscal 2016 than in fiscal 2015, driven by the impact of foreign exchange
rates. Operating profit was negatively impacted by $43.0 million from the impact of foreign exchange rates in fiscal 2016
relative to fiscal 2015.

Foodservice operating profit for fiscal 2016 was $97.7 million, a decrease of $11.7 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal
2015. Gross profits were $8.7 million lower in fiscal 2016 than in fiscal 2015. Foodservice gross profit included an inventory
write-down in fiscal 2016 of a foreign popcorn business that we have since exited. Operating profit of the Foodservice segment
was impacted by charges of $3.2 million in fiscal 2015 in connection with our restructuring plans.

Operating profit for fiscal 2016 in the Commercial segment was $45.4 million, comparable to $43.5 million in fiscal

2015. 

Interest Expense, Net

In fiscal 2016, net interest expense was $295.8 million, a decrease of $32.4 million, or 10%, from fiscal 2015. The decrease
reflects the repayment of debt. Interest expense in fiscal 2016 and 2015 reflected a net benefit of $2.9 million and $8.1 million,
respectively, primarily resulting from interest rate swaps used to effectively convert the interest rates of certain outstanding
debt instruments from fixed rate to floating rate.

Income Taxes

Our income tax expense was $46.4 million and $212.7 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective tax
rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income from continuing operations, inclusive of equity method
investment earnings) was 27% for fiscal 2016 and 32% for fiscal 2015. 

28

Income tax expense for fiscal 2016 included $8.3 million of expense related to legal entity changes for a business retained
from Private Brands and a $2.7 million charge for the prior year implementation of a new tax position, offset by the benefit
of normal, recurring, income tax credits and deductions combined with a lower pre-tax level of earnings (due in large part to
the impact of the write-off of $348.5 million of actuarial losses under our method of accounting for pension benefits). 

 In fiscal 2015, we implemented a new position and took a tax credit that applied to prior year tax returns which resulted

in an income tax benefit of $5.2 million. 

Equity Method Investment Earnings

We include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates. Our
most significant affiliate is the Ardent Mills joint venture. Our share of earnings from our equity method investment earnings
were $66.1 million and $79.4 million for the fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. Fiscal 2016 reflects a full year of earnings
from the Ardent Mills joint venture, compared to the 11 months in fiscal 2015. We recognize earnings on a one-month lag for
the Ardent Mills joint venture, due to differences in fiscal year periods.

Results of Discontinued Operations

Our discontinued operations generated after-tax losses of $794.4 million and $692.1 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015,

respectively. 

As a result of the disposition of the Private Brands business, we recognized a pre-tax charge of $1.92 billion ($1.44 billion
after-tax) in fiscal 2016 to write-down the goodwill and long-lived assets to the final sales price, less costs to sell, and to
recognize the final loss. The results of discontinued operations for fiscal 2015 include a $1.51 billion impairment of goodwill
and $57.6 million of impairment charges to write-down various brands and fixed assets recognized on the Private Brands
business divestiture.

The results of discontinued operations for fiscal 2015 also include a pre-tax gain of $625.6 million ($379.6 million after-
tax) recognized on the transactions related to the formation of Ardent Mills (see Note 6 "Discontinued Operations and Other
Divestitures" in the consolidated financial statements).

Earnings (Loss) Per Share

Diluted loss per share in fiscal 2016 was $1.56, including earnings of $0.29 per diluted share from continuing operations
and a loss of $1.85 per diluted share from discontinued operations. Diluted loss per share in fiscal 2015 was $0.59, including
earnings of $1.04 per diluted share from continuing operations and a loss of $1.63 per diluted share from discontinued
operations. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Sources of Liquidity and Capital

The primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to
pursue our growth objectives. If necessary, we use short-term debt principally to finance ongoing operations, including our
seasonal requirements for working capital and a combination of equity and long-term debt to finance both our base working
capital needs and our non-current assets. We are committed to maintaining an investment grade credit rating.

During fiscal 2017, we entered into a revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of financial
institutions that provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility in a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at
any one time of $1.25 billion (subject to increase to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1.75 billion with the consent
of the lenders). This revolving credit facility replaced our existing revolving credit facility. We have historically used a credit
facility principally as a back-up for our commercial paper program. As of May 28, 2017, there were no outstanding borrowings
under the facility. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for unsecured investment
grade credit facilities of this type. It generally requires our ratio of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization) to interest expense to be not less than 3.0 to 1.0 and our ratio of funded debt to EBITDA to be not greater than
3.75 to 1.0 (provided that such ratio may be increased at the option of the Company in connection with a material transaction),
with each ratio to be calculated on a rolling four-quarter basis. As of May 28, 2017, we were in compliance with all financial
covenants under the Credit Agreement.

29

As of May 28, 2017, we had $26.2 million outstanding under our commercial paper program. The highest level of
borrowings during fiscal 2017 was $65.0 million. As of May 29, 2016, we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial
paper program.

As of the end of fiscal 2017, our senior long-term debt ratings were all investment grade. A significant downgrade in our
credit ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility, although borrowing costs
would increase. A downgrade of our short-term credit ratings would impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper
program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations, as well as making access to commercial
paper more difficult. 

We repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time after considering market conditions and in accordance with
repurchase limits authorized by our Board of Directors. During fiscal 2017, the Board of Directors approved an additional
$2.25 billion share repurchase authorization to the existing share repurchase program. The share repurchase authorization has
no expiration date. Under the share repurchase authorization, we may repurchase our shares periodically over several years,
depending on market conditions and other factors, and may do so in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions.
As of May 29, 2016 the Company's total remaining share repurchase authorization was $131.9 million. During fiscal 2017,
we repurchased 25.1 million shares of our common stock under this authorization for an aggregate of $1.0 billion. The
Company's total remaining share repurchase authorization as of May 28, 2017 was $1.38 billion. 

On July 19, 2017, the Board of Directors authorized a quarterly dividend payment of $0.2125 per share, which will be

paid on August 31, 2017 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 31, 2017.

During fiscal 2017, we provided a voluntary lump-sum settlement offer to certain terminated vested participants in our
salaried pension plan. During fiscal 2017, $287.5 million was distributed to such participants from pension plan assets in
connection with this offer. We made pension contributions totaling $163.0 million for fiscal 2017, including a $150 million
voluntary contribution made in the fourth quarter to improve the funded status of our pension plans.

On November 9, 2016, we completed the Spinoff of Lamb Weston. In connection with the Spinoff, Lamb Weston issued
to us $1.54 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes (the "Lamb Weston notes"). On November 9, 2016, we exchanged
the Lamb Weston notes for approximately $250.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.819% senior notes due 2017,
$880.4 million aggregate principal amount of our 1.9% senior notes due 2018, $154.9 million aggregate principal amount of
our 2.1% senior notes due 2018, $86.9 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.0% senior notes due 2019, and $71.1
million aggregate principal amount of our 4.95% senior notes due 2020 (collectively, the "Conagra notes"), which had been
purchased in the open market by certain investment banks prior to the Spinoff. Following the exchange, we cancelled the
Conagra notes. We also received a cash payment of $823.5 million from Lamb Weston as consideration for the Spinoff. 

During fiscal 2017, we repaid the entire principal balance of $550.0 million of our floating rate notes on the maturity date
of July 21, 2016. We also repaid the remaining principal balance of $224.8 million of our 5.819% senior notes due 2017 and
$248.2 million principal amount of our 7.0% senior notes due 2019, in each case prior to maturity, resulting in a net loss from
the early retirement of debt of $32.7 million. 

We have access to the $1.25 billion revolving credit facility, our commercial paper program, and the capital markets.  We

believe we also have access to additional bank loan facilities, if needed. 

We have recently signed an agreement to sell our Wesson® oil business. The sale remains subject to customary closing
conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. We expect to realize net proceeds from the sale of approximately $285
million.

We expect to maintain or have access to sufficient liquidity to either retire or refinance senior debt upon maturity, as
market conditions warrant, from operating cash flows, our commercial paper program, proceeds from any divestitures and
other disposition transactions, access to capital markets, and our revolving credit facility. 

Cash Flows

In fiscal 2017, we used $583.1 million of cash, which was the net result of $1.18 billion generated from operating activities,
$189.3 million used in investing activities, $1.57 billion used in financing activities, and a decrease of $0.2 million in cash
due to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 

30

Cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations totaled $1.14 billion in fiscal 2017, as compared to
$625.5 million generated in fiscal 2016. Higher operating cash flows were generated by increased operating profits in fiscal
2017, compared to fiscal 2016. The higher operating profits were achieved by reducing SG&A expenses, in large part enabled
by our restructuring plans, as well as by achieving improved gross margins. The increase was also driven by the timing of
income tax payments (a capital loss generated in fiscal 2016 was utilized in fiscal 2017, such that no income tax payments
were required to be made for the gain realized upon the sale of the Spicetec and JM Swank businesses), significantly lower
inventory build, due to lower sales volumes and lower per case cost of inventories, increase in accounts payable balance due
to extension of certain vendor terms, and reductions of interest payments due to significant debt repayments in fiscal 2017
and 2016. Also, incentive compensation payments in fiscal 2017 (earned in fiscal 2016) were $73.8 million higher than such
payments made in fiscal 2016 (earned in fiscal 2015).

Cash generated from operating activities of discontinued operations was $34.7 million and $633.7 million in fiscal 2017
and fiscal 2016, respectively. This reflects the activities of the Private Brands business we sold in the third quarter of fiscal
2016 and those of the Lamb Weston business that were spun off on November 9, 2016. Operating cash flows of discontinued
operations in fiscal 2017 were also impacted by expenses related to the Spinoff.

Cash used in investing activities of continuing operations totaled $65.6 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $251.9 million
in  fiscal  2016.  Investing  activities  of  continuing  operations  in  fiscal  2017  consisted  primarily  of  the  proceeds  from  the
divestitures of the Spicetec and JM Swank businesses totaling $489.0 million in the aggregate, partially offset by capital
expenditures of $242.1 million, which included several significant plant expansions and improvements, and acquisitions
totaling $325.7 million, including the operating assets of Frontera Foods, Inc. and Red Fork LLC and the protein-based
snacking businesses Thanasi Foods LLC and BIGS LLC. Investing activities of continuing operations of fiscal 2016 consisted
primarily of capital expenditures of $277.5 million. 

Cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations in fiscal 2017 resulted primarily from capital expenditures.
Cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations in fiscal 2016 resulted primarily from the proceeds of the
divestiture of our Private Brands business totaling $2.60 billion, net of cash transferred and closing costs, partially offset by
capital expenditures of $247.6 million.

Cash used for financing activities of continuing operations totaled $2.41 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to $2.73 billion
in fiscal 2016.  Financing activities of continuing operations for fiscal 2017 consisted primarily of long-term debt repayments
totaling $1.06 billion, cash dividends paid of $415.0 million and common stock repurchases totaling $1.0 billion. Proceeds
from employee stock option exercises and the issuance of other stock awards were $73.8 million in fiscal 2017. Cash used in
financing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2016 reflect debt repayments of $2.52 billion and dividends paid of
$432.5 million, partially offset by employee stock option exercises and the issuance of other stock awards of $208.4 million.

Cash provided by financing activities of discontinued operations principally comprises borrowing by Lamb Weston which

were transferred in connection with the Spinoff. 

The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $251.4 million at May 28, 2017 and $798.1 million at May 29, 2016, of
which $244.9 million at May 28, 2017 and $105.3 million at May 29, 2016 was held in foreign countries. The Company makes
an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment outside the United States, with the balance
available to be repatriated to the United States. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally
used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and future foreign investments. No related tax liability has been accrued
as of May 28, 2017. At May 28, 2017, management does not intend to permanently repatriate additional foreign cash. Any
future decision to repatriate foreign cash could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax liability after considering available
foreign tax credits and other tax attributes. It is not practicable to determine the amount of any such deferred tax liability at
this time.

Our preliminary estimate of capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 is approximately $285 million. 

Management believes that the Company's sources of liquidity will be adequate to satisfy working capital needs, repurchase
shares of our common stock from time to time, make payments of anticipated quarterly dividends, complete planned capital
expenditures, and make any required debt repayments, including by retiring or refinancing senior debt upon maturity (as
market conditions warrant), for the foreseeable future.

31

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We use off-balance sheet arrangements (e.g., leases accounted for as operating leases) where sound business principles
warrant their use. We also periodically enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the
ordinary course of business. These are described further in "Obligations and Commitments," below.

Variable Interest Entities Not Consolidated

We have variable interests in certain entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities, but for which we

are not the primary beneficiary. We do not consolidate the financial statements of these entities.

We lease certain office buildings from entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities. The lease agreements
with these entities include fixed-price purchase options for the assets being leased. The lease agreements also contain contingent
put options (the "lease put options") that allow the lessors to require us to purchase the buildings at the greater of original
construction cost, or fair market value, without a lease agreement in place (the "put price") in certain limited circumstances.
As a result of substantial impairment charges related to our divested Private Brands operations, these lease put options are
exercisable now and remain exercisable until generally 30 days after the end of the respective lease agreements. We are
amortizing the difference between the estimated put price and the estimated fair value (without a lease agreement in place)
of each respective property over the remaining respective lease term within selling, general and administrative expenses. As
of May 28, 2017, the estimated amount by which the put prices exceeded the fair values of the related properties was $51.8
million, of which we have accrued $8.4 million. As these buildings are worth considerably more when under lease agreements
than when vacant, we may be able to mitigate some, or all of the financial exposure created by the put options by maintaining
active lease agreements and/or by subleasing the buildings to credit worthy tenants. We do not expect to ultimately incur
material financial losses as a result of the potential exercise of the lease put options by the lessors. During fiscal 2017, one of
these lease agreements expired. As a result of this expiration, we reversed the applicable accrual and recognized a benefit of
$6.7 million in selling, general and administrative expenses. These leases are accounted for as operating leases, and accordingly,
there are no material assets or liabilities, other than the accrued portion of the put price, associated with these entities included
in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most
significantly impact the economic performance of these entities. In making this determination, we have considered, among
other items, the terms of the lease agreements, the expected remaining useful lives of the assets leased, and the capital structure
of the lessor entities.

OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS

As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts
such as lease agreements, debt agreements, and unconditional purchase obligations (i.e., obligations to transfer funds in the
future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices, such as "take-or-pay" contracts). The
unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in our normal course of business in order to ensure adequate
levels of sourced product are available. Of these items, debt, notes payable, and capital lease obligations, which totaled $3.0
billion as of May 28, 2017, were recognized as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating lease obligations and
unconditional purchase obligations, which totaled $1.3 billion as of May 28, 2017, were not recognized as liabilities in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

We are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our long-term debt and capital lease obligations. The weighted

average coupon interest rate of the long-term debt obligations outstanding as of May 28, 2017 was approximately 5.3%.

The operating lease obligations noted in the table above have not been reduced by non-cancellable sublease rentals of

$1.7 million.

As of May 28, 2017, we had aggregate unfunded pension obligations totaling $565.1 million.  This amount is not included
in the table above, as the unfunded pension obligation is marked-to-market each fiscal year and we do not expect to be required
to make payments to fund these amounts in the next few years. Based on current statutory requirements, we are not obligated
to fund any amount to our qualified pension plans during the next twelve months. We estimate that we will make payments
of approximately $12.8 million over the next twelve months to fund our pension plans. See Note 19, "Pension and Postretirement
Benefits" to the consolidated financial statements and "Critical Accounting Estimates - Employment Related Benefits" for
further discussion of our pension obligations and factors that could affect estimates of this liability.

As part of our ongoing operations, we also enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments only
upon the occurrence of a future event (e.g., guarantees of debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be
unable to perform). In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the following commercial commitments are
not recognized as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. A summary of our commitments, including commitments
associated with equity method investments, as of May 28, 2017, was as follows:

In certain limited situations, we will guarantee an obligation of an unconsolidated entity. We guarantee certain leases
resulting from the divestiture of the JM Swank business completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As of May 28, 2017, the
remaining terms of these arrangements do not exceed six years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed
was $4.3 million.

In  certain  limited  situations,  we  also  guarantee  obligations  of  the  Lamb  Weston  business  pursuant  to  guarantee
arrangements that existed prior to the Spinoff and remained in place following completion of the Spinoff until such guarantee
obligations are substituted for guarantees issued by Lamb Weston. Such guarantee arrangements are described below. Pursuant
to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated as of November 8, 2016 (the "Separation Agreement"), between us and
Lamb Weston, these guarantee arrangements are deemed liabilities of Lamb Weston that were transferred to Lamb Weston as
part of the Spinoff. Accordingly, in the event that we are required to make any payments as a result of these guarantee

33

arrangements, Lamb Weston is obligated to indemnify us for any such liability, reduced by any insurance proceeds received
by us, in accordance with the terms of the indemnification provisions under the Separation Agreement.

Lamb Weston is a party to a warehouse services agreement with a third-party warehouse provider through July 2035.
Under this agreement, Lamb Weston is required to make payments for warehouse services based on the quantity of goods
stored and other service factors. We have guaranteed the warehouse provider that we will make the payments required under
the agreement in the event that Lamb Weston fails to perform. Minimum payments of $1.5 million per month are required
under this agreement. It is not possible to determine the maximum amount of the payment obligations under this agreement.
Upon completion of the Spinoff, we recognized a liability for the estimated fair value of this guarantee. As of May 28, 2017,
the amount of this guarantee, recorded in other noncurrent liabilities, was $29.7 million.

Lamb Weston is a party to an agricultural sublease agreement with a third party for certain farmland through 2020 (subject,
at Lamb Weston’s option, to extension for two additional five-year periods). Under the terms of the sublease agreement, Lamb
Weston is required to make certain rental payments to the sublessor. We have guaranteed the sublessor Lamb Weston’s
performance and the payment of all amounts (including indemnification obligations) owed by Lamb Weston under the sublease
agreement, up to a maximum of $75.0 million. We believe the farmland associated with this sublease agreement is readily
marketable for lease to other area farming operators. As such, we believe that any financial exposure to the company, in the
event that we were required to perform under the guaranty, would be largely mitigated.

The obligations and commitments tables above do not include any reserves for uncertainties in income taxes, as we are
unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes. The liability for
gross unrecognized tax benefits at May 28, 2017 was $39.3 million. The net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at May 28,
2017, that, if recognized, would impact our effective tax rate was $31.6 million. Recognition of these tax benefits would have
a favorable impact on our effective tax rate.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management. The estimates
used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with management's understanding of current facts and
circumstances. Certain of our accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our
financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management. The following is a
summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management.

Our  Audit/Finance  Committee  has  reviewed  management's  development,  selection,  and  disclosure  of  the  critical

accounting estimates.

Marketing Costs—We incur certain costs to promote our products through marketing programs, which include advertising,
customer incentives, and consumer incentives. We recognize the cost of each of these types of marketing activities as incurred
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The judgment required in determining marketing costs can be
significant. For volume-based incentives provided to customers, management must continually assess the likelihood of the
customer achieving the specified targets. Similarly, for consumer coupons, management must estimate the level at which
coupons will be redeemed by consumers in the future. Estimates made by management in accounting for marketing costs are
based primarily on our historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and
industry trends. As these factors change, management’s estimates could change and we could recognize different amounts of
marketing costs over different periods of time.

We have recognized reserves of $108.1 million for these marketing costs as of May 28, 2017. Changes in the assumptions
used in estimating the cost of any individual customer marketing program (including amounts classified as a revenue reduction)
would not result in a material change in our results of operations or cash flows.

Advertising and promotion expenses totaled $328.3 million, $347.2 million, and $312.6 million in fiscal 2017, 2016, and

2015, respectively.

Income Taxes—Our income tax expense is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities
available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by
the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our income tax
expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. Management reviews tax positions at least
quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available. Deferred income tax assets represent amounts

34

available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in our balance sheets, as well as from net operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards. Management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the
adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted
operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies. These estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant
judgment. Management uses historical experience and short and long-range business forecasts to develop such estimates.
Further, we employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions.
To the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation
allowance is established.

Further information on income taxes is provided in Note 15 "Pre-tax Income and Income Taxes" to the consolidated

financial statements.

Environmental Liabilities—Environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred
and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated. Management works with independent third-party specialists in order
to effectively assess our environmental liabilities. Management estimates our environmental liabilities based on evaluation
of investigatory studies, extent of required clean-up, our known volumetric contribution, other potentially responsible parties,
and our experience in remediating sites. Environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other
external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of clean-up. Management's
estimate  as  to  our  potential  liability  is  independent  of  any  potential  recovery  of  insurance  proceeds  or  indemnification
arrangements. Insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to
the general status of known claims. We do not discount our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash
payments is not fixed or readily determinable. To the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above,
management's estimate of environmental liabilities may also change.

We have recognized a reserve of approximately $58.1 million for environmental liabilities as of May 28, 2017. The reserve
for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs
required to effect such remedy. 

Employment-Related Benefits—We incur certain employment-related expenses associated with pensions, postretirement
health care benefits, and workers' compensation. In order to measure the annual expense associated with these employment-
related benefits, management must make a variety of estimates including, but not limited to, discount rates used to measure
the present value of certain liabilities, assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses, compensation increases,
employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, anticipated health care costs, and employee accidents incurred but not
yet reported to us. The estimates used by management are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and
circumstances. We use third-party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with
these employment-related benefits. Different estimates used by management could result in us recognizing different amounts
of expense over different periods of time. 

Beginning in fiscal 2017, the Company has elected to use a split discount rate (spot-rate approach) for the U.S. plans and
certain foreign plans. Historically, a single weighted-average discount rate was used in the calculation of service and interest
costs, both of which are components of pension benefit costs. The spot-rate approach applies separate discount rates for each
projected benefit payment in the calculation of pension service and interest cost. This change is considered a change in
accounting estimate and has been applied prospectively. The pre-tax reduction in total pension benefit cost associated with
this change in fiscal 2017 was approximately $27.0 million. 

We have recognized a pension liability of $582.2 million and $946.6 million, a postretirement liability of $156.9 million
and $201.6 million, and a workers' compensation liability of $41.5 million and $62.2 million, as of the end of fiscal 2017 and
2016, respectively. We also have recognized a pension asset of $17.1 million and $3.0 million as of the end of fiscal 2017 and
2016, respectively, as certain individual plans of the Company had a positive funded status.

We recognize cumulative changes in the fair value of pension plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of
10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation ("the corridor") in current period
expense annually as of our measurement date, which is our fiscal year-end, or when measurement is required otherwise under
generally accepted accounting principles. 

We recognized pension expense (benefit), including activities of discontinued operations, from Company plans of $(12.9)
million, $370.8 million, and $0.9 million in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Such amounts reflect the year-end write-
off of actuarial losses in excess of 10% of our pension liability of $1.2 million, $348.5 million, and $6.9 million in fiscal 2017,

35

2016, and 2015, respectively. This also reflected expected returns on plan assets of $207.4 million, $259.9 million, and $267.9
million in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We contributed $163.0 million, $11.5 million, and $12.7 million to the
pension  plans  of  our  continuing  operations  in  fiscal  2017,  2016,  and  2015,  respectively.  We  anticipate  contributing
approximately $12.8 million to our pension plans in fiscal 2018.

One significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate. Historically, we have selected a discount
rate each year (as of our fiscal year-end measurement date) for our plans based upon a high-quality corporate bond yield curve
for which the cash flows from coupons and maturities match the year-by-year projected benefit cash flows for our pension
plans. The corporate bond yield curve is comprised of high-quality fixed income debt instruments (usually Moody's Aa)
available at the measurement date. At May 29, 2016, the Company changed to use a spot-rate approach, discussed above.
This alternative approach focuses on measuring the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by
using individual spot rates derived from a high-quality corporate bond yield curve and matched with separate cash flows for
each future year instead of a single weighted-average discount rate approach.

Based on this information, the discount rate selected by us for determination of pension expense was 3.83% for fiscal
2017, 4.10% for fiscal 2016, and 4.15% for fiscal 2015. We selected a weighted-average discount rate of 4.19% and 3.26%
for determination of service and interest expense, respectively, for fiscal 2018. A 25 basis point increase in our discount rate
assumption as of the end of fiscal 2017 would have resulted in an increase of $1.7 million in our pension expense for fiscal
2017. A 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2017 would have resulted in an increase
of $0.4 million in our pension expense for fiscal 2017. For our year-end pension obligation determination, we selected discount
rates of 3.90% and 3.83% for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Another significant assumption used to account for our pension plans is the expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets. In developing the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense, we consider long-
term historical returns (arithmetic average) of the plan’s investments, the asset allocation among types of investments, estimated
long-term returns by investment type from external sources, and the current economic environment. Based on this information,
we selected 7.50% for the long-term rate of return on plan assets for determining our fiscal 2017 pension expense. A 25 basis
point increase/decrease in our expected long-term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2017 would decrease/
increase annual pension expense for our pension plans by $7.2 million. We selected an expected rate of return on plan assets
of 7.50% to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2018. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in our expected long-
term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2018 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for our
pension plans by $7.3 million.

The rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the development of accounting information
for pension plans. We determine this assumption based on our long-term plans for compensation increases and current economic
conditions. Based on this information, we selected 3.63% and 3.66% for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively, as the rate
of compensation increase for determining our year-end pension obligation. We selected 3.66% for the rate of compensation
increase for determination of pension expense for fiscal year 2017, 3.70% for fiscal 2016, and 4.25% fiscal 2015. A 25 basis
point increase in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2017 would increase pension
expense for our pension plans by $0.7 million for the year. A 25 basis point decrease in our rate of compensation increase
assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2017 would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by $0.7 million for the
year. We selected a rate of 3.63% for the rate of compensation increase to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal
2018. A 25 basis point increase in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2018 would
increase pension expense for our pension plans by $0.5 million for the year. A 25 basis point decrease in our rate of compensation
increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2018 would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by $0.5 million
for the year.

In October 2014, The Society of Actuaries' Retirement Plan Experience Committee published new mortality tables and
recommended their use for the measurement of U.S. pension plan obligations. With the assistance of our third-party actuary,
in measuring our pension obligations as of May 31, 2015, we incorporated revised assumptions that generally reflect the
mortality improvement inherent in these new tables, as adjusted for experience specific to our industry. 

In  October  2016,  The  Society  of  Actuaries'  Retirement  Plan  Experience  Committee  published  updated  mortality
improvement  scales  and  recommended  their  use  with  base  mortality  tables  for  the  measurement  of  U.S.  pension  plan
obligations. With the assistance of our third-party actuary, in measuring our pension obligations as of May 28, 2017, we
incorporated a revised improvement scale to be used with our current base mortality tables that generally reflect the mortality
improvement inherent in these new tables.  

36

We also provide certain postretirement health care benefits. We recognized postretirement benefit expense (benefit) of
$(1.2) million, $0.2 million, and $6.1 million in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We reflected liabilities of $156.9
million and $201.6 million in our balance sheets as of May 28, 2017 and May 29, 2016, respectively. We anticipate contributing
approximately $18.7 million to our postretirement health care plans in fiscal 2018.

The  postretirement  benefit  expense  and  obligation  are  also  dependent  on  our  assumptions  used  for  the  actuarially
determined amounts. These assumptions include discount rates (discussed above), health care cost trend rates, inflation rates,
retirement rates, mortality rates (also discussed above), and other factors. The health care cost trend assumptions are developed
based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook, and an assessment of likely long-term trends. Assumed inflation rates are
based on an evaluation of external market indicators. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan
experience. The discount rate we selected for determination of postretirement expense was 3.18% for fiscal 2017, 3.50% for
fiscal 2016, and 3.65% for fiscal 2015. We have selected a weighted-average discount rate of 3.33% for determination of
postretirement expense for fiscal 2018. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning
of fiscal 2017 would not have resulted in a material change to postretirement expense for our plans. We have assumed the
initial year increase in cost of health care to be 8.5%, with the trend rate decreasing to 4.5% by 2024. A one percentage point
change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects:

We provide workers' compensation benefits to our employees. The measurement of the liability for our cost of providing
these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs. One significant assumption we make is the discount rate used
to calculate the present value of our obligation. The weighted-average discount rate used at May 28, 2017 was 3.08%. A 25
basis point increase/decrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers' compensation
expense or the liability.

Business Combinations, Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (including property, plant and equipment), Identifiable
Intangible Assets, and Goodwill—We use the acquisition method in accounting for acquired businesses. Under the acquisition
method, our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing of the acquisition.
The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition.
Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired, particularly intangible assets. As a result,
in the case of significant acquisitions we normally obtain the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist in estimating fair
values  of  tangible  and  intangible  assets.  The  fair  value  estimates  are  based  on  available  historical  information  and  on
expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspective of marketplace participants. While management
believes  those  expectations  and  assumptions  are  reasonable,  they  are  inherently  uncertain.  Unanticipated  market  or
macroeconomic  events  and  circumstances  may  occur,  which  could  affect  the  accuracy  or  validity  of  the  estimates  and
assumptions.

We reduce the carrying amounts of long-lived assets (including property, plant and equipment) to their fair values when
their carrying amount is determined to not be recoverable.  We generally compare undiscounted estimated future cash flows
of an asset or asset group to the carrying values of the asset or asset group.  If the undiscounted estimated future cash flows
exceed the carrying values of the asset or asset group, no impairment is recognized.  If the undiscounted estimated future cash
flows are less than the carrying values of the asset or asset group, we write-down the asset or assets to their estimated fair
values.  The estimates of fair value are generally in the form of appraisal, or by discounting estimated future cash flows of
the asset or asset group.

Determining the useful lives of intangible assets also requires management judgment. Certain brand intangibles are
expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands,
while other acquired intangible assets (e.g., customer relationships) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our
estimates of the useful lives of definite-lived intangible assets are primarily based upon historical experience, the competitive
and macroeconomic environment, and our operating plans. The costs of definite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense
over their estimated life. 

We reduce the carrying amounts of indefinite-lived intangible assets, and goodwill to their fair values when the fair value
of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts (i.e., assets are deemed to be impaired). Fair value is

37

typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to
be generated by the particular asset being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present
value of the anticipated cash flows. When determining future cash flow estimates, we consider historical results adjusted to
reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management
in such areas as future economic conditions, industry-specific conditions, product pricing, and necessary capital expenditures.
The use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts (or none at
all) for long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets.

In assessing other intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment, we have the option to perform a qualitative
assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than
not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that it is not more likely
than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, then we are not required to perform
any additional tests for assessing intangible assets for impairment. However, if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform
the qualitative assessment, then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test that involves a comparison of the
estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair
value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

If we perform a quantitative impairment test in evaluating impairment of our indefinite lived brands/trademarks, we utilize
a "relief from royalty" methodology. The methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted
cash flow model that incorporates an estimated "royalty rate" we would be able to charge a third party for the use of the
particular brand. When determining the future cash flow estimates, we must estimate future net sales and a fair market royalty
rate for each applicable brand and an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows.
Estimating future net sales requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions, product
pricing, and consumer trends. In determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows, we
consider the current interest rate environment and our estimated cost of capital. 

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment of value and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying
amount of the asset may be impaired. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment
has occurred. Such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions, adverse changes in the markets in
which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have negative effects on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative
or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. The fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may
differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill. 

In testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence
of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (more than 50%) that the estimated fair value
of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an
impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform a quantitative impairment test, otherwise no further
analysis is required. We also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative
impairment test.

Under the qualitative assessment, various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting
unit are identified (similar to impairment indicators above). Furthermore, management considers the results of the most recent
two-step quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital between
the current and prior years for each reporting unit.

Under the quantitative impairment test, the evaluation involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit
to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires
us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the reporting unit being tested for impairment as well as
to select a risk-adjusted discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. When determining future
cash flow estimates, we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. We estimate
cash flows for the reporting unit over a discrete period (typically four or five years) and the terminal period (considering
expected long term growth rates and trends). Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in
such areas as future economic conditions, industry-specific conditions, product pricing, and necessary capital expenditures.
The use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows or significant changes in risk-adjusted discounts rates due
to changes in market conditions could produce substantially different estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit.

Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value, we completed
a second step of the test to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss, if any, to be recognized. In the second step,
we estimated an implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of

38

the assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets). The impairment loss was equal
to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. As a result of adopting Accounting
Standards Update ("ASU") 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2017, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference
between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the reporting unit.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, in anticipation of the Spinoff, we changed our reporting segments. In accordance with
applicable accounting guidance, we were required to determine new reporting units at a lower level (at the operating segment
or one level lower, as applicable). When such a determination was made, we were required to perform a goodwill impairment
analysis for each of the new reporting units.

We performed an assessment of impairment of goodwill for the new Canadian reporting unit within the new International
reporting segment. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates
regarding our future plans and future industry and economic conditions. We estimated the future cash flows of the Canadian
reporting unit and calculated the net present value of those estimated cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate, in order
to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit from the perspective of a market participant. We used discount rates and
terminal growth rates of 7.5% and 2%, respectively, to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows. We then
compared the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the historical carrying value (including allocated assets and liabilities
of certain shared and Corporate functions), and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying
value in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. With the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, we estimated the fair value
of the assets and liabilities of this reporting unit in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. We recognized an
impairment charge for the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and the carrying value of goodwill. Accordingly,
during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded charges totaling $139.2 million for the impairment of goodwill. The
remaining goodwill balance of the Canadian reporting unit as of May 28, 2017 was $43.4 million.

As part of the assessment of the fair value of each asset and liability within the Canadian reporting unit, with the assistance
of the third-party valuation specialist, we estimated the fair value of a Canadian brand to be less than its carrying value. In
accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we recognized an impairment charge of $24.4 million to write-down the
intangible asset to its estimated fair value.

We also performed an assessment of impairment of goodwill for the new Mexican reporting unit within the International
reporting segment using similar methods to those described above. We used discount rates and terminal growth rates of 8.5%
and 3%, respectively, to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows. We determined that the estimated fair value
of this reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of its net assets by approximately 5%. Accordingly, we did not recognize
an impairment of the goodwill in the Mexican reporting unit.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, as a result of further deterioration in forecasted sales and profits primarily due
to foreign exchange rates, we performed an additional assessment of impairment of goodwill for the new Mexican reporting
unit. We used discount rates and terminal growth rates of 8.5% and 3%, respectively, to calculate the present value of estimated
future cash flows. We then compared the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the historical carrying value (including
allocated assets and liabilities of certain shared and Corporate functions), and determined that the fair value of the reporting
unit was less than the carrying value in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. With the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist,
we estimated the fair value of the assets and liabilities of this reporting unit in order to determine the implied fair value of
goodwill. We recognized an impairment charge for the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and the carrying
value of goodwill. Accordingly, during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded charges totaling $43.9 million for the
impairment of goodwill.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, in conjunction with our annual impairment testing, we adopted ASU 2017-04,
Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. As a result of further deterioration in forecasted sales and profits, we performed
an additional assessment of impairment of goodwill for the new Mexican reporting unit. We used discount rates and terminal
growth rates of 9.0% and 3%, respectively, to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows. We then compared
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the historical carrying value (including allocated assets and liabilities of certain
shared and Corporate functions), and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value in
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. With the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, we estimated the fair value of the
reporting unit. We recognized an impairment charge of $15.8 million, equal to the difference between the carrying value and
estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The remaining goodwill balance of the Mexican reporting unit as of May 28, 2017
was $118.5 million.

In fiscal 2017, due to declining sales of certain brands, we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite
lived intangibles of those brands. During fiscal 2017, we recognized impairment charges of $7.1 million for our Del Monte®
brand and $5.5 million for our Aylmer® brand in our International segment. We also recognized impairment charges of $67.1
million for our Chef Boyardee® brand and $1.1 million for our Fiddle Faddle® brand in our Grocery & Snacks segment.

In fiscal 2016, we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles. During fiscal 2016,

we recognized impairment charges of $50.1 million in our Grocery & Snacks segment for our Chef Boyardee® brand.

In fiscal 2015, we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles. During fiscal 2015,

we recognized impairment charges of $4.8 million in our Grocery & Snacks segment for our Poppycock® brand.

Because forecasted sales and profits for a reporting unit in our divested Private Brands business continued to fall below
our expectations relative to our previous projections throughout fiscal 2015, we performed quantitative analyses of goodwill
on this Private Brands segment reporting unit in fiscal 2015. We recorded charges totaling $20.9 million for the impairment
of goodwill in the portion of the business we retained from the Private Brands segment that is now included in the Grocery
& Snacks segment. 

We completed the divestiture of our Private Brands operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2016, we
recognized charges of $1.92 billion ($1.44 billion after-tax) to write-down the goodwill and long-lived assets of the Private
Brands business. 

During fiscal 2015, we recognized impairment charges of $1.51 billion and $43.9 million for goodwill and indefinite-
lived intangibles, respectively, in our Private Brands business. During fiscal 2015, we also recognized a charge of $13.7 million
in our Private Brands business for the impairment of certain long-lived assets. The impairment was measured based upon an
estimated disposal value for the related production facility. These impairment charges are included in discontinued operations.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of
promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP.
On July 9, 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year. Based on the
FASB's ASU, we will apply the new revenue standard in our fiscal year 2019. Early adoption in our fiscal year 2018 is
permitted. We are in the process of documenting the impact of the guidance on our current accounting policies and practices
in order to identify material differences, if any, that would result from applying the new requirements to our revenue contracts.
We continue to make progress on our revenue recognition review and are also in the process of evaluating the impact, if any,
on changes to our business processes, systems, and controls to support recognition and disclosure requirements under the new
guidance. We continue to evaluate the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory, which requires an entity to measure inventory within the scope
at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of
business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The effective date for the standard is
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect ASU 2015-11 to have a
material impact to our financial statements. The standard is to be applied prospectively. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities, which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure
of financial instruments. The effective date for this standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017. Early
adoption is not permitted except for certain provisions. We do not expect ASU 2016-01 to have a material impact to our
consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued its final lease accounting standard, FASB Accounting Standard Codification ("ASC")
Topic 842, Leases, which requires lessees to reflect most leases on their balance sheet as assets and obligations. The effective
date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating
the effect that ASC 842 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The standard is to be applied
under the modified retrospective method, with elective reliefs, which requires application of the new guidance for all periods
presented.

40

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and
Cash Payments, which clarifies how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement
of cash flows. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is
permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial
statements.

In  November  2016,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  2016-18,  Statement  of  Cash  Flows:  Restricted  Cash,  which  provides
amendments to current guidance to address the classifications and presentation of changes in restricted cash in the statement
of cash flows. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is
permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial
statements.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations: Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which
provides a new framework for determining whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of
assets or businesses. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption
is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial
statements.

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension
Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which requires companies to present the service cost component of net
benefit cost in the same line items in which they report compensation cost. Companies will present all other components of
net benefit cost outside operating income, if this subtotal is presented. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect ASU 2017-07 to have a material impact
to our financial statements.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The principal market risks affecting us during fiscal 2017 and 2016 were exposures to price fluctuations of commodity

and energy inputs, interest rates, and foreign currencies.

Commodity Market Risk

We purchase commodity inputs such as wheat, corn, oats, soybean meal, soybean oil, meat, dairy products, nuts, sugar,
natural gas, electricity, and packaging materials to be used in our operations. These commodities are subject to price fluctuations
that may create price risk. We enter into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or
derivative instruments. We have policies governing the hedging instruments our businesses may use. These policies include
limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of our businesses. We also monitor the amount of associated counter-party credit
risk for all non-exchange-traded transactions. 

Interest Rate Risk

We may use interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate changes on the fair value of our existing debt as well

as the forecasted interest payments for the anticipated issuance of debt. 

As of May 28, 2017 and May 29, 2016, the fair value of our long term debt (including current installments) was estimated
at $3.32 billion and $5.85 billion, respectively, based on current market rates.  As of May 28, 2017 and May 29, 2016, a 1%
increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $197.8 million and $249.5
million, respectively, while a 1% decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately
$219.4 million and $275.0 million, respectively.

Foreign Currency Risk

In order to reduce exposures for our processing activities related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we may
enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency
for certain of our operations. This activity primarily relates to economically hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing
inventory and capital equipment, sales of finished goods, and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.

41

Value-at-Risk (VaR)

We employ various tools to monitor our derivative risk, including value-at-risk ("VaR") models. We perform simulations
using historical data to estimate potential losses in the fair value of current derivative positions. We use price and volatility
information for the prior 90 days in the calculation of VaR that is used to monitor our daily risk. The purpose of this measurement
is to provide a single view of the potential risk of loss associated with derivative positions at a given point in time based on
recent changes in market prices. Our model uses a 95% confidence level. Accordingly, in any given one day time period,
losses greater than the amounts included in the table below are expected to occur only 5% of the time. We include commodity
swaps, futures, and options and foreign exchange forwards, swaps, and options in this calculation. The following table provides
an overview of our average daily VaR for our energy, agriculture, and foreign exchange positions (including discontinued
operations) for fiscal 2017 and 2016.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2017, May 29, 2016, and May 31, 2015 

(columnar dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Fiscal Year — The fiscal year of Conagra Brands, Inc. ("Conagra Brands", "Company", "we", "us", or "our") ends the
last Sunday in May. The fiscal years for the consolidated financial statements presented consist of 52-week periods for fiscal
years 2017 and 2016, and a 53-week period for fiscal year 2015.

Basis of Consolidation — The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Conagra Brands, Inc. and all
majority-owned subsidiaries. In addition, the accounts of all variable interest entities for which we have been determined to
be the primary beneficiary are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date such determination is made.
All significant intercompany investments, accounts, and transactions have been eliminated. 

On November 9, 2016, the Company completed the previously announced spinoff (the "Spinoff") of Lamb Weston
Holdings, Inc. ("Lamb Weston") through a distribution of 100% of the Company's interest in Lamb Weston to holders of shares
of the Company's common stock as of November 1, 2016. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
("U.S. GAAP"), the financial position and results of operations of the Lamb Weston operations are presented as discontinued
operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented (see
Note 6 for additional discussion).

Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates — The investments in, and the operating results of, 50%-or-less-owned entities
not required to be consolidated are included in the consolidated financial statements on the basis of the equity method of
accounting or the cost method of accounting, depending on specific facts and circumstances.

We  review  our  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  business
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investments may not be fully recoverable. Evidence of a loss in value
that is other than temporary includes, but is not limited to, the absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the
investment, the inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity which would justify the carrying amount of the
investment,  or,  where  applicable,  estimated  sales  proceeds  which  are  insufficient  to  recover  the  carrying  amount  of  the
investment. Management's assessment as to whether any decline in value is other than temporary is based on our ability and
intent to hold the investment and whether evidence indicating the carrying value of the investment is recoverable within a
reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary. Management generally considers our investments in equity
method investees to be strategic long-term investments. Therefore, management completes its assessments with a long-term
viewpoint. If the fair value of the investment is determined to be less than the carrying value and the decline in value is
considered to be other than temporary, an appropriate write-down is recorded based on the excess of the carrying value over
the best estimate of fair value of the investment.

Cash and Cash Equivalents — Cash and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less
at the date of acquisition, including short-term time deposits and government agency and corporate obligations, are classified
as cash and cash equivalents.

Inventories — We use the lower of cost (determined using the first-in, first-out method) or market for valuing inventories.

Property, Plant and Equipment — Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation has been calculated

using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective classes of assets as follows:

Land improvements. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

We review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability of an asset considered "held-and-used" is

(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)

determined by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from
the use of the asset. If the carrying amount is greater than the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the
asset, the asset's carrying amount is reduced to its estimated fair value. An asset considered "held-for-sale" is reported at the
lower of the asset's carrying amount or fair value. 

Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets — Goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite
lives (e.g., brands or trademarks) are not amortized and are tested annually for impairment of value and whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired. A significant amount of judgment is
involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include deterioration in general
economic conditions, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have negative
effects on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. The
fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill and
other intangible assets.

In testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence
of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (more than 50%) that the estimated fair value
of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an
impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform a quantitative impairment test, otherwise no further
analysis is required. We also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative
impairment test.

Under the goodwill qualitative assessment, various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value
of a reporting unit are identified (similar to impairment indicators above). Furthermore, management considers the results of
the most recent quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital
between the current and prior years for each reporting unit.

Under the goodwill quantitative impairment test, the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value
of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. We estimate the fair value using level 3 inputs as defined by
the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 20 for the definition of the levels in the fair value hierarchy. The inputs used to calculate
the fair value include a number of subjective factors, such as estimates of future cash flows, estimates of our future cost
structure, discount rates for our estimated cash flows, required level of working capital, assumed terminal value, and time
horizon of cash flow forecasts. Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeded its
fair value, we completed a second step of the test to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss, if any, to be recognized.
In the second step, we estimated an implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill by allocating the fair value of the
reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets).  The
impairment loss was equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill.
Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize an
impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the reporting unit.

In assessing other intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment, we have the option to perform a qualitative
assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than
not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that it is not more likely
than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, then we are not required to perform
any additional tests for assessing intangible assets for impairment. However, if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform
the qualitative assessment, then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test that involves a comparison of the
estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair
value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

In fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for other intangible assets not subject
to amortization.  The estimates of fair value of intangible assets not subject to amortization are determined using a "relief from
royalty" methodology, which is used in estimating the fair value of our brands/trademarks. Discount rate assumptions are
based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets.
Also subject to judgment are assumptions about royalty rates.

(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)

Identifiable  intangible  assets  with  definite  lives  (e.g.,  licensing  arrangements  with  contractual  lives  or  customer
relationships)  are  amortized  over  their  estimated  useful  lives  and  tested  for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired. Identifiable intangible assets with definite lives are
evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used in evaluating elements of property, plant and equipment. If
impaired, the asset is written down to its fair value. 

Refer to Note 9 for discussion of the impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets in fiscal 2017, 2016,

and 2015.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments — Unless otherwise specified, we believe the carrying value of financial instruments

approximates their fair value.

Environmental Liabilities — Environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred
and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated. We use third-party specialists to assist management in appropriately
measuring the obligations associated with environmental liabilities. Such liabilities are adjusted as new information develops
or circumstances change. We do not discount our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is
not fixed or readily determinable. Management's estimate of our potential liability is independent of any potential recovery
of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements. We do not reduce our environmental liabilities for potential insurance
recoveries.

Employment-Related Benefits — Employment-related benefits associated with pensions, postretirement health care
benefits, and workers' compensation are expensed as such obligations are incurred. The recognition of expense is impacted
by estimates made by management, such as discount rates used to value these liabilities, future health care costs, and employee
accidents incurred but not yet reported. We use third-party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the
obligations associated with employment-related benefits.

We recognize changes in the fair value of pension plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the
greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation ("the corridor") in current period
expense annually as of our measurement date, which is our fiscal year-end, or when measurement is required otherwise under
generally accepted accounting principles.

Revenue Recognition — Revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss are transferred to customers upon delivery
based on terms of sale and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue is recognized as the net amount to be received after
deducting estimated amounts for discounts, trade allowances, and returns of damaged and out-of-date products. 

Shipping and Handling — Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are included in net sales.

Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold.

Marketing Costs — We promote our products with advertising, consumer incentives, and trade promotions. Such programs
include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, and volume-based incentives. Advertising costs are expensed as
incurred. Consumer incentives and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction of revenue or as a component of
cost of goods sold based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of the period, based
principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. Advertising and promotion expenses totaled $328.3 million, $347.2
million, and $312.6 million in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and are included in selling, general and administrative
expenses.

Research and Development — We incurred expenses of $44.6 million, $59.6 million, and $63.1 million for research and

development activities in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.

Comprehensive  Income  —  Comprehensive  income  includes  net  income,  currency  translation  adjustments,  certain
derivative-related activity, changes in the value of available-for-sale investments, and changes in prior service cost and net
actuarial gains (losses) from pension (for amounts not in excess of the 10% "corridor") and postretirement health care plans.
We generally deem our foreign investments to be essentially permanent in nature and we do not provide for taxes on currency
translation adjustments arising from converting the investment denominated in a foreign currency to U.S. dollars. When we
determine that a foreign investment, as well as undistributed earnings, are no longer permanent in nature, estimated taxes are
provided for the related deferred tax liability (asset), if any, resulting from currency translation adjustments.

general and administrative expenses.

Business Combinations — We use the acquisition method in accounting for acquired businesses. Under the acquisition
method, our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)

Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2017, May 29, 2016, and May 31, 2015

(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)

The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition.
Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.

Reclassifications and other changes — Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year

presentation. 

Use of Estimates — Preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues, and expenses as reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from these
estimates.

Accounting Changes — In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2017-04,
Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by
eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Step 2 measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied
fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Under the amendments in ASU 2017-04,
an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its
fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The
updated guidance required a prospective adoption. Early adoption was permitted for goodwill impairment tests performed on
testing dates after January 1, 2017. We elected to adopt this ASU in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, in conjunction with our
annual review for impairment. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which
simplifies the accounting for income taxes, among other changes, related to stock-based compensation. We elected to adopt
this ASU as of the beginning of fiscal 2017. Starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we recognized all excess tax benefits
and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit as a discrete event. An income tax benefit of approximately $19.4 million
was recognized in fiscal 2017 as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09. The treatment of forfeitures has changed as we
have elected to discontinue our past process of estimating the number of forfeitures and now account for forfeitures as they
occur. As such, we recognized an increase to retained earnings of $3.9 million, net of tax. We have elected to present the cash
flow statement on a retrospective transition method and prior periods have been adjusted to present the excess tax benefits as
part of cash flows from operating activities. This resulted in an increase in cash flows from operating activities and a decrease
in cash flows from financing activities of $51.8 million and $24.0 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.

In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07, Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset
Value per Share (or its Equivalent), which provides new guidance requiring investments measured at net asset value ("NAV"),
as a practical expedient for fair value, to be excluded from the fair value hierarchy. We adopted this ASU retrospectively in
fiscal 2017 and restated the fiscal 2016 fair value of pension plan asset table in Note 19.  The adoption of this guidance did
not impact our results of operations or financial position.

 Recently Issued Accounting Standards — In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of
promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP.
On July 9, 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year. Based on the
FASB’s ASU, we will apply the new revenue standard in our fiscal year 2019. Early adoption in our fiscal year 2018 is
permitted. We are in the process of documenting the impact of the guidance on our current accounting policies and practices
in order to identify material differences, if any, that would result from applying the new requirements to our revenue contracts.
We continue to make progress on our revenue recognition review and are also in the process of evaluating the impact, if any,
on changes to our business processes, systems, and controls to support recognition and disclosure requirements under the new
guidance. We continue to evaluate the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures.

 In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory, which requires an entity to measure inventory within the scope
at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of
business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The effective date for the standard is
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect ASU 2015-11 to have a
material impact to our financial statements. The standard is to be applied prospectively.

Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2017, May 29, 2016, and May 31, 2015

(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)

In January 2016, the FASB issued 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities, which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure
of financial instruments. The effective date for this standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017. Early
adoption is not permitted except for certain provisions. We do not expect ASU 2016-01 to have a material impact to our
consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued its final lease accounting standard, FASB Accounting Standard Codification ("ASC")
Topic 842, Leases, which requires lessees to reflect most leases on their balance sheet as assets and obligations. The effective
date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating
the effect that ASC 842 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The standard is to be applied
under the modified retrospective method, with elective reliefs, which requires application of the new guidance for all periods
presented.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and
Cash Payments, which clarifies how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement
of cash flows. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is
permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial
statements.

In  November  2016,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  2016-18,  Statement  of  Cash  Flows:  Restricted  Cash,  which  provides
amendments to current guidance to address the classifications and presentation of changes in restricted cash in the statement
of cash flows. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is
permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial
statements.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations: Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which
provides a new framework for determining whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of
assets or businesses. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption
is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial
statements.

In  March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension
Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which requires companies to present the service cost component of net
benefit cost in the same line items in which they report compensation cost. Companies will present all other components of
net benefit cost outside operating income, if this subtotal is presented. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect ASU 2017-07 to have a material impact
to our financial statements.

2. ACQUISITIONS

In April 2017, we acquired protein-based snacking businesses Thanasi Foods LLC, maker of Duke’s® meat snacks, and
BIGS LLC, maker of BIGS® seeds, for $217.6 million in cash, net of cash acquired, subject to a working capital adjustment.
Approximately $134.6 million has been classified as goodwill pending determination of the final purchase price allocation,
of which $70.9 million is deductible for income tax purposes. Approximately $81.2 million of the purchase price has been
allocated to other intangible assets. These businesses are included in the Grocery & Snacks segment.  

In September 2016, we acquired the assets of Frontera Foods, Inc. and Red Fork LLC., including the Frontera®, Red
Fork®, and Salpica® brands. These businesses make authentic, gourmet Mexican food products and contemporary American
cooking sauces. We acquired the business for $108.1 million in cash, net of cash acquired. Approximately $39.7 million has
been classified as goodwill and $66.7 million has been classified as other intangible assets. The amount allocated to goodwill
is deductible for tax purposes. These businesses are reflected principally within the Grocery & Snacks segment, and to a lesser
extent within the Refrigerated & Frozen and International segments. 

The Frontera acquisition and the Thanasi acquisition collectively contributed $36.5 million to net sales during fiscal 2017.

In May 2015, we acquired Blake's All Natural Foods, a family-owned company specializing in all natural and organic
frozen meals, including pot pies, casseroles, pasta dishes, and other entrees, for $20.7 million in cash net of cash acquired.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)

Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2017, May 29, 2016, and May 31, 2015

(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)

Approximately $20.0 million of the purchase price has been classified as goodwill. The goodwill is deductible for income tax
purposes. This business is included in the Refrigerated & Frozen segment. 

For each of these acquisitions, the amounts allocated to goodwill were primarily attributable to anticipated synergies,

product portfolios, and other intangibles that do not qualify for separate recognition.

Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in these acquisitions were recorded

at their respective estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.

3. RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES

Supply Chain and Administrative Efficiency Plan 

We  previously  announced  a  plan  for  the  integration  and  restructuring  of  the  operations  of  Ralcorp  Holdings,  Inc.
("Ralcorp"), optimization of the entire Company's supply chain network, manufacturing assets, and dry distribution and mixing
centers, and improvement of selling, general and administrative effectiveness and efficiencies, which we refer to as the Supply
Chain and Administrative Efficiency Plan (the "SCAE Plan"). In the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we announced plans to
realize  efficiency  benefits  through  a  combination  of  reductions  in  selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses  and
enhancements to trade spend processes and tools, which plans were included as part of the SCAE Plan. Although the divestiture
of the Private Brands business was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, resulting in the sale of substantially all the
Ralcorp operations, we will continue to implement the SCAE Plan, including work related to optimizing our supply chain
network, the pursuit of cost reductions through our selling, general and administrative functions, enhancements to trade spend
processes and tools, and productivity improvements. 

Although we remain unable to make good faith estimates relating to the entire SCAE Plan, we are reporting on actions
initiated through the end of fiscal 2017, including the estimated amounts or range of amounts for each major type of costs
expected to be incurred, and the charges that have resulted or will result in cash outflows. As of May 28, 2017, our Board of
Directors has approved the incurrence of up to $880.5 million of expenses in connection with the SCAE Plan, including
expenses allocated for the Private Brands and Lamb Weston operations. We have incurred or expect to incur approximately
$446.2 million of charges ($299.2 million of cash charges and $147.0 million of non-cash charges) for actions identified to
date under the SCAE Plan related to our continuing operations. We recognized charges of $63.6 million, $281.8 million, and
$47.7 million in relation to the SCAE Plan related to our continuing operations in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
We expect to incur costs related to the SCAE Plan over a multi-year period.

Included in the above results are $285.5 million of charges that have resulted or will result in cash outflows and $136.8
million in non-cash charges. Not included in the above table are $130.2 million of pre-tax expenses ($84.5 million of cash
charges and $45.7 million of non-cash charges) related to the Private Brands operations which we sold in the third quarter of
fiscal 2016 and $2.1 million of pre-tax expenses (all resulting in cash charges) related to Lamb Weston.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we entered into a series of related transactions in which we exchanged a warehouse
we owned in Indiana for two buildings and parcels of land that we leased as part of our Omaha corporate offices. Concurrent
with the asset exchange, leases on the two Omaha corporate buildings were canceled. We have recognized aggregate charges
of $55.6 million for the early termination of these leases. We also entered into a lease for the warehouse in Indiana and we
recorded a financing lease obligation of $74.2 million.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we repaid the remaining principal balance of $224.8 million of our 5.819% senior
notes due 2017 and $248.2 million principal amount of our 7.0% senior notes due 2019, in each case prior to maturity, resulting
in a net loss on early retirement of debt of $32.7 million.

In connection with the Spinoff of Lamb Weston (see Note 6), Lamb Weston issued to us $1.54 billion aggregate principal
amount of senior notes (the "Lamb Weston notes"). On November 9, 2016, we exchanged the Lamb Weston notes for $250.2

banks prior to the Spinoff.  Following the exchange, we cancelled the Conagra notes. These actions resulted in a net loss of
$60.6 million as a cost of early retirement of debt. 

During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we repaid the entire principal balance of $550.0 million of our floating rate notes

on the maturity date of July 21, 2016.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we repurchased $560.3 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due
2043, $341.8 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2039, $139.9 million aggregate principal amount of
senior notes due 2019, $110.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2026, $85.0 million aggregate principal
amount of senior notes due 2020, and $163.0 million of aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2023, in each case
prior to maturity in a tender offer, resulting in a net loss of $23.9 million as a cost of early retirement of debt. 

During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we repaid the entire principal balance of $750.0 million of our 1.30% senior notes
on the maturity date of January 25, 2016. The repayment was primarily funded through the issuance of term loans totaling
$600.0 million, which were repaid in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 with the proceeds from the divestiture of our Private
Brands business.

See Note 6 for repayment of senior notes issued by Ralcorp in an aggregate principal amount of $33.9 million in the third

quarter of fiscal 2016.

During fiscal 2015, we repurchased $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in 2023, $200.0 million
aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2043, $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2019,
$25.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2018, and $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior
notes due 2017, in each case prior to maturity in a tender offer, resulting in a net loss of $16.3 million as a cost of early

During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we repaid the remaining borrowings of our unsecured term loan facility (the "Term
Loan Facility") of $900.0 million (with interest rate at LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum), prior to maturity, resulting in a loss
of $8.3 million as a cost of early retirement of debt. The Term Loan Facility was terminated after repayment.

During fiscal 2015, we issued $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes (LIBOR plus 0.37% per

annum) due July 21, 2016. The notes were repaid on maturity.

5. CREDIT FACILITIES AND BORROWINGS

On February 16, 2017, we entered into a revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of financial
institutions that provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility in a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at
any one time of $1.25 billion (subject to increase to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1.75 billion with the consent
of the lenders). This revolving credit facility matures on February 16, 2022. As of May 28, 2017, there were no outstanding
borrowings under the revolving credit facility.

Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2017, May 29, 2016, and May 31, 2015

(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)

The  Credit  Agreement  contains  events  of  default  customary  for  unsecured  investment  grade  credit  facilities  with
corresponding grace periods. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for unsecured
investment grade credit facilities of this type. It generally requires our ratio of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization) to interest expense to be not less than 3.0 to 1.0 and our ratio of funded debt to EBITDA to be
not greater than 3.75 to 1.0 (provided that such ratio may be increased at the option of the Company in connection with a
material transaction), with each ratio to be calculated on a rolling four-quarter basis. As of May 28, 2017, we were in compliance
with all financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. 

The revolving credit facility provided for under the Credit Agreement replaced our existing revolving credit facility under

that certain prior revolving credit agreement, dated as of September 14, 2011, with a syndicate of financial institutions.

We finance our short-term liquidity needs with bank borrowings, commercial paper borrowings, and bankers' acceptances.
As of May 28, 2017, we had $26.2 million outstanding under our commercial paper program at an average weighted interest
rate of 1.23%. As of May 29, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program. 

6. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND OTHER DIVESTITURES

Lamb Weston Spinoff

On November 9, 2016, we completed the Spinoff of our Lamb Weston business.  As of such date, we did not beneficially
own any equity interest in Lamb Weston and no longer consolidated Lamb Weston into our financial results. We reflected the
results of this business as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of the Lamb Weston
business have been reclassified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations within our Consolidated Balance Sheets
for the period presented prior to the Spinoff.

discontinued operations, were as follows:

In connection with the Spinoff, total assets of $2.28 billion and total liabilities of $2.98 billion (including debt of $2.46
billion) were transferred to Lamb Weston. As part of the consideration for the Spinoff, the Company received a cash payment
from Lamb Weston in the amount of $823.5 million. See Note 4 for discussion of the debt-for-debt exchange related to the
Spinoff.

Private Brands Operations

On February 1, 2016, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2015, we completed the
disposition of our Private Brands operations to TreeHouse Foods, Inc. ("Treehouse") for $2.6 billion in cash on a debt-free
basis. 

As a result of the disposition, we recognized a pre-tax charge of $1.92 billion ($1.44 billion after-tax) in fiscal 2016 to
write-down the goodwill and long-lived assets to the final sales price, less costs to sell, and to recognize the final loss of the
Private Brands business. We reflected the results of this business as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The
assets and liabilities of the discontinued business have been reclassified as assets and liabilities held for sale within our
Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented prior to the divestiture.

In fiscal 2016, we repaid senior notes issued by Ralcorp in an aggregate principal amount of $33.9 million, consisting of
4.95% senior notes due August 15, 2020 in an aggregate principal amount of $17.2 million (with an effective interest rate of
2.83%) and 6.625% senior notes due August 15, 2039 in total an aggregate principal amount of $16.7 million (with an effective
interest rate of 4.82%), in each case, prior to maturity, resulting in a loss $5.4 million as a cost of early retirement of debt,
which is reflected in discontinued operations.

In connection with classifying the Private Brands operations as assets held for sale, we recognized, in fiscal 2016, a
deferred tax asset of $1.54 billion on the capital loss of our investment in this business. A partial valuation allowance is recorded
as we have not met the accounting requirements for recognition of a benefit at this time. In fiscal 2016, we recognized an

income tax benefit of $20.7 million, resulting primarily from prior period capital gains. In addition, we released $147.3 million
of the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 due to the Spicetec and JM Swank dispositions, $150.4 million
of the valuation allowance in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 due to the Spinoff of our Lamb Weston business, and $91.3
million of the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 due to the impending sale of our Wesson® oil business.

In fiscal 2015, we recorded a $1.51 billion impairment of goodwill and $57.6 million of impairment charges to write-

down various brands and fixed assets, which are reflected in discontinued operations.

7. INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES

In the first quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company, Cargill, and CHS, completed the formation of Ardent Mills. In connection
with the formation, we contributed all of the assets of ConAgra Mills, our milling operations, including $49.0 million of cash,
to Ardent Mills, we received a 44% ownership interest in Ardent Mills, and Ardent Mills distributed $391.4 million in cash
to us as a return of capital. The contribution of the assets of ConAgra Mills in exchange for a non-controlling interest in the
newly formed joint venture was required to be accounted for at fair value, and accordingly, we recognized a gain of $625.6
million ($379.6 million after-tax) in fiscal 2015 in income from discontinued operations, to reflect the excess of the fair value
of our interest over its carrying value at the time of the transfer. As part of the formation of Ardent Mills, in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2014, pursuant to an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, we sold three flour milling facilities to Miller
Milling Company LLC for $163.0 million. We received the cash proceeds from the sale of these flour milling facilities in the
first quarter of fiscal 2015. In the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we used the net cash proceeds from the Ardent Mills transaction

(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)

to repay debt. The operating results of our legacy milling business, including the disposition of three mills aforementioned,
are included as discontinued operations within our Consolidated Statement of Operations. 

We recognized the 44% ownership interest in Ardent Mills at fair value, as of the date of the formation of the joint venture.
We now recognize our proportionate share of the earnings of Ardent Mills under the equity method of accounting within
results of continuing operations. Due to differences in fiscal reporting periods, we recognized the equity method earnings on
a lag of approximately one month; and as a result, we recognized only 11 months of earnings from Ardent Mills in fiscal 2015.
The carrying value of our Ardent Mills equity method investment at the end of fiscal 2017 and 2016 was $714.7 million and
$732.8 million, respectively. 

The total carrying value of our equity method investments at the end of fiscal 2017 and 2016 was $741.3 million and

$755.7 million, respectively. These amounts are included in Other assets.

In fiscal 2017, we had purchases from our equity method investees of $41.8 million. Total dividends received from

equity method investments in fiscal 2017 were $68.2 million.

In fiscal 2016, we had sales to and purchases from our equity method investees of $1.6 million and $61.2 million,

respectively. Total dividends received from equity method investments in fiscal 2016 were $40.4 million.

In fiscal 2015, we had sales to and purchases from our equity method investees of $1.7 million and $57.3 million,

respectively. Total dividends received from equity method investments in fiscal 2015 were $79.3 million.

We entered into transition services agreements in connection with the Ardent Mills formation and recognized $0.1

million, $9.7 million, and $14.1 million of income for the performance of transition services during fiscal 2017, 2016, and
2015, respectively, classified within Selling, general and administrative expenses.

8. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

Variable Interest Entities Not Consolidated

We have variable interests in certain other entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities, but for which

we are not the primary beneficiary. We do not consolidate the financial statements of these entities.

We lease certain office buildings from entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities. The lease agreements
with these entities include fixed-price purchase options for the assets being leased. The lease agreements also contain contingent
put options (the "lease put options") that allow the lessors to require us to purchase the buildings at the greater of original
construction cost, or fair market value, without a lease agreement in place (the "put price") in certain limited circumstances.
As a result of substantial impairment charges related to our divested Private Brands operations, these lease put options are
exercisable now and remain exercisable until generally 30 days after the end of the respective lease agreements. We are
amortizing the difference between the estimated put price and the estimated fair value (without a lease agreement in place)
of each respective property over the remaining respective lease term within selling, general and administrative expenses. As
of May 28, 2017, the estimated amount by which the put prices exceeded the fair values of the related properties was $51.8
million, of which we have accrued $8.4 million. As these buildings are worth considerably more when under lease agreements
than when vacant, we may be able to mitigate some, or all, of the financial exposure created by the put options by maintaining
active lease agreements and/or by subleasing the buildings to credit worthy tenants. We do not expect to ultimately incur
material financial losses as a result of the potential exercise of the lease put options by the lessors. During fiscal 2017, one of
these lease agreements expired. As a result of this expiration, we reversed the applicable accrual and recognized a benefit of
$6.7 million in selling, general and administrative expenses. These leases are accounted for as operating leases, and accordingly,
there are no material assets or liabilities, other than the accrued portion of the put price, associated with these entities included
in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most
significantly impact the economic performance of these entities. In making this determination, we have considered, among
other items, the terms of the lease agreements, the expected remaining useful lives of the assets leased, and the capital structure
of the lessor entities.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, in anticipation of the Spinoff, we changed our reporting segments.  In accordance with
applicable accounting guidance, we were required to determine new reporting units at a lower level (at the operating segment
or one level lower, as applicable). When such a determination was made, we were required to perform a goodwill impairment
analysis for each of the new reporting units.

We performed an assessment of impairment of goodwill for the new Canadian reporting unit within the new International
reporting segment. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates
regarding our future plans and future industry and economic conditions. We estimated the future cash flows of the Canadian
reporting unit and calculated the net present value of those estimated cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate, in order
to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit from the perspective of a market participant. We used discount rates and
terminal growth rates of 7.5% and 2%, respectively, to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows. We then
compared the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the historical carrying value (including allocated assets and liabilities
of certain shared and Corporate functions), and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying
value in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. With the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, we estimated the fair value
of the assets and liabilities of this reporting unit in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. We recognized an
impairment charge for the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and the carrying value of goodwill. Accordingly,
during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded charges totaling $139.2 million for the impairment of goodwill. 

As part of the assessment of the fair value of each asset and liability within the Canadian reporting unit, with the assistance
of the third-party valuation specialist, we estimated the fair value of our Canadian Del Monte® brand to be less than its carrying
value. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we recognized an impairment charge of $24.4 million to write-
down the intangible asset to its estimated fair value.

We also performed an assessment of impairment of goodwill for the new Mexican reporting unit within the International
reporting segment using similar methods to those described above. We used discount rates and terminal growth rates of 8.5%
and 3%, respectively, to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows. We determined that the estimated fair value

(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)

of this reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of its net assets by approximately 5%.  Accordingly, we did not recognize
an impairment of the goodwill in the Mexican reporting unit.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, as a result of further deterioration in forecasted sales and profits primarily due
to foreign exchange rates, we performed an additional assessment of impairment of goodwill for the new Mexican reporting
unit. We used discount rates and terminal growth rates of 8.5% and 3%, respectively, to calculate the present value of estimated
future cash flows. We then compared the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the historical carrying value (including
allocated assets and liabilities of certain shared and Corporate functions), and determined that the fair value of the reporting
unit was less than the carrying value in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. With the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist,
we estimated the fair value of the assets and liabilities of this reporting unit in order to determine the implied fair value of
goodwill. We recognized an impairment charge for the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and the carrying
value of goodwill. Accordingly, during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded charges totaling $43.9 million for the
impairment of goodwill.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, in conjunction with our annual impairment testing, we adopted ASU 2017-04,
Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. As a result of further deterioration in forecasted sales and profits, we performed
an additional assessment of impairment of goodwill for the new Mexican reporting unit. We used discount rates and terminal
growth rates of 9.0% and 3%, respectively, to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows. We then compared
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the historical carrying value (including allocated assets and liabilities of certain
shared and Corporate functions), and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value in
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. With the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, we estimated the fair value of the
reporting unit. We recognized an impairment charge of $15.8 million, equal to the difference between the carrying value and
estimated fair value of the reporting unit. 

In fiscal 2017, due to declining sales of certain brands, we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite
lived intangibles of those brands. During fiscal 2017, we recognized impairment charges of $7.1 million for our Del Monte®
brand and $5.5 million for our Aylmer® brand in our International segment. We also recognized impairment charges of $67.1
million for our Chef Boyardee® brand and $1.1 million for our Fiddle Faddle® brand in our Grocery & Snacks segment. 

During fiscal 2015, we recorded charges totaling $20.9 million for the impairment of goodwill in the portion of the

business we retained from the divested Private Brands operations that is now included in the Grocery & Snacks segment.

During fiscal 2016 and 2015, we also elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles.
During fiscal 2016, we recognized impairment charges of $50.1 million in our Grocery & Snacks segment for our Chef
Boyardee® brand. During fiscal 2015, we recognized impairment charges of $4.8 million in our Grocery & Snacks segment
for our Poppycock® brand.   

See Note 6 for a discussion of impairments related to discontinued operations.

Amortizing intangible assets, carrying a remaining weighted average life of approximately 15 years, are principally
composed of customer relationships, licensing arrangements, and intellectual property. For fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, we
recognized amortization expense of $33.6 million, $34.6 million, and $26.3 million, respectively. Based on amortizing assets
recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 28, 2017, amortization expense is estimated to average $33.7 million
for each of the next five years, with a high expense of $35.0 million in fiscal year 2018 and decreasing to a low expense of
$33.3 million in fiscal year 2022.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we entered into an agreement for the use of certain intellectual property and recorded
an amortizing intangible asset of $92.8 million, for which cash payments of $14.9 million and $10.4 million were made in
the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. Remaining payments will be made over a five-year period.

10. EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE

Basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated on the basis of weighted average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings
(loss) per share is computed on the basis of basic weighted average outstanding common shares adjusted for the dilutive effect
of stock options, restricted stock unit awards, and other dilutive securities.

13. CAPITAL STOCK

The total number of shares we are authorized to issue is 1,218,050,000 shares, which shares may be issued as follows:
1,200,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $5.00 per share; 150,000 shares of Class B Preferred Stock, par value
$50.00 per  share;  250,000 shares  of  Class  C  Preferred  Stock,  par  value  $100.00 per  share;  1,100,000 shares  of  Class D
Preferred Stock, no par value per share; and 16,550,000 shares of Class E Preferred Stock, no par value per share. There were
no preferred shares issued or outstanding as of May 28, 2017.

We have repurchased our shares of common stock from time to time after considering market conditions and in accordance
with repurchase limits authorized by our Board of Directors. In October 2016, our Board of Directors approved a $1.25 billion
increase to our share repurchase authorization. On May 18, 2017, the Board of Directors approved a further increase of $1.0
billion to the share repurchase program. We repurchased 25.1 million shares of our common stock for approximately $1.0
billion and 1.4 million shares of our common stock for approximately $50.0 million in fiscal 2017 and 2015, respectively,
under this program.

14. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

In accordance with stockholder-approved plans, we issue share-based payments under various stock-based compensation
arrangements, including stock options, restricted stock units, cash-settled restricted stock units, performance shares, and other
share-based awards. The shares to be delivered under the plan may consist, in whole or part, of treasury stock or authorized
but unissued stock, not reserved for any other purpose.

On September 19, 2014, the stockholders approved the Conagra Brands 2014 Stock Plan, which authorized the issuance
of up to 30.0 million shares of Conagra Brands common stock as well as certain shares of stock subject to outstanding awards
under predecessor stock plans that expire, lapse, are cancelled, terminated, forfeited or otherwise become unexercisable. At
May 28, 2017, approximately 32.5 million shares were reserved for granting additional options, restricted stock units, cash-
settled restricted stock units, performance shares, or other share-based awards.

In connection with the completion of the Spinoff, the provisions of our existing stock-based compensation arrangements
required adjustments to the number and terms of outstanding stock options, restricted stock units, cash-settled restricted stock
units, performance shares, and other share-based awards to preserve the intrinsic value of the awards immediately before and
after the completion of the Spinoff. The outstanding awards continue to vest over the original vesting periods (typically three
years). Outstanding awards at the time of the Spinoff were converted into awards of the holder’s employer following completion
of the Spinoff. The stock awards held as of November 9, 2016 were adjusted as follows:

•

•

The number of shares of common stock subject to each outstanding stock option was increased and the corresponding
exercise price was decreased to maintain the intrinsic value of each outstanding stock option immediately before and
after the Spinoff. A comparison of the fair value of the outstanding stock option awards immediately before and after
the Spinoff resulted in no incremental expense. 

The number of shares of common stock underlying each outstanding restricted stock unit and performance share,
and the value of each outstanding cash-settled restricted stock was increased to preserve the intrinsic value of such
award immediately prior to the Spinoff. The Company did not record any incremental compensation expense related
to the adjustment of these awards.

All amounts below are of continuing and discontinued operations.

Stock Option Plan

We have stockholder-approved stock option plans that provide for granting of options to employees for the purchase of
common stock at prices equal to the fair value at the date of grant. Options become exercisable under various vesting schedules
(typically three years) and generally expire seven to ten years after the date of grant.

The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the

following weighted average assumptions for stock options granted:

Expected volatility (%) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Dividend yield (%). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The expected volatility is based on the historical market volatility of our stock over the expected life of the stock options
granted. The expected life represents the period of time that the awards are expected to be outstanding and is based on the
contractual term of each instrument, taking into account employees' historical exercise and termination behavior.

For stock option activity prior to the Spinoff, the weighted-average exercise prices in the table below reflect the historical
exercise prices. A summary of the option activity as of May 28, 2017 and changes during the fiscal year then ended is presented

We recognize compensation expense using the straight-line method over the requisite service period. During fiscal 2017,
2016, and 2015, the Company granted 1.1 million options, 1.6 million options, and 4.4 million options, respectively, with a
weighted average grant date value of $6.12, $5.08, and $3.36, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was
$128.6 million, $165.6 million, and $69.5 million for fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The closing market price of
our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2017 was $39.03 per share.

Compensation expense for stock option awards totaled $6.2 million, $9.4 million, and $12.4 million for fiscal 2017, 2016,
and 2015, respectively. Included in the compensation expense for stock option awards for fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 was
$0.9 million, $1.0 million, and $1.4 million, respectively, related to stock options granted by a subsidiary in the subsidiary's
shares to the subsidiary's employees. The tax benefit related to the stock option expense for fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 was
$2.4 million, $3.6 million, and $4.8 million, respectively.

At May 28, 2017, we had $6.4 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related

to stock options that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.3 years.

Cash received from option exercises for the fiscal years ended May 28, 2017, May 29, 2016, and May 31, 2015 was $84.4
million, $228.7 million, and $150.2 million, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from option
exercises totaled $19.5 million, $57.3 million, and $26.7 million for fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.

Share Unit Plans

In accordance with stockholder-approved plans, we issue stock under various stock-based compensation arrangements,
including restricted stock units, cash-settled restricted stock units, and other share-based awards ("share units"). These awards

Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2017, May 29, 2016, and May 31, 2015

(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)

generally have requisite service periods of three years. Under each arrangement, stock is issued without direct cost to the
employee. We estimate the fair value of the share units based upon the market price of our stock at the date of grant. Certain
share unit grants do not provide for the payment of dividend equivalents to the participant during the requisite service period
(vesting period). For those grants, the value of the grants is reduced by the net present value of the foregone dividend equivalent
payments. We recognize compensation expense for share unit awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
All cash-settled restricted stock units are marked-to-market and presented within other current and noncurrent liabilities in
our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The compensation expense for our stock-settled share unit awards totaled $18.2 million,
$25.1 million, and $21.0 million for fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The tax benefit related to the stock-settled share
unit  award  compensation  expense  for  fiscal  2017,  2016,  and  2015  was  $7.0  million,  $9.6  million,  and  $8.1  million,
respectively. The compensation expense for our cash-settled share unit awards totaled $20.9 million, $33.9 million, and $29.2
million for fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The tax benefit related to the cash-settled share unit award compensation
expense for fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $8.0 million, $13.0 million, and $11.2 million, respectively. 

For restricted stock unit activity prior to the Spinoff, the weighted-average grate-date fair value in the table below reflects
historical market prices. The following table summarizes the nonvested share units as of May 28, 2017 and changes during

During  fiscal  2017,  2016,  and  2015,  we  granted  0.6  million,  1.0  million,  and  0.9  million  stock-settled  share  units,
respectively, with a weighted average grant date value of $46.79, $43.64, and $31.71, respectively. During fiscal 2017, 2016,
and 2015, we granted 0.4 million, 0.8 million, and 0.9 million cash-settled share units, respectively, with a weighted average
grant date value of $48.07, $44.48, and $30.89, respectively.

The total intrinsic value of stock-settled share units vested was $27.0 million, $48.8 million, and $46.6 million during
fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The total intrinsic value of cash-settled share units vested was $24.0 million, $44.9
million, and $1.6 million during fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.

At May 28, 2017, we had $20.5 million and $17.2 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated
forfeitures, that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years and 1.7 years, related to stock-settled share
unit awards and cash-settled share unit awards, respectively.

Performance-Based Share Plan

Performance shares are granted to selected executives and other key employees with vesting contingent upon meeting
various Company-wide performance goals. The performance goals for the performance period that began in fiscal 2015 and
ends in fiscal 2017 were originally based upon an overarching earnings per share goal (for certain participants) and, for all
participants, (a) our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA") return on capital, and (b)
revenue growth, each measured over the defined performance period, and including the expected results of Lamb Weston. In
connection with the Spinoff, the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors certified the EBITDA return on
capital performance of the Company through the fiscal period that ended immediately prior to the Spinoff. Awards to participants
originally subject to the overarching earnings per share goal remain subject to achievement of such goal.  All other performance
shares granted for the fiscal 2015 through 2017 performance period are subject only to continuing employment of the participant
through the date of payout.

(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)

The performance goal for one-third of the target number of performance shares for the performance period ending in
fiscal 2018 (the "2018 performance period") is based upon an overarching earnings per share goal (for certain participants)
and, for all participants, our fiscal 2016 EBITDA return on capital. Another one-third of the target number of performance
shares granted for the 2018 performance period is based on an overarching earnings per share goal (for certain participants)
and our fiscal 2017 EBITDA return on capital. The fiscal 2017 EBITDA return on capital target, when set, excluded the results
of Lamb Weston. The performance goal for the last one-third of the target number of performance shares granted for the 2018
performance period is expected to be set at the start of fiscal 2018.

The performance goal for one-third of the target number of performance shares for the performance period ending in
fiscal 2019 (the "2019 performance period") is based upon an overarching earnings per share goal (for certain participants)
and our fiscal 2017 EBITDA return on capital. The fiscal 2017 EBITDA return on capital target, when set, excluded the results
of Lamb Weston. The performance goal for the final two-thirds of the target number of performance shares granted for the
2019 performance period is expected to be set at the start of fiscal 2018. 

Awards, if earned, will be paid in shares of our common stock. Subject to limited exceptions set forth in the performance
share plan, any shares earned will be distributed after the end of the performance period, and only if the participant continues
to be employed with the Company through the date of distribution. For awards where performance against the performance
target has not been certified, the value of the performance shares is adjusted based upon the market price of our common stock
and current forecasted performance against the performance targets at the end of each reporting period and amortized as
compensation expense over the vesting period.

For performance share activity prior to the Spinoff, the weighted-average grate-date fair value in the table below reflects
historical market prices. A summary of the activity for performance share awards as of May 28, 2017 and changes during the
fiscal year then ended is presented below:

The compensation expense for our performance share awards totaled $13.3 million, $14.2 million, and $5.7 million for
fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The tax benefit related to the compensation expense for fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015
was $5.1 million, $5.4 million, and $2.2 million, respectively.

The total intrinsic value of share units vested (including shares paid in lieu of dividends) during fiscal 2017, 2016, and

2015 was $2.8 million, $12.7 million, and $13.9 million, respectively.

Based on estimates at May 28, 2017, the Company had $10.4 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net
of estimated forfeitures, related to performance shares that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years.

The liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at May 28, 2017 was $39.3 million, excluding a related liability of $6.0
million for gross interest and penalties. Any associated interest and penalties imposed would affect the tax rate. As of May
29, 2016, our gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $32.6 million, excluding a related liability of $6.4 million for
gross interest and penalties. Interest and penalties recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations was a benefit of
$0.3 million in fiscal 2017, $0.2 million in fiscal 2016 and $0.2 million in fiscal 2015.

The net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at May 28, 2017 and May 29, 2016 that, if recognized, would favorably

impact our effective tax rate was $31.6 million and $17.6 million, respectively. 

We accrue interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense.

We conduct business and file tax returns in numerous countries, states, and local jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue
Service ("IRS") has completed its audit for tax years through fiscal 2015 and all resulting significant items for fiscal 2015 and
prior years have been settled with the IRS. Other major jurisdictions where we conduct business generally have statutes of
limitations ranging from three to five years.

We estimate that it is reasonably possible that the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by up to $18.0
million over the next twelve months due to various Federal, state, and foreign audit settlements and the expiration of statutes
of limitations. Of this amount, approximately $15.6 million would reverse through results of discontinued operations.

The change in the unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended May 28, 2017 was:

We have approximately $25.7 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards ($10.1 million will expire between
fiscal 2018 and 2038 and $15.6 million have no expiration dates) and $10.5 million of Federal net operating loss carryforwards

(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)

which expire in fiscal 2027. Federal capital loss carryforwards related to the Private Brands divestiture of approximately $2.8
billion will expire in fiscal 2021. Included in net deferred tax liabilities are $41.7 million of tax effected state net operating
loss carryforwards which expire in various years ranging from fiscal 2018 to 2037 and $167.6 million of tax effected state
capital loss carryforwards related to the divestiture of Private Brands, the vast majority of which expire in fiscal 2021. Foreign
tax credits of $4.0 million will expire between fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2027. State tax credits of approximately $9.7 million
will expire in various years ranging from fiscal 2018 to 2027. 

We  have  recognized  a  valuation  allowance  for  the  portion  of  the  net  operating  loss  carryforwards,  capital  loss
carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards, and other deferred tax assets we believe are not more likely than not to be realized.
The net change in the valuation allowance for fiscal 2017 was a decrease of $420.1 million. For fiscal 2016 and 2015, changes
in the valuation allowance were an increase of $1.4 billion and a decrease of $1.9 million, respectively. The current year
change principally relates to reducing the valuation allowance on the capital loss carryforward generated from the sale of our
Private Brands operations through revisions to the estimates of the capital gains realized on the sales of the Spicetec and JM
Swank businesses, a tax planning strategy allowing additional utilization of the capital loss, the realization of certain tax
attributes based upon the contract terms of the Private Brands sale and expected capital gains from the planned divestiture of
the  Wesson®  oil  business,  as  well  as  utilization  of  the  estimated  tax  asset  to  offset  capital  gains  on  previously  deferred
intercompany transactions that were triggered by the Spinoff.  Of the total fiscal 2017 change, $150.4 million of the reduction
in the valuation allowance was recorded in stockholders' equity as part of the Spinoff.

As  of  May 28,  2017,  the  cumulative  undistributed  earnings  of  the  Company's  foreign  subsidiaries  amounted  to
approximately $494 million. Those earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly, no U.S. federal
income taxes have been provided thereon. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of U.S. income taxes that would be
incurred in the event that we were to repatriate the cumulative earnings of non-U.S. affiliates and associated companies.
Deferred taxes are provided for earnings of non-U.S. affiliates and associated companies when we determine that such earnings
are no longer indefinitely reinvested.

16. LEASES

We lease certain facilities, land, and transportation equipment under agreements that expire at various dates. Rent expense
under all operating leases from continuing operations was $71.2 million, $77.4 million, and $77.6 million in fiscal 2017, 2016,
and 2015, respectively. These amounts are inclusive of accelerated lease payments in connection with the exit of certain lease
contracts.

A summary of non-cancellable operating lease commitments for fiscal years following May 28, 2017, was as follows:

17. CONTINGENCIES

In fiscal 1991, we acquired Beatrice Company ("Beatrice"). As a result of the acquisition of Beatrice and the significant
pre-acquisition  contingencies  of  the  Beatrice  businesses  and  its  former  subsidiaries,  our  condensed  consolidated  post-
acquisition financial statements reflect liabilities associated with the estimated resolution of these contingencies. Such liabilities
include various litigation and environmental proceedings related to businesses divested by Beatrice prior to our acquisition
of Beatrice. The litigation proceedings include suits against a number of lead paint and pigment manufacturers, including
ConAgra Grocery Products Company, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("ConAgra Grocery Products"), and
the Company as alleged successors to W. P. Fuller Co., a lead paint and pigment manufacturer owned and operated by Beatrice
until 1967. Although decisions favorable to us have been rendered in Rhode Island, New Jersey, Wisconsin, and Ohio, we
remain a defendant in active suits in Illinois and California. The Illinois suit seeks class-wide relief for reimbursement of costs
associated with the testing of lead levels in blood. In California, a number of cities and counties joined in a consolidated action
seeking abatement of the alleged public nuisance. On September 23, 2013, a trial of the California case concluded in the
Superior Court of California for the County of Santa Clara, and on January 27, 2014, the court entered a judgment (the
"Judgment") against ConAgra Grocery Products and two other defendants ordering the creation of a California abatement
fund in the amount of $1.15 billion. Liability is joint and several. The Company believes ConAgra Grocery Products did not
inherit any liabilities of W. P. Fuller Co. The Company will continue to vigorously defend itself in this case and has appealed
the Judgment to the Court of Appeal of the State of California Sixth Appellate District. The Company expects the appeals
process to last several years. The absence of any linkage between ConAgra Grocery Products and W. P. Fuller Co. is a critical
issue (among others) that the Company will continue to advance throughout the appeals process. It is not possible to estimate
exposure in this case or the remaining case in Illinois, which is based on different legal theories. If ultimately necessary, the
Company will look to its insurance policies for coverage; its carriers are on notice. However, the extent of insurance coverage
is uncertain, and the Company cannot absolutely assure that the final resolution of these matters will not have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

The environmental proceedings associated with Beatrice include litigation and administrative proceedings involving
Beatrice's status as a potentially responsible party at 37 Superfund, proposed Superfund, or state-equivalent sites (the "Beatrice
sites"). These sites involve locations previously owned or operated by predecessors of Beatrice that used or produced petroleum,
pesticides, fertilizers, dyes, inks, solvents, PCBs, acids, lead, sulfur, tannery wastes, and/or other contaminants. Beatrice has
paid or is in the process of paying its liability share at 33 of these sites. Reserves for these Beatrice environmental proceedings
have been established based on our best estimate of the undiscounted remediation liabilities, which estimates include evaluation
of investigatory studies, extent of required clean-up, the known volumetric contribution of Beatrice and other potentially
responsible parties, and its experience in remediating sites. The accrual for Beatrice-related environmental matters totaled
$52.3 million as of May 28, 2017, a majority of which relates to the Superfund and state-equivalent sites referenced above.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, a final Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study was submitted for the Wells G&H-
Southwest Properties Superfund site, which is one of the Beatrice sites. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the
"EPA") has indicated that it will issue a Record of Decision for this site shortly and subsequently enter into negotiations with
potentially responsible parties to determine a final Remedial Design/Remedial Action plan for the site. While we believe that
it is unlikely, it is reasonably possible that the EPA's decision and negotiations may result in material liability, but we are, at
this time, unable to estimate a range of potential outcomes.

In June 2009, an accidental explosion occurred at our manufacturing facility in Garner, North Carolina. This facility was
the primary production facility for our Slim Jim® branded meat snacks. In June 2009, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
Firearms and Explosives announced its determination that the explosion was the result of an accidental natural gas release
and not a deliberate act. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we settled our property and business interruption claims
related to the Garner accident with our insurance providers. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, Jacobs Engineering
Group Inc. ("Jacobs"), our engineer and project manager at the site, filed a declaratory judgment action against us seeking
indemnity for personal injury claims brought against it as a result of the accident. During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, our
motion for summary judgment was granted and the suit was dismissed without prejudice on the basis that the suit was filed
prematurely. In the third quarter of fiscal 2014, Jacobs refiled its action seeking indemnity. On March 25, 2016, a Douglas
County jury in Nebraska rendered a verdict in favor of Jacobs and against us in the amount of $108.9 million plus post-
judgment interest. We filed our Notice of Appeal in September 2016. Although our insurance carriers have provided customary
notices of reservation of their rights under the policies of insurance, we expect any ultimate exposure in this case to be limited
to the applicable insurance deductible.

We are party to a number of putative class action lawsuits challenging various product claims made in the Company's
product labeling. These matters include Briseno v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., in which it is alleged that the labeling for Wesson®
oils as 100% natural is false and misleading because the oils contain genetically modified plants and organisms. In February
2015, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California granted class certification to permit plaintiffs to pursue state
law claims. The Company appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed class certification
in January 2017. The Company has sought further review by the United States Supreme Court. While we cannot predict with
certainty the results of this or any other legal proceeding, we do not expect this matter to have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition, results of operations, or business.

In certain limited situations, we guarantee obligations of the Lamb Weston business pursuant to guarantee arrangements
that existed prior to the Spinoff and remained in place following completion of the Spinoff until such guarantee obligations
are substituted for guarantees issued by Lamb Weston. Such guarantee arrangements are described below. Pursuant to the
Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated as of November 8, 2016 (the "Separation Agreement"), between us and Lamb
Weston, these guarantee arrangements are deemed liabilities of Lamb Weston that were transferred to Lamb Weston as part
of the Spinoff. Accordingly, in the event that we are required to make any payments as a result of these guarantee arrangements,
Lamb Weston is obligated to indemnify us for any such liability, reduced by any insurance proceeds received by us, in
accordance with the terms of the indemnification provisions under the Separation Agreement.

Lamb Weston is a party to a warehouse services agreement with a third-party warehouse provider through July 2035.
Under this agreement, Lamb Weston is required to make payments for warehouse services based on the quantity of goods
stored and other service factors. We have guaranteed the warehouse provider that we will make the payments required under
the agreement in the event that Lamb Weston fails to perform. Minimum payments of $1.5 million per month are required
under this agreement. It is not possible to determine the maximum amount of the payment obligations under this agreement.
Upon completion of the Spinoff, we recognized a liability for the estimated fair value of this guarantee. As of May 28, 2017,
the amount of this guarantee, recorded in other noncurrent liabilities, was $29.7 million.

Lamb Weston is a party to an agricultural sublease agreement with a third party for certain farmland through 2020 (subject,
at Lamb Weston's option, to extension for two additional five-year periods). Under the terms of the sublease agreement, Lamb
Weston is required to make certain rental payments to the sublessor. We have guaranteed the sublessor Lamb Weston's
performance and the payment of all amounts (including indemnification obligations) owed by Lamb Weston under the sublease
agreement, up to a maximum of $75.0 million. We believe the farmland associated with this sublease agreement is readily
marketable for lease to other area farming operators. As such, we believe that any financial exposure to the company, in the
event that we were required to perform under the guaranty, would be largely mitigated.

We lease certain office buildings from entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities. The lease agreements
contain put options exercisable now and remain exercisable until generally 30 days after the end of the respective lease
agreements, that allow the lessors to require us to purchase the buildings at the greater of original construction cost, or fair
market value, without a lease in place. We have financial exposure with respect to these entities in the event we are required
to purchase the leased buildings for a price in excess of the then current fair value under the applicable lease purchase options.
We are amortizing the difference between the estimated put price and the estimated fair value (without a lease agreement in
place) of each respective property over the remaining respective lease term within selling, general and administrative expenses.
As of May 28, 2017, the estimated amount by which the put prices exceeded the fair values of the related properties was $51.8
million, of which we have accrued $8.4 million. As these buildings are worth considerably more when under lease agreements
than when vacant, we may be able to mitigate some, or all, of the related financial exposure created by the put options by
maintaining active lease agreements and/or by subleasing the buildings to credit worthy tenants. We do not expect to ultimately
incur material financial losses as a result of the potential exercise of the lease put options by the lessors. During fiscal 2017,
one of these lease agreements expired. As a result of this expiration, we reversed the applicable accrual and recognized a
benefit of $6.7 million in selling, general and administrative expenses. 

We are party to a number of matters challenging the Company's wage and hour practices. These matters include a number
of putative class actions consolidated under the caption Negrete v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., et al, pending in the U.S. District
Court for the Central District of California, in which the plaintiffs allege a pattern of violations of California and/or federal
law at several current and former Company manufacturing facilities across the State of California. While we cannot predict
with certainty the results of this or any other legal proceeding, we do not expect this matter to have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition, results of operations, or business.

After taking into account liabilities recognized for all of the foregoing matters, management believes the ultimate resolution
of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. It is
reasonably possible that a change of the estimates of any of the foregoing matters may occur in the future and, as noted, while
unlikely, the lead paint matter could result in a material final judgment. Costs of legal services associated with the foregoing
matters are recognized in earnings as services are provided.

18. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Our operations are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in commodity prices affecting the cost of raw materials
and energy, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. In the normal course of business, these risks are managed
through a variety of strategies, including the use of derivatives.

Commodity and commodity index futures and option contracts are used from time to time to economically hedge commodity
input prices on items such as natural gas, vegetable oils, proteins, packaging materials, dairy, grains, and electricity. Generally,
we economically hedge a portion of our anticipated consumption of commodity inputs for periods of up to 36 months. We
may enter into longer-term economic hedges on particular commodities, if deemed appropriate. As of May 28, 2017, we had
economically hedged certain portions of our anticipated consumption of commodity inputs using derivative instruments with
expiration dates through March 2018.

In order to reduce exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we enter into forward exchange,
option, or swap contracts from time to time for transactions denominated in a currency other than the applicable functional
currency. This includes, but is not limited to, hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital
equipment, sales of finished goods, and future settlement of foreign-denominated assets and liabilities. As of May 28, 2017,
we  had  economically  hedged  certain  portions  of  our  foreign  currency  risk  in  anticipated  transactions  using  derivative
instruments with expiration dates through February 2018.

From time to time, we may use derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, to reduce risk related to changes in
interest rates. This includes, but is not limited to, hedging against increasing interest rates prior to the issuance of long-term
debt and hedging the fair value of our senior long-term debt.

Derivatives Designated as Fair Value Hedges

During fiscal 2014, we entered into interest rate swap contracts to hedge the fair value of certain of our senior long-term
debt instruments maturing in fiscal 2019 and 2020. These contracts, with a total notional amount of $500 million, effectively
converted interest on this debt from fixed rate to floating rate. We designated these interest rate swap contracts as fair value
hedges of the debt instruments. During fiscal 2015, we terminated the interest rate swap contracts and received proceeds of
$21.9 million. The proceeds include $3.9 million of accrued interest from the interest rate swap contract, gains of $5.4 million
representing the change in fair value of the interest rate swap contracts (the ineffective portion of the hedge) recognized within
selling, general and administrative expenses, and $12.6 million of cumulative adjustment to the fair value of the debt instruments
that were hedged (the effective portion of the hedge), that is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the
remaining life of the debt instruments through fiscal 2020. The unamortized amount of the deferred gain was $2.3 million at
May 28, 2017. The portion written off in fiscal 2017 in connection with the Lamb Weston spinoff and the third quarter early
retirement of debt totaled $3.1 million (see Note 4). The portion written off in fiscal 2016 related to the third quarter tender
offers totaled $3.0 million.   

Changes in fair value of such derivative instruments were immediately recognized in earnings along with changes in the
fair value of the items being hedged (based solely on the change in the benchmark interest rate). In fiscal 2015, we recognized
gains of $8.9 million representing the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts and losses of $5.8 million representing the
change in fair value of the related senior long-term debt. The net gain of $3.1 million for fiscal 2015 is classified within selling,
general and administrative expenses. 

The entire change in fair value of the derivative instruments was included in our assessment of hedge effectiveness.

Economic Hedges of Forecasted Cash Flows

Many of our derivatives do not qualify for, and we do not currently designate certain commodity or foreign currency
derivatives to achieve, hedge accounting treatment. We reflect realized and unrealized gains and losses from derivatives used
to economically hedge anticipated commodity consumption and to mitigate foreign currency cash flow risk in earnings
immediately within general corporate expense (within cost of goods sold). The gains and losses are reclassified to segment
operating results in the period in which the underlying item being economically hedged is recognized in cost of goods sold.
In the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity
purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge, we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in
corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results, immediately. 

Economic Hedges of Fair Values — Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We may use options and cross currency swaps to economically hedge the fair value of certain monetary assets and liabilities
(including intercompany balances) denominated in a currency other than the functional currency. These derivatives are marked-
to-market with gains and losses immediately recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses. These substantially
offset  the  foreign  currency  transaction  gains  or  losses  recognized  as  values  of  the  monetary  assets  or  liabilities  being
economically hedged change. 

All derivative instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value (refer to Note 20 for additional
information related to fair value measurements). The fair value of derivative assets is recognized within prepaid expenses and
other current assets, while the fair value of derivative liabilities is recognized within other accrued liabilities. In accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, we offset certain derivative asset and liability balances, as well as certain
amounts representing rights to reclaim cash collateral and obligations to return cash collateral, where master netting agreements
provide for legal right of setoff. At May 28, 2017 and May 29, 2016 amounts representing a right to reclaim cash collateral
of $0.9 million and $0.3 million, respectively, were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

Derivative assets and liabilities and amounts representing a right to reclaim cash collateral or obligation to return cash

collateral were reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:

As of May 28, 2017, our open commodity contracts had a notional value (defined as notional quantity times market value
per notional quantity unit) of $76.8 million and $73.4 million for purchase and sales contracts, respectively. As of May 29,
2016, our open commodity contracts had a notional value of $74.7 million and $41.5 million for purchase and sales contracts,
respectively. The notional amount of our foreign currency forward and cross currency swap contracts as of May 28, 2017 and
May 29, 2016 was $81.9 million and $112.9 million, respectively. 

We enter into certain commodity, interest rate, and foreign exchange derivatives with a diversified group of counterparties.
We continually monitor our positions and the credit ratings of the counterparties involved and limit the amount of credit
exposure to any one party. These transactions may expose us to potential losses due to the risk of nonperformance by these
counterparties. We have not incurred a material loss due to nonperformance in any period presented and do not expect to incur
any such material loss. We also enter into futures and options transactions through various regulated exchanges.

At May 28, 2017, the maximum amount of loss due to the credit risk of the counterparties, had the counterparties failed

to perform according to the terms of the contracts, was $0.3 million. 

19. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

We have defined benefit retirement plans ("plans") for eligible salaried and hourly employees. Benefits are based on years
of credited service and average compensation or stated amounts for each year of service. We also sponsor postretirement plans
which provide certain medical and dental benefits ("other postretirement benefits") to qualifying U.S. employees. Effective
August 1, 2013, our defined benefit pension plan for eligible salaried employees was closed to new hire salaried employees.
New hire salaried employees will generally be eligible to participate in our defined contribution plan.

We recognize the funded status of our plans and other benefits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For our plans, we also
recognize as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, the net of tax results of the actuarial gains or losses within
the corridor and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized in net periodic benefit cost.
For our other benefits, we also recognize as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), the net of tax
results of the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized in net periodic
benefit cost. These amounts will be adjusted out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as they are subsequently
recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. For our pension plans, we have elected to immediately recognize
actuarial gains and losses in our operating results in the year in which they occur, to the extent they exceed the corridor,
eliminating amortization. Amounts are included in the components of pension benefit and other postretirement benefit costs,
below, as recognized net actuarial loss.

The information below includes the activities of our continuing and discontinued operations.

Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2017, May 29, 2016, and May 31, 2015

(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)

As a result of the Spinoff, during fiscal 2017, we recorded a pension curtailment gain of $19.5 million within other
comprehensive income (loss) and remeasured a significant qualified pension plan as of November 9, 2016. In connection with
the remeasurement, we updated the effective discount rate assumption from 3.86% to 4.04%. The remeasurement and the
curtailment gain decreased the underfunded status of the pension plans by $66.0 million with a corresponding benefit within
other comprehensive income (loss).

During fiscal 2017, we provided a voluntary lump-sum settlement offer to certain terminated vested participants in our
salaried pension plan. Lump-sum settlement payments totaling $287.5 million were distributed from pension plan assets to
such participants. Due to the pension settlement, we were required to remeasure our pension plan liability.  In connection with
the remeasurement, we updated the effective discount rate assumption to 4.11%, as of December 31, 2016. The settlement
and related remeasurement resulted in the recognition of a settlement charge of $13.8 million, reflected in selling, general,
and administrative expenses, as well as a benefit to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) totaling $62.2 million. 

Special termination benefits granted in connection with the voluntary retirement program resulted in the recognition of
$25.6 million of expense during fiscal 2016.  This expense was included in restructuring activities.  Special termination benefits
granted in connection with the formation of Ardent Mills resulted in the recognition of $6.9 million of expense during fiscal
2015. This expense was included in results of discontinued operations. 

In fiscal 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded a charge of $1.2 million and $348.5 million, respectively, reflecting the

year-end write-off of actuarial losses in excess of 10% of our pension liability.

The Company recorded an expense of $4.0 million ($2.1 million was recorded in discontinued operations and $1.9 million
was recorded in restructuring activities) and $31.8 million ($2.0 million was recorded in discontinued operations and $29.8
million was recorded in restructuring activities) during fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to our expected incurrence
of certain multi-employer plan withdrawal costs.

Beginning in fiscal 2017, the Company has elected to use a split discount rate (spot-rate approach) for the U.S. plans and
certain foreign plans. Historically, a single weighted-average discount rate was used in the calculation of service and interest
costs, both of which are components of pension benefit costs. The spot-rate approach applies separate discount rates for each
projected benefit payment in the calculation of pension service and interest cost. This change is considered a change in

accounting estimate and has been applied prospectively. The pre-tax reduction in total pension benefit cost associated with
this change in fiscal 2017 was approximately $27.0 million.

We amortize prior service cost for our pension plans and postretirement plans, as well as amortizable gains and losses
for our postretirement plans, in equal annual amounts over the average expected future period of vested service. For plans
with no active participants, average life expectancy is used instead of average expected useful service.

The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) expected to be recognized as components of net expense

during the next year are as follows:

Level 1 assets are valued based on quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. The majority of the Level 1
assets  listed  above  include  the  common  stock  of  both  U.S. and  international  companies,  mutual  funds,  master  limited
partnership units, and real estate investment trusts, all of which are actively traded and priced in the market. Level 2 assets
are valued based on other significant observable inputs including quoted prices for similar securities, yield curves, indices,
etc. 

Level 2 assets consist primarily of individual fixed income securities where values are based on quoted prices of similar

securities and observable market data. 

Level 3 assets consist of investments where active market pricing is not readily available and, as such, fair value is

estimated using significant unobservable inputs.

Certain assets that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not
been  classified  in  the  fair  value  hierarchy.  Such  investments  are  generally  considered  long-term  in  nature  with  varying
redemption availability. For certain of  these investments, with a fair value of approximately $669.8 million as of May 28,
2017, the asset managers have the ability to impose customary redemption gates which may further restrict or limit the
redemption of invested funds therein. As of May 28, 2017, funds with a fair value of $0.1 million have imposed such gates.

As of May 28, 2017, we have unfunded commitments for additional investments of $84.5 million in private equity funds
and $28.3 million in natural resources funds. We expect unfunded commitments to be funded from plan assets rather than the
general assets of the Company.

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption for the pension plans, we consider the current

asset allocation strategy, the historical investment performance, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.

The Company’s investment strategy reflects the expectation that equity securities and multi-strategy hedge funds will
outperform debt securities over the long term. Assets are invested in a prudent manner to maintain the security of funds while
maximizing returns within the Company’s Investment Policy guidelines. The strategy is implemented utilizing indexed and
actively managed assets from the categories listed.

The investment goals are to provide a total return that, over the long term, increases the ratio of plan assets to liabilities
subject to an acceptable level of risk. This is accomplished through diversification of assets in accordance with the Investment
Policy guidelines. Investment risk is mitigated by periodic rebalancing between asset classes as necessitated by changes in
market conditions within the Investment Policy guidelines.

 Other investments are primarily made up of cash and master limited partnerships.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the benefit obligation of the postretirement plans.

Multiemployer Pension Plans

The Company contributes to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under collective bargaining agreements
that cover certain of its union-represented employees. The risks of participating in such plans are different from the risks of
single-employer plans, in the following respects:

a. Assets contributed to a multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other

participating employers.

b.

c.

If a participating employer ceases to contribute to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by
the remaining participating employers.

If the Company ceases to have an obligation to contribute to a multiemployer plan in which it had been a contributing
employer, it may be required to pay to the plan an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan and on the
history of the Company’s participation in the plan prior to the cessation of its obligation to contribute. The amount
that an employer that has ceased to have an obligation to contribute to a multiemployer plan is required to pay to the
plan is referred to as a withdrawal liability.

The Company’s participation in multiemployer plans for the fiscal year ended May 28, 2017 is outlined in the table below.

For each plan that is individually significant to the Company the following information is provided:

•

•

•

•

•

The “EIN / PN” column provides the Employer Identification Number and the three-digit plan number assigned to
a plan by the Internal Revenue Service.

The most recent Pension Protection Act Zone Status available for 2016 and 2015 is for plan years that ended in
calendar years 2016 and 2015, respectively. The zone status is based on information provided to the Company by
each plan. A plan in the “red” zone has been determined to be in “critical status”, based on criteria established under
the Internal Revenue Code (“Code”), and is generally less than 65% funded. A plan in the “yellow” zone has been
determined to be in “endangered status”, based on criteria established under the Code, and is generally less than 80%
funded. A plan in the “green” zone has been determined to be neither in “critical status” nor in “endangered status”,
and is generally at least 80% funded.

The “FIP/RP Status Pending/Implemented” column indicates whether a Funding Improvement Plan, as required
under the Code to be adopted by plans in the “yellow” zone, or a Rehabilitation Plan, as required under the Code to
be adopted by plans in the “red” zone, is pending or has been implemented by the plan as of the end of the plan year
that ended in calendar year 2016.

Contributions by the Company are the amounts contributed in the Company’s fiscal periods ending in the specified
year.

The “Surcharge Imposed” column indicates whether the Company contribution rate for its fiscal year that ended on
May 28, 2017 included an amount in addition to the contribution rate specified in the applicable collective bargaining
agreement, as imposed by a plan in “critical status”, in accordance with the requirements of the Code.

The Company was listed in its plans' Forms 5500 as providing more than 5% of the plan's total contributions for the
National Conference of Firemen & Oilers National Pension Fund for the plan year ending in calendar year 2014.  The Company
withdrew from participation in that plan on or about June 1, 2015.

The Company was not listed in the Forms 5500 filed by any of the other plans or for any of the other years as providing
more than 5% of the plan’s total contributions. At the date our financial statements were issued, Forms 5500 were not available
for plan years ending in calendar year 2016.

In addition to the contributions listed in the table above, we recorded an additional expense of $4.0 million, $31.8 million,
and $0.4 million in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, related to our expected incurrence of certain withdrawal costs.

Certain of our employees are covered under defined contribution plans. The expense related to these plans was $18.0

million, $35.4 million, and $40.6 million in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.

20. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

FASB guidance establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price assets or

liabilities. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:

Level 1  — Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities,

Level 2  — Observable inputs other than those included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities

in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets, and

Level 3  — Unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions and best estimate of what inputs market participants

would use in pricing the asset or liability.

The fair values of our Level 2 derivative instruments were determined using valuation models that use market observable
inputs including interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Derivative assets and
liabilities included in Level 2 primarily represent commodity and foreign currency option and forward contracts and cross-
currency swaps.

Certain assets and liabilities, including long-lived assets, goodwill, asset retirement obligations, and cost and equity

investments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. 

During  fiscal  2017,  goodwill  impairment  charges  totaling  $198.9  million  were  recognized  within  our  International
segment. During fiscal 2015, goodwill impairment charges of $20.9 million were recognized within our Grocery & Snacks
segment. See Note 9 for discussion of the methodology employed to measure these impairments. 

During fiscal 2017, we recognized indefinite-lived brand impairment charges of $37.0 million in our International segment
and $68.2 million in our Grocery & Snacks segment. During fiscal 2016 and 2015, we recognized indefinite-lived brand
impairment charges of $50.1 million and $4.8 million, respectively, in our Grocery & Snacks segment. The fair values of these
brands were estimated using the “relief from royalty” method (See Note 9).

The carrying amount of long-term debt (including current installments) was $2.97 billion as of May 28, 2017 and $5.44
billion as of May 29, 2016. Based on current market rates, the fair value of this debt (level 2 liabilities) at May 28, 2017 and
May 29, 2016 was estimated at $3.32 billion and $5.85 billion, respectively.

21. BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION

During fiscal 2017, we reorganized our reporting segments. We now reflect our results of operations in five reporting
segments: Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, Foodservice, and Commercial. Prior periods have been
reclassified to conform to the revised segment presentation. 

In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we completed the Spinoff of Lamb Weston. The Lamb Weston business had previously
been included in the Commercial segment. The results of operations of the Lamb Weston business have been classified as
discontinued operations for all periods presented.

(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)

The Grocery & Snacks reporting segment principally includes branded, shelf-stable food products sold in various retail

channels in the United States.

The Refrigerated & Frozen reporting segment includes branded, temperature controlled food products sold in various

retail channels in the United States.

The International reporting segment principally includes branded food products, in various temperature states, sold in

various retail and foodservice channels outside of the United States.

The Foodservice reporting segment includes branded and customized food products, including meals, entrees, sauces and
a variety of custom-manufactured culinary products packaged for sale to restaurants and other foodservice establishments in
the United States.

The Commercial reporting segment included commercially branded and private label food and ingredients, which were
sold primarily to commercial, restaurant, foodservice, food manufacturing, and industrial customers. The segment's primary
food items included a variety of vegetable, spice, and frozen bakery goods, which were sold under brands such as Spicetec
Flavors & Seasonings®. The Spicetec and JM Swank businesses were sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 

We do not aggregate operating segments when determining our reporting segments.
Intersegment sales have been recorded at amounts approximating market. Operating profit for each of the segments is
based on net sales less all identifiable operating expenses. General corporate expense, net interest expense, and income taxes
have been excluded from segment operations.

Presentation of Derivative Gains (Losses) for Economic Hedges of Forecasted Cash Flows in Segment Results

Derivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting
treatment. We believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions. As such, these derivatives
are recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses.
The gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the
underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings. In the event that management determines a particular
derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic
hedge, we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such
gains and losses within segment operating results, immediately.

The following table presents the net derivative gains (losses) from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption

and the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions, under this methodology:

As of May 28, 2017, the cumulative amount of net derivative losses from economic hedges that had been recognized in
general corporate expenses and not yet allocated to reporting segments was $3.0 million. This amount reflected net losses of
$3.3 million incurred during the fiscal year ended May 28, 2017, as well as net gains of $0.3 million incurred prior to fiscal
2017. Based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items, we expect to reclassify to segment
operating results losses of $1.2 million in fiscal 2018 and losses of $1.8 million in fiscal 2019 and thereafter.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, management determined that certain derivatives that had been previously entered
into as an economic hedge of forecasted commodity purchases had ceased to function as economic hedges. We recognized
derivative losses of $10.8 million, $6.3 million, and $2.7 million, and derivative gains of $0.9 million within the operating
results of the Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, and Foodservice segments, respectively, during fiscal
2015 in connection with these derivatives. Management effectively exited these derivative positions in the third quarter of
fiscal 2015.

Assets by Segment

The majority of our manufacturing assets are shared across multiple reporting segments. Output from these facilities used
by each reporting segment can change over time. Also, working capital balances are not tracked by reporting segment.
Therefore, it is impracticable to allocate those assets to the reporting segments, as well as disclose total assets by segment.
Total depreciation expense for fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $234.4 million, $243.9 million, and $258.3 million, respectively.

Other Information

At May 28, 2017, Conagra Brands and its subsidiaries had approximately 12,600 employees, primarily in the United
States. Approximately 47% of our employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements. Of the employees subject to
collective bargaining agreements, approximately 6% are parties to collective bargaining agreements scheduled to expire during
fiscal 2018.

Our operations are principally in the United States. With respect to operations outside of the United States, no single
foreign country or geographic region was significant with respect to consolidated operations for fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015.
Foreign net sales, including sales by domestic segments to customers located outside of the United States, were approximately
$887.2 million, $937.9 million, and $1.0 billion in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Our long-lived assets located
outside of the United States are not significant.

Our  largest  customer, Wal-Mart  Stores,  Inc.  and  its  affiliates,  accounted  for  approximately  24%,  23%,  and  20%  of
consolidated  net  sales  for  fiscal  2017,  2016,  and  2015,  respectively,  significantly  impacting  the  Grocery  &  Snacks  and
Refrigerated & Frozen segments.

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates accounted for approximately 26% and 25% of consolidated net receivables as of

May 28, 2017 and May 29, 2016, respectively.

We offer certain suppliers access to a third-party service that allows them to view our scheduled payments online. The
third party service also allows suppliers to finance advances on our scheduled payments at the sole discretion of the supplier
and the third party. We have no economic interest in these financing arrangements and no direct relationship with the suppliers,
the third-party, or any financial institutions concerning this service. All of our accounts payable remain as obligations to our
suppliers as stated in our supplier agreements. As of May 28, 2017, $24.6 million of our total accounts payable is payable to
suppliers who utilize this third-party service.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
Conagra Brands, Inc.: 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Conagra Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as
of May 28, 2017 and May 29, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss),
common stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three‑year period ended May 28, 2017.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Conagra Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries as of May 28, 2017 and May 29, 2016, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three‑year period ended May 28, 2017, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 28, 2017, based on the criteria established in

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company's management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures
as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of May 28, 2017. Based upon that
evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by
this report, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
evaluated any change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter covered by
this report and determined that there was no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal
control over financial reporting.

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Conagra Brands' management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting of Conagra Brands (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Conagra
Brands' internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  U.S. generally  accepted
accounting principles. Conagra Brands' internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of Conagra Brands; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of Conagra Brands are being made only in accordance with the authorization of management and directors of
Conagra Brands; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of Conagra Brands' assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent
limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements. Also,  projections  of  any
evaluations of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of the
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

With the participation of Conagra Brands' Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management assessed
the effectiveness of Conagra Brands' internal control over financial reporting as of May 28, 2017. In making this assessment,
management  used  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control-Integrated  Framework  (2013),  issued  by  the  Committee  of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). As a result of this assessment, management concluded
that, as of May 28, 2017, its internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The effectiveness of Conagra Brands' internal control over financial reporting as of May 28, 2017 has been audited by
KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, a copy of which is included in this
annual report on Form 10-K.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
Conagra Brands, Inc.: 

We have audited Conagra Brands, Inc.'s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of May 28, 2017, based
on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Conagra Brands, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of May 28, 2017, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of May 28, 2017 and May 29, 2016, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), common stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of the fiscal years in the three‑year period ended May 28, 2017, and our report dated July 21, 2017 expressed an
unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS

Fiscal 2017 marked our second full year of transformation.  
Looking back, we’ve accomplished a lot. We reshaped 
our company and portfolio of brands – exiting non-core 
businesses including Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings® and 
JM Swank.® We flawlessly executed the Lamb Weston®
spin-off. We’ve also modernized our portfolio through the
acquisition of on-trend brands like Frontera,® Duke’s® and 
BIGS,® and our transformation continues with the pending 
sale of the Wesson® brand. 

At the same time, we took aggressive action to reduce 
costs, upgrade the quality of our revenue base and 
jumpstart innovation across the company. In short, we’ve
overhauled our culture, growth capabilities and shareholder 
value focus behind a new management team and an 
energized new corporate headquarters.

Our actions have led to stronger, more consistent 
performance. In fiscal year 2017:

•  Adjusted gross margin¹ increased 

180 basis points to 30.2%.

•  Adjusted operating margin¹ increased 

310 basis points to 15.8%.

•  Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations¹ 

increased 33.8% to $1.74.

•  We repurchased $1 billion of stock and  

paid $415 million in dividends.

Clearly, we’ve been busy – but our work is not finished. 
We are seeing a healthier, less promotional business 
emerge. But we still have a lot of opportunity to build 
margins and improve our growth prospects.

We will continue to innovate and strengthen existing 
brands with contemporary attributes most wanted and 
demanded by consumers. Our innovation capabilities are 
accelerating, and you will see our new products hit the 
market throughout fiscal 2018. We’ll also continue to further 
renovate our brand portfolio by acquiring new assets and 
potentially divesting assets that no longer fit. We expect 
that, over time, a greater percentage of our sales will come 
from loyal households and generate higher margins.

Execution excellence will also remain a hallmark of our 
culture. We will continue to drive unnecessary cost out 
of our business, and drive ongoing efficiencies throughout 
our operations. 

We are optimistic our plans and strategies will generate 
strong cash flows and create shareholder value. That’s 
why your board of directors approved a new $1 billion 
share repurchase program to complement our current
solid dividend payout.

Before closing, I want to note one thing that hasn’t 
and won’t change: the priority we place on corporate 
citizenship. Fiscal 2017 marked the sixth consecutive
year that Conagra Brands was included in the 
Dow Jones SustainabilityTM North America Index,
one of the world’s most recognizable sustainability 
indices. Conagra Brands employees around the world 
are delivering our financial results while making our 
communities a better place to live and work – by personally 
volunteering thousands of hours, and by developing and 
implementing projects that save the company millions of 
dollars while diverting thousands of tons of waste from 
landfills, conserving hundreds of million gallons of water 
and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by thousands  
of metric tons.  

These are exciting times for Conagra Brands, and I want 
to thank our talented and dedicated Conagra Brands 
employees, who continue to embrace change and execute
our strategy while serving our customers with excellence. 

Thank you for your continued support of Conagra Brands.

Sincerely, 

Sean M. Connolly
President and Chief Executive Officer
