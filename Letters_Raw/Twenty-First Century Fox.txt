A   M E S S A G E   F R O M   T H E   C H A I R M E N

Fiscal Year 2018 was a defining year for our company. 

This journey began with a single newspaper in Adelaide, Australia. From the very 
beginning, our guiding principle has been a belief that customers deserve more 
choice. We have seized opportunities in markets that others did not see. Through 
the remarkable efforts and energy of thousands of colleagues over decades, 
21CF has grown to become one of the most dynamic and valuable media 
companies in the world. 

With many of the industry’s best minds as partners, we bring outstanding 
storytelling, news, and sports content to viewers. We have built some of the 
world’s leading video brands, each anchored by an unwavering commitment 
to providing exceptional experiences. We’ve also maintained a steadfast 
commitment to our shareholders to create long-term value. 

However, we recognize that new technologies, competitors, and shifting 
consumer preferences have ushered in rapid change and redrawn the whole 
media map. In response, we are pivoting at a pivotal moment. 
Our Board has set, and our shareholders have overwhelmingly approved, 
two paths of opportunity for our assets. First, 21CF will separate Fox 
Broadcasting network and stations and Fox News Channel, Fox Business 
Network, FOX Sports, FS1, FS2 and Big Ten Network into a newly listed 
company that will be spun off to our shareholders as the new “Fox.”  
Following the spin-off of new Fox, Disney will acquire the balance 
of 21CF, including the Twentieth Century Fox Film and Television 
studios, along with cable and international TV businesses.  
The transformational combination with Disney and creation of 
new Fox position the assets we have built to succeed well into 
the future while creating compelling value for shareholders. 

Consider the extraordinary shareholder value our transaction 
has already unlocked. The Company’s stock price increased 
approximately 75 percent during the fiscal year, significantly 
ahead of both the 12 percent average growth for the S&P 
500 and a 10 percent average decline for our media peers 
over the same period. Over the 12-month period, we 
unlocked over $40 billion in shareholder value. 

Adding key Fox businesses to Disney will create  
an impressive global operation, poised to deliver  
what consumers want: quality storytelling, 
breadth, and extraordinary products. The scope 
of the enlarged Disney’s storytelling, customer 
interactions, consolidated Hulu ownership, and 
direct-to-consumer businesses will create a 
customer-driven company positioned for success 
in the future. Our investors, as a group, will have 
meaningful ownership participation of the growth 
opportunities inherent in the new Disney. 
Our shareholders will own 100 percent of 
new Fox. As a growth company anchored 
by the No. 1 news channel across all of 
basic cable, and a sports network that 
captures an estimated 40 percent 
of regular-season NFL viewership, 
new Fox will have unique reach and 
the deep resonance of the iconic 
Fox brand. The new company’s 

strategic advantages will be reflected in a strong financial profile 
marked by robust cash flow and further enhanced by favorable  
tax attributes. 
As excited as we are by these opportunities, we remain wholly focused 
on executing on our growth strategies for all of 21CF. Our performance 
over the last fiscal year bears that out. 

In Fiscal 2018, 21CF’s film and television studios further demonstrated 
our pursuit of creative excellence and enduring commitment to 
pushing boundaries. Our film studio garnered audience and industry 
recognition as our colleagues and creative partners were celebrated 
with 27 Academy Award nominations, an industry-leading six Academy 
Awards for Fox Searchlight, and more Golden Globe wins than any 
of our peers. Domestically, Twentieth Century Fox Television and FX 
Productions continued their mission of creating the most talked-about 
television with a groundbreaking slate of programming.

It is not an overstatement to say that sports is core to who we are as a 
company. We have a track record of success leveraging sports rights to 
launch new platforms, propel our brands, and drive returns for shareholders. 

Live sports remain the most powerful, most valuable content in our industry. 
FOX Sports is the leader in live events and delivered its highest viewership 
ever in calendar 2017 on the combined strength of our sports programming 
on the broadcast network and national cable channels FS1 and FS2. 

This past year, we secured additional sports rights, most notably the NFL’s 
Thursday Night Football and WWE’s SmackDown Live. The launch of NFL 
Thursday Night Football will help give FOX Sports a dominant position in 
television’s highest-rated programming. The FIFA World Cup was another big 
win for the FOX Sports brand.
The strength of our live viewership is also exemplified by Fox News Channel, which 
has maintained its position as the No. 1 network on basic cable in both Prime and Total 
Day. Fox Business Network achieved its highest-rated year ever this past fiscal year. 

Our broadcast network ended the season with growth in cross-platform 
entertainment viewership led by four of the top eight new dramas of the broadcast 
season, with new hits 9-1-1, The Orville, The Resident and The Gifted. 
As we look to the future, the new Fox will be positioned to continue delivering 
consistent growth driven by affiliate and retransmission revenue, as well as robust 
advertising demand. 
The creation of new Fox and an enhanced Disney will position all of our shareholders 
to benefit now and in the future as owners of what we expect will be two of the world’s 
preeminent media and entertainment companies. 
In closing, we would like to thank all of our talented colleagues across decades and 
continents, whose hard work has created enormous shareholder value and paved an 
exciting path of opportunity. We are also grateful to our shareholders, who have risked 
hard-earned capital to back our long-standing mission of providing choice to customers 
around the globe.
Sincerely,

Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch
Executive Chairmen, 21st Century Fox

A   M E S S A G E   F R O M   T H E   C E O

In Fiscal 2018, we delivered great financial and operational momentum across  
our businesses. We made significant progress on our growth plan as we  
moved our transaction with Disney, and the creation of new “Fox,” towards  
the finish line. 
Our strength is largely driven by the growing value of our coveted brands. In the 
2018 Fiscal Year, we achieved double-digit domestic affiliate fee gains over 
four consecutive quarters. This sustained growth across our most predictable 
revenues is a measure of the compelling experiences our colleagues create 
each day for our customers. Additionally, we delivered one of the strongest 
six-month periods ever for our film studio, continued our strength in live 
sports and news, and maintained robust growth in our India business. 
These accomplishments only tell part of a broader story — one of  
a strategy that we have cultivated and executed for the better part  
of a decade. 
In that time, we fundamentally reshaped our company around the future 
of video. We undertook a multi-year plan of investing in our capabilities 
and people, aligning our businesses around a portfolio of core video 
brands, and simplifying our operating model, which included our 
2013 separation of News Corporation. 
In short, we prepared for digital transformation and are now 
delivering it. We have made our content more, not less, available, 
understanding that business rules and content distribution 
approaches must change to meet the growing expectations  
of the empowered consumer. 
The return on our growth plan is clear and measurable in the 
extraordinary shareholder value unlocked by our transaction 
with Disney, which recognizes the outstanding work done  
by all of our colleagues.
We have always been a business animated by a universal 
commitment to our customers and the great storytelling 
they deserve. In a world of proliferating consumer 
services, the ability to create outstanding content 
is a required, competitive advantage that drives the 
distribution platforms and the video brands that anchor 
them. We have few peers in this regard. The creative 
excellence we deliver every day sets the foundation 
for expanding direct relationships with consumers, 
which is ushering in some of the best opportunities 
for our business in a generation.  
The last 12 months illustrate the extraordinary 
range, caliber and diversity of our creative output. 
From Legion, Fargo, Atlanta, and the American 
Crime Story saga at FX, to new hits The Resident, 
The Orville and The Gifted at Fox Broadcasting, 
to Genius: Picasso at Nat Geo, Nimki Mukhiya 
and Agnisakshi at Star India, and Gomorrah, 
Fortitude and Babylon Berlin at Sky, the 
breadth of our storytelling is boundless. 
Additionally, we produce three television 
series that are No. 1 on their respective 
networks: This Is Us (NBC), 9-1-1 (FOX),  
and American Horror Story (FX).

 

Leading the industry in awards, our film studio delivered a solid performance by any 
measure. With Academy Award-nominated features The Greatest Showman and Three 
Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, and the Academy Award for Best Picture for Fox 
Searchlight’s The Shape of Water, we are proud of the creative output from our film studio. 
The business’s turnaround was validated by the box-office success of Deadpool 2, which 
exceeded $730 million in worldwide receipts.
As a business, we have always been comfortable operating in international markets at 
all stages of development. But our goal has never been to be everywhere. We reap the 
best rewards when we commit to those markets that we believe offer unique long-term 
opportunities. One of the world’s largest, most exciting markets is India, where we 
have been for 25 years. 
Last year, Star India secured the Indian Premier League’s (IPL) global media and 
digital broadcast rights. Aided by the inaugural broadcast of the IPL, and continued 
general entertainment growth, Star India nearly doubled its profit contributions 
over the prior year. Hotstar, our India-based streaming platform, has continued to 
flourish. The addition of IPL dramatically increased viewership, with 10.3 million 
concurrent viewers during the IPL final match, making it the most concurrently 
watched live digital event in the world ever. 
Throughout our history, we have always welcomed change and challenge and 
have never been complacent. That sentiment has informed every decision  
we’ve made. 
The Disney combination and creation of new Fox are natural extensions of all 
the work we’ve done. They build on the past, amplify the present, and position 
us for success in the future. 
New Fox will be centered primarily around the content that is consumed 
live: Fox News, Fox Sports, and the Fox Broadcasting Network. These 
longstanding brand pillars will become the foundation of our venture. At the 
same time, an enlarged Disney will benefit from an exceptional pipeline of 
film and television intellectual property.
The logic of this transaction is clear. We believe that 21CF’s film and TV 
properties will align with Disney to maximize their impact and reach, while 
new Fox will be a force in live programming. The restructuring of 21CF 
is a momentous change for us all, but it is a natural evolution for our 
company. 
In this dynamic era, our impatience with the status quo has proven 
to be our greatest strength, and has continued to deliver compelling 
value to our shareholders. We are anchored by powerful brands and an 
enduring reputation for charting new territory and shaping the future. 
None of what we have accomplished would be possible without the 
incredible work of our thousands of colleagues and creative partners 
around the world. Their talent and dedication will drive these 
businesses to new heights.

Our preeminent video brands — FOX, FOX Sports, FOX News, 
National Geographic, FX, Star India, Hulu and Sky — make 
21CF one of the world’s leading destinations for premium 
scripted and unscripted entertainment, live sports events 
and breaking news. From the NFL and the Indian Premier 
League, to our distinct and diverse catalogue of award-
winning entertainment shows, to our longstanding 
leadership position in cable news, we continue to invest  
in the content that is most prized by customers around 
the world. 

As consumer habits evolve, we are expanding the 
ways in which viewers interact with our brands 
and access our content. Hotstar, our streaming 
service in India, set a new world record for most 
concurrent viewers for an OTT video stream. 
Our ground-breaking non-linear brand, FOX+, 
is expanding across Europe, Latin America 
and Asia. Domestically, the 21CF brands are 
anchoring the major digital MVPD services that 
are driving subscriber growth across the pay 
TV ecosystem. These innovative distribution 
models enable us to connect with audiences 
wherever, whenever and however they wish, 
leveraging viewers’ affinity for our brands 
while capitalizing on our global scale. 

The power of our brands and the creative 
excellence of our content give us an 
unrivaled ability to captivate audiences 
around the world.

S O C I A L   I M PA C T
21CF has a long-standing 
commitment to delivering both 
financial and societal value. 
We do this by leveraging our resources to make a difference 
in three key areas: creativity & the arts, sports & well-being, 
and knowledge & exploration, while maintaining our dedication to 
sustainable business practices.

Onscreen, our platforms bring empowering, inspiring programming 
from a diverse range of creators to billions of people worldwide, driving 
significant dialogue, insight and action on some of today’s most pressing 
topics. This year, the hit movie Love, Simon sparked dialogue about LGBTQ 
issues and inspired our campaign to support The Trevor Project’s crisis 
services programs for LGBTQ youth. We helped shed light on the importance of 
representation of women in media by joining the Geena Davis Institute on Gender 
in Media to quantify the “Scully Effect” and the generation of women who the iconic 
character, Agent Dana Scully from FOX’s The X-Files, inspired to pursue scientific 
careers. Our programming also examined a number of key cultural issues: America Inside 
Out showcased the humanity and complexities behind some of today’s most significant 
cultural shifts, while documentary series FOX Sports Magnify used sports as a lens through 
which to view important cultural stories. National Geographic explored race in America and how 
it defines, separates and unites us, and Star India continued to fuel positive change through STAR 
TED Talks India.  

Offscreen, we continue to create new paths to success for up-and-coming creators and innovators 
while leveraging our products, programming and partnerships to support the communities in which we 
live and work. This year, in honor of Battle of the Sexes, we donated 79 cents from every ticket sold during 
the film’s opening weekend to the Women’s Sports Foundation, drawing attention to the gender wage gap. 
We continued to help young, underrepresented filmmakers find their voices through our partnership with 
Ghetto Film School. And we did significant work in empowering women. We’re helping to close the gender gap 
in technology with our financial and programmatic support of Girls Who Code, and via a Hidden Figures inspired 
program, #HiddenNoMore. This U.S. Department of State educational exchange brought women in STEM from  
48 countries to the United States – and to 21CF – for education and inspiration. We were honored to support Step Up,  

an after-school mentoring program for young women in under-resourced communities, in 
honor of Fox Searchlight’s documentary, STEP. We also launched 21CF Community Grants, 
which awards grants to certified charitable organizations engaged in transformative work in 
the communities where 21CF operates.

Behind the scenes, we work to create a collaborative, respectful culture, and to treat 
with care the environment in which we all live and work. This year, we continued to drive 
sustainable practices in the entertainment industry and expanded our investment in 
renewable energy, producing enough solar energy on the Fox Studios lot to equal the 
positive impact of planting 33,000 trees. The 214,561 metric tons of carbon dioxide 
equivalents that we measured, reported and independently verified this year for Fiscal 
2017 is the result of continued efforts to minimize our environmental impacts. We 
also continued to advance responsible film and television production, piloting new 
technologies and practices to reduce the waste going to landfills and lower greenhouse 
gas emissions while working on The Post, The X-Files, Legion, and the US Open. And 
we are thrilled to have completed our second and third Impact Weeks, collectively 
bringing together 6,000 colleagues in 25 U.S. cities for more than 200 service 
activities; by the end of calendar 2018, we’ll have expanded this dedicated week of 
service to Latin America, Europe and Asia. 

D I V E R S I T Y & I N C L U S I O N 
21st Century Fox has long valued diversity 
and inclusion (D&I) and works to foster  
a workplace that attracts and retains the 
world’s best talent. 
We believe this ensures that all our businesses are stronger and more nimble, 
and positioned for long-term success. We accelerated this continuing 
commitment in Fiscal 2018, to further build on the momentum we’ve created 
and drive positive change within the industry.

To make sure we continue to cultivate an inclusive, innovative organization, 
we’ve created a global Diversity and Inclusion Council (Council). The 
Council works closely with 21CF leadership to create and implement a D&I 
vision, set a strategy across the company, and help advance initiatives 
across all our businesses. With the Council’s guidance and support, we 
will continue to put practices and policies in place that deliver business 
impact, create and nurture colleague networks that strengthen culture, 
community and career development, and deepen our efforts to cultivate 
diverse voices and storytelling.

Making sure that diversity and inclusiveness are central to all we do is more than a priority: 
it’s a way of life that we continually incorporate into our business practices. This year, the 
strategic pillars we’ve put in place – Recruiting, Retention, Advancement and Leadership 
– have led to significant D&I progress, at both the company-wide and business unit level, 
which demonstrate how we are continuing  to foster a culture where everyone from all 
backgrounds feels welcome and heard, and can do their best work. Specifically, we’re 
piloting programs that encourage supplier diversity, help parents re-enter the workforce 
after taking a break to focus on family, drive diversity in recruitment, encourage 
colleague connections through mentorship, expand opportunities for internal 
advancement and continue educating people on topics relevant to driving D&I in the 
workplace and onscreen.

We are also supporting strong colleague and creator networks through our 
Colleague Network & Resource Groups (CNRGs) and our Creative Lab programs; 
these efforts help nurture the diverse voices, stories and talent that will lead 
our business and the industry forward. This year, we’ve seen significant 
growth in these programs, with thousands of colleagues joining CNRGs that 
represent a range of cultural groups at 21CF. We also continue to develop 
and promote diverse voices and stories, both in front of and behind the 
camera, through a variety of partnerships, initiatives and programs. These 
include Fox Writers Lab, Fox Directors Lab and the Fox Filmmakers 
Lab. We’re especially proud to have launched Fox Creative Lab: Taiwan 
2018 to help create a pipeline of well-rounded creative talent for Fox 
in Asia, and to increase the diversity of ideas in the continent’s film 
and TV industry. And we’re thrilled to have partnered with AFI to 
launch the Fox DP Lab, which will help grow and develop female 
cinematographers.

We are committed to the corporate value of zero tolerance for 
sexual harassment, race discrimination, and all other forms 
of discrimination prohibited by law and a corporate policy 
that creates a safe, productive and welcoming workplace 
for everyone. At Fox News Channel we have taken steps 
to address concerns regarding workplace civility and 
governance, including the establishment of the Fox News 
Workplace Professionalism and Inclusion Council (the 
“WPIC”). The WPIC is comprised of experts in workplace 
and inclusion matters, with a majority serving from 
outside the company, and offers oversight and guidance 
to Fox News and its senior management. Reports of 
the WPIC can be found on the Workplace Civility and 
Inclusion page of the Corporate Governance section 
of the 21CF website and on the Compliance page of 
the Fox News website.

Background

BUSINESS 

PART I 

Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a diversified global media and 

entertainment company which currently manages and reports its businesses in the following four 
segments: (i) Cable Network Programming; (ii) Television; (iii) Filmed Entertainment; and (iv) Other, 
Corporate and Eliminations. The activities of Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. are conducted principally in 
the United States, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Asia and Latin America. For financial 
information regarding Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.’s segments and operations in geographic areas, see 
“Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Unless otherwise indicated, references in this 
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 (the “Annual Report”) to “we,” “us,” 
“our,” “21st Century Fox,” “Twenty-First Century Fox” or the “Company” means Twenty-First Century Fox, 
Inc. and its subsidiaries.

On June 20, 2018, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Merger Agreement and 

Plan of Merger (the “Amended and Restated Merger Agreement”) with The Walt Disney Company 
(“Disney”) and TWDC Holdco 613 Corp., a newly formed holding company and wholly-owned subsidiary 
of Disney (“New Disney”), which amends and restates in its entirety the Agreement and Plan of Merger 
that the Company entered into with Disney in December 2017, pursuant to which, among other things, the 
Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Disney pursuant to a merger of the Company 
with a subsidiary of New Disney (the “21CF Merger”). The Company stockholders may elect to receive 
$38 per share in either cash or shares of New Disney common stock (subject to adjustment for certain tax 
liabilities). The overall mix of consideration paid to the Company stockholders will be approximately 50% 
cash and 50% stock. The stock consideration is subject to a collar, which will ensure that the Company 
stockholders will receive consideration equal to $38 in value if the average Disney stock price at closing is 
between $93.53 and $114.32. Prior to the consummation of the 21CF Merger, the Company will transfer 
a portfolio of the Company’s news, sports and broadcast businesses, including the Fox News Channel, 
Fox Business Network, FOX Broadcasting Company, Fox Television Stations Group, FS1, FS2, Fox 
Deportes and Big Ten Network and certain other assets and liabilities into a newly formed subsidiary 
(“New Fox”) (the “New Fox Separation”) and distribute all of the issued and outstanding common stock of 
New Fox to the holders of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B 
Common Stock (other than holders that are subsidiaries of the Company (shares held by such holders, 
the “Hook Stock”)) on a pro rata basis (the “New Fox Distribution”). Prior to the New Fox Distribution, New 
Fox will pay the Company a dividend in the amount of $8.5 billion. New Fox will incur indebtedness 
sufficient to fund the dividend, which indebtedness will be reduced after the 21CF Merger by the amount 
of a cash payment paid by Disney to New Fox. As the New Fox Separation and New Fox Distribution will 
be taxable to the Company at the corporate level, the dividend is intended to fund the taxes resulting from 
the New Fox Separation and New Fox Distribution and certain other transactions contemplated by the 
Amended and Restated Merger Agreement (the “Transaction Tax”). The Company will retain all assets 
and liabilities not transferred to New Fox, including the Twentieth Century Fox Film and Television studios 
and certain cable and international television businesses, including FX Networks, National Geographic 
Partners, Regional Sports Networks, Fox Networks Group International and STAR India, as well as the 
Company’s interests in Hulu LLC (“Hulu”), Sky plc (“Sky”), Tata Sky Limited and Endemol Shine Group. 
The foregoing proposed transactions are collectively referred to in this report as the “Transaction”. (See 
Note 3 – Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions to the accompanying Consolidated Financial 
Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox under the heading “Disney Transaction/Distribution of New Fox” 
for further details).

On June 27, 2018, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it cleared 

the Transaction. The Company, Disney and the U.S. Department of Justice have entered into a consent 
decree that allows the Transaction to proceed, while requiring New Disney and the Company to sell the 
Regional Sports Networks within 90 days following the closing of the Transaction, which consent decree 
is subject to court approval. At separate special meetings of stockholders on July 27, 2018, the 
Company’s stockholders adopted the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement, Disney’s stockholders 
approved the stock issuance, and each company’s stockholders adopted or approved the other proposals 
voted on at the special meetings.

1

The consummation of the Transaction remains subject to various conditions, including among 
others, (i) the consummation of the New Fox Separation, (ii) the receipt of certain tax opinions with 
respect to the treatment of the Transaction under U.S. and Australian tax laws, and (iii) the receipt of 
certain regulatory approvals and governmental consents. The Transaction is expected to be completed in 
the first half of calendar year 2019.

In December 2016, the Company announced it reached agreement with Sky, in which the Company 
currently has an approximate 39% interest, on the terms of a recommended pre-conditional cash offer by 
the Company for the fully diluted share capital of Sky which the Company does not already own (the “Sky 
Acquisition”), at a price of £10.75 per Sky share subject to certain payments of dividends. On July 11, 
2018, the Company announced an increased offer price for the Sky Acquisition, of £14.00 per Sky share 
(approximately $19.9 billion in the aggregate), payable in cash, subject to reduction if certain dividends or 
other distributions are paid by Sky (the “Increased Offer”). On August 7, 2018, the Company posted an 
offer document to Sky shareholders in connection with the Increased Offer and announced that it intends 
to implement the Sky Acquisition by way of a takeover offer within the meaning of Part 28 of the 
Companies Act 2006 (the “UK Companies Act”) rather than by means of a scheme of arrangement in 
accordance with Part 26 of the UK Companies Act, which had been the proposed structure of the Sky 
Acquisition prior to that date. The Company has noted that the deadline for publication of any revised 
offer document in respect of its Increased Offer is September 22, 2018.

In connection with the Increased Offer, on July 11, 2018, the Company entered into a letter 

agreement with Disney, pursuant to which Disney consented to the increased indebtedness that would be 
incurred by the Company as a result of the Increased Offer. Also, in the event that Disney does not 
complete the Mergers due to the failure to obtain regulatory approvals or in certain other limited 
circumstances, Disney has agreed to reimburse the Company for an amount equal to the difference 
between the cash consideration of £14.00 and £13.00 for each share of Sky purchased by the Company 
pursuant to the revised terms of the Increased Offer, plus any interest and fees on such amount.

The Sky Acquisition has received unconditional clearance by all competent competition authorities 

including the European Commission, and has been cleared on public interest and plurality grounds. In 
addition, on July 12, 2018, the Sky Acquisition received approval by the UK Secretary of State for Digital, 
Culture, Media and Sport (the “Secretary of State”), subject to accepted undertakings regarding the 
divestment of and financial support for Sky News as described in Note 3 – Acquisitions, Disposals and 
Other Transactions to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox 
under the heading “Sky Acquisition”. However, the Sky Acquisition is conditional on, among other things, 
the Company securing valid acceptances of the Increased Offer in respect of Sky shares which represent 
75% or more of the Sky shares that the Company does not own. The Company reserves the right to 
reduce this acceptance condition to a simple majority of all Sky shares (including those held by the 
Company).

If the Company does not acquire 100% of Sky pursuant to the Sky Acquisition or another party has 

not acquired more than 50% of the ordinary shares of Sky, in each case prior to the completion of the 
Transaction, Disney will be required to make a mandatory offer for all the outstanding ordinary shares of 
Sky not already owned by the Company within 28 days of the Transaction closing. On July 13, 2018, the 
Panel on Takeovers and Mergers of the United Kingdom (the "U.K. Takeover Panel"), ruled that any such 
offer would be required to be made in cash and at a price of £14.00 for each ordinary share in Sky (the 
"July 13 Ruling"), which ruling was upheld on August 3, 2018 by the U.K. Takeover Panel’s Hearings 
Committee on appeal. Certain interested parties have appealed the ruling of the Hearings Committee to 
the Takeover Appeal Board.

On April 25, 2018, Comcast Corporation (“Comcast”) announced a pre-conditional cash offer for the 

fully diluted share capital of Sky at a price of £12.50 per Sky share which was subject to regulatory 
preconditions (which have now been satisfied) as well as additional closing conditions. On July 11, 2018, 
Comcast announced a revised cash offer for the fully diluted share capital of Sky at a price of £14.75 per 
Sky share that was recommended by the independent committee of Sky’s board of directors.

2

Any increase in the debt financing for the Sky Acquisition or sale by the Company of its interest in 
Sky would require Disney’s consent. Completion of the Sky Acquisition is not a condition to either party’s 
obligation to consummate the Transaction. Completion of the Sky Acquisition will not affect the amount or 
form of consideration that stockholders of the Company receive in the Transaction.

For further information, see Note 3 – Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions to the 

accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox under the heading “Sky 
Acquisition”.

In fiscal 2016, the Company formed National Geographic Partners, LLC with the National 

Geographic Society to hold the National Geographic Channels (as defined below) and the publishing, 
travel and certain other businesses that had been owned by the National Geographic Society. For further 
information, see Note 3 – Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions to the accompanying 
Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox under the heading “National Geographic 
Partners”.

On November 12, 2014, the Company sold its 100% and 57% ownership stakes in Sky Italia and 

Sky Deutschland AG (“Sky Deutschland”), respectively, to British Sky Broadcasting Group plc 
(subsequently renamed Sky plc) for approximately $8.8 billion in value comprised of approximately $8.2 
billion in cash received, net of $650 million of cash paid to acquire Sky’s 21% interest in NGC Network 
International LLC (“NGCI”) and NGC Network Latin America LLC (“NGCLA” and together with NGCI, 
“NGC International”), increasing the Company’s ownership stake in NGC International to 73%. In 
connection with this transaction, the Company participated in Sky’s equity offering in July 2014 by 
purchasing additional shares in Sky for approximately $900 million and maintained the Company’s 
approximate 39% ownership interest. As a result of the transaction, Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland 
ceased to be consolidated subsidiaries of the Company.

On June 28, 2013, the Company completed the separation of its business into two independent 

publicly traded companies (the “News Corp Separation”) by distributing to its stockholders shares of the 
new News Corporation (“News Corp”). The Company retained its interests in a global portfolio of cable, 
broadcast, film, pay-TV and satellite assets spanning six continents. News Corp holds the Company’s 
former businesses including newspapers, information services and integrated marketing services, digital 
real estate services, book publishing, digital education and sports programming and pay-TV distribution in 
Australia. The Company completed the News Corp Separation by distributing to its stockholders one 
share of News Corp Class A common stock for every four shares of the Company’s Class A common 
stock held on June 21, 2013, and one share of News Corp Class B common stock for every four shares 
of the Company’s Class B common stock held on June 21, 2013. The Company’s stockholders received 
cash in lieu of fractional shares. Following the News Corp Separation, the Company does not beneficially 
own any shares of News Corp Class A common stock or News Corp Class B common stock.

In connection with the News Corp Separation, the Company and News Corp entered into a 

separation and distribution agreement (the “News Corp Separation and Distribution Agreement”) and 
certain other related agreements, pursuant to which the Company has agreed to indemnify News Corp 
and News Corp has agreed to indemnify the Company for certain liabilities.

The Company’s fiscal year ends on June 30 of each year. Through its predecessor, the Company 
was incorporated in 1979 under the Company Act 1961 of South Australia, Australia. At June 30, 2018, 
the Company had approximately 22,400 full-time employees. The Company’s principal executive offices

channels primarily feature Twentieth Century Fox theatrical motion pictures and series (except in Brazil, 
where the Fox Premium channels only feature series) and those of other studios, dubbed in Spanish or 
Portuguese and/or in English with Spanish or Portuguese subtitles. The Fox Premium streaming service 
was launched in Mexico and Brazil as a standalone service available to subscribers without the need to 
subscribe to a pay television service and such service will subsequently be launched in other countries 
throughout Latin America. In addition to the existing Fox Premium standalone streaming service, the Fox+ 
standalone streaming service was launched in February 2018 in Brazil and Mexico. The Fox+ service 
consists of the Fox Premium streaming service and the Fox Basic streaming service. The Fox Basic 
standalone streaming service will be launched during the second half of calendar year 2018 in Mexico 
and Brazil. In addition to traditional means of distribution, content distribution occurs via internet protocol 
television (“IPTV”) and as an additive, authenticated, Internet-delivered service by traditional distributors 
of the linear networks.

FNG owns and operates the Fox Sports networks in Latin America. FNG distributes Spanish-
language sports programming services in Latin America (other than Brazil), which feature local and 
international soccer events (including Copa Libertadores de América and UEFA Champions League),

(“MGH”). MGH operates television, radio, production, digital and other media businesses in Afghanistan 
and elsewhere in the Middle East, Central and South Asia, and Africa.

Competition

General. Cable network programming is a highly competitive business. Cable networks compete for 

content and distribution and, when distribution is obtained, for viewers and advertisers with free-to-air 
broadcast television, radio, print media, motion picture theaters, DVDs, Blu-ray high definition format 
discs (“Blu-rays”), Internet delivered free, advertising supported, subscription and rental services, wireless 
and portable viewing devices and other sources of information and entertainment. Important competitive 
factors include the prices charged for programming, the quantity, quality and variety of programming 
offered, the accessibility of such programming, the ability to adapt to new technologies and distribution 
platforms, quality of user experience and the effectiveness of marketing efforts.

FOX News and FOX Business Network. FOX News Channel’s primary competition comes from the 

cable networks CNN, HLN (CNN’s Headline News) and MSNBC. FOX Business Network’s primary 
competition comes from the cable networks CNBC and Bloomberg Television. FOX News Channel and 
FOX Business Network also compete for viewers and advertisers within a broad spectrum of television 
networks, including other non-news cable networks and free-to-air broadcast television networks.

Sports programming operations. A number of basic and pay television programming services, such 

as ESPN and NBC Sports Network, as well as free-to-air stations and broadcast networks, provide 
programming that also targets FS1, FS2, BTN and the FSN RSNs’ respective audience. On a national 
level, the primary competitors to FS1, FS2, BTN and FSN are ESPN, ESPN2, NBC Sports Network, Golf 
Channel and league-owned networks such as NFL Network, NHL Network, NBA TV and MLB Network. In 
regional markets, the FSN RSNs and BTN compete with other RSNs (including those operated by team 
owners, collegiate conferences and cable television distributors), local broadcast television stations and 
other sports programming providers and distributors. FS1, FS2, BTN and FSN also face competition 
online from ESPN+, Yahoo Sports, Facebook, Twitter, ESPN.com, NBCSports.com and CBSSports.com, 
among others.

In addition, FS1, FS2, BTN, the FSN RSNs and FSN compete, to varying degrees, for sports 

programming rights. The FSN RSNs compete for local and regional rights with local broadcast television 
stations and other local and regional sports networks, including sports networks launched by team 
owners, collegiate conferences and cable television distributors. FS1, FS2, BTN and FSN compete for 
national rights principally with a number of national cable and broadcast services that specialize in or 
carry sports programming, including sports networks launched by the leagues and collegiate conferences. 
Cable television distributors sometimes contract directly with the sports teams in their service area for the 
right to distribute a number of those teams’ games on their systems. In certain markets, the owners of the 
cable television distributors, also own one or more of the professional teams in the region, increasing their 
ability to launch competing networks and also limiting the professional sports rights available for 
acquisition by the FSN RSNs. Additionally, cable television distributors and online and social media 
properties such as Amazon, Yahoo Sports, Facebook and Twitter compete with the Company’s cable 
sports networks by acquiring and distributing sports content to their online users.

FX and FXX. FX and FXX face competition from a number of basic cable and pay television 

programming services, such as USA Network (“USA”), TNT, Spike TV, HBO and Showtime, as well as 
free-to-air broadcast networks, and Internet subscription and rental services such as Netflix and Amazon, 
and free-to-consumer video sharing websites such as YouTube, that provide programming that targets 
the same viewing audience as FX and FXX. FX and FXX also face competition from these programming 
services in the acquisition of distribution rights to movie and series programming.

National Geographic Partners. In the United States, National Geographic Channels face competition 

for viewers and advertising from a number of basic cable and broadcast television channels, such as 
Discovery Channel, History, Animal Planet, Travel Channel, Science, American Heroes Channel, FYI and 

9

TruTV, as well as free-to-air broadcast networks, sports, news and general entertainment networks which 
have acquired or produced competing programming and Internet subscription and rental services. 
Internationally, the National Geographic Channels compete with various local and foreign television 
services providers and distribution networks, including local broadcasters and factual channels from 
Discovery Communications and A&E Television Networks, for audiences, advertising, content acquisition 
and distribution platforms.

FNG International. Internationally, the Company’s cable businesses compete with various local and 

foreign television audiovisual services providers and distribution networks for audiences, advertising, 
content acquisition and linear/nonlinear distribution platforms.

STAR India. In India, the pay television broadcasting industry and the on-demand streaming 
business have several participants. STAR India’s channels compete with both pay and free-to-air 
channels since they are delivered primarily by common cable and DTH. STAR India also competes in 
India to acquire Hindi and other Indian language film and programming rights, and internationally for 
English film and programming rights for television series and media rights for sporting events.

(a)

VHF television stations transmit on Channels 2 through 13 and UHF television stations on Channels 
14 through 51. The Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) applies a discount (the “UHF 
Discount”) which attributes only 50% of the television households in a local television market to the 
audience reach of a UHF television station for purposes of calculating whether that station’s owner 
complies with the national station ownership cap imposed by FCC regulations and by statute; in 
making this calculation, only the station’s RF broadcast channel is considered. In a duopoly market, 
both stations must be UHF for the discount to apply. In addition, the coverage of two commonly 
owned stations in the same market is counted only once. The percentages listed are rounded and 
do not take into account the UHF Discount. For more information regarding the FCC’s national 
station ownership cap, see “Government Regulation—Television” in this Annual Report.

(b) MyNetworkTV licensee station.
(c) WWOR hosts television station WRNN, New Rochelle, NY, licensed to WRNN License Company, 

LLC, an unrelated third party pursuant to a channel sharing agreement between Fox Television 
Stations and WRNN License Company, LLC. As of May 1, 2018, a portion of the spectrum formerly 
licensed to WWOR is now shared with and licensed to WRNN.
Beginning June 11, 2018, WPWR-TV channel shares with WFLD.
Station WPWR is an affiliate of The CW Television Network during prime time and other network time 
periods. MyNetworkTV programming is telecast during other time periods.
Beginning July 18, 2018, WDCA channel shares with WTTG.

Independent station.
The Company also owns and operates full power station KFTC, Channel 26, Bemidji, MN as a 
satellite station of WFTC, Channel 29, Minneapolis, MN. Station KFTC is in addition to the 28 full 
power stations described in this section.
Beginning June 6, 2018, WMYT-TV channel shares with WJZY.

In March 2017, the FCC concluded a voluntary auction to reclaim 84 megahertz (“MHz”) of 

television broadcast station spectrum. Fox Television Stations had three stations’ bids to relinquish 
spectrum accepted by the FCC as part of the auction. As a result, the spectrum previously utilized by 
stations WDCA, Washington, DC; WMYT, Charlotte, NC; and WPWR, Chicago, IL has been relinquished 
to the FCC in June 2018 (WPWR-TV and WMYT-TV) and July 2018 (WDCA). In each of those markets, 
Fox Television Stations has begun channel sharing arrangements whereby both of its stations in the 
market operate using a single 6 MHz channel. This enables each of WDCA, WMYT and WPWR to 
continue its operations. For further information, see “–Business Overview–Government Regulation–
Television”.

In May 2018, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with 

Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. (“Sinclair”) and Tribune Media Company (“Tribune”) to acquire seven 
television stations from Tribune for approximately $910 million subject to certain purchase price 
adjustments. On August 9, 2018, Tribune exercised its right to terminate its merger agreement with 
Sinclair and correspondingly, the Company’s Purchase Agreement was also terminated.

FOX Broadcasting Company (“FOX”)

FOX has 208 FOX Affiliates, including 17 stations owned and operated by the Company, which 

reach approximately 99.9% of all U.S. television households. In general, each week FOX regularly 
delivers to its affiliates 15 hours of prime-time programming, 60 minutes of late-night programming on 
Saturday and 60 minutes of news programming on Sunday. During the 2017-2018 traditional broadcast 
season, FOX’s prime-time entertainment programming featured such series as 9-1-1, Bob’s Burgers, 
Empire, Family Guy, The Gifted, Gotham, Lethal Weapon, The Orville, The Resident, Star and The 
Simpsons; unscripted series such as The Four: Battle for Stardom, Hell’s Kitchen, Master Chef Junior and 
Showtime at the Apollo; event series such as The X-Files; and event specials such as A Christmas Story 
Live!. In addition, a significant component of FOX’s programming consists of sports programming, with 
FOX providing to its affiliates live coverage of the NFC of the NFL (including coverage of the NFC 
playoffs) and MLB (including post-season and the World Series), as well as live coverage of the Monster 
Energy NASCAR Cup Series (including the Daytona 500), USGA golf events (including the men’s U.S. 
Open), college football and basketball, UFC and international soccer (including FIFA World Cup events). 
The Company has acquired rights to the NFL’s Thursday Night Football package and will begin airing live 
coverage of these games in August 2018.

FOX’s prime-time line-up is intended to appeal primarily to target audiences of 18 to 49-year old 

adults, the demographic group that advertisers seek to reach most often, with an emphasis on the 18 to 
34-year old adult demographic coveted by advertisers. During the 2017-2018 traditional September to 
May broadcast season, FOX ranked third among adults ages 18 to 49 (tied with ABC Television Network 
(“ABC”) and based on Live+7 ratings), just one-tenth of a rating point behind CBS Television Network 
(“CBS”). FOX ranked second among adults ages 18 to 34 (based on Live+7 ratings). FOX ranked second 
in prime-time programming among teens ages 12 to 17 (tied with ABC and CBS and based on Live+7 
ratings). FOX has ranked among the top two networks in adults ages 18 to 34 for the past 23 years 
(1995-1996 to 2017-2018) and in teens ages 12 to 17 for the past 27 years (1991-1992 to 2017-2018). 
FOX’s 9-1-1 ranked among the season’s top three new entertainment series among adults ages 18 to 49, 
adults ages 18 to 34 and teens ages 12 to 17, while ranking second in the same measures among new 
dramas. Empire ranked among the season’s top five broadcast dramas among adults ages 18 to 34 and 
teens ages 12 to 17 for the fourth consecutive season. FOX has seven of the season’s top 20 new series, 
more than any other network, including: 9-1-1, The Orville, The Gifted, The Resident, and The Four: 
Battle for Stardom. Inclusive of all telecasts, the median age of the FOX viewer is 51 years, as compared 
to 55 years for each of ABC and NBC Television Network (“NBC”), and 60 years for CBS. Excluding all 

12

sports and repeat programming, the median age of the FOX viewer is 50 years, as compared to 56 years 
for ABC, 57 years for NBC and 61 years for CBS.

FOX obtains programming from major television studios, including Twentieth Century Fox 

Television, and independent television production companies pursuant to license agreements. The terms 
of those agreements generally provide FOX with the right to broadcast a television series for a minimum 
of four seasons.

National sports programming is obtained through license agreements with professional or collegiate 

sports leagues or organizations. FOX’s current licenses with the NFL, MLB, college football and 
basketball conferences, NASCAR, FIFA and USGA are secured by long-term agreements.

FOX provides programming to the FOX Affiliates in accordance with affiliation agreements of 

varying durations, which grant to each affiliate the right to broadcast network television programming on 
the affiliated station. Such agreements typically run three or more years and have staggered expiration 
dates. These affiliation agreements require FOX Affiliates to carry FOX programming in all time periods in 
which FOX programming is offered to those affiliates, subject to certain exceptions stated in the affiliation 
agreements.

FOX also distributes programming through its network-branded website, FOX.com, and its 

FOXNOW application which offer live streaming of FOX shows and programming from many FOX-
affiliated broadcast stations, and licenses programming for distribution through the websites and 
applications of cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite operators, telecommunications 
companies and online video distributors.

MyNetworkTV

The programming distribution service, Master Distribution Service, Inc. (branded as MyNetworkTV), 

distributes two hours per night, Monday through Friday, of off-network programming from syndicators to 
its licensee stations. As of June 30, 2018, MyNetworkTV had license and delivery agreements covering 
183 stations, including 10 stations owned and operated by the Company, reaching approximately 97% of 
U.S. households.

Competition. The network television broadcasting business is highly competitive. FOX and 

MyNetworkTV compete for audiences, programming and advertising revenue with other broadcast 
networks, such as ABC, NBC, CBS and The CW Television Network, independent television stations, 
cable and direct broadcast satellite distribution services, cable and direct broadcast satellite television 
networks, as well as other media, including digital platforms, Internet-delivered free, advertising 
supported, subscription and rental services, and DVDs, Blu-rays and other physical media. In addition, 
FOX and MyNetworkTV compete with other broadcast networks and programming distribution services to 
secure affiliations or station agreements with independently owned television stations in markets across 
the United States. ABC, NBC and CBS each broadcasts a significantly greater number of hours of 
programming than FOX and, accordingly, may be able to designate or change time periods in which 
programming is to be broadcast with greater flexibility than FOX. In addition, future technological 
developments may affect competition within the broadcast television marketplace.

Each of the stations owned and operated by Fox Television Stations also competes for advertising 
revenues with other television stations, radio and cable systems in its respective market area, along with 
other advertising media, such as digital platforms, Internet apps and websites, newspapers, magazines, 
outdoor advertising and direct mail. All of the stations owned and operated by Fox Television Stations are 
located in highly competitive markets. Additional items that are material to the competitive position of 
each of the television stations include management experience, authorized power and assigned 
frequency of that station. Competition for sales of broadcast advertising time is based primarily on the 
anticipated and actually delivered size and demographic characteristics of audiences as determined by 
various rating services, price, the time of day when the advertising is to be broadcast, competition from 
the other broadcast networks, cable television systems, Direct Broadcast Satellite Television (“DBS”) 

13

services and digital media and general economic conditions. Competition for audiences is based primarily 
on the selection of programming, the acceptance of which is dependent on the reaction of the viewing 
public, which is often difficult to predict.

Filmed Entertainment

The Company is engaged in the production and acquisition of live-action and animated motion 

pictures for distribution and licensing in all formats in all entertainment media worldwide, and the 
production and licensing of television programming worldwide.

Motion Picture Production and Distribution

One of the world’s largest producers and distributors of motion pictures, Twentieth Century Fox Film 

(“TCFF”) produces, acquires and distributes motion pictures throughout the world under a variety of 
arrangements. During fiscal 2018, TCFF placed 19 motion pictures in general release in the United 
States. The motion pictures of TCFF are produced and/or distributed by the following units of TCFF: 
Twentieth Century Fox and Fox 2000, which produce and acquire motion pictures for mainstream 
audiences; Fox Searchlight Pictures, which produces and acquires specialized motion pictures; and 
Twentieth Century Fox Animation, which produces feature length animated motion pictures. In addition, 
Fox International Productions, Inc. co-produces, co-finances and acquires local-language motion pictures 
primarily for distribution outside the United States. The motion pictures produced and/or distributed by 
TCFF in the United States and international territories in fiscal 2018 included War for the Planet of the 
Apes, Kingsman: The Golden Circle, Murder on the Orient Express, The Greatest Showman, Deadpool 2, 
The Shape of Water and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. TCFF has released or currently 
plans to release approximately 20 motion pictures in the United States in fiscal 2019, including The Hate 
U Give, Bohemian Rhapsody, Alita: Battle Angel, X-Men: Dark Phoenix, Can You Ever Forgive Me, The 
Favourite and The Aftermath. Pursuant to an agreement with Monarchy Enterprises Holdings B.V. 
(“MEH”), the parent company of New Regency, and certain of MEH’s subsidiaries, TCFF distributes 
certain New Regency films and all films co-financed by TCFF and New Regency in all media worldwide, 
excluding a number of international territories with respect to television rights. Among its fiscal 2019 
releases, TCFF currently expects to distribute three co-financed films with New Regency.

The Company’s arrangement with DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc. (“DWA”) for domestic and 

international distribution of DWA’s new release animated motion pictures and certain other library motion 
pictures and programming controlled by DWA expired in December 2017. The Company had home 
entertainment rights to DWA titles for part of fiscal 2018 and has certain television distribution rights 
through early fiscal 2019, and titles included in approved television distribution licenses may have 
exhibition periods continuing after that date.

Motion picture companies, such as TCFF, typically seek to generate revenues from various 

distribution channels. TCFF derives its worldwide revenues from motion pictures and other program 
distribution primarily from four basic sources (set forth in general chronology of exploitation): 
(i) distribution of motion pictures for theatrical exhibition in the United States and Canada and markets 
outside of the United States and Canada (“international” markets); (ii) distribution of motion pictures and 
other programming in various home media formats, including digital distribution; (iii) distribution of motion 
pictures and other programming for exhibition on premium pay and SVOD services; and (iv) distribution of 
motion pictures and other programming for exhibition on free television networks, other broadcast 
program services, independent television stations and basic cable programming services, including 
certain services which are affiliates of the Company. The Company does not always have rights in all 
media of exhibition to all motion pictures that it releases, and does not necessarily distribute a given 
motion picture in all of the foregoing media in all markets. The Company believes that the pre-release 
marketing of a feature film is an integral part of its motion picture distribution strategy and generally 
begins marketing efforts three to six months in advance of a film’s release date in any given territory. The 
Company markets and distributes its films worldwide principally through its own companies.

Through Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment LLC and TCFF, the Company distributes 

motion pictures and other programming produced by units of TCFF, its affiliates and other producers in 
the United States, Canada and international markets in all home media formats, including the sale and 
rental of DVDs and Blu-rays. In fiscal 2018, the domestic home entertainment division released or re-
released approximately 1,136 produced and acquired titles, including 23 new TCFF film releases, 
approximately 680 catalog titles and approximately 433 television and non-theatrical titles. In international 
markets, the Company distributed, produced and acquired titles both directly and through foreign 
distribution channels, with approximately 931 releases in fiscal 2018, including approximately 27 new 
TCFF film releases, approximately 584 catalog titles and approximately 320 television and non-theatrical 
releases. The Company enters into domestic and international license arrangements with third parties for 
distribution by electronic sell-through (“EST”), video-on-demand (“VOD”) and/or pay-per-view (“PPV”). 
Distribution on an EST basis enables consumers to acquire the right to retain programs on a permanent 
basis. The EST, VOD and PPV arrangements generally provide for license fees based on a percentage of 
the licensee’s gross receipts received from consumers and in some cases a guaranteed minimum fee per 
consumer transaction. In addition, these arrangements generally provide for a minimum number of 
scheduled PPV exhibitions per program and for continuous VOD availability of each program to 
consumers during a fixed period. In fiscal 2018, the Company continued its worldwide home video 
distribution arrangement with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (“MGM”), releasing approximately 331 MGM home 
entertainment theatrical, catalog and television programs domestically and 315 internationally. The 
Company also continued its domestic home video distribution arrangements with Lions Gate Films Inc. 
(“Lions Gate”) (U.S. only), including titles from Anchor Bay Entertainment, LLC (“Anchor Bay”) (U.S. and 
Canada), releasing approximately 1,347 Lions Gate (including Anchor Bay) home entertainment 
theatrical, catalog and television programs. During fiscal 2018, the domestic home entertainment division 
released 462 Blu-ray titles, including 22 new TCFF film releases, 364 catalog titles and 76 television and 
non-theatrical releases. In international markets, the Company released 466 Blu-ray titles, including 23 
new TCFF film releases, 378 catalog titles and 65 television and non-theatrical releases. The Company 
also distributed 164 Blu-ray titles from MGM domestically and 127 titles internationally and 481 Blu-ray 
titles from Lions Gate (including Anchor Bay) domestically.

Units of TCFF license motion pictures and other programming in the United States and international 

markets to various third party and certain affiliated subscription pay television services, SVOD services, 
free television networks and basic cable programming services for distribution by means of various 
media, which may include DBS, cable television systems and the Internet. The license agreements 
reflecting the subscription pay television arrangements generally provide for a specified number of 
exhibitions of the program during a fixed term in exchange for a license fee that is based on a variety of 
factors, including the box office performance of each program and the number of subscribers to the 
service or system. Among third party license arrangements that units of TCFF have in place in the United 
States for subscription pay television exhibition of motion pictures is an exclusive license agreement with 
HBO, providing for the licensing of films initially released for theatrical exhibition. Units of TCFF also 
license programming to SVOD services in the United States. Such licenses enable the consumer to view 
individual programming selected by the viewer for a subscription fee, typically on a monthly basis. In 
international markets, units of TCFF license motion pictures and other programming to subscription pay 
television and SVOD services operated by leading third parties, as well as to such services operated by 
various affiliated entities of the Company. In addition, units of TCFF license motion pictures and other 
programming in international markets for exhibition on free television networks, including basic cable 
programming services, both to independent third party broadcasters as well as to services operated by 
affiliated entities of the Company.

Competition. Motion picture production and distribution are highly competitive businesses. The 
Company competes with other film studios, independent production companies and others including 
additional entrants into the market for the acquisition of artistic properties, the services of creative and 
technical personnel, exhibition outlets and the public’s interest in its products. The number of motion 
pictures released by the Company’s competitors, particularly the other major film studios, in any given 
period may create an oversupply of product in the market, which may reduce the Company’s shares of 
gross box office admissions and may make it more difficult for the Company’s motion pictures to succeed. 
The commercial success of the motion pictures produced and/or distributed by the Company is affected 

15

substantially by the public’s unpredictable response to them. The competitive risks affecting the 
Company’s home entertainment business include the number of home entertainment titles released by 
the Company’s competitors that may create an oversupply of product in the market, competition among 
home media formats, such as DVDs and Blu-rays, and other methods of distribution, such as EST and 
VOD services.

The Company faces ongoing risks associated with controlling unauthorized copying and distribution 

of the Company’s programs. For a further discussion of issues relating to unauthorized copying and 
distribution of the Company’s programs, see “—Intellectual Property.”

Television Programming, Production and Domestic Syndication Distribution

Twentieth Century Fox Television (“TCFTV”). During fiscal 2018, TCFTV produced television 
programs for FOX, FX, ABC, NBC, CBS, Turner Broadcasting System (“TBS”), and Netflix. TCFTV 
currently produces, or has orders to produce, episodes of the following television series: 9-1-1, Bob’s 
Burgers, The Cool Kids, Empire, Family Guy, The Gifted, Last Man Standing, The Orville, The Passage, 
Proven Innocent, Rel, Rent (live musical event), The Resident, The Simpsons and Star for FOX; 
American Horror Story for FX; Fresh Off The Boat, Modern Family, Single Parents and Speechless for 
ABC; This Is Us for NBC; Life in Pieces for CBS; American Dad for TBS; Arrested Development and 
Mixtape for Netflix; and Central Park for Apple. Generally, a television network or cable network will 
license a specified number of episodes for exhibition during the license period. All other distribution rights, 
including international and off-network syndication rights, are typically retained by TCFTV, utilized by 
other units of the Company or sold to third parties.

Fox21 Television Studios (“Fox21”). Fox21 produces television programs for major U.S. cable 

networks and SVOD services including American Crime Story, Mayans MC and Pose for FX; The Chi and 
Homeland for Showtime; Queen of the South for USA; The Politician and Ratched for Netflix; and Genius 
and The Hot Zone for National Geographic Channel.

Television programs generally are produced under contracts that provide for license fees that may 
cover only a portion of the anticipated production costs. As these costs have increased in recent years, 
the resulting deficit between production costs and license fees for domestic first-run programming also 
has increased. Therefore, additional licensing is often critical to the financial success of a series. 
Successful U.S. network television series are typically (i) licensed for first-run exhibition in international 
markets, (ii) made available for EST, including individual episodes and full series, (iii) licensed for VOD, 
PPV and SVOD services, including individual episodes and full series, (iv) released in DVD and Blu-ray 
box sets, (v) licensed for off-network exhibition in the United States (including in syndication and to cable 
programmers) and (vi) licensed for further television exhibition in international markets. Typically, a series 
must be broadcast for at least three to four television seasons for there to be a sufficient number of 
episodes to offer the series in syndication or to cable and DBS programmers in the United States. The 
decision of a television network to continue a series through an entire television season or to renew a 
series for another television season depends largely on the series’ audience ratings.

Twentieth Television. Twentieth Television licenses both television programming and feature films 
for domestic syndication to television stations, basic cable and advertising-supported video-on-demand 
(“AVOD”) services in the United States. Twentieth Television distributes a program portfolio that includes 
the Company’s library of television and film assets, and first-run programming for sales to local stations, 
including stations owned and operated by the Company, as well as to basic cable networks.

Twentieth Television derives revenue from off-network, theatrical and first-run program sales in the 

form of cash license fees paid by broadcast, cable and AVOD licensees, and from the sales of national 
advertising units retained by Twentieth Television in its programs. Twentieth Television licenses such 
shows as Modern Family, New Girl, Last Man Standing, Archer, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Family 
Guy, Bones, How I Met Your Mother, The Cleveland Show, Bob’s Burgers and The Simpsons to cable 
and broadcast networks. First-run programs distributed by Twentieth Television include television’s 
longest running court show Divorce Court, the entertainment magazine program Dish Nation, Top 30 and 

16

the daily pop culture program Page Six TV. Additionally, Twentieth Television also sells national 
advertising on behalf of other third party syndicators.

Competition. Similar to motion picture production and distribution, production and distribution of 

television programming is extremely competitive. The Company competes with other film studios, 
independent production companies, Internet subscription and rental service providers including additional 
entrants into the market, and others for the acquisition of artistic properties, the services of creative and 
technical personnel, exhibition outlets and the public’s interest in its products. In addition, television 
networks have affiliated production companies from which they are increasingly obtaining their 
programming, which has reduced the demand for programming from other non-affiliated parties.

Motion Picture and Television Library

The Company’s motion picture and television library (the “Fox Library”) consists of varying 

ownership and distribution rights to several thousand previously released motion pictures and many well-
known television programs. Motion pictures in the Fox Library include many successful and well-known 
titles, such as The Sound of Music, Mrs. Doubtfire, Home Alone, the Star Wars series (original six 
episodes), the Die Hard series, the X-Men series, Independence Day, the Ice Age series, The Planet of 
the Apes series, Sideways, Walk the Line, The Devil Wears Prada, Little Miss Sunshine, the Night at the 
Museum series, the Alvin and the Chipmunks series, Slumdog Millionaire, Juno, Life of Pi, the Taken 
series, 12 Years a Slave, The Martian, The Greatest Showman and Deadpool. In addition, the Company 
has distributed the top two box office grossing films of all time worldwide, which are Avatar and Titanic 
(together with Paramount Pictures Corporation).

The Fox Library contains varying ownership and distribution rights to many television series and 

made-for-television motion pictures. The television programming in the Fox Library consists of such 
classic series as 24, How I Met Your Mother, King of the Hill, Prison Break, Boston Legal, My Name is 
Earl, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, M*A*S*H, Hill Street Blues, Doogie Howser, M.D., L.A. Law, The 
Wonder Years, The Practice, Ally McBeal, Angel, Dharma & Greg, In Living Color, The X-Files, Buffy the 
Vampire Slayer, The Cleveland Show, The Americans, Futurama, Glee, The Last Man on Earth, New Girl, 
Sleepy Hollow, Sons of Anarchy, The Shield, Burn Notice, Malcolm in the Middle, Raising Hope, White 
Collar and NYPD Blue, as well as prior seasons of such current series as The Simpsons, Family Guy, 
Arrested Development, Last Man Standing, This Is Us, Modern Family, Homeland, Bob’s Burgers, 
American Dad, American Horror Story, Empire and Fresh Off The Boat.

Other, Corporate and Eliminations

The Other, Corporate and Eliminations segment consists primarily of corporate overhead and 

eliminations.

Equity Interests
Sky

The Company holds an approximate 39% interest in Sky. Sky’s ordinary shares are listed on the 

London Stock Exchange under the symbol “SKY”. Sky is Europe’s leading entertainment company, 
operating the most comprehensive multichannel, multi-platform pay television service in the UK, Ireland, 
Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. Sky also retails communications services in the UK and

including wholesaling its channel portfolio, selling advertising on its own and partner channels and its 
international television program distribution operation. In December 2016, the Company made an offer to 
purchase the fully diluted share capital of Sky which the Company does not already own. In July 2018, 
the Company announced the Increased Offer. On August 7, 2018, the Company posted an offer 
document to Sky shareholders in connection with the Increased Offer. For further information, see Note 3 
– Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions to the accompanying Consolidated Financial 
Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox under the heading “Sky Acquisition”.

17

Hulu

The Company has an approximate 30% equity interest in Hulu which operates subscription-based 

services that offer: (i) both linear and on-demand video programming and (ii) on-demand only video 
programming. Hulu also provides on-demand video programming for distribution through certain 
advertising-supported, free-to-the-consumer services, including Yahoo View. These services offer video 
content from Fox and the other partners in Hulu – NBCUniversal, The Walt Disney Company, and Time 
Warner Inc. Hulu’s subscription service for linear and on-demand video programming includes over 50 
linear channels and such channels’ on-demand video content. Hulu’s on-demand only services include 
video content from approximately 200 other third-party content licensors. Hulu’s subscription-based on-
demand only video service is available on a monthly basis at Hulu.com and all services are available on a 
monthly basis through software applications on many Internet-connected devices, including smart 
phones, tablets, gaming consoles and set-top boxes.

Endemol Shine Group

The Company and funds managed by Apollo Global Management, LLC (“Apollo”) formed a joint 

venture in December 2014 to which the Company contributed its interests in Shine Group and cash. The 
Company and Apollo have an equal ownership interest in the joint venture. Endemol Shine Group, a 
global multi-platform content provider, has creative operations across all the world’s major markets, with a 
diverse portfolio, both scripted and non-scripted, coupled with digital, gaming, and distribution operations.

languages airing on more than 280 channels around the world. (See Note 7 – Investments to the 
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company for further discussion).

Tata Sky

The Company holds an approximate 20% direct interest and an approximate 10% indirect economic 

interest in Tata Sky Limited which owns and operates a DTH platform in India.

Other Investments

The Company has a minority equity interest in Vice Holdings Inc., a digital media company. 

The Company has a minority equity interest in DraftKings, Inc., a leading operator of online fantasy 

games and contests.

Government Regulation
General

Various aspects of the Company’s activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions 

around the world. The Company believes that it is in material compliance with the requirements imposed 
by those laws and regulations described herein. The introduction of new laws and regulations in countries 
where the Company’s products and services are produced or distributed (and changes in the 
enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries) could have a negative impact on the 
interests of the Company.

Cable Network Programming

Asia. Most countries in which the Company operates have a regulatory framework for the satellite 
and cable television industry. Government regulation of direct reception and redistribution via cable or 
other means of satellite television signals, where it is addressed at all, is treated differently in each 
country. At one extreme are absolute bans on private ownership of satellite receiving equipment. Some 
countries, however, have adopted a less restrictive approach, opting to allow ownership of satellite 
receiving equipment by certain institutions and individuals but allowing them to receive only authorized 
broadcasts. At the opposite end of the spectrum are countries where private satellite dish ownership is 

18

allowed and laws and regulations have been adopted which support popular access to satellite services 
through local cable redistribution.

Most television services within Asia, whether free-to-air or pay television, are also subject to 

licensing requirements. In addition, most countries in which the Company operates control the content 
offered by local broadcast operators through censorship requirements and standards and practices 
policies to which program suppliers, such as the Company, are subject. Certain countries also require a 
minimum percentage of local content or restrict foreign channels available within a market. Other 
countries require local broadcast operators to obtain government approval to retransmit foreign 
programming.

Additional categories of regulation of actual or potential significance to the Company are restrictions 
on foreign investment in distribution platforms and broadcast licensees, limitations on foreign participation 
in local television programming production, limitations on exclusive arrangements for channel distribution 
and non-discrimination requirements for supply or carriage of programming and anti-competition or anti-
trust legislation. Such restrictions are different in each country.

India. Television viewers receive broadcast television signals primarily through terrestrial and cable 
delivery and through DTH and IPTV delivery. Terrestrial broadcasting remains the domain of government-
owned broadcast stations. The government allows 100% foreign direct investment in distribution 
platforms and 49% foreign direct investment in news and current affairs. Effective November 2015, 
government approval is no longer required for foreign direct investment in non-“news and current affairs” 
(i.e. entertainment) television channels. In addition, the government does not permit broadcasters to own 
directly more than 20% of a DTH platform.

All distribution platforms are required to carry certain government-operated channels. 

Retransmissions of foreign satellite channels, such as STAR India’s channels, are permitted, subject to 
licensing requirements and compliance with local applicable laws, including programming and 
advertisement codes. Indian law requires that all film content, whether produced in India or abroad, be 
certified by the Central Board of Film Certification prior to exhibition in India and also places certain 
restrictions on advertising content. The Indian Broadcasting Foundation has issued Self-Regulatory 
Guidelines that apply to the programming on non-news and current affairs channels. 

Broadcasters are required to provide their channels on non-discriminatory terms to all distributors if 
no carriage charges are being sought from broadcasters. In 2011, the Cable Television Act was amended 
and new rules were issued mandating that cable networks switch from analog to digital systems. The 
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (the “TRAI”) issued rules that mandated, among other things, basic 
service tiers comprised of free-to-air channels be compulsorily offered to consumers.

Channel prices in India have been frozen since 2003 and occasional inflationary adjustments have 
been allowed in the past. The TRAI allowed a 27.5% inflation based increase in channel rates that was to 
be implemented by January 1, 2015. However, the Indian court remanded the matter back to the TRAI for 
reconsideration. In May 2016, the TRAI struck down the increase and held that no inflationary hikes are 
required. The Company, along with other broadcasters, has filed an appeal before the Telecom Disputes 
Settlement and Appellate Tribunal which is pending.

The TRAI introduced new interconnect and tariff regulations which, among other things, cap the 

maximum retail price per subscriber per month for channels offered as part of a bouquet. These 
regulations were challenged by STAR India on the basis that, among other things, the TRAI does not 
have the authority to regulate the price and manner of offering of television channels which are also 
protected as broadcast reproduction rights under the Indian Copyright Act. In May 2018, the regulations 
became effective. STAR India has appealed the decision in the Supreme Court of India however, subject 
to guidance on implementation, the regulations are not expected to negatively impact STAR India’s 
business.

19

The TRAI enacted regulations in March 2013 that limit the amount of advertising time allowed on 
television channels. These regulations replaced the regulations enacted by the TRAI in May 2012 that 
had been challenged in the Indian courts. The March 2013 regulations have also been challenged and 
such challenges are currently pending in the Indian courts.

The Indian government has mandated sports content rights owners to simultaneously share a feed 
free of advertisements of the live broadcasting signal of sporting events of national importance with the 
Indian government owned broadcaster to enable it to re-transmit the signal on its terrestrial networks and 
DTH networks. For such shared events, the regulations also provide for sharing of advertising revenue, 
75% to the content rights owners and 25% to the government owned broadcaster.

The copyright laws in India were amended in June 2012 to provide, among other things, for rights to 

receive royalties by authors of underlying work upon exploitation of the work by a broadcaster and to 
permit broadcasters to access content under a statutory license at royalty rates to be determined by the 
authorized copyright body once it is established. In November 2017, the Indian Performing Rights Society 
(“IPRS”) was authorized as the governing copyright body. In March 2018, the IPRS proposed tariff rates 
for payment of royalties by broadcasters.

Latin America. The Company broadcasts television programming throughout approximately 18 Latin 

American countries, as well as the Caribbean. Certain countries in which the Company operates have a 
regulatory framework for the satellite and cable television industry. These regulations vary in each country 
as does their impact on the Company’s business. In Argentina, pay-TV operators are required to carry 
certain government operated channels. In addition, Argentina regulations require, among other things, 
registration of all channels and production companies and reduced the available advertising inventory on 
the channels by half to six minutes per hour, which must be accumulated within a four-hour consecutive 
programming block. In Brazil, regulations require, among other things: (i) that all channels distributed in 
the region contain at least three hours and thirty minutes per week of Brazilian content during prime time 
hours (the “Quota Requirement”), half of which must be produced by a Brazilian independent producer; 
(ii) registration of all channels, programmers, local content and advertisements; (iii) website disclosure of 
programming and advertising content to ensure compliance with tax and other regulations; and 
(iv) mediation of local agency requirements and taxation on all advertising that is contracted abroad. 
While such tax shall primarily be paid by advertisers, programmers are ultimately responsible for the tax 
payment, and failure by advertisers to pay the required tax could subject programmers to fines or 
penalties. In order to encourage the local industry and the production of Brazilian content, new restrictions 
continue to be established defining the type of content that may be considered Brazilian content for 
purposes of the Quota Requirement. Compliance with these regulations increases the cost of doing 
business by imposing additional production/acquisition costs as well as third party administrative and 
legal expenses.

Europe. The sectors in which the Company operates in Europe are subject to both general 
competition laws and sector specific regulation. The regulatory regime applicable to the electronic 
communications and broadcasting sectors is, to a large extent, based on European Union (“EU”) law 
comprised in various EU directives that require EU member states to adopt national legislation to give 
effect to the directives’ objectives, while leaving the precise manner and form of the national legislation to 
the discretion of each member state. The Electronic Communications Directives regulate the provision of 
communication services, including networks and transmission services that are involved in the 
broadcasting of television services as well as the provisions of services and facilities associated with the 
operation of digital television platforms. The AudioVisual Media Services Directive sets out the basic 
principles for the regulation of television broadcasting activity, including broadcasting licensing, 
advertising and content regulation, and imposes production and investment quotas, obligations to 
transmit European content for at least 50% of the day and limitations on advertising time. The Satellite 
and Cable Directive provides the European legal framework for the right of communication to the public 
by satellite and for the retransmission of broadcast signals from one member state by cable operators in 
another member state. Each European country also has the right to adopt more strict rules.

20

In January 2014, the European Commission (“EC”) initiated formal antitrust proceedings to examine 
certain provisions in licensing agreements between several U.S. film studios, including Twentieth Century 
Fox, and a number of European pay-TV broadcasters, including Sky Italia, Sky Deutschland and Sky UK. 
The EC is investigating provisions which prevent broadcasters from providing their services across 
borders, for example by refusing potential subscribers from other EU countries or blocking cross-border 
online access to their services. In July 2015, the EC sent a Statement of Objections to Twentieth Century 
Fox, several other U.S. film studios and Sky UK taking the preliminary view that such contractual 
provisions may breach EU competition rules prohibiting anti-competitive agreements. In January 2016, 
the EC held a hearing on the matter. The Statement of Objections, which sets out the preliminary position 
of the EU, and the hearing do not represent a finding of infringement or prejudge the outcome of the 
investigation. The EC continues to investigate the license agreements between the film studios and other 
European broadcasters. It is not possible to predict the timing or outcome of the EC’s proceedings, 
including whether fines, if any, may be imposed, or the impact on the Company’s business.

In April 2018, the EC conducted unannounced inspections in several member states at the premises 

of companies active in the distribution of sports media rights and the broadcasting of various sports 
events. The EC inspections are related to concerns that the EU antitrust rules that prohibit cartels and 
restrictive business practices may have been violated. Unannounced inspections are a preliminary step 
into suspected anticompetitive practices but the fact that the EC carries out such inspections does not 
mean that the companies are guilty of anti-competitive behavior nor does it prejudge the outcome of the 
investigation itself. One office of the Company was subject to an inspection and the Company is 
cooperating with the investigation. It is not possible to predict the timing or outcome of the EC’s 
investigation, including whether fines, if any, may be imposed, or the impact on the Company’s business.

Since 2015, as part of its Digital Single Market Strategy, the EC commenced a number of initiatives, 
including legislative proposals to allow for broader access to online content across EU countries, as well 
as consultations to review the Satellite and Cable Directive, the AudioVisual Media Services Directive and 
the Electronic Communications Directive. The EC adopted new portability regulations, which became 
effective on April 1, 2018, to allow consumers who paid for online content services in their home country 
to access them when visiting another country within the EU. It is not possible to predict the impact of 
these portability regulations or other initiatives on the Company’s business or the timing or outcome of 
other initiatives.

Television

In general, the television broadcast industry in the United States is highly regulated by federal laws 

and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies, including the FCC. The FCC 
regulates television broadcasting, and certain aspects of the operations of cable, satellite and other 
electronic media that compete with broadcasting, pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended (the “Communications Act”).

The Communications Act permits the operation of television broadcast stations only in accordance 

with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the grant of the license would serve the public 
interest, convenience and necessity. The FCC grants television broadcast station licenses for specific 
periods of time and, upon application, may renew the licenses for additional terms. Under the 
Communications Act, television broadcast licenses may be granted for a maximum permitted term of 
eight years. Generally, the FCC renews broadcast licenses upon finding that: (i) the television station has 
served the public interest, convenience and necessity; (ii) there have been no serious violations by the 
licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations; and (iii) there have been no other 
violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations which, taken together, 
indicate a pattern of abuse. After considering these factors, the FCC may grant the license renewal 
application with or without conditions, including renewal for a lesser term than the maximum otherwise 
permitted, or hold an evidentiary hearing. Currently Fox Television Stations has no pending renewal 
applications for its television station licenses. For information on the television stations owned and 
operated by the Company, see “—Fox Television Stations” above.

21

In March 2010, the FCC delivered its national Broadband Plan to Congress, which reviewed the 
nation’s broadband Internet infrastructure and recommended a number of initiatives to spur broadband 
deployment and use. In order to free up more spectrum for wireless broadband services, the Broadband 
Plan proposed to make spectrum available, including 120 MHz of broadcast spectrum, by incentivizing 
current private-sector spectrum holders to return some of their spectrum to the government through such 
initiatives as voluntary “incentive” spectrum auctions (with current licensees permitted to share in the 
auction proceeds) and “repacking” of channel assignments to increase efficient spectrum usage. Over 
time, if voluntary measures fail to yield the amount of spectrum the FCC deems necessary for wireless 
broadband deployment, the Broadband Plan proposed various mandates to reclaim spectrum, such as 
forced channel sharing. In response to the Broadband Plan, Congress passed legislation in February 
2012 authorizing the FCC to conduct a voluntary auction of television broadcast station spectrum. That 
auction concluded in March 2017 with the FCC reclaiming 84 MHz of broadcast spectrum. Stations that 
continue their operations may be “repacked” into the remaining, smaller broadcast spectrum band, and 
some stations may have to change channels as part of a 39-month transition process. In implementing 
the auction, the FCC was required by legislation to assist stations in retaining their current coverage 
areas and to establish a fund to reimburse broadcasters for reasonable channel relocation expenses. Fox 
Television Stations had three stations’ bids to relinquish spectrum accepted by the FCC as part of the 
auction. Of its remaining stations, nine will be required to repack during the transition. The broadcast 
industry is continuing to explore additional uses for currently allocated spectrum. It is expected that the 
FCC repacking will take several years to complete. It is not possible to predict the timing or outcome of 
implementation of any additional steps under the Broadband Plan or the repacking, or their effect on the 
Company.

On December 22, 2011, the FCC commenced a quadrennial review of its broadcast ownership 
regulations as required by the 1996 Telecom Act, proposing only minor modifications to its rules. That 
review was never completed. In early 2014, the FCC announced its intention to combine the 2011 review 
with the quadrennial review scheduled for 2014. The FCC completed the 2014 review in August 2016. 
The FCC adopted only minor modifications that were not likely to affect the impact of the FCC ownership 
rules on the Company’s ownership of media properties. Several parties, however, sought reconsideration 
of the FCC’s decision, asking that the FCC eliminate the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule, 
which prohibited common ownership of broadcast stations and daily newspapers, as well as the local 
television ownership rule limiting the number of stations that a single entity can own in any geographic 
market. In November 2017, the FCC issued a reconsideration order that (1) eliminated the 
newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule and (2) relaxed the local television ownership rule so that, 
among other things, station owners could petition the FCC to permit ownership of two stations both 
ranked among the top four in a market. The reconsideration order is currently the subject of an appeal in 
the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. It is not possible to predict the timing or outcome 
of the appeal.

Fox Television Stations is in compliance with the rules governing ownership of multiple stations in 
the same market and with the national station ownership cap established by Congress. In August 2016, 
the FCC adopted an order to eliminate the so-called “UHF discount” under which UHF stations are 
attributed with only 50% of the television households in their markets for purposes of calculating 
compliance with the national station ownership cap. Following a request for reconsideration, however, the 
FCC reversed its decision and reinstated the UHF discount in April 2017. In July 2018, the United States 
Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit dismissed a petition that had sought to overturn the FCC’s decision 
to reinstate the UHF discount. As a result, the UHF discount remains in effect. If the FCC determines in 
the future to again eliminate the UHF discount, it may affect the Company’s ability to acquire television 
stations in additional markets. Even in the event that the UHF discount is again eliminated, the 
Company’s national audience reach would remain below the national station ownership cap, based on 
stations the Company currently owns. It is not possible to predict the timing or outcome of future 
proceedings at the FCC relating to the national station ownership cap. 

Fox Television Stations owns two television stations in the New York DMA. By virtue of the Murdoch 

Family Trust’s ownership interest in both News Corp and the Company, Fox Television Stations also 
retains an attributable interest in The New York Post, a daily newspaper in the New York DMA. On

October 6, 2006, the FCC reaffirmed the Company’s permanent waiver of the newspaper/broadcast 
cross-ownership rule, which allows the common ownership of the The New York Post and WNYW (TV). 
On August 8, 2014, the FCC’s Media Bureau granted a new temporary waiver of the 
newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule to permit the common ownership of the The New York Post 
and WWOR-TV; the waiver was set to remain in effect until 90 days after the effective date of an FCC 
order in the 2014 quadrennial review of the media ownership regulations (concluded in 2016) that either 
adopts a new rule or upholds the existing rule, at which time Fox Television Stations was required to 
either (1) comply with the rule then in effect or (2) file a new request for a waiver of such rule. Fox 
Television Stations therefore filed with the FCC a request for a new waiver on February 28, 2017. Fox 
Television Stations also filed a request for a brief extension of the pre-existing temporary waiver to the 
extent necessary to preserve the status quo while the FCC reviews the matter. Parties opposed to the 
waiver request filed objections with the FCC. As noted above, the FCC eliminated the 
newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule in November 2017, a decision that is now the subject of 
judicial review. It is not possible to predict the timing or outcome of the court’s review or any potential 
remand proceeding at the FCC or their effect on the Company.

In addition, if the elimination of the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule is overturned by the 
court, the Company’s future conduct, including the acquisition of any broadcast networks, or stations or 
any newspapers, in the same local markets in which News Corp owns or operates newspapers or has 
acquired television stations, may affect News Corp’s ability to own and operate its newspapers or any 
television stations it acquires or otherwise comply with the rules. Therefore, the Company and News Corp 
agreed in the News Corp Separation and Distribution Agreement that if the Company acquires, after the 
News Corp Separation, newspapers, radio or television broadcast stations or television broadcast 
networks in the U.S. and such acquisition would impede or be reasonably likely to impede News Corp’s 
business, then the Company will be required to take certain actions, including divesting assets, in order to 
permit News Corp to hold its media interests and to comply with such rules.

Under the Communications Act, no broadcast station licensees may be owned by a corporation if 

more than 25% of the corporation’s stock is owned or voted by non-U.S. persons, their representatives, or 
by any other corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country. The Company owns broadcast 
station licensees in connection with its ownership and operation of U.S. television stations. In August 
2016, the Company eliminated a suspension of 10% of the voting rights of shares of Class B Common 
Stock held by non-U.S. stockholders that had been in place in order to maintain compliance with U.S. law. 
The FCC could review the Company’s compliance with the Act in connection with its consideration of Fox 
Television Stations’ license renewal applications.

FCC regulations implementing the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 
1992 require each television broadcaster to elect, at three-year intervals, either to (i) require carriage of 
its signal by cable systems in the station’s market (“must carry”) or (ii) negotiate the terms on which that 
broadcast station would permit transmission of its signal by the cable systems within its market 
(“retransmission consent”). Generally, the Company has elected retransmission consent for the stations 
owned and operated by Fox Television Stations. The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999 
requires satellite carriers to carry upon request all television stations located in markets in which the 
satellite carrier retransmits at least one local station pursuant to the copyright license provided in the 
statute (“Carry One, Carry All”). FCC regulations implementing this statutory provision require affected 
stations to elect either mandatory carriage at the same three year intervals applicable to cable “must 
carry” or negotiate carriage terms with the satellite operators. On September 2, 2015, the FCC initiated a 
new proposed rulemaking seeking comment on whether the FCC should make changes to its rules that 
require commercial broadcast television stations to negotiate retransmission consent with cable and 
satellite operators in “good faith.” The Chairman of the FCC announced in July 2016 that the Commission 
will not proceed at this time to adopt additional rules governing good faith negotiations for retransmission 
consent. However, the notice of proposed rulemaking remains pending.

Legislation enacted in 1990 limits the amount of commercial matter that may be broadcast during 

programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger. In addition, under FCC license renewal 
processing guidelines, television stations are generally required to broadcast a minimum of three hours 

23

per week of programming, which, among other requirements, must serve, as a “significant purpose,” the 
educational and informational needs of children 16 years of age and under. A television station found not 
to have complied with the programming requirements or commercial limitations could face sanctions, 
including monetary fines and the possible non-renewal of its license. The FCC announced in July 2018 a 
proposal to reconsider the three-hour programming obligation as part of a broad review of its children’s 
programming rules. It is not possible to predict the timing or outcome of any FCC action in response to 
this review.

FCC rules prohibit the broadcast by television and radio stations of indecent or profane material 

between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Beginning in March 2004, the FCC implemented a new 
policy regarding this prohibition and generally stepped up its enforcement of indecency violations. Under 
the new policy, the single use of certain forbidden expletives, or variations of those expletives, were 
deemed “indecent” and “profane.” The FCC also warned broadcasters that serious multiple violations of 
the indecency prohibition could lead to license revocation proceedings, and that fines could be imposed 
for each incident in a single broadcast. Under the new FCC policy, both complaints about indecency and 
FCC enforcement actions have increased, and several complaints alleging the broadcast of alleged 
indecent or profane material by Fox Television Stations are believed to be pending at the FCC. The law 
currently authorizes the FCC to impose fines of up to $350,000 per incident for violation of the prohibition 
against indecent and profane broadcasts.

On March 15, 2006, the FCC determined that the 2002 and 2003 Billboard Music Awards programs, 
both live broadcasts on FOX, violated the prohibitions against indecent and profane broadcasts because 
they contained isolated uses of the forbidden expletives. On June 21, 2012, the Supreme Court decided 
that the FCC failed to give FOX fair notice that the isolated use of expletives could violate the indecency 
prohibition and therefore the Commission’s standards as applied to the broadcasts in question were 
unconstitutionally vague. The Court vacated the violations for the Billboard Music Awards broadcasts. On 
April 1, 2013, the FCC announced it had reduced the backlog of pending indecency complaints and would 
focus its enforcement on “egregious” cases. The FCC also sought public comment on whether its 
indecency policies should be altered in light of the Supreme Court’s decision. It is not possible to predict 
the outcome of the FCC’s inquiry or how it will enforce its indecency rules in the future.

On February 22, 2008, the FCC issued an order imposing forfeitures of $7,000 each on 13 FOX 
Affiliates, including five stations owned and operated by the Company, on the grounds that an April 7, 
2003 episode of the program Married by America violated the prohibition against indecent broadcasts. On 
April 4, 2008, the United States commenced an action in federal district court in the District of Columbia 
against the five Company-owned stations to collect the forfeitures imposed by the FCC. In 2012, the 
government voluntarily dismissed this collection action. The Company subsequently petitioned the FCC to 
vacate the forfeitures against the Company and other FOX stations that had been found to have violated 
the indecency prohibition. The petition remains pending and it is not possible to predict the timing or 
outcome of FCC action.

Modifications to the Company’s programming to reduce the risk of indecency violations could have 
an adverse effect on the competitive position of Fox Television Stations and FOX. If indecency regulation 
is extended to Internet or cable and satellite programming, and such extension was found to be 
constitutional, some of the Company’s other programming services could be subject to additional 
regulation that might affect subscription and viewership levels.

The FCC continues to enforce strictly its regulations concerning sponsorship identification, political 

advertising, children’s television, environmental concerns, equal employment opportunity, technical 
operating matters and antenna tower maintenance. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) 
has increased its focus on unfair and deceptive advertising practices, particularly with respect to social 
media marketing. Both FCC and FTC rules and guidance require marketers to clearly and conspicuously 
disclose whenever there has been payment for a marketing message or when there is a material 
connection between an advertiser and a product endorser. FCC rules also require the closed captioning 
of almost all broadcast and cable programming. A federal law enacted in late 2010 requires affiliates of 
the four largest broadcast networks in the 25 largest markets to carry 50 hours of prime time or children’s 

24

programming per calendar quarter with video descriptions, i.e., a verbal description of key visual elements 
inserted into natural pauses in the audio and broadcast over a separate audio channel. Cable and 
satellite operators with 50,000 or more subscribers must do the same on each of the top five non-
broadcast networks they carry. Compliance has been required since July 1, 2012 and, as of July 1, 2015, 
applies to FOX affiliates in the Top 60 markets. Fox News Channel, which from time to time has been 
among the top five non-broadcast networks, falls within the statutory exemption for “live or near-live” 
programming. In July 2017, the FCC modified its video description rules to require covered stations and 
networks to carry 87.5 hours of prime time or children’s programming per calendar quarter with video 
descriptions. The same statute requires programming that was captioned on television to retain captions 
when distributed via Internet Protocol apps or services. Although not required by FCC regulation, the 
Company has committed to provide program ratings information for its broadcast network programming 
for use in conjunction with V-Chip technology, which blocks the display of television programming based 
on its rating. The Company has also agreed to make this ratings information available for all full-length 
entertainment programs that stream on websites the Company controls. FCC regulations governing 
network affiliation agreements mandate that television broadcast station licensees retain the right to reject 
or refuse network programming in certain circumstances or to substitute programming that the licensee 
reasonably believes to be of greater local or national importance. Violation of FCC regulations can result 
in substantial monetary forfeitures, periodic reporting conditions, short-term license renewals and, in 
egregious cases, denial of license renewal or revocation of license. Violation of FTC-imposed obligations 
can result in enforcement actions, litigation, consent decrees and, ultimately, substantial monetary fines.

Filmed Entertainment 

United States. TCFF is subject to the provisions of so-called “trade practice laws” in effect in 

approximately half of the states relating to theatrical distribution of motion pictures. These laws 
substantially restrict the licensing of motion pictures unless theater owners are first invited to attend a 
screening of the motion pictures and, in certain instances, also prohibit payment of advances and 
guarantees to motion picture distributors by exhibitors. Further, pursuant to various consent judgments, 
TCFF and certain other motion picture companies are subject to certain restrictions on their trade 
practices in the United States, including a requirement to offer motion pictures for exhibition to theaters on 
a theater-by-theater basis and, in some cases, a prohibition against the ownership of theaters.

Other International Regulation. In countries outside of the United States, there are a variety of 

existing or contemplated governmental laws and regulations that may affect the ability of TCFF to 
distribute and/or license its motion picture and television products to cinema, television or in-home media, 
including copyright laws and regulations that may or may not be adequate to protect its interests, cinema 
screen quotas, television quotas, contract term limitations, discriminatory taxes and other discriminatory 
treatment of U.S. products. The ability of countries to deny market access or refuse national treatment to 
products originating outside their territories is regulated under various international agreements, including 
the World Trade Organization’s General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and General Agreement on 
Trade and Services; however, these agreements have limited application with respect to preventing the 
denial of market access to audio-visual products originating outside the EU.

Privacy and Information Regulation

The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) prohibits websites and online services from 

collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental 
consent. The Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (“CAN-SPAM”) 
regulates the distribution of unsolicited commercial emails, or “spam.” The Video Privacy Protection Act 
(“VPPA”) prohibits the knowing disclosure of information that identifies a person as having requested or 
obtained specific video materials from a “video tape service provider.” The Telephone Consumer 
Protection Act (“TCPA”) restricts marketing communications such as text and calls without explicit 
consent. The Company’s online services, websites and other business activities may be subject to 
COPPA, CAN-SPAM, VPPA and TCPA requirements and the accompanying risk of enforcement and 
litigation.

Federal regulators’ interest in issues of privacy, cybersecurity and data security has continued to 
steadily increase. On March 26, 2012, the FTC released a report on consumer privacy setting forth a 
detailed privacy framework and urging industry to accelerate the pace of adoption of self-regulatory 
measures. Since then, the FTC has released additional reports on privacy and security topics, including 
reports on data brokers (May 2014), Big Data (January 2016) and cross-device tracking (January 2017), 
and it has continued to bring enforcement actions.

A number of privacy and data security bills have been introduced in both Houses of Congress that 

address the collection, maintenance and use of personal information, web browsing and geolocation data, 
data security and breach notification requirements and cybersecurity. Many state legislatures have 
already adopted legislation that regulates how businesses operate on the Internet, including measures 
relating to privacy, data security and data breaches, and state attorneys general have made consumer 
privacy and data security an enforcement focus. The industry released a set of self-regulatory online 
behavioral advertising principles in 2009, which have been implemented by web publishers, online 
advertisers and online advertising networks. These principles were extended in November 2011 to the 
use of online consumer data for purposes other than advertising, in July 2013 to the mobile environment 
and in November 2015 to cross-device tracking. It is unclear whether these and other industry self-
regulatory efforts alone will address the concerns expressed by some federal and state officials about the 
collection of anonymous data online or via mobile applications to serve targeted content and advertising. 
It is not possible to predict whether proposed privacy and data security legislation will be enacted or to 
determine what effect such legislation might have on the Company’s business.

Foreign governments are raising similar privacy and data security concerns. In particular, the EU 

General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) became enforceable as of May 25, 2018. The GDPR 
tightens regulation of the collection, use and security of personal data and will continue to restrict the 
trans-border flow of such data while increasing the potential fines for non-compliance. A new e-Privacy 
Regulation (“e-PR”) is in negotiation in the EU that would supersede the existing EU e-Privacy (Cookie) 
Directive and complement the GDPR. If adopted, the new e-PR would tighten regulation regarding third 
party tracking tools. European industry has implemented a self-regulatory regime for online behavioral 
advertising that is largely consistent with the U.S. self-regulatory framework. It is unclear how compliance 
with the GDPR will affect the Company’s business and it is not possible to predict the measures that the 
e-PR, if and when enacted, will contain and the resulting impact on the Company’s business. Canada, 
Australia, Russia, China, Japan and other countries in South/Latin America and Asia are also 
strengthening their privacy laws and the enforcement of privacy and data security requirements.

The Company monitors pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance, analyze 

impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments.

Intellectual Property

The Company’s intellectual property assets include: copyrights in motion pictures, television 

programming, books and other publications, websites and technologies; trademarks in names, logos and 
characters; domain names; patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products, business 
methods and/or services; and licenses of intellectual property rights of various kinds. The Company 
derives value from these assets through the theatrical release of films and the production, distribution 
and/or licensing of its films and television programming to domestic and international television and cable 
networks, pay television services, PPV, VOD services and DTH satellite services, operation of websites, 
and through the sale of products, such as DVDs, Blu-rays, video games, collectible merchandise, 
apparel, books and publications, among others.

The Company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property in the United 

States and other key foreign territories. To protect these assets, the Company relies upon a combination 
of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other laws and contract provisions. 
However, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any 
given case. Policing unauthorized use of the Company’s products and services and related intellectual 
property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by 
unauthorized third parties of the Company’s intellectual property. The Company seeks to limit that threat 

26

through a combination of approaches, including offering legitimate market alternatives, deploying digital 
rights management technologies, pursuing legal sanctions for infringement, promoting appropriate 
legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value 
of intellectual property and intellectual property laws. Piracy, including in the digital environment, 
continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property.

Third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the Company’s intellectual property from time to 
time, and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Irrespective of 
their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an 
adverse effect on the Company’s operations. Moreover, effective intellectual property protection may be 
either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. Therefore, the Company engages in efforts to 
strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world, including efforts to ensure the 
effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Prospective investors should consider carefully the risk factors set forth below before making an 

investment in the Company’s securities. 

Risks related to transactions
Disney Transaction and Creation of New Fox 
The Transaction may cause disruption in the Company’s business.

On June 20, 2018, the Company entered into the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement with 
Disney, which amends and restates in its entirety the Agreement and Plan of Merger that the Company 
entered into with Disney in December 2017. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement, 
the Company will, after completing the New Fox Separation and the New Fox Distribution, become a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of New Disney (see Item 1 – Background under the heading “Business” and 
Note 3 – Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions to the accompanying Consolidated Financial 
Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox under the heading “Disney Transaction/Distribution of New Fox” 
for further details). The Amended and Restated Merger Agreement generally requires the Company to 
operate its business in the ordinary course pending consummation of the Mergers and restricts the 
Company, without Disney’s consent, from taking certain specified actions until the Transaction is 
consummated or the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement is terminated, including making certain 
acquisitions and divestitures, entering into certain contracts, incurring certain indebtedness and 
expenditures, paying dividends in excess of certain thresholds, and repurchasing or issuing securities 
outside of existing equity award programs. These restrictions may affect the Company’s ability to execute 
its business strategies and attain its financial and other goals and may impact its financial condition, 
results of operations and cash flows.

In connection with the pending Transaction, current and prospective employees of the Company 

may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the Company (and Disney) or New Fox following 
the consummation of the Transaction, which may materially adversely affect the ability of the Company to 
attract, retain and motivate key personnel while the Transaction is pending. Despite the Company’s 
retention planning and programs that the Company has and will implement, key employees may depart 
because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration with Disney and the New Fox 
Separation and establishment of New Fox, or a desire not to remain with the Company (and Disney) or 
New Fox following the consummation of the Transaction. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the 
Company will be able to attract and retain key employees to the same extent that the Company has been 
able to in the past.

The proposed Transaction further could cause disruptions to the Company’s business or business 

relationships (including the business to be conducted by, and business relationships of, New Fox after the 
consummation of the transactions), which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s businesses, 
financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In addition, the risk, and adverse effect, of such 

27

disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in the consummation of the Transaction or a termination of 
the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement. Parties with which the Company has business 
relationships may experience uncertainty as to the future of such relationships and may delay or defer 
certain business decisions, seek alternative relationships with third parties or seek to alter their present 
business relationships with the Company. Parties with whom the Company otherwise may have sought to 
establish business relationships may seek alternative relationships with third parties.

The pursuit of the proposed Transaction and the preparation for both the integration with Disney and 

the establishment of New Fox may place a significant burden on the Company’s management and 
internal resources. The diversion of management’s attention away from day-to-day business concerns 
could adversely affect the Company’s financial results.

The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs, expenses and fees for 

professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Transaction. The substantial 
majority of these costs will be non-recurring expenses relating to the Transaction, including costs relating 
to the New Fox Separation, and many of these costs are payable regardless of whether or not the 
Transaction is consummated. The Company is currently subject to certain litigation related to the 
proposed Transaction as described in Item 3 – Legal Proceedings, and the Company could be subject to 
additional litigation, which could result in significant costs and expenses. Even if the proposed 
Transaction is not consummated, these risks may materialize and may adversely affect the Company's 
businesses, financial condition, financial results and stock price.

Failure to consummate the Transaction in a timely manner or at all could negatively impact the market 
price of the Company’s common stock, as well as the Company’s future business and its financial 
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The Company currently anticipates the Transaction will be consummated in the first half of calendar 

year 2019, but it cannot be certain when or if the conditions for the Transaction will be satisfied or (if 
permissible under applicable law) waived. The Transaction cannot be consummated until the conditions 
to closing are satisfied or (if permissible under applicable law) waived, including (i) receipt of certain 
required governmental approvals and consents, (ii) receipt by the Company of a surplus and solvency 
opinion with respect to the New Fox Separation and the cash dividend in connection with the Transaction, 
(iii) effectiveness of registration statements with respect to the New Fox Distribution and the issuance of 
New Disney shares in connection with the Transaction, (iv) authorization of New Disney and New Fox 
shares for listing on NYSE or NASDAQ, as applicable, (v) the consummation of the New Fox Separation 
and Distribution, (vi) receipt of certain tax opinions by each of the Company and Disney with respect to 
the treatment of the transactions under U.S. and Australian tax laws, including a legal opinion on the 
intended tax treatment of the Transaction and (vii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties 
made by the Company or Disney, as applicable, in the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement. The 
obligation of Disney to consummate the Transaction is also subject to, among other conditions, the 
absence of regulatory authorities requiring Disney to take certain actions.

The satisfaction of the required conditions could delay the consummation of the Transaction for a 

significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. Further, there can be no assurance that the 
conditions to the closing of the Transaction will be satisfied or waived or that the Transaction will be 
consummated.

In the event that the Transaction is not consummated for any reason, (i) the holders of the 

Company’s common stock will not receive any consideration for their shares of the Company’s common 
stock in connection with the proposed Transaction and (ii) the New Fox Separation and Distribution of 
New Fox will not occur and the holders of the Company’s common stock will not receive shares in New 
Fox. Instead, the Company will remain an independent public company and holders of the Company’s 
common stock will continue to own their shares of the Company’s common stock.

28

Additionally, if the proposed Transaction is not consummated in a timely manner or at all, the 

Company’s ongoing business may be adversely affected as follows:

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

the Company may experience negative reactions from financial markets and the stock price 
could decline;
it may experience negative reactions from employees, customers, suppliers or other third 
parties;
management’s focus would have been diverted from pursuing other opportunities that could 
have been beneficial to the Company; and
the Company’s costs of pursuing the Transaction may be higher than anticipated and, in any 
event, would be borne entirely by the Company.

If the Transaction is not consummated, there can be no assurance that these risks will not 
materialize and will not materially adversely affect the Company’s stock price, business, financial 
conditions, results of operations or cash flows.

In order to consummate the Transaction, Disney and the Company must obtain certain governmental 
approvals, and if such approvals are not granted or are granted with conditions, consummation of the 
Transaction may be jeopardized or the anticipated benefits of the Transaction could be reduced.

Although Disney and the Company have agreed to use reasonable best efforts, subject to certain 

limitations, to make certain governmental filings and obtain the governmental approvals or expirations or 
earlier termination of applicable waiting periods, as the case may be, there can be no assurance that the 
applicable waiting periods will expire or be terminated or that the applicable approvals will be obtained. As 
a condition to approving the Transaction, governmental authorities may impose conditions, terms, 
obligations or restrictions or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined 
company's business after consummation of the Transaction, including those which Disney may not be 
required to accept pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement. Disney has 
agreed to accept certain restrictions on certain of its and the Company’s assets if and to the extent 
necessary to obtain the governmental regulatory approvals required to consummate the Transaction, as 
described in the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement. There can be no assurance that regulators 
will not impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, terms, obligations or 
restrictions will not have the effect of delaying or preventing consummation of the Transaction or imposing 
additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the 
Transaction, or otherwise adversely affecting, including to a material extent, the combined company's 
businesses and results of operations after consummation of the Transaction. If the Company and Disney 
are required to divest assets or businesses, there can be no assurance that they will be able to negotiate 
such divestitures expeditiously or on favorable terms or that the governmental authorities will approve the 
terms of such divestitures. The Company can provide no assurance that these conditions, terms, 
obligations or restrictions will not result in the abandonment of the Transaction.

29

Sky Acquisition
The Sky Acquisition Involves a Number of Risks, including, among others, the Risk that the Sky 
Acquisition is Not Completed on a Timely Basis, or at All, and Risks Associated with the Company’s Use 
of a Significant Portion of its Cash and Taking on Significant Additional Indebtedness.

The Sky Acquisition is conditional on, among other things, the Company securing valid acceptances 

of the Increased Offer in respect of Sky shares which represent 75% or more of the Sky shares that the 
Company does not own. The Company reserves the right to reduce this acceptance condition to a level 
which is not less than a simple majority of all Sky shares (including those held by the Company and its 
wholly-owned subsidiaries). The Sky Acquisition has received unconditional clearance by all competent 
competition authorities including the European Commission, and has been cleared on public interest and 
plurality grounds. In addition, on July 12, 2018, the Sky Acquisition received approval by the Secretary of 
State, subject to accepted undertakings regarding the divestment of and financial support for Sky News 
as described in Note 3 – Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions to the accompanying 
Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox under the heading “Sky Acquisition”.

The Company cannot predict whether and when any of the outstanding conditions will be satisfied 

and/or whether Sky shareholders will ultimately decide to support the Sky Acquisition or the Comcast 
Offer. If the Sky Acquisition does not receive, or timely receive, the requisite acceptance of Sky 
shareholders unaffiliated with the Company, any delay or failure to complete the Sky Acquisition and the 
acquisition process may cause uncertainty or other negative consequences that may adversely affect the 
Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations and the price per share for the 
Company’s common stock could be negatively impacted.

In addition, the Sky Acquisition will require the use of a significant portion of the Company’s cash 

and increase the amount of debt on the Company’s balance sheet leading to substantial additional 
interest expense. These factors could limit the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing business and 
economic conditions and reduce funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions 
and other general corporate purposes. If the Sky Acquisition is completed but the financial performance of 
the Company after the Sky Acquisition does not meet management’s current expectations, the 
Company’s ability to reduce its level of indebtedness may be adversely impacted. More information 
regarding risks related to financing the Sky Acquisition and paying the consideration to the Sky 
shareholders in Pounds Sterling is set forth below in the risk factor describing the Company’s exposure to 
risks associated with weak domestic and global economic conditions and increased volatility and 
disruption in the financial markets and in the risk factor describing the adverse effect that fluctuations in 
foreign exchange rates could have on the Company’s cash flows and results of operations.

Risks related to our business
The Company Must Respond to Changes in Consumer Behavior as a Result of New Technologies in 
Order to Remain Competitive.

Technology, particularly digital technology used in the entertainment industry, continues to evolve 

rapidly, leading to alternative methods for the delivery and storage of digital content. These technological 
advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior and have empowered consumers to seek 
more control over when, where and how they consume digital content. Content owners are increasingly 
delivering their content directly to consumers over the Internet and innovations in distribution platforms 
have enabled consumers to view such Internet-delivered content on televisions and portable devices. The 
growth of direct to consumer video offerings, including video-on-demand, downloadable content and 
simultaneous live streaming of broadcast content including on social media, offerings by cable providers 
of smaller packages of programming to customers at price points lower than traditional cable distribution 
offerings and the trend of consumers “cord-cutting” or cancelling their multi-channel video programming 
distributors (“MVPD”) subscriptions could adversely affect demand for our cable channels. Enhanced 
Internet capabilities and other new media may reduce television viewership, the demand for home 
entertainment and the desire to see motion pictures in theaters, which could negatively affect the 
Company’s revenues. In addition, increased video consumption through streaming apps, digital MVPD 

30

services and social media with no advertising or less advertising than on video programming networks, 
time shifted viewing of television programming and the use of DVRs to skip advertisements could also 
negatively affect the Company’s advertising revenues. There is a risk that the Company’s responses to 
these changes and strategies to remain competitive, or failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to new 
market changes, could adversely affect our business. The Company’s failure to protect and exploit the 
value of its content, while responding to and developing new technology and business models to take 
advantage of advancements in technology and the latest consumer preferences, could have a significant 
adverse effect on the Company’s businesses, asset values and results of operations.

Acceptance of the Company’s Content, Including Its Films and Television Programming, by the Public is 
Difficult to Predict, Which Could Lead to Fluctuations in Revenues.

Feature film and television production and distribution are speculative businesses since the 
revenues derived from the production and distribution of a feature film or television series depend 
primarily upon its acceptance by the public, which is difficult to predict. The commercial success of a 
feature film or television program also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing films 
and television programming released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of a 
growing number of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic 
conditions and their effects on consumer spending and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which 
can change and cannot be predicted with certainty. Further, the theatrical success of a feature film and 
the audience ratings for a television program are generally key factors in generating revenues from other 
distribution channels, such as home entertainment and premium pay television, with respect to feature 
films, and content licensing and syndication, with respect to television programming. In addition, a decline 
in the ratings or popularity of the Company’s entertainment, sports or news television programming, which 
could be a result of the loss of talent or rights to certain programming, could adversely affect advertising 
revenues in the near term and, over a longer period of time, adversely affect affiliate revenues. 

The Company’s Businesses Operate in Highly Competitive Industry.

The Company competes with other media companies for content to achieve large audiences and 

distribution relationships, and to generate advertising revenue. The Company also competes for 
distribution on various multichannel video programming distributors and other third-party digital platforms. 
The Company’s ability to attract viewers and advertisers and obtain favorable distribution depends in part 
on its ability to provide popular television programming and motion pictures and adapt to new 
technologies and distribution platforms, which are increasing the number of media and entertainment 
choices available to audiences. Competition for audiences and/or advertising comes from: broadcast 
television networks; cable television systems and networks; film studios; Internet-delivered free, 
advertising supported, subscription and rental services; other sources of information and entertainment; 
radio; print and other media. Increased competition from additional entrants into the market for 
development and production of original programming may increase our costs of development and 
production including obtaining creative and technical personnel. Increased competition in the acquisition 
of programming may also affect the scope of rights we are able to acquire and the cost of such rights, and 
the value of the rights we acquire or retain cannot be predicted with certainty in the future. The Company 
cannot be assured that it will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or potential 
competitors, or that competition or consolidation in the marketplace will not have a material adverse effect 
on its business, financial condition or results of operations.

The Inability to Renew Sports Programming Rights Could Cause the Company’s Affiliate and Advertising 
Revenue to Decline Significantly in any Given Period or in Specific Markets.

The sports rights contracts between the Company, on the one hand, and various professional sports 

leagues and teams, on the other, have varying duration and renewal terms. As these contracts expire, 
renewals on favorable terms may be sought; however, third parties may outbid the current rights holders 
for the rights contracts. In addition, professional sports leagues or teams may create their own networks 
or the renewal costs could substantially exceed the original contract cost. The loss of rights or renewal on 
less favorable terms could impact the extent of the sports coverage offered by the Company and its 

31

affiliates, as it relates to FOX, and could adversely affect the Company’s advertising and affiliate 
revenues. Upon renewal, the Company’s results could be adversely affected if escalations in sports 
programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in advertising rates and, in the case of cable 
networks, subscriber fees.

A Decline in Advertising Expenditures Could Cause the Company’s Revenues and Operating Results to 
Decline Significantly in any Given Period or in Specific Markets.

The Company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on or in its television 

stations and broadcast and cable networks. Expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting 
overall economic conditions, as well as budgeting and buying patterns. A decline in the economic 
prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers’ 
spending priorities. Demand for the Company’s products is also a factor in determining advertising rates. 
For example, ratings points for the Company’s television stations and broadcast and cable networks are 
factors that are weighed when determining advertising rates, and with respect to the Company’s 
television stations and broadcast and television networks, when determining the affiliate rates received by 
the Company. In addition, newer technologies, including new video formats, streaming and downloading 
capabilities via the Internet, video-on-demand, personal video recorders and other devices and 
technologies are increasing the number of media and entertainment choices available to audiences. 
Some of these devices and technologies allow users to view television or motion pictures from a remote 
location or on a time-delayed basis and provide users the ability to fast-forward, rewind, pause and skip 
programming and advertisements. These technological developments could affect the attractiveness of 
the Company’s offerings to viewers, advertisers and/or distributors. Failure to effectively anticipate or 
adapt to emerging technologies or changes in consumer behavior could have an adverse effect on our 
business. Further, a decrease in advertising expenditures, reduced demand for the Company’s offerings 
or the inability to obtain market ratings that adequately measure demand for the Company’s content on 
personal video recorders and mobile devices could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising 
spending, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s businesses and assets.

The Loss of Carriage Agreements Could Cause the Company’s Revenue and Operating Results to 
Decline Significantly in any Given Period or in Specific Markets.

The Company’s broadcast stations and cable networks maintain affiliation and carriage 

arrangements that enable them to reach a large percentage of households through cable television 
systems, direct broadcast satellite operators, telecommunications companies and online video 
distributors. The loss of a significant number of these arrangements or the loss of carriage on basic 
programming tiers could reduce the distribution of the Company’s broadcast stations and cable networks, 
which may adversely affect those networks’ revenues from affiliate fees and their ability to sell national 
and local advertising time. Further, the loss of favorable packaging, positioning, pricing or other marketing 
opportunities with any distributor could reduce revenues from subscriber fees. Also, consolidation among 
MVPDs and increased vertical integration of such distributors into the cable or broadcast network 
business have provided more leverage to these distributors and could adversely affect the Company’s 
ability to maintain or obtain distribution for its network programming or distribution and/or marketing of its 
subscription program services on favorable or commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The Company is 
dependent upon the maintenance of affiliation agreements with third party owned television stations and 
there can be no assurance that these affiliation agreements will be renewed in the future on terms 
acceptable to the Company. The loss of a significant number of these affiliation arrangements could 
reduce the distribution of FOX and MyNetworkTV and adversely affect the Company’s ability to sell 
national advertising time. 

32

The Company Relies on Network and Information Systems and Other Technology Whose Degradation, 
Failure or Misuse, Could Cause a Disruption of Services or Improper Disclosure of Personal Data, 
Business Information, Including Intellectual Property, or Other Confidential Information, Resulting in 
Increased Costs or Loss of Revenue.

Network and information systems and other technologies, including those related to the Company’s 

network management, are important to its business activities. Network and information systems-related 
events, such as computer hacking and phishing, theft, computer viruses, ransomware, worms or other 
destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social 
engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing, as well as power outages, 
natural or other disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist activities or human error that may affect 
such systems, could result in disruption of our services or improper disclosure of personal data, business 
information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information. In recent years, there has 
been a rise in the number of sophisticated cyber attacks on network and information systems, and as a 
result, the risks associated with such an event continue to increase. The Company has experienced, and 
expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents, none of which has been material 
to the Company to date. While we continue to develop, implement and maintain security measures 
seeking to prevent unauthorized access to or misuse of our network and information systems, such 
efforts may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring given that the techniques used to 
access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently. The development and 
maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies 
change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Significant security 
breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, alteration, theft, loss, leakage, falsification, accidental or 
premature release, or otherwise improper disclosure of information maintained in the Company’s 
information systems and networks or those of our vendors, including financial, personal, confidential and 
proprietary information relating to personnel, customers, vendors and our business, including our 
intellectual property, or a degradation or interruption in the technologies and networks that facilitate 
content distribution could result in a disruption of our operations, customer or advertiser dissatisfaction, 
damage to our reputation or brands, regulatory investigations, claims, lawsuits or loss of customers or 
revenue. In addition, the Company may be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and 
laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy, may be required to expend significant 
resources to remedy any such security breach, and while the Company maintains insurance to assist in 
the cost of recovery in the event of a security breach, the Company may not have adequate insurance 
coverage to compensate it for any losses that may occur.

Technological Developments May Increase the Threat of Content Piracy and Signal Theft and Limit the 
Company’s Ability to Protect Its Intellectual Property Rights.

Content piracy and signal theft present a threat to the Company’s revenues from products and 

services, including, but not limited to, films, television shows, cable and other programming, as well as 
pre-release content. The Company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy as well as cable and direct 
broadcast satellite programming signal theft; however, policing unauthorized use of the Company’s 
products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken by the 
Company may not in every case prevent infringement. Developments in technology, including digital 
copying, file compression technology, growing penetration of high-bandwidth Internet connections, 
increased availability and speed of mobile data networks, and new devices and applications that enable 
unauthorized access to content, increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to access, 
duplicate, widely distribute and store high-quality pirated material. In addition, developments in software 
or devices that circumvent encryption technology and the falling prices of devices incorporating such 
technologies increase the threat of unauthorized use and distribution of direct broadcast satellite 
programming signals and the proliferation of user-generated content sites and live and stored video 
streaming sites, which deliver unauthorized copies of copyrighted content, including those emanating 
from other countries in various languages, may adversely impact the Company’s businesses. The 
proliferation of unauthorized distribution and use of the Company’s content could have an adverse effect 
on the Company’s businesses and profitability because it reduces the revenue that the Company could 
potentially receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of its products and services.

33

The Company has taken, and will continue to take, a variety of actions to combat piracy and signal 
theft, both individually and, in some instances, together with industry associations. However, protection of 
the Company’s intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of the Company’s 
rights as defined by applicable laws in the United States and abroad and the manner in which those laws 
are construed. If those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the 
Company’s rights, or if existing laws are changed, the Company’s ability to generate revenue from 
intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and enforcing our rights may increase. A 
change in the laws of one jurisdiction may also have an impact on the Company’s overall ability to protect 
its intellectual property rights across other jurisdictions. In addition, many parts of the world where piracy 
is prevalent lack effective copyright and other legal protections or enforcement measures. There can be 
no assurance that the Company’s efforts to enforce its rights and protect its products, services and 
intellectual property will be successful in preventing content piracy or signal theft. Further, while piracy 
and the proliferation of piracy-enabling technology tools continue to escalate, if any U.S. or international 
laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property are repealed or weakened or not 
adequately enforced, or if the applicable legal systems fail to evolve and adapt to new technologies that 
facilitate piracy, we may be unable to effectively protect our rights and the value of our intellectual 
property may be negatively impacted, and our costs of enforcing our rights could increase.

Fluctuations in Foreign Exchange Rates Could Have an Adverse Effect on the Company’s Cash Flows 
and Results of Operations.

The Company has significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of the 

Company’s operations are conducted in foreign currencies. The Company has acquired and may in the 
future acquire assets and businesses using foreign currencies. The value of these currencies fluctuates 
relative to the U.S. dollar. As a result, the Company is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations, which could 
have an adverse effect on its cash flows and results of operations in a given period or in specific markets. 
As part of the Sky Acquisition, the Company will be obligated to pay the Sky shareholders cash 
consideration in Pounds Sterling thereby increasing the Company’s exposure to exchange rate 
fluctuations for Pounds Sterling. The UK began the formal two-year process of exiting the European 
Union in March 2017, which could lead to additional political and economic instability that may contribute 
to volatility in the value of Pounds Sterling and other foreign exchange markets. Even though the 
Company uses foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposures to foreign currency 
exchange rate risks, and has purchased a foreign currency exchange option to limit its foreign currency 
exchange rate risk in connection with the Sky Acquisition, the use of such derivative instruments may not 
be effective in reducing the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange 
rates. In addition, countries where we have operations may be classified in the future to be highly 
inflationary economies, requiring special accounting and financial reporting treatment for such operations. 
The Argentine Peso has been designated highly inflationary and will be accounted for as such starting 
July 1, 2018.

Labor Disputes May Have an Adverse Effect on the Company’s Business.

In a variety of the Company’s businesses, the Company and its partners engage the services of 

writers, directors, actors and other talent, trade employees and others who are subject to collective 
bargaining agreements, including employees of the Company’s film and television studio operations. If 
the Company or its partners are unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible 
that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Such actions, as well 
as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, 
could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business by causing delays in production or by reducing 
profit margins.

Changes in U.S. or Foreign Regulations May Have an Adverse Effect on the Company’s Business.

The Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign regulations in the jurisdictions in which its 

businesses operate. In general, the television broadcasting and multichannel video programming and 
distribution industries in the United States are highly regulated by federal laws and regulations issued and 

34

administered by various federal agencies, including the FCC. The FCC generally regulates, among other 
things, the ownership of media, broadcast and multichannel video programming and technical operations 
of broadcast licensees. Our program services and online properties are subject to a variety of laws and 
regulations, including those relating to issues such as content regulation, user privacy and data 
protection, and consumer protection, among others. Further, the United States Congress, the FCC and 
state legislatures currently have under consideration, and may in the future adopt, new laws, regulations 
and policies regarding a wide variety of matters, including technological changes and measures relating 
to network neutrality, privacy and data security, which could, directly or indirectly, affect the operations 
and ownership of the Company’s U.S. media properties. Similarly, new laws or regulations or changes in 
interpretations of law or in regulations imposed by governments in other jurisdictions in which the 
Company, or entities in which the Company has an interest, operate could require changes in the 
operations or ownership of our media properties. Laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions which regulate, among 
other things, licensing arrangements, local content requirements, carriage requirements regarding pricing 
and distribution, and limitations on advertising time, may impact the operations and results of our 
international businesses. In addition, the GDPR applies as of May 25, 2018 and will tighten regulation of 
the collection, use and security of personal data and will continue to restrict the trans-border flow of such 
data while increasing the potential fines for non-compliance. We have committed significant resources to 
ensure that we are in compliance with the GDPR but, particularly given the complexity of both the GDPR 
and our business, as well as the uncertainties that accompany new, comprehensive legislation, the 
GDPR could affect the operations and results of the Company’s businesses or result in claims despite our 
efforts.

In addition, changes in laws, regulations or the interpretations thereof in the U.S. and other 

jurisdictions in which the Company has operations could affect the Company’s results of operations.

U.S. Citizenship Requirements May Limit Common Stock Ownership and Voting Rights.

The Company owns broadcast station licensees in connection with its ownership and operation of 
U.S. television stations. Under U.S. law, no broadcast station licensee may be owned by a corporation if 
more than 25% of its stock is owned or voted by non-U.S. persons, their representatives, or by any other 
corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country. The Company’s Restated Certificate of 
Incorporation authorizes the Board of Directors to prevent, cure or mitigate the effect of stock ownership 
above the applicable foreign ownership threshold by taking any action including: refusing to permit any 
transfer of common stock to or ownership of common stock by a non-U.S. stockholder; voiding a transfer 
of common stock to a non-U.S. stockholder; suspending rights of stock ownership if held by a non-U.S. 
stockholder; or redeeming common stock held by a non-U.S. stockholder. The Company is currently in 
compliance with applicable U.S. law and continues to monitor its foreign ownership based on its 
assessment of the information reasonably available to it, but it is not able to predict whether it will need to 
take action pursuant to its Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The FCC could review the Company’s 
compliance with applicable U.S. law in connection with its consideration of the Company’s renewal 
applications for licenses to operate the broadcast stations the Company owns.

The Company Could Be Subject to Significant Additional Tax Liabilities.

We are subject to taxation in U.S. federal, state and local jurisdictions and many non-U.S. 

jurisdictions. Changes in tax laws, regulations, practices or the interpretations thereof could affect the 
Company’s results of operations. Judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and 
accruals for taxes. In addition, transactions occur during the ordinary course of business or otherwise for 
which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.

Our tax returns are routinely audited, tax-related litigation or settlements may occur, and U.S. or 
foreign jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. The final outcomes of tax 
audits, investigations, and any related litigation could result in materially different tax recognition from our 
historical tax provisions and accruals. These outcomes could conflict with private letter rulings, opinions of 
counsel or other interpretations provided to the Company. If these matters are adversely resolved, we 
may be required to recognize additional charges to our tax provisions and pay significant additional 

35

amounts with respect to current or prior periods or our taxes in the future could increase, which could 
affect our operating results and financial condition.

In connection with the News Corp Separation, the Company received a private letter ruling from the 

IRS and an opinion from Hogan Lovells US LLP confirming the tax-free status of the distribution and 
related internal transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling 
and the opinion, the IRS could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should 
be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions or representations 
relied upon for the private letter ruling is not correct or has been violated. If these transactions are 
determined to be taxable, the Company would recognize gains on the internal reorganization and/or 
recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of the News Corp 
common stock distributed to our stockholders on the distribution date over our tax basis in such shares of 
our common stock. In addition, other tax authorities could determine on audit that the distribution or the 
related internal reorganizations should be treated as taxable transactions.

Under the terms of a tax sharing and indemnification agreement that we entered into in connection 
with the News Corp Separation, we are required to indemnify News Corp against U.S. consolidated and 
combined tax liabilities attributable to all tax periods or portions thereof prior to June 29, 2013. Disputes 
or assessments could arise during future audits by the IRS that could give rise to indemnification 
obligations under this agreement in amounts that we cannot quantify. 

In addition, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the comprehensive tax legislation 
commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The changes included in the Tax Act 
are broad and complex. As permitted by guidance issued by the SEC, we will finalize the recording of the 
related impacts of the Tax Act prior to the date that is one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act. 
For fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a provisional income tax benefit to adjust its net deferred tax 
liability position, a provisional liability for the transition tax to a territorial tax system and a provisional 
valuation allowance for foreign tax credits that it does not expect to be able to utilize before they expire in 
accordance with the Tax Act. The Company may make adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded 
during this measurement period and such adjustments could possibly be material. For additional 
information regarding the Tax Act, see Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the 
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox under the heading “U.S. 
Tax Reform”.

The Company is Exposed to Risks Associated with Weak Domestic and Global Economic Conditions and 
Increased Volatility and Disruption in the Financial Markets.

The Company’s businesses, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

by weak domestic and global economic conditions. Factors that affect economic conditions include the 
rate of unemployment, the level of consumer confidence, changes in consumer spending habits, political 
uncertainties and potential changes in trade relationships between the U.S. and other countries. The 
Company also faces risks, including currency volatility and the stability of global local economies, 
associated with the impact of weak domestic and global economic conditions on advertisers, affiliates, 
suppliers, wholesale distributors, retailers, insurers, theater operators and others with which it does 
business.

Increased volatility and disruptions in the financial markets could make it more difficult and more 
expensive for the Company to refinance outstanding indebtedness and obtain new financing, including 
financing for the Sky Acquisition. While the Company has entered into a bridge credit agreement, dated 
as of December 15, 2016 and as amended on July 11, 2018 (the “Bridge Credit Agreement”), we may 
obtain permanent financing in the capital markets to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Sky 
Acquisition in lieu of utilizing funds available under the Bridge Credit Agreement or to prepay funds drawn 
under the Bridge Credit Agreement, but we cannot guarantee that the Company will obtain such 
permanent financing on terms that are acceptable to the Company or at all. If we are not successful in 
obtaining permanent financing due to market conditions or other factors and utilize funds under the Bridge 
Credit Agreement, we will incur significantly higher borrowing costs than the contemplated permanent 

36

financing in the capital markets, which may have an adverse impact on our business. See Note 3 – 
Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements 
of Twenty-First Century Fox under the heading “Sky Acquisition”.

Disruptions in the financial markets can also adversely affect the Company’s lenders, insurers, 

customers and counterparties, including vendors, retailers and film co-financing partners. For instance, 
the inability of the Company’s counterparties to obtain capital on acceptable terms could impair their 
ability to perform under their agreements with the Company and lead to negative effects on the Company, 
including business disruptions, decreased revenues and increases in bad debt expenses.

The Company Could Suffer Losses Due to Asset Impairment Charges for Goodwill, Intangible Assets and 
Programming.

In accordance with applicable generally accepted accounting principles, the Company performs an 

annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including 
FCC licenses. The Company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators, such as the 
prevailing conditions in the capital markets, require the performance of an interim impairment assessment 
of those assets, as well as other investments and other long-lived assets. Any significant shortfall, now or 
in the future, in advertising revenue and/or the expected popularity of the programming for which the 
Company has acquired rights could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units. 
A downward revision in the fair value of a reporting unit, indefinite-lived intangible assets, investments or 
long-lived assets could result in an impairment and a non-cash charge would be required. Any such 
charge could be material to the Company’s reported net earnings.

Certain of Our Directors and Officers May Have Actual or Potential Conflicts of Interest Because of Their 
Equity Ownership in News Corp, and Certain of Our Officers and Directors May Have Actual or Potential 
Conflicts of Interest Because They Also Serve as Officers and/or on the Board of Directors of News Corp.
Certain of our directors and executive officers own shares of News Corp’s common stock, and the 

individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets. In 
addition, certain of our officers and directors also serve as officers and/or as directors of News Corp, 
including our Executive Chairmen K. Rupert Murdoch, who serves as News Corp’s Executive Chairman, 
and Lachlan K. Murdoch, who serves as News Corp’s Co-Chairman, and our Chief Executive Officer 
James Murdoch, who serves as a director of News Corp. This ownership or service to both companies 
may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are 
faced with decisions that could have different implications for News Corp and us. In addition to any other 
arrangements that the Company and News Corp may agree to implement, the Company and News Corp 
agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions 
where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies.

Fox News Channel

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

The Company and certain of its current and former employees have been subject to allegations of 

sexual harassment and discrimination and racial discrimination relating to alleged misconduct at the 
Company’s Fox News Channel business. The Company has resolved many of these claims and is 
contesting other claims in litigation. The Company has also received regulatory and investigative inquiries 
relating to these matters. To date, none of the amounts paid in settlements or reserved for pending or 
future claims, is individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company. The amount of liability, if any, 
that may result from these or related matters cannot be estimated at this time. However, the Company 
does not currently anticipate that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will have a material 
adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, future results of operations or liquidity.

Litigation Relating to the Transaction

On July 9, 2018, the Company received notice of a complaint filed July 6, 2018 by Robert Weiss, a 
purported stockholder of the Company, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, against the 
Company and the Company’s Board of Directors. The purported class action lawsuit was filed in the 
District of Delaware and is captioned Weiss v. Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. et al., No. 18-1007 (D. Del.). 
The complaint alleges, among other things, that the Company and the Company’s Board of Directors 
violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15.U.S.C. §§ 78n(a), 78t(a), and SEC Rule 14a-9, 
17 C.F.R. 240.14a-9. Specifically, Mr. Weiss alleges that material information concerning various aspects 
of the transactions has been omitted or misrepresented. On July 11, 2018, purported Company 
stockholder Robert Lowinger, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, filed a complaint in the 
Southern District of New York alleging, among other things, that the Company and the Company’s Board 
of Directors violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15.U.S.C. §§ 78n(a), 78t(a), and SEC 
Rule 14a-9, 17 C.F.R. 240.14a-9. The case is captioned Lowinger v. Twenty-First Century Fox, In. et al., 
No. 18-6261 (S.D.N.Y.). Specifically, Mr. Lowinger alleges that material information concerning various 
aspects of the transactions has been omitted or misrepresented. On July 16, 2018 and July 17, 2018, 
purported Company stockholders Melvin Gross and Max Federman, on behalf of themselves and all 
others similarly situated, filed complaints in the District of Delaware alleging, among other things, that the 
Company and the Company’s Board of Directors violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 
15.U.S.C. §§ 78n(a), 78t(a), and SEC Rule 14a-9, 17 C.F.R. 240.14a-9. The cases are captioned Gross 
v. Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. et al., No. 18-1046 (D. Del.) and Federman v. Twenty-First Century Fox, 
Inc. et al., No. 18-1061 (D. Del.), respectively. Both Messrs. Gross and Federman allege that material 
information concerning various aspects of the transactions has been omitted or misrepresented. On July 
17, 2018 purported Company stockholder Belle Cohen, individually and on behalf of all others similarly 
situated, filed a complaint in the Southern District of New York captioned Cohen v. Twenty-First Century 
Fox, In. et al., No. 18-6462 (S.D.N.Y.). The complaint alleges, among other things, that the Company and 
the Company board violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15.U.S.C. §§ 78n(a), 78t(a), 
and SEC Rule 14a-9, 17 C.F.R. 240.14a-9 by omitting or misrepresenting material information concerning 
various aspects of the transactions.

39

Through these actions, the plaintiffs sought to enjoin the July 27, 2018 special meeting of the 

Company’s stockholders. The defendants believe that all of the actions are without merit.

Cash dividend declared per share. 

The timing and amount of cash dividends, if any, is determined by the Company’s Board of 

Directors (the “Board”). Subsequent to June 30, 2018, the Company declared a semi-annual dividend of 
$0.18 per share on both the Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock. The dividend 
declared is payable on October 17, 2018 with a record date for determining dividend entitlements of

authorized to acquire Class A Common Stock. In August 2016 and 2015, the Board authorized the 
repurchase of an additional $3 billion and $5 billion, respectively, of Class A Common Stock, excluding 
commissions. As of June 30, 2018, the Company’s remaining buyback authorization was approximately 
$3.1 billion representing $3 billion under the fiscal 2017 authorization and approximately $110 million 
under the fiscal 2016 authorization. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement (See 
Note 3 – Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions to the accompanying Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the Company under the heading “Disney Transaction/Distribution of New Fox”), the

2018, 2017 and 2016.
In fiscal 2015, the Company sold its 100% and 57% ownership stakes in Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland, 
respectively, to Sky for approximately $8.8 billion in value comprised of approximately $8.2 billion in cash 
received, net of $650 million of cash paid to acquire Sky’s 21% interest in NGC Network International 
LLC and NGC Network Latin America LLC (collectively, “NGC International”), increasing the Company’s 
ownership stake in NGC International to 73%. In connection with this transaction, the Company 
participated in Sky’s equity offering in July 2014 by purchasing additional shares in Sky for approximately 
$900 million and maintained the Company’s 39% ownership interest. As a result of the transaction, Sky 
Italia and Sky Deutschland ceased to be consolidated subsidiaries of the Company. The Company 
recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $5.0 billion on this transaction. 
In fiscal 2014, the Company acquired an additional 31% interest in the Yankees Entertainment and 
Sports Network (the “YES Network”), increasing the Company’s ownership interest to an 80% controlling 
interest, for approximately $680 million, net of cash acquired. As a result of this transaction, the 

42

Company consolidated the balance sheet and operating results of the YES Network, including $1.7 
billion in debt. Also in fiscal 2014, a subsidiary of News Corp (as defined in Note 4 – Discontinued 
Operations to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox), prior 
to the News Corp Separation (as defined in Note 4 – Discontinued Operations to the accompanying 
Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox), had filed for tax reimbursement in a 
foreign jurisdiction. During fiscal 2014, the foreign jurisdiction notified News Corp that it had accepted its 
claims and would reimburse the taxes plus interest to News Corp. As of June 30, 2014, the net amount 
that the Company received, pursuant to the tax sharing and indemnification agreement with News Corp, 
was approximately $720 million, which was included in income from discontinued operations, net of tax. 
Also during fiscal 2014, through separate transactions, the Company sold its 47% interest in CMC-News 
Asia Holdings Limited, its 50% interest in STATS LLC, its 50% interest in STAR CJ Network India Pvt. 
Ltd. and its 12% interest in Phoenix Satellite Television Holdings Ltd. for approximately $465 million. The 
Company recorded a gain on these transactions.
On July 1, 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2015-03, “Interest—
Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs” 
(“ASU 2015-03”) on a retrospective basis. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 resulted in a $172 million, 
$171 million and $165 million decrease in Other non-current assets and Non-current Borrowings in 
the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS 

The Company is a diversified global media and entertainment company, which manages and 

reports its businesses in the following four segments: 

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

Cable Network Programming, which principally consists of the production and licensing of 
programming distributed primarily through cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite 
operators, telecommunication companies and online video distributors, (collectively, “multi-channel 
video programming distributors”) (“MVPDs”) in the United States (“U.S.”) and internationally. 
Television, which principally consists of the broadcasting of network programming in the U.S. 
and the operation of 28 full power broadcast television stations, including 11 duopolies, in the 
U.S. (of these stations, 17 are affiliated with FOX Broadcasting Company (“FOX”), nine are 
affiliated with Master Distribution Service, Inc. (“MyNetworkTV”), one is affiliated with both The 
CW Television Network and MyNetworkTV and one is an independent station). 
Filmed Entertainment, which principally consists of the production and acquisition of live-
action and animated motion pictures for distribution and licensing in all formats in all 
entertainment media worldwide, and the production and licensing of television programming 
worldwide. 
Other, Corporate and Eliminations, which principally consists of corporate overhead costs 
and intercompany eliminations. 

Cable Network Programming and Television

The Company’s cable networks, which target various demographics, derive a majority of their 

revenues from monthly affiliate fees received from MVPDs based on the number of their subscribers. 
Affiliate fee revenues are net of the amortization of cable distribution investments (capitalized fees paid to 
U.S. MVPDs to typically facilitate the carriage of a domestic cable network). The Company defers the 
cable distribution investments and amortizes the amounts on a straight-line basis over the contract 
period. In the U.S., cable television systems and direct broadcast satellite operators are currently the 
predominant means of distribution of the Company’s program services. Internationally, distribution 
technology varies region by region. 

The television operations derive revenues primarily from the sale of advertising and affiliate fee 

revenue. Adverse changes in general market conditions for advertising may affect revenues. 

U.S. law governing retransmission consent revenue, recognized as affiliate fees, provides a 

mechanism for the television stations owned by the Company to seek and obtain payment from MVPDs 
who carry the Company’s broadcast signals. Retransmission consent revenue consists of per subscriber-
based compensatory fees paid to the Company by MVPDs that distribute the signals of the Company’s 
owned and operated television stations. The Company also receives compensation, primarily related to 
the distribution of FOX programming, from independently-owned television stations that are affiliated with 
FOX. 

The most significant operating expenses of the Cable Network Programming segment and the 
Television segment are acquisition and production expenses related to programming, marketing and 
promotional expenses, and expenses related to operating the technical facilities of the cable network or 
broadcaster. Marketing and promotional expenses relate to improving the market visibility and awareness 
of the cable network or broadcaster and its programming. Additional expenses include salaries, employee 
benefits, rent and other routine overhead expenses.

The profitability of U.S. national sports contracts and certain international sports rights agreements is 

based on the Company’s best estimates at June 30, 2018 of attributable revenues and costs; such estimates 
may change in the future and such changes may be significant. Should revenues decline materially from 
estimates applied at June 30, 2018, amortization of rights may be accelerated. Should revenues improve as 

45

compared to estimated revenues, the Company may have improved results related to the contract, which may 
be recognized over the remaining contract term. 

Filmed Entertainment 

The Filmed Entertainment segment derives revenue from the production and distribution of live-

action and animated motion pictures and television series. In general, motion pictures produced or 
acquired for distribution by the Company are exhibited in U.S. and foreign theaters, followed by home 
entertainment, including sale and rental of DVDs and Blu-rays, licensing through digital distribution 
platforms, premium subscription television, network television and basic cable and syndicated television 
exploitation. Television series initially produced for the networks and first-run syndication are generally 
licensed to domestic and international markets concurrently and subsequently made available via digital 
distribution platforms and released in seasonal DVD and Blu-ray box sets. More successful series are 
later syndicated in domestic markets. The length of the revenue cycle for television series will vary 
depending on the number of seasons a series remains in active production and, therefore, may cause 
fluctuations in operating results. License fees received for television exhibition (including international and 
U.S. premium television and basic cable television) are recorded as revenue in the period that licensed 
films or programs are available for such exhibition, which may cause substantial fluctuations in operating 
results. 

The revenues and operating results of the Filmed Entertainment segment are significantly affected 

by the timing of the Company’s theatrical, home entertainment and digital distribution releases, the 
number of its original and returning television series that are aired by television networks and cable 
channels and the number of its television series in off-network syndication. Theatrical and home 
entertainment release dates are determined by several factors, including timing of vacation and holiday 
periods and competition in the marketplace. The distribution windows for the release of motion pictures 
theatrically and in various home entertainment products and services (including subscription rentals, 
rental kiosks and digital distribution platforms), have been compressing and may continue to change in 
the future. A further reduction in timing between theatrical and home entertainment releases could 
adversely affect the revenues and operating results of this segment. 

The Company enters into arrangements with third parties to co-produce certain of its theatrical and 

television productions. These arrangements, which are referred to as co-financing arrangements, take 
various forms. The parties to these arrangements, primarily for theatrical productions, include studio and 
non-studio entities both domestic and international. In several of these agreements, other parties control 
certain distribution rights. The Filmed Entertainment segment records the amounts received for the sale of 
an economic interest as a reduction of the cost of the film, as the investor assumes full risk for that portion 
of the film asset acquired in these transactions. The substance of these arrangements is that the third-
party investors own an interest in the film and, therefore, receive a participation based on the third-party 
investors’ contractual interest in the profits or losses incurred on the film. Consistent with the 
requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification 
(“ASC”) 926, “Entertainment—Films” (“ASC 926”), the estimate of the third-party investor’s interest in 
profits or losses on the film is based on total estimated ultimate revenues. 

Operating costs incurred by the Filmed Entertainment segment include: exploitation costs, primarily 

theatrical prints and advertising and home entertainment marketing and manufacturing costs; 
amortization of capitalized production, overhead and interest costs; and participations and talent 
residuals. Selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and 
other routine overhead expenses. 

Other Business Developments 

In June 2018, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Merger Agreement and Plan of 

Merger (the “Amended and Restated Merger Agreement”) with The Walt Disney Company (“Disney”), 
which amends and restates in its entirety the Agreement and Plan of Merger that the Company entered 
into with Disney in December 2017. Prior to the mergers contemplated by the Amended and Restated 

46

Merger Agreement, the Company will transfer a portfolio of the Company’s news, sports and broadcast 
businesses and certain other assets and liabilities into a newly formed subsidiary (“New Fox”) and the 
holders of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock 
(other than holders that are subsidiaries of the Company) will receive, on a pro rata basis, all of the 
issued and outstanding common stock of New Fox.

In December 2016, the Company made an offer to purchase the fully diluted share capital of Sky plc 

(“Sky”) which the Company does not already own. In July 2018, the Company announced an increased 
offer price for the Sky Acquisition (the “Increased Offer”). On August 7, 2018, the Company posted an 
offer document to Sky shareholders in connection with the Increased Offer and announced that it intends 
to implement the Sky Acquisition by way of a takeover offer within the meaning of Part 28 of the 
Companies Act 2006 (the “UK Companies Act”) rather than by means of a scheme of arrangement in 
accordance with Part 26 of the UK Companies Act, which had been the proposed structure of the Sky 
Acquisition prior to that date. The Company has noted that the deadline for publication of any revised 
offer document in respect of its Increased Offer is September 22, 2018.

See Note 3 – Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions to the accompanying Consolidated 

Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox for further details.

Overview – The Company’s revenues increased 7% for fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, 

primarily due to higher affiliate fee and content revenues partially offset by lower advertising revenue. The 
increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily attributable to contractual rate increases at the Cable 
Network Programming and Television segments. The increase in content revenue was primarily due to 
higher subscription video-on-demand (“SVOD”) revenue from the licensing of television productions, higher 
worldwide theatrical revenue and the sublicensing of Big Ten programming rights to third party networks. 
The decrease in advertising revenue was primarily due to the comparative effect of the broadcast of the 
National Football League (“NFL”) Super Bowl LI in February 2017 and lower U.S. political advertising 
revenue due to the impact of the 2016 presidential election last year partially offset by the broadcasts of 
the Indian Premier League (“IPL”) and the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (“FIFA”) World 
Cup. These revenue increases include a benefit of approximately $135 million due to the strengthening of 
local currencies against the U.S. dollar for fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017.

Operating expenses increased 9% for fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to 
higher sports and entertainment programming rights amortization at the Cable Network Programming 
segment and higher production amortization and participation costs from television and motion picture 
productions at the Filmed Entertainment segment.

48

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 11% for fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 
2017, primarily due to higher compensation expenses, including approximately $65 million of additional 
compensation expense related to the Transaction (See Note 3 – Acquisitions, Disposals and Other 
Transactions to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox under 
the heading “Disney Transaction/Distribution of New Fox”), and higher legal fees.

Impairment and restructuring charges – See Note 5 – Restructuring Programs and Note 6 – 
Inventories, net to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox.

Equity losses of affiliates – Equity losses of affiliates increased $97 million for fiscal 2018, as 

compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher losses at Hulu, LLC (“Hulu”) resulting from higher 
programming costs partially offset by higher subscription and advertising revenues. Partially offsetting the 
increased Hulu equity losses were higher earnings at Sky, principally as a result of increased revenues 
partially offset by higher programming and operating costs, and improved results at Endemol Shine 
Group, primarily due to the absence of a goodwill impairment recorded in fiscal 2017.

Interest expense, net – Interest expense increased $29 million for fiscal 2018, as compared to 

fiscal 2017, primarily due to the bridge credit agreement and the bridge commitment letter related to the 
Sky Acquisition and the Transaction, respectively (as described in Note 3 – Acquisitions, Disposals and 
Other Transactions to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox 
under the headings “Sky Acquisition” and “Disney Transaction/Distribution of New Fox”).

Other, net – See Note 22 – Additional Financial Information to the accompanying Consolidated 

Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox under the heading “Other, net”.

Income tax benefit (expense) – The Company’s effective tax rate of (8)% for fiscal 2018 was lower 

than the statutory rate of 28% primarily due to a provisional $1.5 billion tax benefit which reflects the 
effects of the legislation in the U.S. passed in December 2017 commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) (See Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying 
Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox under the heading “U.S. Tax Reform”).

The Company’s tax provision and related effective tax rate of 30% for fiscal 2017 was lower than the 

statutory rate of 35% primarily due to a 3% benefit from domestic production activities and a 2% benefit 
from the Company’s foreign operations.

Net income – Net income increased for fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to the 

income tax benefit as a result of the Tax Act.

Overview – The Company’s revenues increased 4% for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, 

primarily due to higher affiliate fee, advertising and other revenues partially offset by lower content 
revenue. The increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily attributable to higher average rates per 
subscriber at the domestic channels. The increase in advertising revenue was primarily due to the 
broadcast of Super Bowl LI in February 2017, higher ratings and pricing at Fox News Channel (“Fox 
News”) and the broadcast of the Major League Baseball (“MLB”) World Series, which benefited from 
higher ratings and two additional games. Partially offsetting these increases in advertising revenue were 
lower entertainment advertising revenue at both FOX and the Company’s television stations due to lower 
entertainment ratings at FOX as compared to fiscal 2016, which included the final season of American 
Idol. The increase in other revenues was primarily due to the acquisition of the publishing, travel and 
certain other businesses (the “NGS Media Business”) in November 2015 from the National Geographic 
Society (See Note 3 – Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions to the accompanying Consolidated 
Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox under the heading “National Geographic Partners”). 
The decrease in content revenue was primarily attributable to lower worldwide theatrical and home 
entertainment revenues from motion pictures partially offset by higher SVOD and network and syndication 
revenues. The 4% revenue increase is net of a decrease of approximately $220 million due to the 
strengthening of the U.S. dollar against local currencies for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.

50

Operating expenses increased 4% for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to 

higher sports programming rights amortization at the Cable Network Programming and Television 
segments, including Super Bowl LI at the Television segment, and the acquisition of the NGS Media 
Business partially offset by lower marketing costs at the Filmed Entertainment segment.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 3% for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 
2016, primarily due to lower compensation expense partially offset by the acquisition of the NGS Media 
Business.

Impairment and restructuring charges – See Note 5 – Restructuring Programs and Note 6 – 
Inventories, net to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox. 

Equity losses of affiliates – Equity losses of affiliates increased $7 million for fiscal 2017, as 

compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher losses at Hulu and lower equity earnings for Sky 
principally due to the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Pound Sterling partially 
offset by improved results at Endemol Shine Group. For fiscal 2016, Endemol Shine Group’s results 
include the Company’s proportionate share related to the loss on deconsolidation of a subsidiary and 
other impairment charges of approximately $95 million (See Note 7 – Investments to the accompanying 
Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox under the heading “Other Equity 
Affiliates”).

Interest expense, net – Interest expense increased $35 million for fiscal 2017, as compared to 

fiscal 2016, primarily due to the bridge credit agreement (as described in Note 3 – Acquisitions, Disposals 
and Other Transactions to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century 
Fox under the heading “Sky Acquisition”) and higher average debt outstanding as a result of the issuance 
in November 2016 of $450 million of 3.375% Senior Notes due 2026 and $400 million of 4.750% Senior 
Notes due 2046.

Other, net – See Note 22 – Additional Financial Information to the accompanying Consolidated 

Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox under the heading “Other, net”.

Income tax expense – The Company’s tax provision and related effective tax rate of 30% for fiscal 

2017 was lower than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to a 3% benefit from domestic production 
activities and a 2% benefit from the Company’s foreign operations.

The Company’s tax provision and related effective tax rate of 27% for fiscal 2016 was lower than the 

statutory rate of 35% primarily due to a 3% rate reduction from the Company’s foreign operations and a 4% 
rate reduction from increased tax amortization deductions for certain film and television properties as a 
result of a ruling that was received by the Company. In addition, increases in the net provision for 
uncertain tax positions were substantially offset by the final settlement of a foreign matter. 

Net income – Net income increased for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to 

higher operating results.

Segment Analysis 

The Company’s operating segments have been determined in accordance with the Company’s 

internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities. The Company evaluates 
performance based upon several factors, of which the primary financial measure is Segment OIBDA. Due 
to the integrated nature of these operating segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating 
certain assets, revenues and expenses.

Segment OIBDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and 

administrative expenses. Segment OIBDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution 
investments, Depreciation and amortization, Impairment and restructuring charges, Equity losses of 
affiliates, Interest expense, net, Interest income, Other, net, Income tax benefit (expense), Loss from 
discontinued operations, net of tax and Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Management 
believes that Segment OIBDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the 
Company’s business segments because it is the primary measure used by the Company’s chief operating 
decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to the Company’s businesses.

Management believes that information about Total Segment OIBDA assists all users of the 

Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating 
results of the Company’s portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net 
income, thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. Total 
Segment OIBDA provides management, investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze the 
operating performance of the Company’s business and its enterprise value against historical data and 
competitors’ data, although historical results, including Segment OIBDA and Total Segment OIBDA, may 
not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, 
including customer tastes and preferences).

Total Segment OIBDA may be considered a non-GAAP measure and should be considered in 

addition to, not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow and other measures of financial performance 
reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). In addition, this 
measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation 
and amortization and impairment charges, which are significant components in assessing the Company’s 
financial performance.

and 2017, respectively) 

For fiscal 2018, revenues at the Cable Network Programming segment increased $1.8 billion, or 

11%, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher affiliate fee, advertising and content and other 
revenues as shown below:

For fiscal 2018, Cable Network Programming Segment OIBDA increased $572 million, or 10%, as 

compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above partially offset by higher 
expenses of $1.2 billion, or 12%. For fiscal 2018, the increase in expenses was primarily due to higher 
sports programming rights amortization and production costs.

Domestic Channels

For fiscal 2018, domestic affiliate fee revenue increased, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due 

to contractual rate increases led by the Regional Sports Networks (“RSNs”), Fox News, FS1 and FX 
Networks. For fiscal 2018, domestic advertising revenue increased, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily 
due to higher pricing at Fox News. The increase in domestic content and other revenues for fiscal 2018, 
as compared to fiscal 2017, was primarily due to the sublicensing of Big Ten programming rights to third 
party networks.

For fiscal 2018, domestic channels OIBDA increased 8%, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due 
to the revenue increases noted above partially offset by higher expenses. Operating expenses increased 
approximately $635 million for fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher sports 
programming rights amortization and production costs, including the addition of Big Ten and FIFA World 
Cup programming and higher National Basketball Association (“NBA”) and MLB costs as a result of 
contractual rate increases. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $85 
million for fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher legal fees and compensation 
expenses.

International Channels

For fiscal 2018, international affiliate fee revenue increased, as compared to fiscal 2017, as a result 

of higher rates and additional subscribers in Latin America, Europe and India. For fiscal 2018, 
international advertising revenues increased, as compared to fiscal 2017, led by the addition of the IPL at 
STAR India (“STAR”), higher pricing and viewership at STAR’s general entertainment channels and 
growth in Latin America. The increase in international content and other revenues for fiscal 2018, as 

54

compared to fiscal 2017, was primarily due to the sublicensing of soccer programming rights in Latin 
America.

For fiscal 2018, international channels OIBDA increased 22%, as compared to fiscal 2017, as the 
revenue increases noted above were partially offset by higher expenses. Operating expenses increased 
approximately $490 million for fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to the addition of the 
IPL programming rights at STAR and higher sports and entertainment programming rights amortization at 
Fox Networks Group International (“FNGI”), led by higher soccer rights in Latin America and Europe.

Television (17% and 20% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in fiscal 2018 and 2017, 
respectively)

For fiscal 2018, revenues at the Television segment decreased $487 million, or 9%, as compared to 

fiscal 2017, as higher affiliate fee revenue was more than offset by lower advertising and content and 
other revenues. Affiliate fee revenue increased 12%, as compared to fiscal 2017, due to contractual rate 
increases. Advertising revenue decreased 15%, as compared to fiscal 2017, due to lower NFL revenue 
primarily due to the comparative effect of the broadcast of Super Bowl LI in February 2017 of 
approximately $425 million, the broadcast of one less postseason game and lower ratings combined with 
lower ratings for the MLB World Series games and lower political advertising revenue due to the 2016 
presidential election. These decreases were partially offset by the broadcast of the FIFA World Cup and a 
higher number of college football games in fiscal 2018. Content and other revenues decreased 15%, as 
compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to the absence of revenue generated in the prior year by one of 
the Company’s television stations granting a license to permit the commercial use of adjacent wireless 
spectrum in that market.

For fiscal 2018, Television Segment OIBDA decreased $532 million, or 60%, as compared to fiscal 
2017, primarily due to the revenue decreases noted above as well as increased expenses of $45 million, 
or 1%, as compared to fiscal 2017. Operating expenses remained relatively consistent with fiscal 2017, 
as the decreased expenses due to absence of Super Bowl LI were offset by higher sports programming 
rights amortization primarily due to the broadcast of a higher number of college football games, the 
addition of the FIFA World Cup and contractual rate increases with the NFL and MLB. Selling, general 
and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher compensation, legal and facility costs. The 
absence of Super Bowl LI in the current year decreased Segment OIBDA by approximately $100 million 
for fiscal 2018.

Filmed Entertainment (29% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in fiscal 2018 and 2017)

For fiscal 2018, revenues at the Filmed Entertainment segment increased $512 million, or 6%, as 
compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher SVOD revenue from television productions, led by the 
licensing of Bob’s Burgers and This Is Us, and higher worldwide theatrical and home entertainment 
revenues from motion picture productions partially offset by lower television licensing revenues from 
motion picture productions. The revenues at the Filmed Entertainment segment include benefits of 
approximately $110 million due to the strengthening of local currencies against the U.S. dollar for fiscal 
2018, as compared to fiscal 2017.

increases noted above. Operating expenses increased approximately $490 million for fiscal 2018, as 
compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher production amortization and participation costs from 
television and motion picture productions and higher costs at FoxNext Games related to the release of 
the mobile game, Marvel Strike Force. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 
approximately $110 million for fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher 
compensation costs, including higher costs at FoxNext Games. Segment OIBDA for fiscal 2018 
decreased approximately $95 million due to the new releases and initiatives at FoxNext Games. The 
strengthening of local currencies against the U.S. dollar resulted in a Segment OIBDA increase of 
approximately $75 million for fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017.

Cable Network Programming (57% and 55% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in fiscal 2017 
and 2016, respectively) 

For fiscal 2017, revenues at the Cable Network Programming segment increased $1.1 billion, or 7%, 

as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher affiliate fee, advertising and content and other 
revenues as shown below:

These revenue increases are net of a decrease of approximately $155 million due to the 

strengthening of the U.S. dollar against local currencies, primarily in Latin America and Europe, for fiscal 
2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.

For fiscal 2017, Cable Network Programming Segment OIBDA increased $456 million, or 9%, as 
compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above partially offset by higher 
expenses of $645 million, or 7%. For fiscal 2017, the Segment OIBDA increase is net of a decrease of 
approximately $60 million due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against local currencies as 
compared to fiscal 2016. The incremental revenues and expenses related to the NGS Media Business as 
a result of the acquisition were approximately $140 million for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.

Domestic Channels

For fiscal 2017, domestic affiliate fee revenue increased, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due 

to higher average rates per subscriber led by Fox News and the RSNs partially offset by the impact of 
lower average subscribers. Also contributing to the increase were FS1 and FS2 due to higher average 
rates per subscriber and higher average subscribers and FX Networks due to higher average rates per 
subscriber. For fiscal 2017, domestic advertising revenue increased, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily 
due to higher ratings and pricing at Fox News and the broadcasts of the MLB postseason games at FS1 
partially offset by the impact of lower ratings at FX Networks. The increase in domestic content and other 
revenues for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily due to the acquisition of the NGS 
Media Business and higher SVOD revenue.

For fiscal 2017, domestic channels OIBDA increased 10%, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily 

due to the revenue increases noted above partially offset by higher expenses. Operating expenses 
increased approximately $505 million for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, principally due to higher 
sports rights amortization, including the MLB, NBA and National Association of Stock Car Auto Racing 
(“NASCAR”) rights at the Company’s sports channels, higher programming and marketing costs related to 
the launch of new programming at FX Networks and National Geographic and the acquisition of the NGS 
Media Business. 

International Channels

For fiscal 2017, international affiliate fee revenue increased, as compared to fiscal 2016, as a result 
of local currency growth of 11%, led by additional subscribers and higher rates at FNGI in Latin America 
and Europe and at STAR. Partially offsetting the affiliate fee increase for fiscal 2017 was the adverse 
impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against local currencies. For fiscal 2017, international 
advertising revenues decreased, as compared to fiscal 2016, as local currency growth at FNGI in Latin 
America and Europe was more than offset by lower local currency advertising revenue at STAR due to 
the effect of the Indian government’s demonetization initiatives on the general advertising market in India, 
a lower volume of cricket matches broadcast in the current year and a decrease in market share. The 
adverse impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against local currencies also contributed to the 
decrease in international advertising revenue. The increase in international content and other revenues 
for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily due to higher network and syndication revenues 
in Latin America and Asia at FNGI partially offset by lower syndication revenues related to sports rights at 
STAR.

For fiscal 2017, international channels OIBDA increased 4%, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily 

due to the revenue increases noted above partially offset by higher expenses. Operating expenses 
increased approximately $125 million for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher 
entertainment programming rights amortization at FNGI in Europe and Latin America and at STAR 
partially offset by lower sports programming amortization at STAR, due to lower volume of cricket 
matches broadcast in the current year.

Television (20% and 19% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in fiscal 2017 and 2016, 
respectively) 

For fiscal 2017, revenues at the Television segment increased $544 million, or 11%, as compared to 

fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher advertising, affiliate fee and content and other revenues. Advertising 
revenue increased 8% for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to revenues resulting 
from the broadcast of Super Bowl LI in February 2017 of approximately $425 million after agency 

58

commissions, the MLB World Series which benefited from higher ratings and two additional games, 
higher political advertising related to the 2016 U.S. elections, the broadcast of one additional NFL 
divisional playoff game and higher ratings and pricing of the NFL postseason. Partially offsetting these 
increases in advertising revenue were lower entertainment advertising revenue at both FOX and the 
Company’s television stations due to lower entertainment ratings at FOX as compared to fiscal 2016, 
which included the final season of American Idol and the Emmy Awards, and lower ratings for the 
broadcast of the NFL regular season. Affiliate fee revenue increased 14% for fiscal 2017, as compared to 
fiscal 2016, as a result of higher rates. Content and other revenues increased 45% for fiscal 2017, as 
compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher SVOD revenue at FOX and revenue generated by one of 
the Company’s television stations granting a license to permit the commercial use of adjacent wireless 
spectrum in that market.

For fiscal 2017, Television Segment OIBDA increased $150 million, or 20%, as compared to fiscal 

2016, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above, partially offset by higher expenses of $394 
million, or 9%, as compared to fiscal 2016. Operating expenses increased approximately $440 million for 
fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher sports programming rights amortization 
and production costs at FOX, including Super Bowl LI and one additional NFL divisional playoff game, 
and higher advertising and promotion costs at FOX related to new television series. Partially offsetting 
these increases in operating expenses were a decrease in entertainment programming rights 
amortization at FOX, primarily due to the absence of American Idol and the mix of programming in the 
current year compared to the prior year. The increase in operating expenses noted above was partially 
offset by a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses. 

Filmed Entertainment (29% and 31% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in fiscal 2017 and 2016, 
respectively) 

For fiscal 2017, revenues at the Filmed Entertainment segment decreased $270 million, or 3%, as 
compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower worldwide theatrical and home entertainment revenues 
from motion picture productions. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher SVOD revenue from 
television productions, led by the licensing of Homeland and The People v. O.J. Simpson: American 
Crime Story, and higher network and syndication revenues from television productions, led by a number 
of new series licensed for distribution. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against local currencies 
resulted in a revenue decrease of approximately $65 million for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.

The following feature film titles contributed significant revenues for fiscal 2017 and 2016:

 
 

Fiscal 2017

 
 
Worldwide theatrical and home 
entertainment releases ........................  Logan
  Trolls
  Ice Age: Collision Course
  Independence Day: Resurgence   Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials

 
 
 
Worldwide theatrical releases................  The Boss Baby

  Deadpool
  The Martian
  Kung Fu Panda 3

  X-Men: Apocalypse

 

 

Fiscal 2016

 
 

For fiscal 2017, Filmed Entertainment Segment OIBDA decreased $34 million, or 3%, as compared 
to fiscal 2016, primarily due to the revenue decreases noted above partially offset by lower expenses of 
$236 million, or 3%. For fiscal 2017, operating expenses decreased approximately $200 million, as 
compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower production amortization and participation costs and lower 
marketing costs related to motion picture productions due to the mix of theatrical releases in the current 
period compared to the prior year partially offset by higher production amortization and participation costs 
related to television productions due to the number and mix of television series delivered in the current 
period compared to the prior year. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in 
a Segment OIBDA decrease of approximately $50 million for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
Current Financial Condition 

The Company’s principal source of liquidity is internally generated funds. The Company also has an 

unused $1.4 billion revolving credit facility, as amended, which expires in May 2020, and has access to 
various film co-financing alternatives to supplement its cash flows. In addition, the Company has access 
to the worldwide capital markets, subject to market conditions. As of June 30, 2018, the Company was in 
compliance with all of the covenants under the revolving credit facility, and it does not anticipate any 
violation of such covenants. The Company’s internally generated funds are highly dependent upon the 
state of the advertising markets and public acceptance of its film and television productions.

As of June 30, 2018, the Company’s consolidated assets included $7.6 billion in cash and cash 
equivalents, of which approximately $1.1 billion was held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. The 
Company earns income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in certain 
foreign jurisdictions. The Company does not currently intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. 
Should the Company require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by or available to its domestic 
operations, the Company could elect to repatriate funds held in foreign jurisdictions which, for certain 
balances, may result in higher effective tax rates and higher cash paid for income taxes for the Company. 
As a result of the Tax Act, the Company will continue to evaluate whether or not to assert indefinite 
reinvestment on a part or all the foreign undistributed earnings as further guidance becomes available.

The principal uses of cash that affect the Company’s liquidity position include the following: 
investments in the production and distribution of new motion pictures and television programs; the 
acquisition of rights and related payments for entertainment and sports programming; operational 
expenditures including employee costs; capital expenditures; interest expenses; income tax payments; 
investments in associated entities; dividends; acquisitions; debt repayments; and stock repurchases.

In addition to the acquisitions, sales and possible acquisitions disclosed elsewhere, the Company 

has evaluated, and expects to continue to evaluate, possible acquisitions and dispositions of certain 
businesses and assets. Such transactions may be material and may involve cash, the Company’s 
securities or the assumption of additional indebtedness (See Note 3 – Acquisitions, Disposals and Other 
Transactions to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox).

The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 

2017, is primarily due to lower production spending for motion picture productions and a decrease in 
taxes paid partially offset by lower operating results.

The increase in net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, 
was primarily due to cash paid related to the premium for the foreign currency option contract, additional 
investments in Hulu and higher capital expenditures partially offset by cash received from the Federal 
Communications Commission’s reverse auction for broadcast spectrum (See Note 3 – Acquisitions, 
Disposals and Other Transactions to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-
First Century Fox under the heading “Fiscal 2017” under the subheading “Other”).

The increase in net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, 
was primarily due to net repayments over borrowings in the current year partially offset by the absence of 
stock repurchases in fiscal 2018.

Stock Repurchase Program

The Company has a stock repurchase program, but did not repurchase any of its Class A Common 

Stock or Class B Common Stock during fiscal 2018. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Merger 
Agreement, the Company is prohibited from repurchasing any additional shares without Disney’s consent 
(See Note 12 – Stockholders’ Equity to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-
First Century Fox under the heading “Stock Repurchase Program”).

Dividends

The total dividends paid in fiscal 2018 were $0.36 per share of Class A Common Stock and Class B 

Common Stock. Subsequent to June 30, 2018, the Company declared a semi-annual dividend of $0.18 
per share on both the Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock, resulting in a prospective 
annual dividend of $0.36 per share. The dividend declared is payable on October 17, 2018 with a record 
date for determining dividend entitlements of September 12, 2018.

Based on the number of shares outstanding as of June 30, 2018 and the prospective annual 

dividend rate stated above, the total aggregate cash dividends expected to be paid to stockholders in 
fiscal 2019 is approximately $665 million.

The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal

Programming segment to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (“BCCI”) for contract termination costs 
related to a program rights contract for the Champions League Twenty20 (“CLT20”) cricket tournament 
through 2018 partially offset by higher tax payments and lower cash distributions received from Sky (See 
Note 7 – Investments to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century 
Fox).

The decrease in net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016,

MAA Television Network transactions in fiscal 2016 (See Note 3 – Acquisitions, Disposals and Other 
Transactions to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox under 
the heading “Fiscal 2016”).

The Company also has certain contractual arrangements in relation to certain subsidiaries and 

investees that would require the Company to make payments or provide funding if certain circumstances 
occur (“contingent guarantees”). The Company does not expect that these contingent guarantees will 
result in any material amounts being paid by the Company in the foreseeable future. The timing of the 
amounts presented in the table below reflect when the maximum contingent guarantees will expire and 
does not indicate that the Company expects to incur an obligation to make payments during that time

In addition to the contingent guarantees above, the Company is party to a capital funding agreement 

related to Hulu.

For additional details on commitments and contingent guarantees see Note 15 – Commitments and 

Contingencies to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox 
under the headings “Operating leases and service agreements”, “Sports programming rights”, “Other 
commitments and contractual obligations” and “Hulu indemnity”.

Pension and other postretirement benefits and uncertain tax benefits

The table excludes the Company’s pension, other postretirement benefits (“OPEB”) obligations and 

the gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as the Company is unable to reasonably 
predict the ultimate amount and timing. The Company made contributions of $36 million and $98 million 
to its pension plans in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. The majority of these contributions were 
voluntarily made to improve the funding status of the plans. Future plan contributions are dependent upon 
actual plan asset returns, interest rates and statutory requirements. Assuming that actual plan asset 
returns are consistent with the Company’s expected plan returns in fiscal 2019 and beyond, and that 
interest rates remain constant, the Company would not be required to make any material contributions to 
its U.S. pension plans for the immediate future. Required pension plan contributions for the next fiscal 
year are not expected to be material but the Company may make voluntary contributions in future 
periods. Payments due to participants under the Company’s pension plans are primarily paid out of 
underlying trusts. Payments due under the Company’s OPEB plans are not required to be funded in 
advance, but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations, and are principally 
dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under the Company’s pension plans. The 
Company does not expect its net OPEB payments to be material in fiscal 2019 (See Note 16 – Pension 
and Other Postretirement Benefits to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-
First Century Fox for further discussion of the Company’s pension and OPEB plans).

Contingencies

See Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies to the accompanying Consolidated Financial 

Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox under the heading “Contingencies”.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the Company’s financial condition 

and results and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its 

64

application. The development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by 
management of the Company and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the Audit Committee 
of the Company’s Board of Directors. For the Company’s summary of significant accounting policies, see 
Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying Consolidated Financial 
Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox.

Use of Estimates 

See Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying Consolidated 

Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox under the heading “Use of Estimates”.

Revenue Recognition 

Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fees are fixed or 

determinable, the product or service has been delivered and collectability is reasonably assured. The 
Company considers the terms of each arrangement to determine the appropriate accounting treatment.

Cable Network Programming and Television

Advertising revenue is recognized as the commercials are aired, net of agency commissions. 

Subscriber fees received from MVPDs for Cable Network Programming and Television are recognized as 
affiliate fee revenue in the period services are provided.

The Company classifies the amortization of cable distribution investments (capitalized fees paid to 

MVPDs to facilitate carriage of a cable network) against affiliate fee revenue in accordance with ASC 605-
50, “Revenue Recognition—Customer Payments and Incentives.” The Company defers the cable 
distribution investments and amortizes the amounts on a straight-line basis over the contract period.

Filmed Entertainment

Content revenues from the distribution of motion pictures and television series are recognized in 

accordance with ASC 926. Revenues from the theatrical distribution of motion pictures are recognized as 
they are exhibited, and revenues from home entertainment sales, net of a reserve for estimated returns, 
are recognized on the date that DVD and Blu-ray units are made widely available for sale by retailers or 
when made available for viewing via digital distribution platforms and all Company-imposed restrictions 
on the sale or availability have expired. Revenues from television distribution are recognized when the 
motion picture or television series is made available to the licensee for broadcast.

License agreements for the broadcast of motion pictures and television series in the broadcast 

network, syndicated television and cable television markets are routinely entered into in advance of their 
available date for broadcast. Cash received and amounts billed in connection with such contractual rights 
for which revenue is not yet recognizable is classified as deferred revenue. Because deferred revenue 
generally relates to contracts for the licensing of motion pictures and television series which have already 
been produced, the recognition of revenue for such completed product is principally only dependent upon 
the commencement of the availability period for broadcast under the terms of the related licensing 
agreement.

The Company earns and recognizes revenues as a distributor on behalf of third parties. In such 

cases, determining whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis is based on 
management’s assessment of whether the Company acts as the principal or agent in the transaction. To 
the extent the Company acts as the principal in a transaction, revenues are reported on a gross basis. 
Determining whether the Company acts as principal or agent in a transaction involves judgment and is 
based on an evaluation of whether the Company has the substantial risks and rewards of ownership 
under the terms of an arrangement.

65

Filmed Entertainment Costs and Programming Rights
Filmed Entertainment Costs

Accounting for the production and distribution of motion pictures and television programming is in 
accordance with ASC 926, which requires management’s judgment as it relates to total revenues to be 
received and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each program or its license period. These 
judgments are used to determine the amortization of capitalized filmed entertainment and television 
programming costs, the expensing of participation and residual costs associated with revenues earned 
and any fair value adjustments.

In accordance with ASC 926, the Company amortizes filmed entertainment and television 

programming costs using the individual-film-forecast method. Under the individual-film-forecast method, 
such programming costs are amortized for each film or television program in the ratio that current period 
actual revenue for such title bears to management’s estimated ultimate revenue as of the beginning of the 
current fiscal year to be recognized over approximately a six year period from all media and markets for 
such title. Management bases its estimates of ultimate revenue for each motion picture on the historical 
performance of similar motion pictures, incorporating factors such as the past box office record of the lead 
actors and actresses, the genre of the motion picture, pre-release market research, the expected number 
of theaters in which the motion picture will be released and, once released, actual results of each motion 
picture. For each television program, management bases its estimates of ultimate revenue on the 
performance of the television programming in the initial markets, the existence of future firm commitments 
to sell additional episodes of the program and the past performance of similar television programs. 
Management regularly reviews, and revises when necessary, its total revenue estimates on a title-by-title 
basis, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization and/or a write-down of the asset to fair 
value.

Programming Costs

Costs incurred in acquiring program rights or producing programs are accounted for in accordance 
with ASC 920, “Entertainment—Broadcasters.” Program rights and the related liabilities are recorded at 
the gross amount of the liabilities when the license period has begun, the cost of the program is 
determinable and the program is accepted and available for airing. Television broadcast network 
entertainment programming and cable network entertainment programming, which includes acquired 
series, series produced in-house, movies and other programs, are amortized primarily on an accelerated 
basis. Management regularly reviews, and revises when necessary, its total revenue estimates on a 
contract basis, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization and/or a write-down of the asset 
to fair value.

As a result of the evaluation of the recoverability of the unamortized costs associated with 

programming rights, the Company recognized impairment charges of $44 million, $91 million and $92 
million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for entertainment programming rights principally 
relating to programming that it will no longer broadcast (See Note 6 – Inventories, net to the 
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox for further discussion).

The Company has single and multi-year contracts for broadcast rights of programs and sporting 
events. The costs of multi-year national sports contracts at FOX and the national sports channels are 
primarily charged to expense and allocated to segments based on the ratio of each current period’s 
attributable revenue for each contract to the estimated total remaining attributable revenue for each 
contract. Estimates can change and accordingly, are reviewed periodically and amortization is adjusted 
as necessary. Such changes in the future could be material. The recoverability of certain sports rights 
contracts for content broadcast on FOX and the national sports channels is assessed on an aggregate 
basis.

The costs of local and regional sports contracts for a specified number of events are amortized on 

an event-by-event basis while costs for local and regional sports contracts for a specified season are 
amortized over the season on a straight-line basis.

66

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The Company’s intangible assets include goodwill, film and television libraries, Federal 

Communications Commission (“FCC”) licenses, MVPD affiliate agreements and relationships and 
trademarks and other copyrighted products. Intangible assets acquired in business combinations are 
recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recorded as the difference 
between the consideration transferred to acquire entities and the estimated fair values assigned to their 
tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes 
of testing for impairment. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each 
class of intangible assets acquired, their reporting unit, as well as their useful lives can significantly 
impact net income.

The Company accounts for its business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. 

The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their respective estimated 
fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets 
acquired is recorded as intangibles. Amounts recorded as goodwill are assigned to one or more reporting 
units. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s 
judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with 
respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other 
items. Identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the 
aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing 
business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill. The Company allocates goodwill to disposed 
businesses using the relative fair value method.

Carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually 
for possible impairment in accordance with ASC 350 “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other.” The Company’s 
impairment review is based on, among other methods, a discounted cash flow approach that requires 
significant management judgment. The Company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may 
have become impaired between annual valuations. Indicators such as unexpected adverse economic 
factors, unanticipated technological change or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by 
governments and courts, may signal that an asset has become impaired.

The Company uses direct valuation methods to value identifiable intangibles for acquisition 

accounting and impairment testing. The direct valuation method used for FCC licenses requires, among 
other inputs, the use of published industry data that are based on subjective judgments about future 
advertising revenues in the markets where the Company owns television stations. This method also 
involves the use of management’s judgment in estimating an appropriate discount rate reflecting the risk 
of a market participant in the U.S. broadcast industry. The resulting fair values for FCC licenses are 
sensitive to these long-term assumptions and any variations to such assumptions could result in an 
impairment to existing carrying values in future periods and such impairment could be material.

During fiscal 2018, the Company determined that the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets 

included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet of Twenty-First Century Fox as of June 30, 
2018 were not impaired. The Company determined there are no reporting units with goodwill considered 
to be at risk and will continue to monitor its goodwill and intangible assets for possible future impairment.

See Note 10 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets, net to the accompanying Consolidated Financial 

Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox under the heading “Annual Impairment Review” for further 
discussion.

Income Taxes 

The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which it 
operates. The Company computes its annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning 
opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it earns income. Tax laws are complex and 
subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. 

67

Significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s tax expense and in evaluating its tax 
positions including evaluating uncertainties under ASC 740, “Income Taxes”.

The Company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is 
more likely than not to be realized. In making this assessment, management analyzes future taxable 
income, reversing temporary differences and ongoing tax planning strategies. Should a change in 
circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, 
the Company would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances 
occurs, along with a corresponding increase or charge to income.

For information regarding the impact of the Tax Act, see Note 2 – Summary of Significant 

Accounting Policies to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox 
under the heading “U.S. Tax Reform”.

Employee Costs

The measurement and recognition of costs of the Company’s pension and OPEB plans require the 

use of significant management judgments, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, 
future compensation and other actuarial assumptions.

The Company participates in and/or sponsors various pension, savings and postretirement benefit 
plans. The major pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are closed to new participants (with the 
exception of groups covered by collective bargaining agreements). In fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, the 
Company settled a portion of its pension obligations by irrevocably transferring pension liabilities to an 
insurance company through the purchase of group annuity contracts and/or through lump sum 
distributions. These transactions, primarily funded with pension plan assets, resulted in pre-tax settlement 
losses related to the recognition of accumulated deferred actuarial losses of $91 million, $39 million and 
$75 million for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which were included in Other, net in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension expense is calculated based upon a number 

of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate, an expected rate of return on plan assets and 
mortality. The Company considers current market conditions, including changes in investment returns and 
interest rates, in making these assumptions. In developing the expected long-term rate of return, the 
Company considered the pension portfolio’s future return expectations of the various asset classes. The 
expected long-term rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of 47% equity securities, 
28% fixed income securities and 25% in other investments. The mortality assumptions reflect data from 
the mortality table released by the Society of Actuaries in fiscal 2015 and subsequently updated in fiscal 
2016, 2017 and 2018.

The discount rate reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments on the 

Company’s annual measurement date of June 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year. The discount 
rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at 
which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. The rate was determined by matching the 
Company’s expected benefit payments for the primary plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed 
using a portfolio of several hundred high-quality non-callable corporate bonds.

Beginning in fiscal 2017, the Company changed the method used to estimate the service and 

interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. 
This change in estimate did not have a material impact on the Company’s pension and postretirement net 
periodic benefit expense in fiscal 2017 (See Note 16 – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits to the 
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox for further discussion).

68

The key assumptions used in developing the Company’s fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 net periodic 

pension expense for its plans consist of the following:
 
 
 
 
Discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit 
costs .........................................................................

The weighted average discount rate is volatile from year to year because it is determined based 
upon the prevailing rates in the U.S. and U.K. as of the measurement date. The Company will utilize a 
weighted average discount rate of 4.2% in calculating the fiscal 2019 net periodic pension expense for its 
plans. The Company will use a weighted average long-term rate of return of 6.7% for fiscal 2019 based 
principally on future return expectation of the plans’ asset mix. The accumulated net pre-tax losses on the 
Company’s pension plans as of June 30, 2018 were $449 million which decreased from $584 million as of 
June 30, 2017. This decrease of $135 million was primarily due to the settlement of pension obligations 
through the purchase of a group annuity contract and through lump sum distributions and the recognition 
of deferred losses related to amortization. The accumulated pre-tax net losses as of June 30, 2018 were 
primarily the result of changes in discount rates. Lower discount rates increase present values of benefit 
obligations and increase the Company’s deferred losses and also increase subsequent-year pension 
expense. Higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduce the 
Company’s accumulated net loss and also decrease subsequent-year pension expense. These deferred 
losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with 
ASC 715, “Compensation—Retirement Benefits.” Unrecognized losses in excess of 10% of the greater of 
the market-related value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) are recognized 
over the average future service of the plan participants or average future life of the plan participants.

The Company made contributions of $36 million, $98 million and $195 million to its pension plans in 

fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The majority of these contributions were voluntarily made to 
improve the funding status of the plans which were impacted by the economic conditions noted above. 
Future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns, statutory requirements and 
interest rate movements. Assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with the Company’s expected 
plan returns in fiscal 2019 and beyond, and that interest rates remain constant, the Company would not 
be required to make any material statutory contributions to its primary U.S. pension plans for the 
immediate future. The Company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve 
funded status.

69

Changes in net periodic pension expense may occur in the future due to changes in the Company’s 

expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events. The following 
table highlights the sensitivity of the Company’s pension obligations and expense to changes in these 
assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant:

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company has exposure to several types of market risk: changes in foreign currency exchange 

rates, interest rates and stock prices. The Company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for 
trading purposes.

The following sections provide quantitative and qualitative information on the Company’s exposure to 

foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and stock price risk. The Company makes use of 
sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from 
changes in market conditions.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of the Company’s U.S. operations and continues to be the 

principal currency in which the Company conducts its operations. For operations outside the U.S., the 
respective local currency is generally the functional currency. In most regions where the Company 
operates, the net earnings of wholly-owned subsidiaries are reinvested locally and working capital 
requirements are met from existing liquid funds. To the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet 
working capital requirements, draw downs in the appropriate local currency are generally available from 
intercompany borrowings. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts, primarily denominated 
in Pounds Sterling and Canadian Dollars, to hedge certain exposures to foreign currency exchange rate 
risks associated with revenues and the cost of producing or acquiring films and television programming. 
The Company also entered into foreign currency option contracts to limit its foreign currency exchange 
rate risk in connection with the Sky Acquisition. For accounting purposes, the option contracts do not 
qualify for hedge accounting and therefore have been treated as economic hedges (See Note 3 – 
Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements 
of Twenty-First Century Fox under the heading “Sky Acquisition”). Information on the derivative financial 
instruments with exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk is presented below:

Interest Rates 

The Company's current financing arrangements and facilities include approximately $18.4 billion of 
outstanding fixed-rate debt and, at the YES Network and STAR India, approximately $1.2 billion and $73 
million, respectively, of outstanding variable-rate bank debt, before adjustments for unamortized discount 
and debt issuance costs (See Note 11 – Borrowings to the accompanying Consolidated Financial 
Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox for further discussion).

Fixed and variable-rate debts are impacted differently by changes in interest rates. A change in the 

interest rate or yield of fixed-rate debt will only impact the fair market value of such debt, while a change in 
the interest rate of variable-rate debt will impact interest expense, as well as the amount of cash required to 
service such debt. As of June 30, 2018, substantially all of the Company's financial instruments with 
exposure to interest rate risk were denominated in U.S. dollars. Information on financial instruments with 
exposure to interest rate risk is presented below:

as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Stock Prices 

The Company has common stock investments in publicly traded companies that are subject to market

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

Management of Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining 

adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.’s internal control over 
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company’s internal control 
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

(cid:3)

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.; 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America; 
provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. 
are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and directors of Twenty-
First Century Fox, Inc.; and 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized 
acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated 
financial statements. 

Internal control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring and internal 

auditing practices and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well 
designed, may not prevent or detect misstatements. Accordingly, even effective internal control over 
financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. 
Also, the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting was made as of a 
specific date. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that 
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with 
the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management, including the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, 
conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.’s internal control over 
financial reporting as of June 30, 2018, based on criteria for effective internal control over financial 
reporting described in the 2013 “Internal Control — Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management’s assessment included an 
evaluation of the design of Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting and 
testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Management 
reviewed the results of its assessment with the Audit Committee of Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.’s Board 
of Directors. 

Based on this assessment, management determined that, as of June 30, 2018, Twenty-First 

Century Fox, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. 

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm who audited and reported on 
the Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. included in the Annual Report on 
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, has audited the Company’s internal control over 
financial reporting. Their report appears on the following page.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.:

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 
2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee 
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our 
opinion, Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over 
financial reporting as of June 30, 2018, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. as of 
June 30, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, 
cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2018, and the related 
notes and our report dated August 13, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion
Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over 
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on 
our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent 
with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules 
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that 
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control 
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the 
risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered 
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal 
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the 
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to 
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, 
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance 
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s 
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

76

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect 
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk 
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.:
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (the 
“Company”) as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, 
comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 
2018, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our 
opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position 
of the Company at June 30, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each 
of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted 
accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 
2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated August 
13, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 

Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public 
accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the 
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of 
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that 
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are 
free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to 
assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and 
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, 
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included 
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as 
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for our opinion.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries (together, “Twenty-First 
Century Fox” or the “Company”) is a diversified global media and entertainment company, which currently 
manages and reports its businesses in the following four segments: Cable Network Programming, which 
principally consists of the production and licensing of programming distributed primarily through cable 
television systems, direct broadcast satellite operators, telecommunication companies and online video 
distributors (collectively, multi-channel video programming distributors) (“MVPDs”) primarily in the United 
States (“U.S.”) and internationally; Television, which principally consists of the acquisition, marketing and 
distribution of broadcast network programming in the U.S. and the operation of 28 full power broadcast 
television stations, including 11 duopolies, in the U.S. (of these stations, 17 are affiliated with the FOX 
Broadcasting Company (“FOX”), nine are affiliated with Master Distribution Service, Inc. (“MyNetworkTV”), 
one is affiliated with both The CW Television Network and MyNetworkTV and one is an independent 
station); Filmed Entertainment, which principally consists of the production and acquisition of live-action 
and animated motion pictures for distribution and licensing in all formats in all entertainment media 
worldwide, and the production and licensing of television programming worldwide; and Other, Corporate 
and Eliminations, which principally consists of corporate overhead costs and intercompany eliminations.

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Principles of consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of all majority-owned and controlled 
subsidiaries. In addition, the Company evaluates its relationships with other entities to identify whether 
they are variable interest entities as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) 
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810-10, “Consolidation” (“ASC 810-10”) and whether the 
Company is the primary beneficiary. Consolidation is required if both of these criteria are met. All 
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation, including the 
intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees.

Any change in the Company’s ownership interest in a consolidated subsidiary, where a controlling 

financial interest is retained, is accounted for as a capital transaction. When the Company ceases to have 
a controlling interest in a consolidated subsidiary, the Company will recognize a gain or loss in net income 
upon deconsolidation.

The Company’s fiscal year ends on June 30 (“fiscal”) of each year.

Reclassifications and adjustments 

Certain fiscal 2017 and 2016 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2018 

presentation. Unless indicated otherwise, the information in the notes to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements relates to the Company’s continuing operations.

The Company has reclassified certain fiscal 2017 and 2016 amounts for development and certain 

other costs from Selling, general and administrative to Operating expenses within the Consolidated 
Statements of Operations to conform to the fiscal 2018 presentation. These reclassifications did not affect 
previously reported Revenue, Income from continuing operations before income tax benefit (expense) or 
Net income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Use of estimates 

The preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally 

accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and 

84

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

assumptions that affect the amounts that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and 
accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of 
current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from 
those estimates.

Cash and cash equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and marketable securities with original 

maturities of three months or less.

Receivables

Receivables are presented net of an allowance for returns and doubtful accounts, which is an 

estimate of amounts that may not be collectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based 
on historical experience, receivable aging, current economic trends and specific identification of certain 
receivables that are at risk of not being paid. In determining the allowance for returns, management 
analyzes historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of 
the Company’s products. Based on this information, management reserves a percentage of each dollar of 
product sales that provide the customer with the right of return.

The Company has receivables with original maturities greater than one year in duration principally 
related to the Company’s sale of program rights in the television syndication markets within the Filmed 
Entertainment segment. Allowances for credit losses are established against these non-current 
receivables as necessary. As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, these allowances were not material.

Inventories
Filmed Entertainment Costs

In accordance with ASC 926, “Entertainment—Films” (“ASC 926”), Filmed Entertainment costs 

include capitalized production costs, overhead and capitalized interest costs, net of any amounts received 
from outside investors. These costs, as well as participations and talent residuals, are recognized as 
operating expenses for each individual motion picture or television series based on the ratio that the 
current year’s gross revenues for such film or series bear to management’s estimate of its total remaining 
ultimate gross revenues. Management bases its estimates of ultimate revenue for each motion picture on 
the historical performance of similar motion pictures, incorporating factors such as the past box office 
record of the lead actors and actresses, the genre of the motion picture, pre-release market research and 
the expected number of theaters in which the motion picture will be released. Management updates such 
estimates based on information available on the actual results of each motion picture through its life 
cycle. Television production costs incurred in excess of the amount of revenue contracted for each 
episode in the initial market are expensed as incurred on an episode-by-episode basis. Estimates for 
initial syndication revenue are not included in the estimated lifetime revenues of network series until such 
sales are probable. Television production costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of secondary 
markets are capitalized and amortized. Marketing costs are charged as operating expenses as incurred. 

85

TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY FOX, INC.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Development costs for projects not produced are written-off at the earlier of the time the decision is made 
not to develop the story or after three years. 

Filmed Entertainment costs are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated fair value on an 

individual motion picture or television series basis. Revenue forecasts for both motion pictures and 
television series are continually reviewed by management and revised when warranted by changing 
conditions. When estimates of total revenues and other events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
a motion picture or television series has a fair value that is less than its unamortized cost, a loss is 
recognized currently for the amount by which the unamortized cost exceeds the film or television series’ 
fair value. The Company receives tax credits on qualifying motion picture and television productions 
which are offset against Filmed Entertainment costs. The Company records these outstanding tax credits 
in Other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Programming Rights

In accordance with ASC 920, “Entertainment—Broadcasters,” costs incurred in acquiring program 

rights or producing programs for the Cable Network Programming and Television segments, including 
advances, are capitalized and amortized over the license period or projected useful life of the 
programming. Program rights and the related liabilities are recorded at the gross amount of the liabilities 
when the license period has begun, the cost of the program is determinable and the program is accepted 
and available for airing. Television broadcast network entertainment programming and cable network 
entertainment programming, which includes acquired series, series produced in-house, movies and other 
programs, are amortized primarily on an accelerated basis.

The Company has single and multi-year contracts for broadcast rights of programs and sporting 

events. The Company evaluates the recoverability of the unamortized costs associated therewith, using 
total estimated advertising and other revenues attributable to the program material and considering the 
Company’s expectations of the programming usefulness of the program rights. The recoverability of 
certain sports rights contracts for content broadcast on FOX and the national sports channels is assessed 
on an aggregate basis. Where an evaluation indicates that these multi-year contracts will result in an 
asset that is not recoverable, amortization of rights is accelerated. The costs of multi-year national sports 
contracts at FOX and the national sports channels are primarily amortized based on the ratio of each 
current period’s attributable revenue for each contract to the estimated total remaining attributable 
revenue for each contract. Estimates can change and, accordingly, are reviewed periodically and 
amortization is adjusted as necessary. Such changes in the future could be material. 

The costs of local and regional sports contracts for a specified number of events are amortized on 

an event-by-event basis while costs for local and regional sports contracts for a specified season are 
amortized over the season on a straight-line basis. 

Investments 

Investments in and advances to entities or joint ventures in which the Company has significant 

influence, but less than a controlling voting interest, are accounted for using the equity method. 
Significant influence is generally presumed to exist when the Company owns an interest between 20% 
and 50% and exercises significant influence. 

Under the equity method of accounting, the Company includes its investments and amounts due to 
and from its equity method investees in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s Consolidated 
Statements of Operations include the Company’s share of the investees’ earnings (losses), the 
Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income include the Company’s share of other 
comprehensive income (loss) of equity method investees and the Company’s Consolidated Statements of 
Cash Flows include all cash received from or paid to the investees. 

86

TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY FOX, INC.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The difference between the Company’s investment and its share of the fair value of the underlying 
net assets of the investee is first allocated to either finite-lived intangibles or indefinite-lived intangibles 
and the balance is attributed to goodwill. The Company follows ASC 350, “Intangibles—Goodwill and 
Other” (“ASC 350”), which requires that equity method finite-lived intangibles be amortized over their 
estimated useful life while indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill are not amortized. 

Investments in which the Company has no significant influence (generally less than a 20% 

ownership interest) are designated as available-for-sale investments if readily determinable market values 
are available. If an investment’s fair value is not readily determinable, the Company accounts for its 
investment at cost. The Company reports available-for-sale investments at fair value based on quoted 
market prices. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments are included in 
Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of applicable taxes and other adjustments until the 
investment is sold or considered impaired. 

Property, plant and equipment 

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line 

method over an estimated useful life of three to 40 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using 
the straight-line method over the shorter of their useful lives or the life of the lease. Costs associated with 
the repair and maintenance of property are expensed as incurred. Changes in circumstances, such as 
technological advances, or changes to the Company’s business model or capital strategy, could result in 
the actual useful lives differing from the Company’s estimates. In those cases where the Company 
determines that the estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment should be shortened, the 
Company would depreciate the asset over its revised remaining useful life, thereby increasing 
depreciation expense. 

Goodwill and Intangible assets

The Company’s intangible assets include goodwill, Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) 
licenses, MVPD affiliate agreements and relationships, film and television libraries, and trademarks and 
other copyrighted products. Intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their 
estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recorded as the difference between the 
consideration transferred to acquire entities and the estimated fair values assigned to their tangible and 
identifiable intangible net assets. In accordance with ASC 350, the Company’s goodwill and indefinite-
lived intangible assets, which primarily consist of FCC licenses, are tested annually for impairment, or 
earlier, if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value 
below its carrying amount. The impairment assessment of indefinite-lived intangibles compares the fair 
value of the assets to their carrying value. Intangible assets with finite lives are generally amortized over 
their estimated useful lives. 

The Company’s goodwill impairment reviews are determined using a two-step process. The first 

step of the process is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including 
goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill of the reporting unit 
is not impaired and the second step of the impairment review is not necessary. If the carrying amount of a 
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment review is required to be 
performed to estimate the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. The implied fair value of the 
reporting unit’s goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of 
the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is 
recognized in an amount equal to that excess. 

When a business within a reporting unit is disposed of, goodwill is allocated to the disposed 

business using the relative fair value method. 

87

TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY FOX, INC.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Asset impairments 
Investments 

Equity method investments are reviewed for impairment by comparing their fair value to their 

respective carrying amounts. The Company determines the fair value of its public company investments 
by reference to their publicly traded stock prices. With respect to private company investments, the 
Company makes its estimate of fair value by considering other available information, including recent 
investee equity transactions, discounted cash flow analyses, estimates based on comparable public 
company operating multiples and, in certain situations, balance sheet liquidation values. If the fair value of 
the investment has dropped below the carrying amount, management considers several factors when 
determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in market value has occurred, including the length 
of time and extent to which the market value has been below cost, the financial condition and near-term 
prospects of the issuer of the security, the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the 
issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value and other factors 
influencing the fair market value, such as general market conditions.

The Company regularly reviews available-for-sale investment securities and investments accounted 

for at cost for other-than-temporary impairment based on criteria that include the extent to which the 
investment’s carrying value exceeds its related market value or estimated fair value, the duration of the 
decline, the Company’s ability to hold until recovery and the financial strength and specific prospects of 
the issuer of the security.

Long-lived assets

ASC 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment,” and ASC 350 require that the Company periodically 
review the carrying amounts of its long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and finite-
lived intangible assets, to determine whether current events or circumstances indicate that such carrying 
amounts may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of the asset is greater than the expected 
undiscounted cash flows to be generated by such asset, an impairment adjustment is recognized if the 
carrying value of such asset exceeds its fair value. The Company generally measures fair value by 
considering sale prices for similar assets or by discounting estimated future cash flows using an 
appropriate discount rate. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of 
assets; accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates. Assets to be disposed of 
are carried at the lower of their financial statement carrying amount or fair value less their costs to sell.

Guarantees

The Company follows ASC 460, “Guarantees” (“ASC 460”). ASC 460 requires a guarantor to 
recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in 
issuing certain guarantees. Subsequently, the initial liability recognized for the guarantee is generally 
reduced as the Company is released from the risk under the guarantee. The Company periodically 
reviews the facts and circumstances pertaining to its guarantees in determining the level of related risk.

Revenue recognition

Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fees are fixed or 

determinable, the product or service has been delivered and collectability is reasonably assured. The 
Company considers the terms of each arrangement to determine the appropriate accounting treatment.

Cable Network Programming and Television

Advertising revenue is recognized as the commercials are aired, net of agency commissions. 

Subscriber fees received from MVPDs for Cable Network Programming and Television are recognized as 
affiliate fee revenue in the period services are provided.

88

TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY FOX, INC.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company classifies the amortization of cable distribution investments (capitalized fees paid to 

MVPDs to facilitate carriage of a cable network) against affiliate fee revenue in accordance with ASC 605-
50, “Revenue Recognition—Customer Payments and Incentives.” The Company defers the cable 
distribution investments and amortizes the amounts on a straight-line basis over the contract period.

Filmed Entertainment

Content revenues from the distribution of motion pictures and television series are recognized in 

accordance with ASC 926. Revenues from the theatrical distribution of motion pictures are recognized as 
they are exhibited, and revenues from home entertainment sales, net of a reserve for estimated returns, 
are recognized on the date that DVD and Blu-ray units are made widely available for sale by retailers or 
when made available for viewing via digital distribution platforms and all Company-imposed restrictions 
on the sale or availability have expired. Revenues from television distribution are recognized when the 
motion picture or television series is made available to the licensee for broadcast.

License agreements for the broadcast of motion pictures and television series in the broadcast 

network, syndicated television and cable television markets are routinely entered into in advance of their 
available date for broadcast. Cash received and amounts billed in connection with such contractual rights 
for which revenue is not yet recognizable is classified as deferred revenue. Because deferred revenue 
generally relates to contracts for the licensing of motion pictures and television series which have already 
been produced, the recognition of revenue for such completed product is principally only dependent upon 
the commencement of the availability period for broadcast under the terms of the related licensing 
agreement.

The Company earns and recognizes revenues as a distributor on behalf of third parties. In such 

cases, determining whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis is based on 
management’s assessment of whether the Company acts as the principal or agent in the transaction. To 
the extent the Company acts as the principal in a transaction, revenues are reported on a gross basis. 
Determining whether the Company acts as principal or agent in a transaction involves judgment and is 
based on an evaluation of whether the Company has the substantial risks and rewards of ownership 
under the terms of an arrangement.

Film production financing

The Company enters into arrangements with third parties to co-produce certain of its theatrical and 

television productions. These arrangements, which are referred to as co-financing arrangements, take 
various forms. The parties to these arrangements, primarily for theatrical productions, include studio and 
non-studio entities both domestic and international. In several of these agreements, other parties control 
certain distribution rights. The Company records the amounts received for the sale of an economic 
interest as a reduction of the cost of the film, as the investor assumes full risk for that portion of the film 
asset acquired in these transactions. The substance of these arrangements is that the third-party 
investors own an interest in the film and, therefore, receive a participation based on the third-party 
investors’ contractual interest in the profits or losses incurred on the film. Consistent with the 
requirements of ASC 926, the estimate of the third-party investor’s interest in profits or losses on the film 
is based on total estimated ultimate revenues.

Advertising expenses 

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred, including advertising expenses for theatrical 

and television productions in accordance with ASC 720-35, “Other Expenses—Advertising Cost.” 
Advertising expenses recognized totaled $2.3 billion, $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 
2016, respectively.

89

TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY FOX, INC.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Translation of foreign currencies 

Foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are translated into U.S. dollars using the current rate method, 
whereby trading results are converted at the average rate of exchange for the period and assets and 
liabilities are converted at the closing rates on the period end date. The resulting translation adjustments 
are accumulated as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Gains and losses from 
foreign currency transactions are included in income for the period. 

Income taxes 

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC 

740”). ASC 740 requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income 
taxes. Under the asset and liability approach, deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of 
temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Valuation allowances are established where 
management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will 
not be realized. Deferred taxes have not been provided on the cumulative undistributed earnings of 
foreign subsidiaries to the extent amounts are reinvested indefinitely.

Earnings per share 

Basic earnings per share for the Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Class A 

Common Stock”), and Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Class B Common Stock”) is 
calculated by dividing Net income attributable to Twenty-First Century Fox stockholders by the weighted 
average number of outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. Diluted 
earnings per share for Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock is calculated similarly, except 
that the calculation for Class A Common Stock includes the dilutive effect of the assumed issuance of 
shares issuable under the Company’s equity-based compensation plans.

Equity-based compensation

The Company accounts for share-based payments in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation—

Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”). ASC 718 requires that the cost resulting from all share-based 
payment transactions be recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. ASC 718 establishes fair 
value as the measurement objective in accounting for share-based payment arrangements and requires 
all companies to apply a fair-value-based measurement method in accounting for generally all share-
based payment transactions with employees (See Note 13 – Equity-Based Compensation).

Financial instruments and derivatives

The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents, 
receivables, payables and cost method investments, approximate fair value. The fair value of financial 
instruments is generally determined by reference to market values resulting from trading on a national 
securities exchange or in an over-the-counter market.

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposures to foreign currency 

exchange rate and interest rate risks. All derivative financial instruments used as hedges are recorded at 
fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets (See Note 8 – Fair Value). The effective changes in fair 
values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive 
loss and included in unrealized (losses) gains on cash flow hedges. The effective changes in the fair 
values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are reclassified from Accumulated other 
comprehensive loss to Net income when the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings. Cash 
flows from the settlement of derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges offset cash flows from 
the underlying hedged items and are included in operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of 
Cash Flows. The effective changes in fair values of derivatives designated as net investment hedges are 
recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and included in foreign currency translation 

90

TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY FOX, INC.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

adjustments. The effective changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as net investment hedges 
are reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to Net income when the related foreign 
subsidiaries or equity method investments are sold. The related cash flows are reported in Proceeds from 
dispositions, net within Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities from continuing operations in 
the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Concentrations of credit risk

Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions. The Company has 
deposits held with banks that exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, 
these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable 
credit and, therefore, bear minimal credit risk.

The Company’s receivables did not represent significant concentrations of credit risk as of June 30, 

2018 or 2017 due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the 
Company’s products and services are sold.

The Company monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions which are 

counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of 
nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. As of June 30, 2018, the Company did not 
anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties.

Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Guidance and U.S. Tax Reform
Adopted 

In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards 

Update (“ASU”) 2016-09, “Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee 
Share-Based Payment Accounting” (“ASU 2016-09”). The amendments in ASU 2016-09 simplify various 
aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial 
statements, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, 
and classification on the statement of cash flows. On July 1, 2017, the Company adopted ASU 2016-09. 
In accordance with ASU 2016-09, the Company will prospectively recognize all excess tax benefits and 
tax deficiencies in Income tax benefit (expense) in the Statements of Operations. In the statement of cash 
flows, all excess tax benefits are presented retrospectively in Net cash provided by operating activities 
from continuing operations. In addition, the Company retrospectively adopted the guidance that requires 
cash paid by the Company when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes to be classified 
as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 resulted in an 
increase in Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations and a corresponding 
increase in Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations in the Statement of Cash 
Flows for fiscal 2017 and 2016. The other aspects of ASU 2016-09 did not have a material effect on the 
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

On July 1, 2017, the Company early adopted ASU 2017-07, “Compensation–Retirement Benefits 
(Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement 
Benefit Cost” (“ASU 2017-07”). ASU 2017-07 requires an employer to report the service cost component 
of net benefit cost in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by 
the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be 
presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of 
income from operations. ASU 2017-07 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated 
financial statements.

Issued

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” 

(“ASU 2014-09”). The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict 

91

TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY FOX, INC.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to 
which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, ASU 2014-09 
requires additional disclosure around the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash 
flows arising from contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the Company for annual 
and interim reporting periods beginning July 1, 2018. The Company expects to apply ASU 2014-09 on a 
modified retrospective basis with the cumulative effect, if any, of initially applying the new guidance 
recognized at the date of initial application as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. The Company 
has completed its review of contracts for each of the Company’s significant revenue streams and does 
not expect a material impact on its consolidated financial statements as a result of its adoption of ASU 
2014-09. The Company expects that the new standard will impact the timing of revenue recognition for 
renewals or extensions of existing licensing agreements for intellectual property, which upon adoption will 
be recognized as revenue when the customer can begin to use and benefit from the license rather than 
when the agreement is extended or renewed, under historical GAAP. The new standard will require the 
Company’s Filmed Entertainment segment to recognize revenues from certain television license deals 
earlier as opposed to recognizing those license fees over the term of the licenses. Conversely, revenues 
from certain of the Filmed Entertainment segment’s trademark licensing deals will be recognized over the 
license terms as opposed to recognition at inception as under historical GAAP. In addition, the Company 
implemented appropriate changes to the Company’s processes, systems and controls to support the 
recognition and disclosure requirements under the new standard.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, “Financial Instruments––Overall (Subtopic 825-
10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“ASU 2016-01”). The 
amendments in ASU 2016-01 address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and 
disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 will be effective for the Company for annual and interim 
reporting periods beginning July 1, 2018. In accordance with ASU 2016-01, the Company will 
prospectively record changes in fair value of available-for-sale investments in net income rather than in 
Accumulated other comprehensive loss. On July 1, 2018, the Company will record a cumulative-effect 
adjustment to Retained Earnings for the balance of unrealized holding gains on securities in Accumulated 
other comprehensive loss as of June 30, 2018 (See Note 12 – Stockholders’ Equity under the heading 
“Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss”). Cost method investments that do not have readily 
determinable fair values will be recognized prospectively at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus 
changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar 
investment of the same issuer. The adjustments related to the observable price changes will be 
recognized in net income.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASU 2016-02”). ASU 
2016-02 requires recognition of lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosure of key 
information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for the Company for annual and 
interim reporting periods beginning July 1, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 
2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements. Since the Company has a significant amount 
of minimum lease commitments (See Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies), the Company expects 
that the impact of recognizing lease assets and liabilities will be significant to the Company’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): 

Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments” (“ASU 2016-15”). ASU 2016-15 addresses 
eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice in how 
certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. 
ASU 2016-15 is effective for the Company for annual and interim reporting periods beginning July 1, 2018. 
The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers 

of Assets Other Than Inventory” (“ASU 2016-16”). ASU 2016-16 requires an entity to recognize the 
income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. ASU 2016-16 is 
effective for the Company for annual and interim reporting periods beginning July 1, 2018. The Company

does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying 

the Definition of a Business” (“ASU 2017-01”). The objective of ASU 2017-01 is to clarify the definition of 
a business in order to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as 
acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of 
accounting including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill and consolidation. ASU 2017-01 is effective for the 
Company for annual and interim reporting periods beginning July 1, 2018. The Company does not expect 
the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles–Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): 

Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment” (“ASU 2017-04”). The objective of ASU 2017-04 is to 
simplify how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment. Under current GAAP, entities are 
required to test goodwill for impairment using a two-step approach. Under the amendments in ASU 2017-
04, an entity should perform its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit 
with its carrying amount. ASU 2017-04 is effective for the Company for annual and interim reporting 
periods beginning July 1, 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2017-04 will have 
on its consolidated financial statements.

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted 

Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities” (“ASU 2017-12”). The objective of ASU 2017-12 is to 
better align an entity’s risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through 
changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the 
presentation of hedge results. In addition, ASU 2017-12 simplifies the assessment of hedge effectiveness. 
ASU 2017-12 is effective for the Company for annual and interim reporting periods beginning July 1, 2019. 
Early adoption is permitted in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 
2017-12 will have on its consolidated financial statements.

U.S. Tax Reform

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly 

referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act significantly revises the future 
ongoing U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering U.S. corporate income tax rates and 
implementing a territorial tax system. Since the Company has a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower 
corporate income tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of approximately 28% 
for fiscal 2018, and 21% for subsequent fiscal years. As part of the transition to the new territorial tax 
system, the Tax Act imposes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of 
foreign entities.

The SEC has issued guidance that would allow for a measurement period of up to one year after the 

enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. As of June 30, 2018, 
the Company has not completed its analysis of the accounting for all the tax effects of the Tax Act but has 
recorded a provisional net tax benefit of $1.5 billion for those items which it could reasonably estimate 
and which are discussed below. The Company currently anticipates finalizing its provisional amounts by 
the end of the current calendar year based on future interpretive guidance expected to be issued by the 
U.S. Treasury and the additional time required to refine calculations. There may be adjustments to the 
provisional amounts recorded during the measurement period and such adjustments could possibly be 
material.

For fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a provisional income tax benefit of $1.8 billion to adjust its 
net deferred tax liability position in accordance with the Tax Act. The net deferred tax liability represents 
future tax obligations. Among the Company’s more significant net deferred tax liabilities are basis 
differences and amortization, and sports rights contracts. The final amount of the adjustment to the net 
deferred tax liability could be revised based on changes in interpretations of the Tax Act and any updates 
or changes to estimates based on additional information the Company obtains or analyzes.

93

TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY FOX, INC.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a provisional liability for the 
transition tax to a territorial tax system of $139 million. The U.S. federal tax cost for the deemed 
repatriation is computed at 15.5% for foreign earnings held in liquid assets and 8% for non-liquid assets, 
reduced by applicable foreign tax credits. This amount is provisional due to additional information and 
analyses required to determine foreign unremitted earnings, some of which was not previously needed or 
not yet accumulated. 

The Tax Act also imposed new restrictions on the use of foreign tax credits. The Company does not 
expect it will be able to fully utilize such credits before they expire. As a result, the Company has recorded 
a provisional tax expense and related increase to its valuation allowance of $158 million.

The transition tax has generally removed U.S. federal taxes on distributions to the U.S. from foreign 

subsidiaries. Beginning in 2018, the Company will generally not record U.S. federal income tax on its 
share of the income of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries generated after December 31, 2017, nor will 
the Company record a benefit for foreign tax credits related to that income. The Company will continue to 
evaluate whether or not to assert indefinite reinvestment on a part or all the foreign undistributed earnings 
as further guidance becomes available. 

As a result of the shift to a territorial system for U.S. taxation, the new minimum tax on certain 
foreign earnings (“global intangible low-tax income”) imposes a tax on foreign earnings and profits in 
excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign subsidiaries. This provision is effective for tax 
years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, which for the Company would be the fiscal year beginning 
on July 1, 2018 (fiscal 2019). The Company is still evaluating whether to account for the effects of this 
provision either as a component of future income tax expense in the period the tax arises or as a 
component of deferred taxes on the related investments but does not expect there to be a material effect 
on the financial statements. 

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive 

Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive 
Income” (“ASU 2018-02”). The objective of ASU 2018-02 is to eliminate the stranded tax effects resulting 
from the Tax Act and to improve the usefulness of information reported to financial statement users. ASU 
2018-02 is effective for the Company for annual and interim reporting periods beginning July 1, 2019. 
Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period. The Company is currently evaluating 
the impact ASU 2018-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSALS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS 

During fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company announced and/or completed acquisitions as 

more fully described below. All of the Company’s completed acquisitions were accounted for under ASC 
805, “Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”), which requires, among other things, that an acquirer 
(i) remeasure any previously held equity interest in an acquiree at its acquisition date fair value and 
recognize any resulting gains or losses in earnings and (ii) record any noncontrolling interests in an 
acquiree at their acquisition date fair values. 

The below acquisitions by the Company all support its strategic priority of increasing its brand 

presence and reach in key domestic and international markets and acquiring greater control of 
investments that complement its portfolio of businesses. 

For fiscal 2017 and 2016, the incremental revenues and Segment OIBDA (as defined in Note 18 – 
Segment Information), related to the acquisitions below, included in the Company’s consolidated results 
of operations were not material individually or in the aggregate for each respective year.

Fiscal 2018
Disney Transaction/Distribution of New Fox

On June 20, 2018, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Merger Agreement and 

Plan of Merger (the “Amended and Restated Merger Agreement”) with The Walt Disney Company 
(“Disney”) and TWDC Holdco 613 Corp., a newly formed holding company and wholly-owned subsidiary 
of Disney (“New Disney”), which amends and restates in its entirety the Agreement and Plan of Merger 
that the Company entered into with Disney in December 2017, pursuant to which, among other things, at 
the closing, the Company will merge with and into a subsidiary of New Disney (the “21CF Merger”), 
Disney will merge with and into a subsidiary of New Disney (the “Disney Merger,” and together with the 
21CF Merger, the “Mergers”), and each of Disney and the Company will become wholly-owned 
subsidiaries of New Disney. Prior to the consummation of the Mergers, the Company will transfer a 
portfolio of the Company’s news, sports and broadcast businesses, including the Fox News Channel, Fox 
Business Network, FOX Broadcasting Company, Fox Television Stations Group, FS1, FS2, Fox Deportes 
and Big Ten Network and certain other assets and liabilities into a newly formed subsidiary (“New Fox”) 
(the “New Fox Separation”) and distribute all of the issued and outstanding common stock of New Fox to 
the holders of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common 
Stock (other than holders that are subsidiaries of the Company (shares held by such holders, the “Hook 
Stock”)) on a pro rata basis (the “New Fox Distribution”). Prior to the New Fox Distribution, New Fox will 
pay the Company a dividend in the amount of $8.5 billion. New Fox will incur indebtedness sufficient to 
fund the dividend, which indebtedness will be reduced after the Mergers by the amount of a cash 
payment paid by Disney to New Fox. As the New Fox Separation and New Fox Distribution will be taxable 
to the Company at the corporate level, the dividend is intended to fund the taxes resulting from the New 
Fox Separation and New Fox Distribution and certain other transactions contemplated by the Amended 
and Restated Merger Agreement (the “Transaction Tax”). The Company will retain all assets and liabilities 
not transferred to New Fox, including the Twentieth Century Fox Film and Television studios and certain 
cable and international television businesses, including FX Networks, National Geographic Partners, LLC 
(“National Geographic Partners”). Regional Sports Networks (“RSNs”), Fox Networks Group International 
and STAR India (“STAR”), as well as the Company’s interests in Hulu LLC (“Hulu”), Sky plc (“Sky”), Tata 
Sky Limited and Endemol Shine Group. The foregoing proposed transactions are collectively referred to 
as the “Transaction”.

Upon consummation of the Transaction, each share of the Company’s common stock issued and 

outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Mergers (other than (i) shares held in treasury by 
the Company that are not held on behalf of third parties, (ii) shares that are Hook Stock and (iii) shares 
held by the Company’s stockholders who have not voted in favor of the 21CF Merger and perfected and 
not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Delaware law) will be exchanged for 
consideration (the “Merger Consideration”) in the form of either cash (the “Cash Consideration”) or a 
fraction of a share of New Disney common stock (the “Stock Consideration”). The value of the Merger 
Consideration may fluctuate with the market price of Disney common stock and will, subject to the collar 
described below, be determined based on the volume-weighted average trading price of a share of 
Disney common stock on the New York Stock Exchange over the fifteen day consecutive trading day 
period ending on (and including) the trading day that is three trading days prior to the date of the effective 
time of the Disney Merger (such price, the “Average Disney Price”). Subject to the election, proration and 
adjustment procedures set forth in the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement, each share of the 
Company’s common stock will be exchanged for an amount (such amount, the “Per Share Value”), 
payable in cash or New Disney common stock, equal to the sum of (i) $19.00 plus (ii) fifty percent (50.0%) 
of the value (determined based on the Average Disney Price) of a number of shares of Disney common 
stock equal to the exchange ratio described below. The number of shares of New Disney common stock 
to be delivered in exchange for each share of the Company’s common stock to the Company’s 
stockholders electing to receive Stock Consideration will be equal to the Per Share Value divided by the 
Average Disney Stock Price. If the Average Disney Price is greater than $114.32, then the exchange ratio 
will be 0.3324. If the Average Disney Price is less than $93.53, then the exchange ratio will be 0.4063. If 
the Average Disney Price is greater than or equal to $93.53 but less than or equal to $114.32, then the 
exchange ratio will be an amount equal to $38.00 divided by the Average Disney Price. The Merger 
Consideration is subject to the proration provisions set forth in the Amended and Restated Merger

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Agreement, which ensure that the aggregate Cash Consideration (before giving effect to the adjustment 
for transaction taxes) is equal to $35.7 billion. As a result, the form of consideration a stockholder elects 
to receive may be adjusted such that it may receive, in part, a different form of consideration than the 
form it elected. Any stockholder of the Company not making an election will receive the Cash 
Consideration, the Stock Consideration or a combination of both, as determined by the proration 
provisions of the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement.

To provide New Fox with financing in connection with the New Fox Distribution, 21st Century Fox 

America, Inc. (“21CFA”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a commitment letter on 
behalf of New Fox with the financial institutions party thereto (the “Bridge Commitment Letter”) which 
provides for borrowings of up to $9 billion. Given the Company’s current debt ratings, 21CFA pays a 
commitment fee of 0.1%. While the Company has entered into the Bridge Commitment Letter, New Fox 
intends to finance the dividend by obtaining permanent financing in the capital markets on a standalone 
basis.

Under the terms of the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement, Disney will pay the Company 

$2.5 billion if the Mergers are not consummated under certain circumstances relating to the failure to 
obtain approvals, or there is a final, non-appealable order preventing the transaction, in each case, 
relating to antitrust laws, communications laws or foreign regulatory laws.

On June 27, 2018, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it cleared 

the Transaction. The Company, Disney and the U.S. Department of Justice have entered into a consent 
decree that allows the Transaction to proceed, while requiring New Disney and the Company to sell the 
RSNs within 90 days following the closing of the Transaction, which consent decree is subject to court 
approval. At separate special meetings of stockholders on July 27, 2018, the Company’s stockholders 
adopted the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement, Disney’s stockholders approved the stock 
issuance, and each company’s stockholders adopted or approved the other proposals voted on at the 
special meetings. 

The consummation of the Transaction remains subject to various conditions, including among 
others, (i) the consummation of the New Fox Separation, (ii) the receipt of certain tax opinions with 
respect to the treatment of the Transaction under U.S. and Australian tax laws, and (iii) the receipt of 
certain regulatory approvals and governmental consents. The Transaction is expected to be completed in 
the first half of calendar year 2019. 

The Amended and Restated Merger Agreement generally requires the Company to operate its 

business in the ordinary course pending consummation of the 21CF Merger and restricts the Company, 
without Disney’s consent, from taking certain specified actions until the Transactions are consummated or 
the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement is terminated, including making certain acquisitions and 
divestitures, entering into certain contracts, incurring certain indebtedness and expenditures, paying 
dividends in excess of certain thresholds, and repurchasing or issuing securities outside of existing equity 
award programs.

In February 2018, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the 

“Compensation Committee”) established a cash bonus retention plan for certain employees of 
approximately $110 million of which 50% is payable at the time of the Mergers and 50% on the 10-month 
anniversary of the Mergers, subject to each participant's continued employment through the applicable 
payment date. The cash bonus retention payment plans are subject to accelerated payment upon the 
occurrence of certain termination events. In the event the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement is 
terminated, the payments under the cash-based retention program will be made on the later of December 
13, 2019 and the date of such termination. In addition, the Compensation Committee modified certain 
equity awards and granted additional equity awards to certain executives (See Note 13 – Equity-based 
Compensation). The modification and grant of equity awards and the cash bonus retention plan resulted 
in additional compensation expenses of approximately $130 million for fiscal 2018, of which 
approximately $65 million was included in Selling, general and administrative expenses and the 
remaining amount was included in Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Television Stations Acquisition

In May 2018, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with 

Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. (“Sinclair”) and Tribune Media Company (“Tribune”) to acquire seven 
television stations from Tribune for approximately $910 million subject to certain purchase price 
adjustments. On August 9, 2018, Tribune exercised its right to terminate its merger agreement with 
Sinclair and correspondingly, the Company’s Purchase Agreement was also terminated. 

Other

In fiscal 2018, the Company acquired an additional 10% interest in a RSN, increasing the 

Company’s ownership interest to 70%, for approximately $100 million. In July 2018, the Company paid in 
cash the first of four equal annual installments. This transaction was accounted for as the purchase of 
subsidiary shares from noncontrolling interests (See Note 8 – Fair Value under the heading “Redeemable 
Noncontrolling Interests”).

Fiscal 2017
Sky Acquisition

In December 2016, the Company announced it reached agreement with Sky, in which the Company 
currently has an approximate 39% interest, on the terms of a recommended pre-conditional cash offer by 
the Company for the fully diluted share capital of Sky which the Company does not already own (the “Sky 
Acquisition”), at a price of £10.75 per Sky share subject to certain payments of dividends. On July 11, 
2018, the Company announced an increased offer price for the Sky Acquisition, of £14.00 per Sky share 
(approximately $19.9 billion in the aggregate), payable in cash, subject to reduction if certain dividends or 
other distributions are paid by Sky (the “Increased Offer”). In connection with the Increased Offer, the 
Company and Sky agreed to amend the surviving provisions of the co-operation agreement entered into 
on December 15, 2016 between the Company and Sky (the “Co-operation Agreement”), including those 
provisions regarding the Company switching from a scheme of arrangement to a takeover offer (as that 
term is defined in the UK Companies Act as defined below) as the method of implementing the Sky 
Acquisition, such that the restrictions on the level of the acceptance condition for a takeover offer by the 
Company have been terminated and the Company may reduce the minimum acceptance condition of a 
contractual offer to a simple majority of all shares of Sky (including those held by the Company and 
wholly-owned subsidiaries). Such amendment to the Co-operation Agreement also provides that the 
Company may bring forward or extend the last possible date for announcing that its offer is unconditional 
as to acceptances so that it is the same as that of any competing bidder for Sky. On August 7, 2018, the 
Company posted an offer document to Sky shareholders in connection with the Increased Offer and 
announced that it intends to implement the Sky Acquisition by way of a takeover offer within the meaning 
of Part 28 of the Companies Act 2006 (the “UK Companies Act”) rather than by means of a scheme of 
arrangement in accordance with Part 26 of the UK Companies Act, which had been the proposed 
structure of the Sky Acquisition prior to that date. The Company has noted that the deadline for 
publication of any revised offer document in respect of its Increased Offer is September 22, 2018.

In connection with the Increased Offer, on July 11, 2018, the Company entered into a letter 

agreement with Disney, pursuant to which Disney consented to the increased indebtedness that would be 
incurred by the Company as a result of the Increased Offer. Also, in the event that Disney does not 
complete the Mergers due to the failure to obtain regulatory approvals or in certain other limited 
circumstances, Disney has agreed to reimburse the Company for an amount equal to the difference 
between the cash consideration of £14.00 and £13.00 for each share of Sky purchased by the Company 
pursuant to the revised terms of the Increased Offer, plus any interest and fees on such amount.

The Sky Acquisition has received unconditional clearance by all competent competition authorities 
including the European Commission and has been cleared on public interest and plurality grounds. On 
July 12, 2018, the Sky Acquisition received approval by the UK Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, 
Media and Sport (the “Secretary of State”), subject to accepted undertakings described below. However, 

97

TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY FOX, INC.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

the Sky Acquisition is conditional on, among other things, the Company securing valid acceptances of the 
Increased Offer in respect of Sky shares which represent 75% or more of the Sky shares that the 
Company does not own. The Company reserves the right to reduce this acceptance condition to a simple 
majority of all Sky shares (including those held by the Company).

In connection with the approval given by the Secretary of State, the Company has undertaken to the 
Secretary of State to separate the Sky News business into a separate company (“Sky News Newco”), and 
to transfer the shares in Sky News Newco to Disney or to an alternative suitable third party if Disney does 
not complete its acquisition of Sky News Newco within a specified period, (the “Sky News Divestment”). 
The Sky News Divestment is conditional upon the Sky Acquisition completing. The Company shall pay to 
Sky News NewCo an annual lump sum every year for 15 years from the date of the Sky News Divestment 
(the “NewCo Funding”), subject to a reduction to reflect the actual amount of revenue received or 
generated by Sky News NewCo in the relevant financial year. Disney has undertaken to maintain the 
operating investment in Sky News NewCo at an agreed level (plus inflation) for 15 years from the date of 
the Sky News Divestment, conditional upon Sky News NewCo receiving the NewCo Funding. Disney has 
also undertaken to ensure that the total funds available for Sky News Newco, including the funding the 
Company has undertaken to provide, is no less than £100 million per year for the next 15 years. Disney 
has undertaken to continue to operate Sky News for a period of 15 years after the Sky News Divestment 
and may only sell Sky News Newco with the approval of the Secretary of State. Disney and the Company 
have undertaken that the Sky News Newco board of directors shall consist of directors that are 
independent of the Company, News Corp, any member of the Murdoch family or companies controlled by 
the Murdoch family. The Secretary of State announced that the undertakings provided by the Company 
and Disney had been accepted on July 12, 2018.

If the Company does not acquire 100% of Sky pursuant to the Sky Acquisition or another party has 

not acquired more than 50% of the ordinary shares of Sky, in each case prior to the completion of the 
Transaction, Disney will be required to make a mandatory offer for all the outstanding ordinary shares of 
Sky not already owned by the Company within 28 days of the Transaction closing. On July 13, 2018, the 
Panel on Takeovers and Mergers of the United Kingdom (the "U.K. Takeover Panel"), ruled that any such 
offer would be required to be made in cash and at a price of £14.00 for each ordinary share in Sky (the 
"July 13 Ruling"), which ruling was upheld on August 3, 2018 by the U.K. Takeover Panel’s Hearings 
Committee on appeal. Certain interested parties have appealed the ruling of the Hearings Committee to 
the Takeover Appeal Board.

To provide financing in connection with the Sky Acquisition, the Company and 21CFA entered into a 

bridge credit agreement with the lenders party thereto (the “Bridge Credit Agreement”) which was 
subsequently amended as a result of the Increased Offer. The Bridge Credit Agreement provides for 
borrowings of up to £15.3 billion (approximately $20.2 billion). Fees under the Bridge Credit Agreement 
are based on the Company’s long-term senior unsecured non-credit enhanced debt ratings. Given the 
Company’s current debt ratings, 21CFA pays a commitment fee on undrawn funds of 0.1% and the initial 
interest rate on advances will be London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 1.125% with subsequent 
increases every 90 days up to LIBOR plus 1.875%. 21CFA has also agreed to pay a duration fee on each 
of the 90th, 180th and 270th day after the funding of the loans in an amount equal to 0.50%, 0.75%, and 
1.00%, respectively, of the aggregate principal amount of the advances and undrawn commitments 
outstanding at the time. The terms of the Bridge Credit Agreement also include the requirement that 
21CFA maintain a certain leverage ratio and limitations with respect to secured indebtedness. The 
Company purchased a foreign currency exchange option in February 2017, which expired in June 2018, 
to limit its foreign currency exchange rate risk in connection with the Sky Acquisition. In June 2018, the 
Company purchased a new foreign currency exchange option for the same objective (See Note 8 – Fair 
Value under the heading “Foreign Currency Contracts” and Note 22 – Additional Financial Information 
under the heading “Other, net” for additional information).

The Company believes the Sky Acquisition will result in enhanced capabilities of the combined 
company, underpinned by a more geographically diverse and stable revenue base, and an improved 
balance between subscription, affiliate fee, advertising and content revenues.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On April 25, 2018, Comcast Corporation (“Comcast”) announced a pre-conditional cash offer for the 

fully diluted share capital of Sky at a price of £12.50 per Sky share (the “Original Comcast Offer”) which 
was subject to regulatory preconditions (which have now been satisfied) as well as additional closing 
conditions. Following the announcement of the Original Comcast Offer, on April 25, 2018, the 
independent committee of the Sky Board of Directors (the “Sky Independent Committee”) withdrew its 
previously announced recommendation that unaffiliated Sky shareholders vote in favor of the Sky 
Acquisition and the Company received from Sky a written notice of termination of the Co-operation 
Agreement. Certain provisions relating to the Company’s conduct of the Sky Acquisition survived the 
termination of the Co-operation Agreement. As stated above, the Co-operation Agreement has since 
been further amended on July 11, 2018. On July 11, 2018, Comcast announced a revised cash offer for 
the fully diluted share capital of Sky at a price of £14.75 per Sky share that was recommended by the Sky 
Independent Committee.

Any increase in the debt financing for the Sky Acquisition or sale by the Company of its interest in 
Sky would require Disney’s consent. Completion of the Sky Acquisition is not a condition to either party’s 
obligation to consummate the Transaction. Completion of the Sky Acquisition will not affect the amount or 
form of consideration that stockholders of the Company receive in the Transaction.

Other

In March 2017, the FCC concluded a voluntary auction to reclaim television broadcast station 

spectrum. The Company had three stations’ bids of approximately $350 million to relinquish spectrum 
accepted by the FCC as part of the auction. As a result, the spectrum previously utilized by its television 
stations in Washington, DC, Charlotte, NC and Chicago, IL designated market areas, in which the 
Company operates duopolies, has been relinquished to the FCC. The proceeds were received in July 
2017 and the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $102 million for the portion of spectrum relinquished to 
the FCC prior to June 30, 2018, which was included in Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of 
Operations for fiscal 2018. The Company will record a nominal pre-tax gain in fiscal 2019 for the 
remaining spectrum relinquished to the FCC. These television stations will continue broadcasting using 
the spectrum of the existing FOX owned and operated station in that market.

National Geographic Partners

In fiscal 2016, the Company, through 21CFA and the National Geographic Society (“NGS”), formed 

the entity that became National Geographic Partners, to which, in November 2015, the Company 
contributed $625 million in cash and the Company and NGS contributed their existing interests in NGC 
Network US, LLC, NGC Network International, LLC and NGC Network Latin America, LLC (collectively, 
“NGC Networks”). Prior to the transaction, the Company held a controlling interest in NGC Networks, a 
consolidated subsidiary. NGS also contributed its publishing, travel and certain other businesses 
(collectively, the “NGS Media Business”) to National Geographic Partners. As part of the transaction, 
National Geographic Partners also acquired the long-term license for the use of certain trademarks 
owned by NGS related to the NGC Networks and the NGS Media Business. The Company currently holds 
a 73% controlling interest in National Geographic Partners. The consideration transferred to NGS has 
been allocated as follows: approximately $510 million to indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the 
trademark license agreement, $105 million to intangible assets consisting primarily of subscriber 
relationships with useful lives of eight years, $60 million to goodwill on the transaction and other net 
assets of the NGS Media Business and $55 million to the additional interest in National Geographic

entertainment channels, for approximately $346 million in cash including payments toward non-compete 
agreements. The consideration transferred of approximately $285 million has been allocated, based on a 
valuation of MAA TV, as follows: approximately $90 million to intangible assets consisting of MVPD 
affiliate agreements and relationships with useful lives of 11 years, advertiser relationships with useful 
lives of eight years and the MAA TV trade name with a useful life of 10 years; and the balance 
representing the goodwill on the transaction.

For the fiscal 2016 transactions, the majority of the goodwill is tax deductible and reflects the 

synergies and increased market penetration expected from combining the operations of the NGS Media 
Business and MAA TV with the Company.

In February 2016, the Company acquired the 7% interest it did not already own in a RSN for $225 

million in cash. As a result of this transaction, the Company now owns 100% of the RSN. This transaction 
was accounted for as the purchase of subsidiary shares from noncontrolling interests (See Note 8 – Fair 
Value under the heading “Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests”).

NOTE 5. RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS
Fiscal 2017

In fiscal 2017, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $224 million primarily related to costs 
in connection with management and employee transitions and restructuring at several of the Company’s 
business units at the Cable Network Programming segment, including Fox News Channel, and Filmed 
Entertainment segment.

Fiscal 2016

In fiscal 2016, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $231 million primarily related to a 
voluntary resignation program extended to certain employees across all segments as part of ongoing 
efforts to transform certain functions and reduce costs. Costs related to the voluntary resignation program 
are accrued over the relevant service period when the Company and the employee agree on the specific 
terms of the voluntary resignation.

In July 2015, the Company paid approximately $420 million to the Board of Control for Cricket in 

India (“BCCI”) for the contract termination, including service taxes, of the Champions League Twenty20 
(“CLT20”) cricket tournament. As a result of the contract termination, STAR no longer has the rights to 
broadcast future CLT20 cricket matches and has no additional payment obligations.

Sports programming rights will be amortized over a weighted-average useful life of 8 years. 
Does not include $210 million and $241 million of net intangible film library costs as of June 30, 
2018 and 2017, respectively, which were included in intangible assets subject to amortization in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Current portion of inventories, net as of June 30, 2018 and 2017 was comprised of programming 
rights ($3,625 million and $3,037 million, respectively), DVDs, Blu-rays and other merchandise.

As of June 30, 2018, the Company estimated that approximately 71% of unamortized filmed 
entertainment costs from the completed films are expected to be amortized during fiscal 2019 and 
approximately 93% of released filmed entertainment costs will be amortized within the next three fiscal 
years. During fiscal 2019, the Company expects to pay $1,319 million in accrued participation liabilities, 
which are included in Participations, residuals and royalties payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
As of June 30, 2018, acquired film and television libraries had remaining unamortized film costs that were 
not material.

The Company evaluates the recoverability of unamortized costs associated with the Company’s 
programming rights using total estimated advertising and other revenues attributable to the program 
material and considering the Company’s expectation to utilize the programming rights as part of its 
ongoing programming plans. The evaluation considers, among other factors, the rapid evolution of digital 
technology used in the entertainment industry, alternative methods for the delivery and storage of digital 
content, and the resultant changes in consumer behavior and preferences and advertiser priorities and 
spending patterns. As a result of the evaluation, the Company recognized impairment charges of $44 
million, $91 million and $92 million for entertainment programming rights principally relating to 
programming that it will no longer broadcast at the Cable Network Programming segment which was 
recorded in Impairment and restructuring charges in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 
2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The Company’s investment in several of its affiliates exceeded its equity in the underlying net assets 

by approximately $1 billion as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, which represented the excess cost over the 
Company’s proportionate share of its investments’ underlying net assets. This excess was allocated 
between finite-lived intangible assets (primarily tradenames), indefinite-lived intangible assets and 
goodwill. The weighted average useful lives of these finite-lived intangible assets as of June 30, 2018 and 
2017 were 17 and 14 years, respectively. In accordance with ASC 350, the Company amortized $21 
million, $6 million and $48 million during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to amounts 
allocated to finite-lived intangible assets. Such amortization is reflected in Equity losses of affiliates. 

Other Equity Affiliates

In fiscal 2016, the Company’s share of the earnings of Other equity affiliates included approximately 
$220 million of losses recorded by a joint venture comprised of Shine Group, Endemol and CORE Media 
Group. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, Core Entertainment Inc., which retained a separate capital 
and management structure under ownership of the joint venture and was consolidated with Endemol and 
Shine solely for the purposes of financial reporting for the joint venture, was deconsolidated for the 
purposes of financial reporting upon commencement of its bankruptcy proceedings. The Company’s 
proportionate share of the loss on deconsolidation and other impairment charges was approximately $95 
million which was included in Equity losses of affiliates in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As a

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

result of Core Entertainment Inc.’s bankruptcy proceedings, the joint venture no longer holds an equity 
interest in Core Entertainment Inc. The joint venture now consists of the Endemol Shine Group only.

Other 

In fiscal 2016, the Company invested approximately $160 million in cash for a minority equity 

interest in DraftKings, Inc. (“DraftKings”), a leading operator of online fantasy games and contests. The 
Company accounts for this investment at cost. During fiscal 2016, based on information concerning 
DraftKings’ then current valuation in a financing transaction, the Company determined that a portion of its 
investment in DraftKings was impaired and reduced the carrying value by approximately $95 million as 
reflected in Other, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations (See Note 22 – Additional Financial 
Information under the heading “Other, net”).

Impairments of Investments 

The Company regularly reviews investments for impairments based on criteria that include the 
extent to which the investment’s carrying value exceeds its related market value, the duration of the 
market decline, the Company’s ability to hold its investment until recovery and the investment’s financial 
strength and specific prospects. Impairments of investments are reflected in Other, net in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations and were recorded as a result of either the deteriorating financial 
position of the investee or due to a permanent impairment resulting from sustained losses and limited 
prospects for recovery (See Note 22 – Additional Financial Information under the heading “Other, net”).

NOTE 8. FAIR VALUE 

In accordance with ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” fair value measurements are required to 
be disclosed using a three-tiered fair value hierarchy which distinguishes market participant assumptions 
into the following categories: (i) inputs that are quoted prices in active markets (“Level 1”); (ii) inputs other 
than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable, including quoted prices for similar assets 
or liabilities (“Level 2”); and (iii) inputs that require the entity to use its own assumptions about market 
participant assumptions (“Level 3”).

The Company utilizes the market, income or cost approaches or a combination of these valuation 
techniques for its Level 3 fair value measures. Inputs to such measures could include observable 
market data obtained from independent sources such as broker quotes and recent market 
transactions for similar assets. It is the Company’s policy to maximize the use of observable inputs 
in the measurement of its Level 3 fair value measurements. To the extent observable inputs are not 
available, the Company utilizes unobservable inputs based upon the assumptions market 
participants would use in valuing the asset (liability). Examples of utilized unobservable inputs are 
future cash flows, long term growth rates and applicable discount rates. 
Represents investments in available-for-sale securities.
Represents derivatives associated with the Company’s foreign currency forward and option 
contracts and interest rate swap contracts. 
Relates to past acquisitions, including contingent consideration agreements.

Contingent Consideration 

The Company records contingent consideration arrangements at fair value on a recurring basis and 

the associated balances presented as of June 30, 2018 and 2017 are related to past acquisitions.

Significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company’s contingent 

consideration are operating income before depreciation and amortization (“OIBDA”) projections (generally 
within a 1% - 3% average growth rate range, where applicable) and discount rates (generally within an 8% 
- 10% range, where applicable). Significant increases (decreases) in growth rates and multiples, 
assuming no changes in discount rates, would generally result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value 
measurement. Significant increases (decreases) in discount rates, assuming no changes in growth rates 
and multiples, would result in a significantly (lower) higher fair value measurement.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

The Company accounts for redeemable noncontrolling interests in accordance with ASC 480-10-

S99-3A, “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity” (“ASC 480-10-S99-3A”), because their exercise is outside 
the control of the Company. The redeemable noncontrolling interests recorded at fair value are put 
arrangements held by the noncontrolling interests in certain of the Company’s majority-owned sports 
networks.

See Note 3 – Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions under the headings “Fiscal 2018” and 
“Fiscal 2016” under the subheading “Other”. 

Significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company’s redeemable 
noncontrolling interests are OIBDA projections (generally within a 1% - 3% average growth rate range, 
where applicable) and discount rates (generally 8%, where applicable). Significant increases (decreases) 
in growth rates and multiples, assuming no change in discount rates, would result in a significantly higher 
(lower) fair value measurement. Significant increases (decreases) in discount rates, assuming no 
changes in growth rates and multiples, would result in a significantly (lower) higher fair value 
measurement.

The fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests in the sports networks were primarily 
determined by (i) applying a multiples-based formula for one of the sports networks and (ii) using a 
combination of multiples-based and discounted OIBDA valuation model for the other sports networks. As 
of June 30, 2018, the redeemable noncontrolling interests are not exercisable. Subsequent to June 30, 
2018, one minority shareholder’s put right became exercisable in July 2018 and two minority 
shareholders’ put rights will become exercisable in March 2019. The remaining redeemable 
noncontrolling interests are currently not exercisable.

Fair value is generally determined by reference to market values resulting from trading on a national

Foreign Currency Contracts 

The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts primarily to hedge certain exposures to 
foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with revenues and the cost of producing or acquiring 
films and television programming. The Company also entered into foreign currency option contracts to

purposes, the option contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore have been treated as 
economic hedges (See Note 3 – Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions under the heading “Sky 
Acquisition”). The Company’s foreign currency forward contracts, which are primarily denominated in 
Pounds Sterling and Canadian Dollars, are valued using an income approach.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 

The Company’s assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include investments, long-

lived assets, indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill. The Company reviews the carrying amounts 
of such assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not 
be recoverable or at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill. Any resulting asset 
impairment would require that the asset be recorded at its fair value. The resulting fair value 
measurements of the assets are considered to be Level 3 measurements.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Annual Impairment Review 
Goodwill

The Company’s goodwill impairment reviews are determined using a two-step process. The first 

step of the process is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including 
goodwill. In performing the first step, the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit by 
primarily using discounted cash flow analysis and market-based valuation approach methodologies. 
Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about 
appropriate discount rates, long-term growth rates, relevant comparable transaction and company 
earnings multiples, as applicable, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The cash 
flows employed in the analyses are based on the Company’s estimated outlook and various growth rates 
have been assumed for years beyond the long-term business plan period. Discount rate assumptions are 
based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units. For 
the goodwill impairment review as of June 30, 2018, the Company also considered the fair value implied 
in the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement with Disney (See Note 3 – Acquisitions, Disposals and 
Other Transactions under the heading “Disney Transaction/Distribution of New Fox”). In assessing the 
reasonableness of its determined fair values, the Company evaluates its results against other value 
indicators, such as comparable public company trading values. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds 
its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment 
review is not necessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step 
of the goodwill impairment review is required to be performed to estimate the implied fair value of the 
reporting unit’s goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the 
amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. That is, the estimated fair value of the reporting 
unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible 
assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value 
of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid. The implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is 
compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill 
exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to 
that excess.

FCC licenses

The Company performs impairment reviews consisting of a comparison of the estimated fair value 

of the Company’s FCC licenses with their carrying amount on a station-by-station basis using a 
discounted cash flow valuation method, assuming a hypothetical start-up scenario for a broadcast station 
in each of the markets the Company operates in. The significant assumptions used are the discount rate 
and terminal growth rates and operating margins, as well as industry data on future advertising revenues 
in the markets where the Company owns television stations. These assumptions are based on actual 
historical performance and estimates of future performance in each market.

Fiscal 2018 and 2017 

During fiscal 2018 and 2017, the Company determined that the goodwill and indefinite-lived 

intangible assets included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, 
respectively, were not impaired.

Bank loans

In December 2017, the Yankees Entertainment and Sports Network (the “YES Network”) amended 
its credit agreement to decrease the total size of its credit facility to $1.6 billion, comprised of a secured 
revolving credit facility and a term loan facility, and to extend the maturity date of the credit agreement to 
December 2023 (the “YES Credit Agreement”). As of June 30, 2018, the outstanding balances on the 
term loan facility and secured revolving credit facility were approximately $1.1 billion and $145 million, 
respectively. The maximum amount available under the secured revolving credit facility is $500 million. 
The material terms of the YES Credit Agreement include various financial and restrictive covenants. The 
YES Credit Agreement is collateralized by a substantial portion of the real and personal property assets 
of the YES Network. At the election of the YES Network, the YES Credit Agreement bears interest at (i) 
one, two, three or six month LIBOR plus the applicable LIBOR margin, or (ii) the Base Rate plus a Base 
Rate margin; margins reset quarterly based on the specified leverage ratio of YES Network. The YES 
Network pays a commitment fee on undrawn funds (currently 0.225%) that is determined by the total 
leverage ratio. Principal payments with respect to the term loan are required quarterly. Additionally, an 
annual excess cash flow payment is required as mandatory prepayment of future amortization 
obligations, subject to certain leverage ratio conditions. The YES Credit Agreement also provides for the 
establishment of additional credit facilities provided certain terms and provisions are met.

In March 2018, STAR entered into a term loan agreement (the “STAR Term Loan”) among STAR as 

borrower, the Company as parent guarantor, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as original lender and IDBI 
Trusteeship Services Limited as agent. The term loan agreement is comprised of an Indian rupee (“INR”) 
5 billion (approximately $73 million) unsecured term loan facility with a maturity date of March 2021. The 
term loan facility bears interest at the Financial Benchmarks India Pvt. Ltd. Treasury Bills rate for three 
month terms plus a margin. The term loan facility is callable and may be redeemed, in whole or in part, 
every three months.

In addition to the STAR Term Loan, STAR has entered into various unsecured credit facilities (the 

“STAR Credit Facilities”) that are available for working capital and for acquiring programming rights. 
These credit facilities are uncommitted and are reviewed periodically for renewal. The credit facilities had 
a total capacity for borrowings of INR 13.7 billion (approximately $200 million) as of June 30, 2018, which 
was subsequently increased to INR 21.7 billion (approximately $315 million). As of June 30, 2018, the 
outstanding balance on the credit facilities was nil. Borrowings under the credit facilities are due on

Public debt - Predecessor indentures

The Company has issued notes under indentures prior to 2009, by and among 21CFA, the 

Company as Parent Guarantor and the applicable trustee. These notes are direct unsecured obligations 
of 21CFA and rank pari passu with all other unsecured indebtedness of 21CFA. Redemption may occur, 
at the option of the holders, at 101% of the principal plus an accrued interest amount in certain 
circumstances where a change of control is deemed to have occurred. These notes are subject to certain 
covenants, which, among other things, restrict secured indebtedness to 10% of tangible assets and in 
certain circumstances limit new senior indebtedness. 

Included in the predecessor indentures as of June 30, 2017 was $350 million of 7.25% Senior Notes 

which were retired in May 2018. 

In October 2016, the Company retired $400 million of 8.00% Senior Notes.

Public debt - Senior notes issued under August 2009 indenture

The Company has issued notes under the Indenture, dated August 25, 2009, as amended and 

restated on February 16, 2011, by and among 21CFA, the Company, as Parent Guarantor, and The Bank 
of New York Mellon, as Trustee (the “2009 Indenture”). These notes are direct unsecured obligations of 
21CFA and rank pari passu with all other unsecured indebtedness of 21CFA. Redemption may occur, at 
the option of the holders, at 101% of the principal plus an accrued interest amount in certain 
circumstances where a change of control is deemed to have occurred. These notes are subject to certain 
covenants, which, among other things, limit the Company’s ability and the ability of the Company’s 
subsidiaries, to create liens and engage in a merger, sale or consolidation transaction. The 2009 
Indenture does not contain any financial maintenance covenants. 

Under the 2009 Indenture, the Company had the following issuances:

In November 2016, 21CFA issued $450 million of 3.375% Senior Notes due 2026 and $400 million 

of 4.750% Senior Notes due 2046. The net proceeds of $842 million were used for general corporate 
purposes.

In October 2015, 21CFA issued $600 million of 3.70% Senior Notes due 2025 and $400 million of 

4.95% Senior Notes due 2045. The net proceeds of $987 million were used for general corporate 
purposes.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMorgan Chase”) and Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”) as Co-Administrative 
Agents, JPMorgan Chase as Designated Agent and Bank of America, N.A. (“Bank of America”) as 
Syndication Agent. The Credit Agreement, which was amended on December 22, 2016, provides a $1.4 
billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a sub-limit of $250 million (or its equivalent in Euros) 
available for the issuance of letters of credit and a maturity date of May 2020. Under the Credit 
Agreement, the Company may request an increase in the amount of the credit facility up to a maximum 
amount of $2.0 billion and the Company may request that the maturity date be extended for up to two

As of June 30, 2018, there were approximately 28,800 holders of record of shares of Class A 

Common Stock and 6,400 holders of record of shares of Class B Common Stock.

In the event of a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, holders of Class A Common Stock and 
Class B Common Stock shall be entitled to receive all of the remaining assets of the Company available 
for distribution to its stockholders, ratably in proportion to the number of shares held by Class A Common 
Stock holders and Class B Common Stock holders, respectively. In the event of any merger or 
consolidation with or into another entity, the holders of Class A Common Stock and the holders of Class B 
Common Stock shall be entitled to receive substantially identical per share consideration.

Under the Twenty-First Century Fox Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Board is authorized to 

issue shares of preferred stock or common stock at any time, without stockholder approval, and to 
determine all the terms of those shares, including the following:

(i) the voting rights, if any, except that the issuance of preferred stock or series common stock which 
entitles holders thereof to more than one vote per share requires the affirmative vote of the holders 
of a majority of the combined voting power of the then outstanding shares of the Company’s capital 
stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; 
(ii) the dividend rate and preferences, if any, which that preferred stock or common stock will have 
compared to any other class; and
(iii) the redemption and liquidation rights and preferences, if any, which that preferred stock or 
common stock will have compared to any other class.

Any decision by the Board to issue preferred stock or common stock must, however, be taken in 

accordance with the Board’s fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the Company’s stockholders. The 
Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. The 
Board has the authority, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, to issue preferred stock in 
one or more series and to fix the number of shares, designations, relative rights (including voting rights), 
preferences, qualifications and limitations of such series to the full extent permitted by Delaware law.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 13. EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION 
2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan 

In October 2013, the Company adopted the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2013 Plan”), 
under which equity-based compensation, including stock options, performance stock units (“PSUs”), 
restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and other types of awards, may be granted. The 
Company’s employees and directors are eligible to participate in the 2013 Plan. The Compensation 
Committee of the Board (the “Compensation Committee”) determines the recipients, type of award to be 
granted and amounts of awards to be granted under the 2013 Plan. Stock options awarded under the 
2013 Plan will be granted at exercise prices which are equal to or exceed the market price at the date of 
grant. The 2013 Plan replaced the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan” and together with the 
2013 Plan, the “Plans”) under which no additional stock options, PSUs, restricted stock or RSUs will be 
granted. The maximum number of shares of Class A Common Stock that may be issued under the 2013 
Plan is 87.5 million shares plus any residual shares that returned from the 2005 Plan. As of June 30, 
2018, the remaining number of shares available for issuance under the 2013 Plan was approximately 64 
million. Of the shares available for future issuance under the 2013 Plan, a maximum of 56 million shares 
may be issued in connection with awards of restricted stock, RSUs or PSUs as of June 30, 2018. The 
Company will issue new shares of Class A Common Stock upon vesting of stock-settled PSUs and RSUs. 
The Company currently has no stock options outstanding.

Commencing with the fiscal 2017 awards granted, each eligible person is entitled to receive 

dividend equivalents for each regular cash dividend on the Class A Common Stock paid by the Company 
during the award period. Any such dividend equivalent units shall be subject to the same terms and 
conditions which apply to the underlying award and will convert to shares of Class A Common Stock, if at 
all, on the payment date, only to the extent that the underlying award has been earned.

The fair value of equity-based compensation under the Plans is calculated according to the type of 

award issued. Cash-settled awards are marked-to-market at each reporting period.

Performance Stock Units 

PSUs are fair valued on the date of grant and expensed over the service period using a straight-line 

method as the awards cliff vest at the end of the three-year performance period. The Company also 
estimates the number of shares expected to vest which is based on management’s determination of the 
probable outcome of the performance condition, which requires considerable judgment. The Company 
records a cumulative adjustment in periods that the Company’s estimate of the number of shares 
expected to vest changes. Additionally, the Company ultimately adjusts the expense recognized to reflect 
the actual vested shares following the resolution of the performance conditions. The number of shares 
that will be issued upon vesting of PSUs can range from 0% to 200% (limited to 150% for certain 
executives) of the target award, based on the Company’s three-year total shareholder return (“TSR”) as 
measured against the three-year TSR of the companies that comprise the Standard and Poor’s 500 Index 
(excluding financial, real estate and energy sector companies) and other performance measures. The fair 
value of the TSR condition is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model.

Participants in the plan received a grant of PSUs that has a three-year performance measurement 
period beginning in July of each fiscal year. The awards are subject to the achievement of one or more 
pre-established objective performance measures determined by the Compensation Committee. The 
majority of the awards issued will be settled in shares of Class A Common Stock upon vesting and are 
subject to the participants’ continued employment with the Company. Any person who holds PSUs shall 
have no ownership interest in the shares of Class A Common Stock to which such PSUs relate until and 
unless shares of Class A Common Stock are delivered to the holder. All shares of Class A Common 
Stock awards that are cancelled or forfeited become available for future grants. Certain of these awards 
have a graded vesting provision and the expense recognition is accelerated.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, a total of approximately 6.8 million, 7.4 million and 6.2 million PSUs 

were granted, respectively, and will primarily be settled in shares of Class A Common Stock. PSUs 
granted to employees in certain foreign locations are settled in cash.

In February 2018, the Compensation Committee determined that, upon vesting, the outstanding 
PSU awards for the fiscal 2016-2018 performance period granted to all participants in the PSU award 
program, including the Company’s named executive officers, will be paid out based on the target number 
of PSUs awarded in accordance with the original vesting schedule. As of June 30, 2018, there were 
approximately 5.0 million PSUs outstanding for the 2016-2018 performance period (See Note 3 – 
Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions under the heading “Disney Transaction/Distribution of 
New Fox”).

Retention Awards

The Compensation Committee made a special grant of approximately 5.9 million restricted stock 

units (“Retention RSUs”) to certain of the Company’s senior executives, including named executive 
officers. The Retention RSU grants will vest 50% at the time of the Mergers and 50% on the 15-month 
anniversary of the Mergers, subject to each executive’s continued employment through the applicable 
vesting date. The Retention RSU grants will be subject to accelerated vesting upon the occurrence of 
certain termination events. In the event the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement is terminated, the 
Retention RSU grants will vest on the later of December 13, 2019 and the date of such termination (See 
Note 3 – Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions under the heading “Disney 
Transaction/Distribution of New Fox”).

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Operating leases and service agreements

Operating leases and service agreements primarily include agreements for office facilities, 

equipment, transponder service agreements and microwave transmitters used to carry broadcast signals. 
The leases, which are classified as operating leases, expire at certain dates through fiscal 2048. Included 
in the total amount committed for operating leases of land and buildings of $1.6 billion, are approximately 
$175 million for office facilities that have been sub-leased to News Corp.

agreements, marketing agreements and contracts for capital expenditures. 

Hulu indemnity

The Company owns an equity interest in Hulu, which is considered a variable interest entity under 

ASC 810-10. However, the Company is not the primary beneficiary and hence accounts for its investment 
under the equity method. The Company has guaranteed $113 million of Hulu’s $338 million five-year term 
loan due in August 2022. The fair value of this guarantee was calculated using Level 3 inputs and was 
included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other liabilities. 

121

TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY FOX, INC.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In August 2016, Hulu issued a 10% equity interest to a new investor thereby diluting the Company’s 
ownership from 33% to 30%. For a period of up to 36 months, under certain limited circumstances arising 
from regulatory review, the new investor may put its shares to Hulu or Hulu may call the shares from the 
new investor. If Hulu is required to fund the repurchase of shares from the new investor, the Company 
has agreed to make an additional capital contribution of up to approximately $300 million to Hulu. As a 
result of these conditions, the Company will record a gain on the dilution of its ownership interest upon 
resolution of the contingency. The Company will continue to account for its interest in Hulu as an equity 
method investment.

In fiscal 2016, the Company invested approximately $50 million in Hulu to maintain its ownership 

percentage at that time. In addition, in fiscal 2018 and 2017, the Company invested approximately $430 
million and $100 million, respectively, in Hulu to maintain its ownership percentage and has committed to 
an additional investment of approximately $225 million in fiscal 2019.

Pension and other postretirement benefits

In accordance with ASC 715, “Compensation—Retirement Benefits” (“ASC 715”), the total accrued 
net benefit liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of June 30, 2018 was 
$655 million (See Note 16 – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits). This amount is affected by, 
among other items, statutory funding levels, changes in plan demographics and assumptions and 
investment returns on plan assets. Because of the current overall funded status of the Company’s 
material plans, the accrued liability does not represent expected near-term liquidity needs and, 
accordingly, this amount is not included in the contractual obligations table. 

Contingencies 
Fox News Channel

The Company and certain of its current and former employees have been subject to allegations of 

sexual harassment and discrimination and racial discrimination relating to alleged misconduct at the 
Company’s Fox News Channel business. The Company has resolved many of these claims and is 
contesting other claims in litigation. The Company has also received regulatory and investigative inquiries 
relating to these matters. To date, none of the amounts paid in settlements or reserved for pending or 
future claims, is individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company. The amount of liability, if any, 
that may result from these or related matters cannot be estimated at this time. However, the Company 
does not currently anticipate that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will have a material 
adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, future results of operations or liquidity.

Shareholder Litigation

On November 20, 2017, a stockholder of the Company filed a derivative action in the Court of 

Chancery of the State of Delaware captioned City of Monroe Employees’ Retirement System v. Rupert 
Murdoch, et al., C.A. No. 2017-0833-AGB. The lawsuit named as defendants all directors of the Company 
and the Estate of Roger Ailes (the “Ailes Estate”), and named the Company as a nominal defendant. The 
plaintiff alleged that the directors of the Company and Rupert Murdoch as a purported controlling 
stockholder breached their fiduciary duties by, among other things, failing to properly oversee the work 
environment at Fox News. The plaintiff also brought claims of breach of fiduciary duty and unjust 
enrichment against the Ailes Estate.

On November 20, 2017, the parties reached an agreement to settle the lawsuit and filed a 

Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement, Compromise, and Release with the Court (the “Settlement 
Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the parties agreed that the director 
defendants and the Ailes Estate would cause their insurers to make a payment in the amount of $90 
million to the Company, less approximately $22 million of attorneys’ fees and expenses awarded by the 
Court to the plaintiff’s counsel. Such amount was paid pursuant to an agreement reached between the 
defendants and their directors’ and officers’ liability insurers for the payment of insurance proceeds,

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

subject to a claims release. In addition to the payment to the Company, the Settlement Agreement 
provides that the Company shall put in place governance and compliance enhancements, including the 
creation of the Fox News Workplace Professionalism and Inclusion Council, as set forth in the Non-
Monetary Relief Agreement agreed to by the parties in connection with the Settlement Agreement. These 
governance and compliance enhancements, which the Company has implemented, shall remain in effect 
for five years. No stockholder objected to either the settlement or the proposed fee award at the 
settlement hearing on February 9, 2018. The Court approved the settlement and entered a final order and 
judgment on February 9, 2018. Accordingly, the Company received a cash payment and recorded the net 
settlement of $68 million in Other, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for fiscal 2018.

U.K. Newspaper Matters Indemnity

In connection with the News Corp Separation, the Company and News Corp agreed in the News 

Corp Separation and Distribution Agreement that the Company will indemnify News Corp, on an after-tax 
basis, for payments made after the News Corp Separation arising out of civil claims and investigations 
relating to phone hacking, illegal data access and inappropriate payments to public officials that occurred 
at subsidiaries of News Corp, as well as legal and professional fees and expenses paid in connection with 
the related criminal matters, other than fees, expenses and costs relating to employees who are not (i) 
directors, officers or certain designated employees or (ii) with respect to civil matters, co-defendants with 
News Corp (the “Indemnity”). Pursuant to the Indemnity, the Company made payments of $61 million, $28 
million and $20 million to News Corp during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The liability 
recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the indemnity was approximately $50 million and 
$80 million as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Other 

Equity purchase arrangements that are exercisable by the counterparty to the agreement, and that 
are outside the sole control of the Company, are accounted for in accordance with ASC 480-10-S99-3A 
and are classified as Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other 
than the arrangements classified as Redeemable noncontrolling interests, the Company is also a party to 
several other purchase and sale arrangements which become exercisable at various points in time. 
However, these arrangements are currently either not exercisable in the next twelve months or are not 
material.

The Company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims when the Company determines that a 

loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, 
accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The amount of 
any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be 
higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters. Any fees, expenses, fines, penalties, 
judgments or settlements which might be incurred by the Company in connection with the various 
proceedings could affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. For the 
contingencies disclosed above for which there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be 
incurred, other than the accrual provided, the Company was unable to estimate the amount of loss or 
range of loss.

The Company’s operations are subject to tax in various domestic and international jurisdictions and 
as a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The 
Company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of all pending tax matters and 
does not currently anticipate that the ultimate resolution of pending tax matters will have a material 
adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, future results of operations or liquidity.

NOTE 16. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS 

The Company participates in and/or sponsors various pension, savings and postretirement benefit 
plans. The major pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are closed to new participants (with the 
exception of groups covered by collective bargaining agreements). In fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, the 

123

TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY FOX, INC.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Company settled a portion of its pension obligations by irrevocably transferring pension liabilities to an 
insurance company through the purchase of group annuity contracts and/or through lump sum 
distributions. These transactions, primarily funded with pension plan assets, resulted in pre-tax settlement 
losses related to the recognition of accumulated deferred actuarial losses of $91 million, $39 million and 
$75 million for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which were included in Other, net in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company has a legally enforceable obligation to contribute to some plans and is not required to 
contribute to others. The plans in the U.S. include both defined benefit pension plans and employee non-
contributory and employee contributory accumulation plans covering all eligible employees. The 
Company makes contributions in accordance with applicable laws or contract terms in each jurisdiction in 
which the Company operates. The Company’s benefit obligation is calculated using several assumptions 
which the Company reviews on a regular basis.

The funded status of the plans can change from year to year, but the assets of the funded plans 

have been sufficient to pay all benefits that came due in each of fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016.

The Company uses a June 30 measurement date for all pension and postretirement benefit plans. 

The following table sets forth the change in the projected benefit obligation, change in the fair value of 
plan assets and funded status for the Company’s benefit plans:

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Beginning in fiscal 2017, the Company changed the method used to estimate the service and 

interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. 
For fiscal 2016 and previous periods presented, the Company estimated the service and interest cost 
components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to 
measure the benefit obligation. The new method utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of 
these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of 
the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows. The Company changed to the new method 
to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation 
between projected benefit cash flows and their corresponding spot rates. The change is accounted for as 
a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle, which is 
applied prospectively. This change in estimate did not have a material impact on the Company’s pension 
and postretirement net periodic benefit expense in fiscal 2017.

The Company adopted the mortality table released by the Society of Actuaries in fiscal 2015, which 

extends the assumed life expectancy of plan participants, and subsequently updated by the Society of 
Actuaries in fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018, which lowered the assumed life expectancy of plan participants.

The following assumed health care cost trend rates as of June 30 were also used in accounting for 

postretirement benefits: 
 
 
Health care cost trend rate.........................................................................   
Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (the ultimate 
trend rate).................................................................................................

As a practical expedient, pooled funds are valued at the net asset value (“NAV”) provided by the 
fund issuer and partnership interests are based on the fair value obtained from the general partner.
Open-ended pooled funds that are registered and/or available to the general public are valued at the 
daily published NAV.
Common stock investments that are publicly traded and exchange traded funds are valued at the 
closing price reported on active markets in which the securities are traded.
The fair value of corporate, government and agency obligations are valued based on a compilation 
of primary observable market information or a broker quote in a non-active market.

The Company’s investment strategy for its pension plans is to maximize the long-term rate of return 

on plan assets within an acceptable level of risk in order to minimize the cost of providing pension 
benefits while maintaining adequate funding levels. The Company’s practice is to conduct a periodic 
review of its asset allocation. The Company’s current broad strategic targets are to have a pension asset 
portfolio comprising of 47% equity securities, 28% fixed income securities and 25% in other investments. 
In developing the expected long-term rate of return, the Company considered the pension asset 
portfolio’s future return expectations of the various asset classes. A portion of the other allocation is 
reserved in short-term cash to provide for expected benefits to be paid in the short-term. The Company’s 
equity portfolios are managed in such a way as to achieve optimal diversity. The Company’s fixed income 
portfolio is investment grade in the aggregate. The Company does not manage any assets internally.

Required pension plan contributions for the next fiscal year are not expected to be material; 

however, actual contributions may be affected by pension asset and liability valuation changes during the 
year. The Company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve funded status. 

Multiemployer Pension and Postretirement Plans 

The Company contributes to various multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of 

collective-bargaining agreements that cover certain of its union-represented employees, primarily at the 
Filmed Entertainment segment. The risks of participating in these multiemployer pension plans are 
different from single-employer pension plans such that (i) contributions made by the Company to the 
multiemployer pension plans may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating 
employers; (ii) if the Company chooses to stop participating in certain of these multiemployer pension 
plans, it may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, 
which is referred to as a withdrawal liability; and (iii) actions taken by a participating employer that lead to 
a deterioration of the financial health of a multiemployer pension plan may result in the unfunded 
obligations of the multiemployer pension plan to be borne by its remaining participating employers. While 
no multiemployer pension plan that the Company contributed to is individually significant to the Company, 
the Company was listed on five Form 5500s as providing more than 5% of total contributions based on 
the current information available. The financial health of a multiemployer plan is indicated by the zone 
status, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, which represents the funded status of the plan 
as certified by the plan’s actuary. Plans in the red zone are less than 65% funded, the yellow zone are 
between 65% and 80% funded, and the green zone are at least 80% funded. The most recent available 
funded status of the five plans in which the Company was listed as providing more than 5% of total 
contributions are all green.

The Company also contributes to various other multiemployer benefit plans that provide health and 

welfare benefits to active and retired participants, primarily at the Filmed Entertainment segment.

In fiscal 2018, decreases in the net provision for uncertain tax positions were primarily from the 
settlement of the federal audit; in fiscal 2016, increases in the net provision for uncertain tax 
positions were substantially offset by the final settlement of a foreign matter.
Fiscal 2016 reflects increased tax amortization deductions for certain film and television properties 
as a result of a ruling that was received by the Company.

The table above reflects the effects of the Tax Act (See Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting 

Policies under the heading “U.S. Tax Reform”).

The Company had deferred tax assets of $76 million and $197 million as of June 30, 2018 and 

2017, respectively. The Company also had deferred tax liabilities of $1,892 million and $2,782 million as 
of June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

As of June 30, 2018, the Company had $460 million of tax attributes from net operating loss 
carryforwards available to offset future taxable income. A substantial portion of these losses expire 
through 2026. 

As of June 30, 2018, the Company had $170 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards available to 
offset certain future income tax expense. As of June 30, 2018, the Company has recorded a provisional 
tax expense to establish a valuation allowance of $158 million associated with a portion of this tax asset 
as the Company has determined that it is not more likely than not that the Company will utilize these 
foreign tax credit carryforwards prior to their expiration (See Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies under the heading “U.S. Tax Reform”).

The increase in the valuation allowance to $821 million as of June 30, 2018 was primarily due to the 

establishment of a valuation allowance against excess foreign tax credits as noted above partially offset 
by the impact of the change in the federal tax rate in accordance with the Tax Act.

The Company recognizes interest and penalty charges related to uncertain tax positions as income 

tax expense. The Company recorded liabilities for accrued interest of $77 million and $74 million as of 
June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and the amounts of interest income/expense recorded in each of 
the three fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016 were not material.

The Company is subject to tax in various domestic and international jurisdictions and, as a matter of 

ordinary course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The 
Company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of all pending tax matters and 
does not anticipate that the resolution of these pending tax matters will have a material adverse effect on 
its consolidated financial condition, future results of operations or liquidity. The additions to the balance of 
uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2018 is primarily attributable to foreign and state matters. During fiscal 
2018, the reduction for prior year tax positions results primarily from the completion of the U.S. federal tax 
audits for fiscal years 2009 through 2013. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service is currently examining fiscal 
years 2014 and 2015. In addition, the Company’s income tax returns for fiscal years 2010 through 2018 
are subject to examination in various foreign jurisdictions. The Company does not expect significant 
changes to these positions over the next 12 months. As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, $385 million and 
$505 million, respectively, would affect the Company’s effective income tax rate, if the Company’s 
position with respect to the uncertainties is sustained.

The Tax Act also changes the taxation of foreign earnings, and companies generally will not be 

subject to U.S. federal income taxes upon the receipt of dividends from foreign subsidiaries and will not 
be permitted foreign tax credits related to such dividends. Beginning in 2018, the Company will generally 
not record U.S. federal income tax on its share of the income of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries 
generated after December 31, 2017, nor will the Company record a benefit for foreign tax credits related 
to that income. The Company has accumulated historical earnings that upon distribution could be subject 
to taxation. It is management’s intention to treat these earnings as indefinitely reinvested except to the 
extent of amounts which were taxed as part of the Company’s transition tax liability. The Company’s long 
term domestic liquidity needs do not consider repatriation of the undistributed earnings of these 
subsidiaries. The calculation of the unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to 
the outside basis differentials in the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is not practicable. Undistributed 
earnings of foreign subsidiaries of the Company considered to be indefinitely reinvested amounted to 
approximately $963 million as of June 30, 2018.

NOTE 18. SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company is a diversified global media and entertainment company, which manages and 

reports its businesses in the following four segments:

Cable Network Programming, which principally consists of the production and licensing of 
programming distributed primarily through MVPDs in the U.S. and internationally.
Television, which principally consists of the acquisition, marketing and distribution of 
broadcast network programming in the U.S. and the operation of 28 full power broadcast 
television stations, including 11 duopolies, in the U.S. (of these stations, 17 are affiliated with

TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY FOX, INC.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOX, nine are affiliated with MyNetworkTV, one is affiliated with both The CW Television 
Network and MyNetworkTV and one is an independent station).
Filmed Entertainment, which principally consists of the production and acquisition of live-
action and animated motion pictures for distribution and licensing in all formats in all 
entertainment media worldwide, and the production and licensing of television programming 
worldwide.
Other, Corporate and Eliminations, which principally consists of corporate overhead costs 
and intercompany eliminations.

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

The Company’s operating segments have been determined in accordance with the Company’s 

internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities. The Company evaluates 
performance based upon several factors, of which the primary financial measure is Segment OIBDA. Due 
to the integrated nature of these operating segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating 
certain assets, revenues and expenses.

Segment OIBDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and 

administrative expenses. Segment OIBDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution 
investments, Depreciation and amortization, Impairment and restructuring charges, Equity losses of 
affiliates, Interest expense, net, Interest income, Other, net, Income tax benefit (expense), Loss from 
discontinued operations, net of tax and Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Management 
believes that Segment OIBDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the 
Company’s business segments because it is the primary measure used by the Company’s chief operating 
decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to the Company’s businesses. 

Management believes that information about Total Segment OIBDA assists all users of the 

Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating 
results of the Company’s portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net 
income, thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. Total 
Segment OIBDA provides management, investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze the 
operating performance of the Company’s business and its enterprise value against historical data and 
competitors’ data, although historical results, including Segment OIBDA and Total Segment OIBDA, may 
not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, 
including customer tastes and preferences). 

Total Segment OIBDA may be considered a non-GAAP measure and should be considered in 

addition to, not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow and other measures of financial performance 
reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund 
requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, which 
are significant components in assessing the Company’s financial performance.

The acquisition related and other transaction costs for fiscal 2018 and 2017 primarily represent the 
change in fair value of foreign currency option contracts to limit the foreign currency exchange rate 
risk in connection with the Sky Acquisition (See Note 3 – Acquisitions, Disposals and Other 
Transactions under the heading “Sky Acquisition” for further discussion). The acquisition related 
costs for fiscal 2016 are primarily due to a revision of a contingency estimate related to a previous 
acquisition. 
See Note 3 – Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions.
See Note 16 – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits.
See Note 8 – Fair Value under the heading “Contingent Consideration” for further discussion. 
See Note 7 – Investments. 
See Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under the heading “Shareholder Litigation” for 
further discussion. 
Other in fiscal 2017 included approximately $50 million of costs related to settlements of claims 
arising out of allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination at the Company’s Fox News 
Channel business.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Notes to Supplemental Guarantor Information 

(1)

(2)

Investments in the Company’s subsidiaries, for purposes of the supplemental consolidating 
presentation, are accounted for by their parent companies under the equity method of accounting 
whereby earnings of subsidiaries are reflected in the respective parent company’s investment 
account and earnings. 
The guarantees of 21CFA’s senior public indebtedness constitute senior indebtedness of the 
Company, and rank pari passu with all present and future senior indebtedness of the Company. 
Because the factual basis underlying the obligations created pursuant to the various facilities and 
other obligations constituting senior indebtedness of the Company differ, it is not possible to predict 
how a court in bankruptcy would accord priorities among the obligations of the Company.
