Annual Report

2017

Our Mission is to 
enable our customers 
to make the world  
healthier, cleaner and safer.

Thermo Fisher Scientific is the world leader in serving 
science, generating more than $20 billion in annual revenues. 
Customers worldwide trust the technologies and solutions 
available through our premier brands to help them accelerate 
innovation and enhance productivity. 

Dear Shareholder, 

By all measures, Thermo Fisher Scientific 
achieved another outstanding year in 2017. 
We continued to successfully execute our 
growth strategy to be the best partner for our 
customers. We made progress in enhancing our 
culture to be a great place to work for our 70,000 
colleagues. And we extended our long track 
record of delivering strong financial performance.

Without the dedication of our team, none of 
these accomplishments would be possible, and 
I am humbled by their steadfast commitment to 
our company’s growth and success.  

Starting with our financial scorecard, our primary 
metric of success is to consistently deliver strong 
growth in adjusted earnings per share (EPS),* 
and I’m pleased to report that we did so again 
in 2017. Our GAAP diluted EPS increased by 
10 percent to $5.59 for the full year, and our 
adjusted EPS increased 15 percent to $9.49.  
Our adjusted operating income increased by  
15 percent, with adjusted operating margin of 
23.2 percent. We also generated record free 
cash flow of $3.5 billion in 2017.

On the top line, we grew revenues by 14 percent 
to $20.92 billion for the full year. The dynamics in 
our key end markets were favorable overall, and 
our team did an excellent job of leveraging our 
industry-leading capabilities to drive growth. At 
the same time, we successfully completed and 

*Adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating margin, adjusted operating income and free 
cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items. For a reconciliation of 
these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures, see the accompanying 
consolidated statement of income on pages 10 and 11 of this annual report.

Inspiring Mission
Thermo Fisher is the world leader in serving science. 
As such, we measure success not just by our 
financial performance, but also by the way we are 
making a difference in the world – for our customers, 
our colleagues and our communities. 

Our Mission as a company is to enable our 
customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and 
safer. Whether they’re discovering new treatments for 
disease, understanding climate change or protecting 
citizens from harm, our customers rely on Thermo 
Fisher to help them find answers to some of the most 
pressing issues of our time. Everything we do starts 
with our customers, because if we do right by them, 
all of our stakeholders will benefit.

The daily headlines are a constant reminder that we 
live in an ever-changing and ever-challenging world. 
In today’s environment, our customers expect more 
from us. This inspires us to be the company they 
trust to deliver the best solution, and we do, time and 
again, because we follow a simple growth strategy: 

• Continuously develop high-impact, innovative 

products and services

• Leverage our global scale in high-growth emerging  

markets and

• Deliver a unique customer value proposition.

This proven formula positions us to serve our 
customers well today and for years to come, and 
I’ll use it as a framework to cover some of the many 
highlights from the year.

Breakthrough Innovation 
The first element of our growth strategy is our 
ongoing commitment to innovation. Since our 
company’s founding, innovation has remained an 
important differentiator for us. In 2017, we spent 
nearly $900 million on research and development – 
far more than any company in our industry. We  
use this investment to help our customers achieve 
their goals for innovation and productivity, and  
enable exciting breakthroughs that will benefit 
society at large.

therapies 

 
When it comes to beating cancer, we now know that a one-
size-fits-all approach doesn’t work well. Our technologies 
are propelling a revolution in diagnosis and treatment by 
advancing precision medicine. 

One example is our Ion Torrent Oncomine Dx Target Test 
for non-small-cell lung cancer, a companion diagnostic that 
uses our next-generation sequencing technology. It helps 
doctors identify the best therapy for individual patients based 
on their unique molecular profiles. We continue to expand 
our Oncomine menu of tests to keep pace with advances in 
clinical oncology research.

From molecule  
to medicine 

More-targeted therapies promise to significantly 
improve patient lives, but they also create complexity for 
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies challenged 
with bringing new treatments to market quickly, yet  
cost-effectively.

In 2017, Thermo Fisher significantly strengthened its 
leading offering for these customers with the acquisition 
of Patheon, a provider of contract development and 
manufacturing services. By combining Patheon’s 
capabilities with our clinical trials services, we can take 
a drug through formulation development to commercial 
production, partnering with our customers to deliver 
critical medicines to patients.

For example, to combat cancer and other diseases, 
life science researchers are trying to better under-
stand the structure and function of proteins in our 
body. New systems such as our Thermo Scientific 
Krios G3i cryo-transmission electron microscope are 
revolutionizing structural biology. In fact, the 2017 
winners of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry worked 
with our cryo-electron microscopy (EM) systems. 
And, our leading Thermo Scientific Orbitrap mass 
spectrometry platform has been a game-changer 
in protein research for many years. We continued to 
build on that legacy with the launch of our Thermo 
Scientific Q Exactive HF-X system in 2017. 

Another exciting opportunity is precision medicine. 
We are helping scientists design therapies based 
on an individual’s genetic profile, so doctors can 
match the right therapy to a patient’s specific type of 
cancer. We were especially proud to play a role in two 
medical breakthroughs during the year. Our Invitrogen 
Dynabeads technology enabled the first CAR-T cell 
therapy for childhood leukemia approved by the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). And our 
Ion Torrent Oncomine Dx Target Test for non-small-
cell lung cancer screening was the first companion 
diagnostic based on next-generation sequencing to 
receive FDA clearance.

We also continued to strengthen our offering of 
specialty diagnostics, giving doctors faster and more 
accurate information to make the right decisions for 
their patients. A highlight from the year was receiving 
510(k) clearance from the FDA to expand the use 
of our BRAHMS PCT sensitive KRYPTOR assay to 
prevent the overuse of antibiotic therapies.  

Innovation in digital science is another compelling 
opportunity for us. We’re creating a digital platform 
that helps our customers manage data, run their labs 
and collaborate more efficiently. For example, we’re 
connecting instruments to the cloud – everything 
from electronic pipettes to our most sophisticated 
analytical tools. And we continue to expand our web 
presence, with a 13 percent increase in e-commerce 
revenues in 2017. Our customers want to use new 
digital tools to create more impact through their work, 
and Thermo Fisher is in the best position to lead this 
important trend.

 2017 Annual ReportGlobal Scale
The second element of our growth strategy involves 
leveraging our industry-leading scale to serve our 
customers in high-growth emerging markets, such as 
China, India and the Middle East. Emerging markets 
represented 21 percent of our total revenues in 2017, 
and we continued to increase our presence to meet 
our customers’ evolving needs. 

In India, for example, we’re supporting the growing 
pharmaceutical industry and the country’s focus 
on improving food safety. In the Middle East, we’re 
collaborating with academic and government 
customers to broaden the use of our advanced 
technologies – from cryo-EM systems for life  
science research to genetic analysis instruments 
for human identification. 

10%
of total revenues

Our greatest success story in emerging markets 
continues to be China, which represents 10 percent 
of our company’s total revenues. Our China strategy 
is aligned with the country’s 5-year plan, placing 
an emphasis on precision medicine, environmental 
protection and food safety. 

In 2017, we opened a Precision Medicine Customer 
Experience Center in Guangzhou – the center of 
healthcare innovation in China. In addition to serving 
as a showcase of our capabilities, the facility is a hub 
for customer training, collaboration and applications 
development. We also expanded our leading 
offering of air quality products in China by acquiring 
complementary technologies to help our customers 
comply with rapidly evolving environmental standards. 

We continue to have great momentum in China 
and other emerging markets, and our targeted 
investments there will fuel our long-term growth.

Unique Value
Finally, the third element of our growth strategy is 
the unique value proposition we can deliver to our 
customers by leveraging our capabilities across the 

6

thermofisher.com

company. We continued to enhance our offering 
through a combination of internal developments and 
strategic acquisitions that complement our strengths.  

In 2017, we invested $7.8 billion in strategic M&A. 
The most significant was our addition of Patheon, 
a leading contract development and manufacturing 
organization (CDMO) for pharma and biotech 
customers. Through its comprehensive services 
offering – from initial drug formulation development 
to commercial production – the business is a vital 
partner to biopharma in helping to deliver medicines 
to patients. By adding these capabilities to our 
leading clinical trials services, we’ve created a  
$3 billion services business that supports our  
largest customer base. 

I’ve had the chance to welcome many of our 9,000 
new colleagues during Day One celebrations 
and visits to their sites. It’s been great to see the 
enthusiasm about being part of Thermo Fisher and 
the shared excitement over new opportunities this 
combination will bring.   

Whether large or small, acquired businesses create 
the most value when their cultures and capabilities 
are smoothly integrated. This is where our Practical 
Process Improvement (PPI) Business System gives 
us a distinct advantage. It is ingrained across our 
company to set new standards for operational 
excellence in quality and productivity, and ultimately 
promotes customer allegiance. Our PPI Business 
System also serves as a playbook for successfully 
integrating new businesses. Our formula for creating 
value from acquisitions is to make sure that one plus 
one equals more than two, and our PPI Business 
System is critical to achieving that goal. 

Vibrant Culture 
When we serve our customers well, we build a strong 
and growing company that creates opportunities for 
our colleagues. I have been part of Thermo Fisher 
Scientific for 17 years, and I have always been 
inspired by the company’s Mission and our potential 
to make a real difference in the world. When I travel 
to our sites, it’s also evident that our 4i Values of 
Integrity, Intensity, Innovation and Involvement are not 
just words, but the heart of our culture. We continue 
to build on this foundation to attract and retain an 
exceptional team.

Understanding  
climate change

According to NASA, the earth is warming at an 
unprecedented rate. And to understand what it means for 
the future of our planet, we have to look back. Thermo 
Fisher has joined the global ICE MEMORY initiative to help 
scientists find answers that lie in ancient glacial ice cores. 

Led by the Fondation Université Grenoble Alpes, this 
initiative involves extracting ice cores from mountain 
glaciers. Our spectrometry and chromatography 
instruments are then being used to analyze the ice 
samples to gain insight into what the future holds.

Uncovering the truth

Solving crimes can present complex challenges, 
especially when evidence is scarce. Our human 
identification (HID) technologies help forensics scientists 
extract critical DNA evidence that can bring a criminal to 
justice or free the wrongly accused. 

In fact, our human DNA profiling kits and instruments 
helped exonerate two men in the U.S. who had spent 
years behind bars before their murder convictions were 
overturned. Our range of HID systems are used globally to 
solve crimes, find missing children and identify victims of 
natural disasters.

our operations, while developing innovative solutions 
to help our customers achieve their own sustainability 
goals. Second, our philanthropic charter is centered 
on STEM education (science, technology, engineering 
and math), and we donate considerable time and 
money to inspire students to take an interest in 
these subjects. Last, we encourage our teams to be 
involved through volunteer activities organized by our 
Community Action Councils and many other outreach 
programs on a global scale. 

I was especially moved by the response of our teams 
when the hurricanes hit our facilities in Puerto Rico 
last fall. It was inspiring to see the outpouring of 
supplies and donations from colleagues around the 
world. Local teams set up shelters at our facilities, 
and in some cases, managers went house-to-
house to find their missing colleagues. In spite of 
tremendous hardship, they worked tirelessly to get 
our operations back online to serve our customers 
and deliver critical medicines to patients.

Examples like these are what make our company a 
special place, and they assure me that our best years 
are still ahead. Our long-term vision for Thermo Fisher 
is to not only be a great company, but to be a great 
enduring company in the eyes of our customers, our 
colleagues, the communities in which we operate 
and the shareholders who invest in our future. Every 
successful year keeps us solidly on that course. 

Sincerely,

Marc N. Casper

I’m especially proud of our progress in becoming 
a more diverse and inclusive culture – where 
different ways of thinking are respected, valued 
and encouraged. Every year, the feedback from 
our Employee Involvement Survey tells us what 
we’re doing well and where we can improve. The 
three survey indexes that measure our progress – 
Leadership, Involvement and Inclusion – all showed 
improvement again in 2017, and our Inclusion score 
was the highest of the three. This is a result of our 
emphasis on modeling behaviors that foster diversity 
of thought across all career levels, job families and 
demographics. 

Our network of Employee Resource Groups, which 
has grown to more than 85 chapters worldwide, 
has been instrumental in promoting this aspect of 
our culture. Through these employee-led groups, 
individuals can embrace their differences, learn from 
each other and have the confidence to bring their true 
selves to work. 

~70,000
     employees

We were pleased to be recognized externally in 
2017, including achieving a perfect score from the 
Corporate Equality Index for the third year in a row as 
one of the Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality. 
We were also included in the Top 100 Innovators 
in Diversity and Inclusion by the women’s social 
platform, Mogul, and recognized as one of the  
Best Companies to Work For by the Women’s  
Choice Awards. 

Every year we take deliberate actions to be an even 
better place to work. When talented colleagues 
choose to join, stay and grow their careers at Thermo 
Fisher, our customers win and so do we. Our cultural 
evolution is very intentional and strengthens our 
competitive advantage year after year. 

It’s also important that our culture of Involvement and 
Inclusion extends into our communities. I encourage 
you to read about the great progress we’ve made 
in our recent corporate social responsibility (CSR) 
report. Our CSR strategy is threefold. First, we are 
committed to minimizing the environmental impact of

 2017 Annual ReportConsolidated Statement of Income

In addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including 
adjusted  EPS,  adjusted  operating  income  and  adjusted  operating  margin,  which 
exclude certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories 
revalued  at  the  date  of  acquisition  and  significant  transaction  costs;  restructuring 
and  other  costs/income;  and  amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangible  assets. 
Adjusted EPS also excludes certain other gains and losses that are either isolated 
or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, tax provisions/benefits 
related  to  the  previous  items,  benefits  from  tax  credit  carryforwards,  the  impact 
of  significant  tax  audits  or  events  and  the  results  of  discontinued  operations.  We 
exclude the above items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, 

in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. We also use 
a non-GAAP measure, free cash flow, which is operating cash flow, excluding net 
capital  expenditures,  and  also  excludes  operating  cash  flows  from  discontinued 
operations to provide a view of the continuing operations’ ability to generate cash 
for use in acquisitions and other investing and financing activities. We believe that 
the  use  of  non-GAAP  measures  helps  investors  to  gain  a  better  understanding  of 
our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management 
measures  and  forecasts  the  company’s  performance,  especially  when  comparing 
such results to previous periods or forecasts. The non-GAAP measures presented 
herein are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for our results of 
operations prepared in accordance with GAAP.
