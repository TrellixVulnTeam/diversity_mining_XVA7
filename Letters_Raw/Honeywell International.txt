Shareowners Letter

This is my 16th and final letter to the shareowners of Honeywell. When I compare where we are
today with the bleak early days of my first letter—which appeared in Honeywell’s 2002 Annual Report—
I am reminded of what a tremendously fulfilling experience it has been to lead this great company.

Those early days are fun to think about, but they sure were unpleasant at the time. Back then, we
were an underperforming, problem-filled company with numerous legacy issues. Now, we are a
company that routinely receives awards for financial, environmental, and community performance. I am
proud to have played a role in bringing about all of these positive changes and building the foundation
for the company we are today.

When I first came to Honeywell, an analyst asked what I wanted my legacy to be. I said there were
three things I wanted to accomplish. First, I wanted anyone associated with me during my time at
Honeywell to be able to say they had done well. Clearly, this has been important to our investors, and
the vast majority are pleased with our performance over time. But employees are investors, too. In a
recent analysis, we found that about 2,500 employees and former employees had become 401(k)
millionaires. These were by no means only executives—in fact, 94% of them are below the executive
band level, and some have salaries in the low $40s. To be able to create this level of wealth for
employees feels really good.

Second, I wanted Honeywell to be a place targeted by recruiters for leaders of all kinds. Of course,
I also wanted Honeywell to be a place where leaders tended to stay because they did well and the work
was fulfilling. I believe we have done very well in developing and retaining leaders as well as many
other talented employees in all disciplines around the world.

Third, I wanted to be able to own my shares ten years after I left the company—or to say it another
way, I wanted the people, processes, and portfolio we put in place to sustain Honeywell’s performance
well beyond the time of my retirement. This is how institutions are created–not by one leader
performing well, but by the next leader sustaining and building on that performance. Nearly one year
past
things are looking good for me and other long-term
shareowners. While Honeywell’s processes are much more efficient and effective than they were
16 years ago, there is still plenty of upside to be gained through further improvements. Our portfolio
continues to get better as we improve our growth profile with acquisitions and exits. We have terrific
leaders in place, and that is particularly true of our CEO Darius Adamczyk.

the time when Darius became CEO,

The CEO makes a huge difference in the performance of a company. Leadership matters, and
Darius is a tremendous leader. He has an intense desire to win; he is smart, analytical, and thinks
independently; he has the courage of his convictions; and he isn’t afraid to make difficult decisions that
make the Company better. He is intensely curious and approaches every aspect of the job with passion
and enthusiasm. He focuses on having the right people, organized correctly, and aligned around
superior business strategies.

Darius will be the first to tell you a terrific first year is great, but he will judge himself on how he
outperforms during his full tenure. Having watched Darius over a number of years and having worked
with him closely over the last two years during our transition, I am extremely confident we chose the
right
leader for Honeywell. Darius is building on what I did to create a company that generates
tremendous value, and he will take Honeywell to the next level. You will be impressed. All I ask is that
you remember I was instrumental in picking him!

It has really been an honor for me to lead Honeywell. Our people have been terrific, and we far
exceeded what anyone ever expected of us. It was incredibly fun to build a company. It is even more
rewarding to see it built even further. For Honeywell, the best is yet to come.

Sincerely,

DAVID M. COTE
Executive Chairman

Shareowners Letter

The year 2017 turned out to be terrific for Honeywell as we delivered on our financial and strategic
objectives while executing a flawless CEO transition. For you, our shareowner, we delivered a 35%
return, which was at the top of our multi-industry peer group. We generated superior growth (4%
organic), improved free cash flow generation1 (12% better than 2016), expanded our segment margin by
70 bps, and increased our dividend by 12%. This marked the 8th double-digit dividend increase since
2010. We also positioned the company for long-term growth when we announced the spins of the Homes
and Transportation Systems businesses. These transactions will enable Honeywell to narrow its focus to
six main end markets. Although Homes and Transportation Systems are outstanding businesses, their
long-term growth and prospects for value creation will be enhanced by independent capital allocation
decisions. The separations will allow us to focus on high-growth businesses in attractive industrial end
markets, each aligned to global mega trends such as energy efficiency,
infrastructure investment,
urbanization, and worker safety. All of these businesses thrive by leveraging Honeywell’s operating
system, HOS Gold. All platforms in the remaining Honeywell portfolio provide further opportunities for
profitable organic growth as well as potential expansions via bolt-on acquisitions.

When I was first named COO of Honeywell in April 2016, I mistakenly thought a two-year overlap
with Dave Cote was a little long. The experience turned out to be invaluable in my preparation to
become CEO of Honeywell. Dave’s mentorship during this period flattened my learning curve and even
more importantly, we forged a lasting relationship from which I will benefit for many years to come. I
know I join many others in expressing my deepest gratitude to Dave for everything he has done for me
and for Honeywell.

2018 Outlook

Although 2017 was a great year, Honeywell has room for further improvement. In 2017, the
Company realized the benefits of our renewed focus on organic growth while continuing our track
record of margin expansion and improving cash flow. We prepared for 2018 by becoming more efficient
and developing a pipeline of new offerings across all our businesses. Honeywell is well-positioned to
deliver again in 2018. We have a better backlog position and view our markets more favorably than we
did 12 months ago. Our capex investments—elevated in recent years to support several high-return
projects—will normalize to more moderate levels. These normalized levels of capex, coupled with our
focus on working capital, will lead to substantial progress in our cash generation.

2017 Review Against Strategic Priorities

It is important for us to look back at how we performed against the goals we set for ourselves last

year. The following table depicts the objectives I presented during our Investor Day in March 2017.

As the table above depicts, our “say” matches our “do” because we delivered across the board on
all our financial objectives. Particularly noteworthy was our delivery of accelerated organic growth,
which we accomplished while continuing to expand our margin rate.

Also during Honeywell’s Investor Day in March, I presented a framework for the future financial
profile of Honeywell that shows we plan to accelerate organic growth while continuing to expand
margins. It is important for us to grow and expand our installed base to enable future software and
services opportunities. We have opportunities to capture what is potentially lower margin business
today in order to transition to higher margin business in the future. Perhaps the best example comes
from our Intelligrated warehouse automation business, where we have substantially grown our installed
base since its integration into Honeywell. The current business opportunities are primarily focused on
greenfield buildouts, but this installed base will eventually convert to a services model that offers
broader opportunities for software and services sales. We have seen the same dynamics play out in
our Honeywell Process Solutions business.

Investor Day,

During the past

I outlined a few strategic
imperatives for Honeywell. The top objective was to enhance our organic growth rate. The table below
depicts both the initiatives and associated key performance indicators (KPIs) to enable accelerated
growth.

New Behaviors

Toward the middle of 2017,

I

introduced a set of principles and behaviors to all Honeywell

employees. You will find the principles and behaviors below.

If you observe that these behaviors are unlikely to be found at any other industrial company, then I
achieved my objective. My intent is to create the best software-industrial company, which attracts,
recruits, promotes, develops, and cultivates the best and most talented employees on the planet. We
will drive an entrepreneurial culture which is bold yet thoughtful, and takes calculated risks to achieve
superior results. I want each of our employees to improve every year and have a passion for winning.
We also want to maintain customer intimacy in order to understand and solve our customers’ problems.
We have to not only think big, but also deliver big. Honeywell may not be the employer for everyone—
we want only the brightest and the best. At the same time that we foster a performance culture, we will
ensure that we are inclusive and support diversity and operate at the highest level of integrity in
everything we do.
there are three must-haves to work at
Honeywell: 1) The highest level of integrity; 2) Respect for all cultures, religious beliefs, and genders;
and 3) A commitment to promoting diversity. You simply cannot work at Honeywell
if you don’t live
these three principles. Although we have made some progress in demonstrating the new behaviors, we
still have a long way to go to realize the full potential across our workforce. I was not expecting instant
traction; however, we will make progress every year.

In addition to the desired behaviors,

2018 Emphasis Areas

There will be three areas of emphasis in 2018. The good news is none of these are “new,” as I am
a strong believer in consistency. First, we will drive free cash flow and cash conversion. The primary
lever will be working capital, where we still have substantial room for improvement despite making
progress in 2017. Second, we will build a software / sensor strategy into everything we develop. Third,
we will take even bolder bets in our new product development and leverage the latest technologies to
deliver superior value to customers. A large portion of our portfolio—businesses such as UOP,
Industrial Safety, Advanced Materials, and substantial segments of Aerospace—is less susceptible to
digital disruption, but all Honeywell businesses will emphasize software along with other innovations in
order to stay ahead in providing leading solutions. Every business will have one or two big bets which
can change their growth trajectory. Granted, some of these may not materialize. I am confident many
will, and they will result in a very different growth profile for us while positioning the company for
success for many years to come.

Capital Allocation

As we committed during our 2017 Investor Day, we deployed roughly $5.1 billion in cash during
2017. Our investment in M&A was somewhat light compared to historical norms, but we acquired three
smaller companies that will enable accelerated growth in our key markets such as warehouse
automation and industrial cyber security. Two of our transactions—FLUX Information Technology3 and
NextNine—were pure software plays that provide unique technologies that can be leveraged as part of
our current offerings and gain broader market access under Honeywell ownership. We are very excited
about our growth potential in cyber security and warehouse automation, where we anticipate double-
digit growth for many years to come. Although we were very active in the M&A arena, we found the
environment to be a sellers’, not a buyers’, market. The multiples paid during the last two years are
about 2.5 points higher than the past averages, and one would need to revert to a period prior to the
2008-09 recession to see valuations at these levels. Our plan is to continue to be very active in M&A
activity but also to stay disciplined in our approach. We will see if the current pricing environment is the
“new reality” or simply a phase which will normalize. Either way, we will be active and may need to look
at more transactions to find the right ones for Honeywell. Although we prefer M&A,
if we are
unsuccessful in securing deals, we will opportunistically deploy cash to buy back shares as we did in
2017 and drive superior returns for our shareowners. In addition, we will continue to pay a competitive
dividend that grows roughly in line with our EPS.

Summary

In 2017, our accelerated organic growth rates reflected the very early returns from our key
initiatives such as commercial excellence, software growth, and customer experience enhancement.
We achieved this growth while leveraging our core capabilities in productivity, enabling further margin
expansion. We were also able to fund substantial restructuring projects to help us become much more
efficient. In keeping with our long-term approach, we focused on two things—growth and productivity.
We did the necessary work in 2017 to prepare for 2018 and beyond. Although we generated terrific
returns in 2017, I am very confident we can, and will, continue to drive superior shareowner value, just
like we did last year and have for the last 15 years.

Thank you for your continued confidence in Honeywell and for choosing to invest in us. Trust me,

you have not seen anything yet!

Sincerely,

DARIUS ADAMCZYK
President and Chief Executive Officer

3 Honeywell announced in December 2017 its intent to acquire a 25 percent ownership interest in FLUX Information Technology in China. This
acquisition closed at the end of January 2018. Honeywell will also form a new joint venture company with FLUX’s founder to serve
customers outside China. Honeywell will hold a 75 percent stake in the new joint venture, which will initially focus on opportunities in the Asia
Pacific region.

Competition

We are subject to competition in substantially all product and service areas. Some of our key

competitors are:

• Aerospace: Borg-Warner (automotive), Garmin, General Electric, Rockwell Collins, Thales and

United Technologies

• Home and Building Technologies: Emerson Electric, Itron, Johnson Controls, Schneider and

Siemens

• Performance Materials and Technologies: Albemarle, BASF, Dow, Dupont, Emerson and

Sinopec

• Safety and Productivity Solutions: 3M, Mine Safety Appliances (MSA), Kion Group, TE

Connectivity and Zebra Technologies

Our businesses compete on a variety of

factors such as price, quality, reliability, delivery,
customer service, performance, applied technology, product innovation and product recognition. Brand
identity, service to customers and quality are important competitive factors for our products and
services, and there is considerable price competition. Other competitive factors include breadth of
product line, research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability. While our
competitive position varies among our products and services, we believe we are a significant
competitor in each of our major product and service classes. Many of our competitors have substantial

2

financial resources and significant technological capabilities. In addition, some of our products compete
with the captive component divisions of OEMs.

Aerospace Sales

Our Aerospace segment sales were 36%, 38% and 39% of our total sales in 2017, 2016 and
2015. Our sales to commercial aerospace OEMs were 6%, 6% and 8% of our total sales in 2017, 2016
and 2015. In addition, our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and
services were 13%, 12% and 12% of our total sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015.

U.S. Government Sales

Sales to the U.S. Government (principally by Aerospace), acting through its various departments
and agencies and through prime contractors, amounted to $3,203 million, $3,330 million and $3,743
million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, which included sales to the U.S. Department of Defense, as a prime
contractor and subcontractor, of $2,546 million, $2,647 million and $2,680 million in 2017, 2016 and
2015. U.S. defense spending decreased in 2017 compared to 2016. We do not expect our overall
operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2018 federal defense
spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us (OEMs’
production, engineering development programs, aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul
programs), as well as our diversified commercial businesses.

Backlog

Our total backlog at December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $17,690 million and $17,277 million. We
anticipate that approximately $12,337 million of the 2017 backlog will be filled in 2018. We believe that
backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the
orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at
the customer’s option. The 2016 backlog
previously disclosed has been revised to apply the methodology used for the 2017 backlog and
excludes certain previously included amounts that do not meet the criteria for inclusion.

International Operations

We are engaged in manufacturing, sales, service and research and development (R&D) globally.
U.S. exports and non-U.S. manufactured products are significant to our operations. U.S. exports
comprised 12% of our total sales in 2017, 13% in 2016 and 14% in 2015. Non-U.S. manufactured
products and services, mainly in Europe and Asia, were 44% of our total sales in 2017, 43% in 2016
and 39% in 2015.

Information related to risks attendant to our foreign operations is included in Item 1A. Risk Factors

under the caption “Macroeconomic and Industry Risks.”

Raw Materials

The principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available. Although we
occasionally experience disruption in raw materials supply, we experienced no significant problems in
the purchase of key raw materials or commodities in 2017. We are not dependent on any one supplier
for a material amount of our raw materials.

The costs of certain key raw materials,

fluorspar, copper, ethylene and
perchloroethylene in Performance Materials and Technologies and nickel, steel, titanium and other
metals in Aerospace, are expected to continue to fluctuate. We will continue to attempt to offset raw

including R240,

3

material cost increases with formula or long-term supply agreements, price increases and hedging
activities where feasible. We do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any
material adverse impacts during 2018.

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Distribution Rights

Our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, or any
licenses or distribution rights. In our judgment, our intellectual property rights are adequate for the
conduct of our business. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents, trademarks
and licenses are generally important to our operations, but we do not consider any individual patent,
trademark or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of
material importance in relation to our total business.

Research and Development

The Company’s principal research and development activities are in the U.S., India, Europe, and
China. Research and development expense totaled $1,835 million, $1,864 million and $1,856 million in
2017, 2016 and 2015. R&D expense was 5% of sales in each of 2017, 2016 and 2015. Customer-
sponsored (principally by the U.S. Government) R&D activities amounted to an additional $876 million,
$967 million and $998 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Environment

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regarding
protection of human health and the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies,
practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental
damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with our business. Some risk of environmental
damage is, however, inherent in some of our operations and products, as it is with other companies
engaged in similar businesses.

We are and have been engaged in the handling, manufacturing, use and disposal of many
substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies. We believe that, as a general
matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of
environmental damage and personal injury, and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of
these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations. It is also possible
that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the
environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could
bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances.

Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal Superfund and similar
state and foreign laws and regulations, under which we have been designated as a potentially
responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating
sites and various hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency’s National Priority List. Although there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to
bear more than its proportional share of
is unable to obtain appropriate
contribution from other responsible parties, we do not anticipate having to bear significantly more than
our proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole.

the cleanup costs if

it

We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international
treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the
Company’s business or markets that it serves, nor on its results of operations, capital expenditures,
earnings, competitive position or
financial standing. We will continue to monitor emerging
developments in this area.

Employees

We have approximately 131,000 employees at December 31, 2017, of whom approximately

46,000 are located in the United States.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements

We describe many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in
Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and
in other parts of
this report (including this Item 1A). Such discussions contain forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that
management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. They

5

are based on management’s assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends,
current economic and industry conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors.
They are not guarantees of
future performance, and actual results, developments and business
decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements, including
with respect to any changes in or abandonment of the proposed spin-offs. We do not undertake to
update or revise any of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are also
subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near-and long-term.
These forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this
Form 10-K, including, in particular, the factors discussed below. These factors may be revised or
supplemented in subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.

Risk Factors

Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the principal risks
and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially
from recent results or from our anticipated future results.

Macroeconomic and Industry Risks

Industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating
conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services
and our results of operations.

• Aerospace—Operating results of Aerospace are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic
conditions, as well as changes in customer buying patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier
stability, factory transitions and capacity constraints. The operating results of our Commercial
Aviation business unit may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air
travel which impacts new aircraft production or the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders,
delays in launch schedules for new aircraft, the retirement of aircraft and global flying hours,
which impact air transport, regional, business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates.
Operating results could also be impacted by changes in overall trends related to end market
demand for the product portfolio, as well as, new entrants and non-traditional players entering
the market. Operating results in our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by the
mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs and by
compliance risks. Results may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit parts
into our global supply chain. Operating results in our Transportation Systems business unit may
be affected by the level of production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with
turbochargers, regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy,
growing importance of automotive electrification, consumer demand and spending for
automotive aftermarket products and delays in launch schedules for new automobile and truck
platforms.

• Home and Building Technologies—Operating results may be adversely impacted by
downturns in the level of global residential and commercial construction activity (including
retrofits and upgrades), lower capital spending and operating expenditures on building projects,
less industrial plant expansion, changes in the competitive landscape including new market
entrants and new technologies, and fluctuations in inventory levels in distribution channels.

• Performance Materials and Technologies—Operating results may be adversely impacted by
industrial, refining, petrochemical and semi-
downturns in capacity utilization for chemical,
conductor plants, our customers’ availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion,
raw material demand and supply volatility, product commoditization, and our ability to maximize
our facilities’ production capacity and minimize downtime. In particular, the volatility in oil and
natural gas prices have and will continue to impact our customers’ operating levels and capital
spending and thus demand for our products and services.

• Safety and Productivity Solutions—Operating results may be adversely impacted by
downturns in the level of global capital spending and operating expenditures, including in the

6

oil and gas industry, reduced investments in process automation, safety monitoring, and plant
capacity utilization initiatives, fluctuations in retail markets, lower customer demand due to the
failure to anticipate and respond to overall trends related to end market demand, changes in the
competitive landscape including new market entrants and technology that may lead to product
commoditization, and adverse industry economic conditions, all of which could result in lower
market share, reduced selling prices and lower margins.

An increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is
subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of
international operations.

Our international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Company’s
sales. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price
controls, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and
other trade restrictions (such as sanctions and embargoes), violations by our employees of anti-
corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate these risks), changes in regulations regarding
transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, and
our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these
regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment, including the
United Kingdom referendum in favor of exiting the European Union and the evolving international and
domestic political, regulatory and economic landscape, the potential for changes in global trade policies
including sanctions and trade barriers, trends such as populism, economic nationalism and negative
sentiment toward multinational companies, and the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and
often conflicting regulations worldwide can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing
or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and
maintain acceptable operating margins.

Operating outside of the United States also exposes us to foreign exchange risk, which we monitor
and seek to reduce through hedging activities. However, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a
financial cost and may not always be available to us or be successful
in eliminating such volatility.
Finally, we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the United States that is invested with
financial and non-financial counterparties. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global
cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our
operations and commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact
business could expose Honeywell to financial loss.

Risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of
operations and cash flow.

Significant changes in actual

investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other
factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future
periods. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns
can result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses which we record in the fourth quarter of each
fiscal year, and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. With
regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent
upon interest rates, actual
investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or
regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations.

Operational Risks

Raw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery
requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services,
impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant
liabilities.

The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in Performance
fluorspar, copper, ethylene and perchloroethylene) and in

Materials and Technologies (R240,

7

Aerospace (nickel, steel, titanium and other metals). Our inability to offset material price inflation
through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers,
productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations.

Many major components, product equipment items and raw materials, particularly in Aerospace,
are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-source basis. Although we maintain a qualification
and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and
components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases
may have in the future. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be
constrained by our suppliers’ inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products
during times of volatile demand. Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to
fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced
sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships.

We may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, and
divestitures may not occur as planned.

We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek
to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a
timely basis, or at all, and during integration we may discover cybersecurity and compliance issues. In
addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of
acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, including risk of impairment; (ii) the failure to
integrate multiple acquired businesses into Honeywell simultaneously and on schedule and/or to
achieve expected synergies; (iii) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on
satisfactory terms and conditions; and (iv) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, labor relations
difficulties or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections,
insurance or indemnities, or with regard to divested businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we
have provided contractual indemnification.

The proposed spin-offs of our Homes and Global Distribution business and of our
Transportation Systems business into two stand-alone, publicly-traded companies are each
contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions, may not be completed on the
currently contemplated timeline, or at all, and may not achieve the intended benefits.

On October 10, 2017, the Company announced its intention to separately spin-off our Homes and
Global Distribution business, which is part of our Home and Building Technologies segment, and our
Transportation Systems business, which is part of our Aerospace segment, into two stand-alone,
publicly-traded companies. Completion of each proposed spin-off is subject to readiness of each spin-
off to operate as an independent public company, finalization of the financial statements of the spun-off
business, assurance that the separation will be tax-free to our shareowners for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, finalization of the capital structure of the three corporations, the effectiveness of appropriate
filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, final approval of the Board of Directors, and
other customary matters. Each proposed spin-off
is complex in nature, and may be affected by
unanticipated developments, credit and equity markets, or changes in market conditions. These or
other unanticipated developments could delay or prevent the proposed spin-offs or cause the proposed
spin-offs to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable than anticipated, including without
limitation, the failure to qualify as tax-free to our shareowners, and the inability of the two spun-off
companies to incur sufficient
indebtedness to allow for a distribution to Honeywell of proceeds
concurrently with the consummation of the spin-offs or to make ongoing cash contributions towards the
satisfaction of certain of our legacy asbestos and environmental remediation liabilities. Furthermore, if
the spin-offs are completed, we cannot assure you that each will be successful
in meeting its
objectives. There is the potential for business disruption and significant separation costs. Any of these
factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,
cash flows and/or the price of our common stock.

Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and
introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets
with acceptable margins.

Our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify and
evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trends in our target end-markets, (ii) develop
and maintain competitive products, (iii) defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of
competitors including many new and non-traditional competitors, (iv) enhance our products by adding
innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent
commoditization of our products, (v) develop, manufacture and bring compelling new products to
market quickly and cost-effectively,
(vi) monitor disruptive technologies and business models,
(vii) achieve sufficient return on investment for new products introduced based on capital expenditures
and research and development spending, (viii) respond to changes in overall trends related to end
market demand, and (x) attract, develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise
and understanding of customers’ needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products.

The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive
revenues and adversely affect our

offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our
competitive standing and prospects.

Failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an
inability to successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our
workforce, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses.

Our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable
improvements.
In addition, we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning
actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive
regions and product
line rationalizations. Risks associated with these actions include delays in
execution of the planned initiatives, additional unexpected costs, realization of fewer than estimated
productivity improvements and adverse effects on employee morale. We may not realize the full
operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these
actions may potentially disrupt our operations. In addition, organizational changes, attrition,
labor
relations difficulties, or workforce stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business,
reputation, financial position and results of operations.

As a supplier to the U.S. Government, we are subject to unique risks, such as the right of
the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and
investigations of our operations and performance.

U.S. Government contracts are subject

for
the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of

the
convenience of
the
applicable contract. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are also subject to government audits that
may recommend downward price adjustments and other changes. When appropriate and prudent, we
have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future.

to termination by the government, either

We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with
government procurement regulations. If, as a result of any such investigation or other government
investigations (including investigation of violations of certain environmental, employment or export
laws), Honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law, then it could be
suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from
contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges
suspended.

Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of
material environmental liabilities.

Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to
liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of

potentially material

9

personal
injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and
exposures. We continue to incur remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination
and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past
production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional
lawsuits, claims and costs
involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. Various federal, state, local
and foreign governments regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and can impose
substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly equipment or
operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous
substance releases.
the
discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual
sites,
to certain
contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require
us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or
results of operations.

Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and
confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.

Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to
gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted
measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its customers
and/or its third party service providers, including cloud providers. Our customers, including the U.S.
government, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity
standards in our products, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. While
we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none
of them to date have been material to the Company. We seek to deploy comprehensive measures to
deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls,
data protection, vulnerability assessments, product software designs which we believe are less
susceptible to cyber attacks, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance
of backup and protective systems. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their
in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or
nature and scope, could potentially result
unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of
third
parties) and the disruption of business operations. Cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software
imbedded in our products could lead to third party claims that our product failures have caused a
similar range of damages to our customers, and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected
nature of our products. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident
include
financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual property, fines levied
by the Federal Trade Commission, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development
and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing
sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and
results of operations.

Data privacy, identity protection, and information security may require significant resources
and presents certain risks.

We collect, store, have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data,
including proprietary business information, personal data and other information that
to
privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed controls. Despite our efforts to protect
such data, we may be vulnerable to material security breaches,
theft, misplaced or lost data,
programming errors, or employee errors that could potentially lead to the compromising of such data,
improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure,
modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational
disruptions. In addition, we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially
conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we
operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions
while ensuring the data is secure. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the

regular operation of our business, and violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational
damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial
statements.

A material disruption of our operations, particularly at our manufacturing facilities or within
our information technology infrastructure, could adversely affect our business.

Our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject
to catastrophic loss due to natural disasters including hurricanes and floods, power outages, fires,
explosions, terrorism, equipment failures, sabotage, adverse weather conditions, public health crises,
labor disputes, critical supply failure,
inaccurate downtime forecast, political disruption, and other
reasons, which can result

relationships with customers. We employ information technology systems and networks to support the
business and rely on them to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or
support a variety of business processes and activities. Disruptions to our information technology
infrastructure from system failures, shutdowns, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures,
and other events, including disruptions at our cloud computing, server, systems and other third party IT
service providers, could interfere with our operations, interrupt production and shipments, damage
customer and business partner relationships, and negatively impact our reputation.

in undesirable consequences,

including financial

Legal and Regulatory Risks

Our U.S. and non-U.S. tax liabilities are dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income
among various jurisdictions in which we operate.

Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as
a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax
laws, regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof), changes in generally
accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes
in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of
previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other
governmental enforcement initiatives. Our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects
other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company which
could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Changes in tax laws or regulations, including
further regulatory developments arising from U.S. tax reform legislation as well as multi-jurisdictional
changes enacted in response to the action items provided by the Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD), will increase tax uncertainty and impact our provision for income
taxes.

Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact
on our results of operations.

The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations
including safety, performance and product certification regulations. Within Aerospace, the operating
results of Commercial Original Equipment and Commercial Aftermarket may be impacted by, among
other things, mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory
bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft. Our Defense and Space business unit may be
affected by changes in government procurement regulations, while emissions,
fuel economy and
energy efficiency standards for motor vehicles can impact Transportation Systems. Within Home and
Building Technologies, the demand for and cost of providing products, services and solutions can be
impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and
regulations. Performance Materials and Technologies’ results of operations can be impacted by
environmental standards, regulations, and judicial determinations. Growth in all our businesses within
emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employees
where local employment
law mandates may be restrictive. Noncompliance with legislation and
regulations can result in fines and penalties.

11

We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings
and other contingencies and uncertainties.

We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve
substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to
commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions
and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, import and
export, and environmental, health and safety matters. Our potential
liabilities are subject to change
over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary
requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be
adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. The incurrence of significant
liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of
operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.

Honeywell’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Market and dividend
information for Honeywell’s common stock is included in Note 24 Unaudited Quarterly Financial
Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The number of record holders of our common stock at December 31, 2017 was 47,678.

Information regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is
included in Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related

In December 2017,

Honeywell purchased 10,300,000 shares of its common stock, par value $1 per share, in the
quarter ending December 31, 2017.
the Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to a total of $8 billion of Honeywell common stock, which included amounts remaining
under and replaced the previously approved share repurchase program. $7.7 billion remained available
as of as of December 31, 2017 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to
repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to generally offset the dilutive impact of employee
stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching
contributions under our savings plans. Additionally, we seek to reduce share count via share
repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. The amount and timing of future repurchases
may vary depending on market conditions and the level of our operating, financing and other investing
activities.

Performance Graph

The following graph compares the five-year cumulative total return on our common stock to the
total returns on the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 Stock Index and a composite of S&P’s Industrial
Conglomerates and Aerospace and Defense indices, on a 65%/35% weighted basis (the Composite
Index). The weighting of the components of the Composite Index are based on our segments’ relative
contribution to total segment profit. The selection of the Industrial Conglomerates component of the
Composite Index reflects the diverse and distinct range of non-aerospace businesses conducted by
Honeywell. The annual changes for the five-year period shown in the graph are based on the
assumption that $100 had been invested in Honeywell stock and each index on December 31, 2012
and that all dividends were reinvested.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

Results of Operations

(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition
of Honeywell International Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (“Honeywell” or “the Company”) for the
three years ended December 31, 2017. All references to Notes relate to Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

In October 2017, the Company announced the results of a comprehensive portfolio review which
included the announcement of our intent to spin-off our Homes and Global Distribution business, as
well as our Transportation Systems business, into two stand-alone, publicly traded companies.

Effective October 2017, we realigned the Smart Energy business, previously part of the Home and
Building Technologies segment, into the Process Solutions business within the Performance Materials
and Technologies segment. Effective July 2016, the Company realigned the business units comprising
its Automation and Control Solutions segment by forming two new segments: Home and Building
Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions. These realignments have no impact on the
Company’s historical consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Prior period
amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period segment presentation.

On October 1, 2016, the Company completed the tax-free spin-off of its Resins and Chemicals
business, part of Performance Materials and Technologies, into a standalone, publicly-traded company
(named AdvanSix Inc. (“AdvanSix”)) to Honeywell shareowners. The assets and liabilities associated
with AdvanSix have been removed from the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
the
effective date of the spin-off. The results of operations for AdvanSix are included in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations through the effective date of the spin-off.

On September 16, 2016, the Company completed the sale of the Aerospace government services
business, Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. (“HTSI” or “government services business”). The
assets and liabilities associated with HTSI have been removed from the Company’s Consolidated
Balance Sheet as of the effective date of the sale. The results of operations for HTSI are included in
the Consolidated Statement of Operations through the effective date of the sale.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

During 2017, Honeywell continued to successfully deliver on its financial commitments while still
creating long-term value for our shareowners. We grew net sales 3% to $40,534 million and grew
income before taxes 7% to $6,902 million. The improvement in year over year income before taxes
was attributable to both organic sales growth as well as operational
improvements that increased
operating margins. We believe our ability to consistently grow earnings derives from the consistent,
rigorous deployment of the Honeywell Operating System as well as a long history of identifying and
investing in productivity initiatives. We have made concerted efforts to revitalize our commercial
excellence processes, such as Velocity Product Development (“VPD”), which enables higher organic
revenue at better margins.

We are careful to not allow the attainment of short-term financial results imperil the creation of
long-term, sustainable shareowner value. Hence, as part of the announcement in October 2017 of the
results of our portfolio review, we affirmed our commitment to a strategy and investments that are
intended to enable us to become one of the world’s leading software industrial companies. Our
refocused strategy and investments are intended to take better advantage of our core technological
and software strengths in high growth businesses that participate in six attractive industrial end
markets. Each of these end markets is characterized by favorable global mega-trends including energy
efficiency, infrastructure investment, urbanization and safety.

17

In 2017 we deployed capital of over $6 billion, including the following:
• Share Repurchases—we continue to repurchase our shares with the goal of keeping share
count flat by offsetting the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation and savings
plans. Additionally, we seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive
opportunities arise. In 2017, we repurchased 20.5 million shares for $2.9 billion.

• Dividend—In 2017, we paid cash dividends of $2.1 billion and increased our annual dividend
rate by 12%, as we seek to continue to grow the dividend faster than earnings. Since 2010, we
have increased the dividend rate by 10% or more eight times.

• Capital Investment in Facilities—we invested over $1 billion in capital expenditures focused

on high return projects.

Cost of products and services sold increased in 2017 compared with 2016 principally due to
increased direct material costs of approximately $290 million (driven by higher sales volume and
acquisitions partially offset by divestitures and productivity, net of inflation), higher repositioning and
other charges of approximately $260 million and higher depreciation and amortization of approximately
$90 million, partially offset by higher pension and other postretirement benefits income, and lower
pension mark-to-market expense, allocated to cost of products and services sold of approximately
$110 million, and decreased indirect material costs of approximately $70 million.

Gross margin percentage increased in 2017 compared with 2016 principally due to higher gross
margin in Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies (approximately 1.7 percentage
point impact collectively) and higher pension and other postretirement benefits income and lower
pension market to market expense allocated to cost of products and services sold (approximately
0.3 percentage point impact), partially offset by higher repositioning and other charges (approximately

and Productivity Solutions (approximately 0.3 percentage point impact collectively).

Cost of products and services sold increased in 2016 compared with 2015 principally due to
increased direct material costs of approximately $380 million (driven primarily by acquisitions, net of
divestitures, partially offset by the favorable impact of productivity, net of inflation, and foreign currency
translation), higher depreciation and amortization attributable to acquisitions of approximately
$135 million and increased pension mark-to-market expense allocated to cost of products and
services sold of $70 million, partially offset by higher pension and other postretirement benefits income
allocated to cost of products and services sold of $200 million.

Gross margin percentage increased in 2016 compared with 2015 principally due to higher gross
margin in Performance Materials and Technologies (approximately 0.2 percentage point impact) and
higher pension and other postretirement benefits income allocated to cost of products and services
sold (approximately 0.5 percentage point impact), partially offset by lower gross margin in Aerospace,
Home and Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions an (approximately
0.3 percentage point impact collectively) and increased pension mark-to-market expense allocated
to cost of products and services sold (approximately 0.2 percentage point impact).

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) that instituted
fundamental changes to the U.S. tax system. The Tax Act includes changes to the taxation of foreign
earnings by implementing a dividend exemption system, expansion of the current anti-deferral rules, a
minimum tax on low-taxed foreign earnings and new measures to deter base erosion. The Tax Act also
permanently reduces the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%,
imposes a one-time mandatory
transition tax on the historical earnings of foreign affiliates and implements a territorial style tax system.
The impacts of these changes are reflected in the 2017 tax expense which resulted in a provisional
charge of approximately $3.8 billion, which is subject to adjustment given the provisional nature of the
charge. This resulted in an effective tax rate higher than the statutory rate in 2017.

The effective tax rates for 2016 and 2015 were lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily

due to lower tax rates on non-U.S. earnings.

The Company currently expects the effective tax rate for 2018 to be in the range of 22.0% and
23.0%. The effective tax rate may vary from quarter to quarter due to unusual or infrequently occurring
items, the resolution of income tax audits, changes in tax laws, the tax impact from employee share-
based payments, taxes incurred in connection to the territorial style tax system, or other items such as
pension mark-to-market adjustments.

Earnings per share of common stock–assuming dilution decreased in 2017 compared with 2016
primarily driven by additional
income tax expense from the Tax Act, higher repositioning and other
charges, partially offset by higher segment profit across all segments, lower pension mark-to-market
expense and increased pension and other postretirement income.

Earnings per share of common stock–assuming dilution increased in 2016 compared with 2015
primarily driven by increased pension and other postretirement income, higher segment profit in Home
and Building Technologies and Performance Materials and Technologies, the gain related to the
Honeywell Technology Solutions,
Inc. divestiture, a decrease in the weighted average shares
outstanding and the tax benefit from adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB)
accounting standard related to employee share-based payment accounting, partially offset by lower
segment profit in Aerospace and Safety and Productivity Solutions, increased pension mark-to-market
expense and higher repositioning and other charges.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Our consolidated results are principally impacted by:
• Changes in global economic growth rates and industry conditions and demand in our key end

markets;

• The impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (in particular the Euro), relative to

the U.S. Dollar;

• The extent to which cost savings from productivity actions are able to offset or exceed the

impact of material and non-material inflation;

• The impact of the pension discount rate and asset returns on pension expense, including mark-

to-market adjustments, and funding requirements; and

• The impact from the Tax Act.
Our 2018 areas of focus, most of which are applicable to each of our segments include:
• Driving profitable organic growth through R&D and technological excellence to deliver innovative
products that customers value and expansion and localization of our footprint in high growth
regions;

• Executing on our strategy to become a software-industrial company, which for us means

products and services that facilitate the connected plane, home, building and factory;

• Expanding margins by maintaining and improving the Company’s cost structure through
manufacturing and administrative process improvements, repositioning, and other productivity
actions;

• Executing disciplined, rigorous M&A and integration processes to deliver growth through

acquisitions;

• Ensuring the successful completion of

the proposed spin-offs of our Homes and Global
Distribution business, as well as our Transportation Systems business, into two stand-alone,
publicly traded companies;

• Controlling corporate costs, including costs incurred for asbestos and environmental matters,

pension and other post-retirement benefits;

• Increasing availability of capital through strong cash flow conversion from effective working
capital management and proactively managing debt levels to enable the Company to smartly

20

deploy capital for strategic acquisitions, dividends, share repurchases and capital expenditures;
and

• Aligning our operating structure to benefit from the territorial tax system being implemented by

the Tax Act.

2017 compared with 2016

Aerospace sales were flat due to organic sales growth, offset by the government services

business divestiture.

• Commercial Original Equipment sales decreased 2% (decreased 2% organic) primarily due to
lower shipments to business jet OEMs, partially offset by lower air transport and regional OEM
incentives.

• Commercial Aftermarket sales increased 6% (increased 6% organic) primarily driven by higher

repair and overhaul activities and increased spares shipments.

• Defense and Space sales decreased 7% (increased 1% organic) primarily due to the
government services business divestiture and lower Space sales, partially offset by growth in
U.S. defense.

• Transportation Systems sales increased 3% (increased 2% organic) primarily driven by higher
from foreign

commercial vehicle volumes, gas turbo penetration and the favorable impact
currency translation, partially offset by lower diesel turbo volumes.

Aerospace segment profit increased due to an increase in operational segment profit, partially
offset by the government services business divestiture. The increase in operational segment profit was
driven primarily by productivity, net of inflation, including restructuring benefits, lower OEM incentives
and higher organic sales volume, partially offset by the government services business divestiture. Cost
of products and services sold decreased primarily driven by the government services business
divestiture and productivity, net of inflation, partially offset by higher organic sales volume.

2016 compared with 2015

Aerospace sales decreased primarily due to higher OEM incentives, a decrease in organic sales
volumes and the government services business divestiture, which was partially offset by growth from
acquisitions.

• Commercial Original Equipment sales decreased by 13% (decreased 12% organic) primarily
due to higher OEM incentives and decreased demand from business and general aviation
original equipment manufacturers, partially offset by higher shipments to air transport OEMs.
• Commercial Aftermarket sales increased by 3% (increased 3% organic) primarily driven by

higher repair and overhaul activities and increased spares shipments.

• Defense and Space sales decreased by 7% (decreased 6% organic) primarily due to declines in
lower U.S. government services revenue,
U.S. space and international defense programs,
largely attributable to the impact of divestitures, and decreased demand from commercial
helicopter OEMs, partially offset by sales from acquisitions.

• Transportation Systems sales increased by 3% (increased 4% organic) primarily driven by new

platform launches and higher global turbo gas penetration.

Aerospace segment profit decreased primarily due to a 6% decrease in operational segment profit
and a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. The decrease in operational segment
profit was primarily due to product mix, higher OEM incentives and lower sales volumes, partially offset
by productivity and price, net of inflation. Cost of products and services sold decreased primarily driven
by productivity, net of
inflation, and lower sales volumes, partially offset by acquisitions, net of
divestitures.

Repositioning Charges

See Note 3 Repositioning and Other Charges of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a
discussion of our repositioning actions and related charges incurred in 2017, 2016 and 2015. These
repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pre-tax savings of $300 million in 2018
compared with 2017 principally from planned workforce reductions. Cash spending related to our
repositioning actions was $177 million, $228 million and $118 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, and was
funded through operating cash flows. In 2018, we expect cash spending for repositioning actions to be
approximately $250 million and to be funded through operating cash flows.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the
primary source of liquidity. In addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, additional
sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper market,
long-term borrowings, access to the public debt and equity markets and the ability to access non-U.S.
cash as a result of
the Tax Act. We continue to balance our cash and financing uses through
investment in our existing core businesses, acquisition activity, share repurchases and dividends.

Cash Flow Summary

Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated

Statement of Cash Flows, are summarized as follows:

2017 compared with 2016

Cash provided by operating activities increased by $468 million primarily due to a $504 million
increase in segment profit and a $294 million favorable impact from working capital (favorable accounts
payable partially offset by inventory and accounts receivable), partially offset by higher cash tax
payments of $609 million.

Cash used for investing activities increased by $232 million primarily due to (i) a net $2,056 million
increase in investments, primarily short-term marketable securities, (ii) an increase of $500 million of
settlement payments of foreign currency exchange contracts used as economic hedges on certain non-
functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and (iii) a decrease in proceeds from
the sales of businesses of $296 million (most significantly Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. in
2016), partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $2,491 million (most significantly
Intelligrated in 2016).

Cash used for financing activities increased by $3,862 million primarily due to a decrease in the
net proceeds from debt issuances of $2,827 million, an increase in net repurchases of common stock
of $699 million and an increase in cash dividends paid of $204 million.

Cash used for investing activities decreased by $3,172 million primarily due to (i) a decrease in
cash paid for acquisitions of $2,655 million, most significantly Elster in 2015, (ii) an increase in
proceeds from the sales of businesses of $295 million (most significantly Honeywell Technology
Solutions Inc.) and (iii) a $384 million favorable change in settlements of foreign currency exchange
contracts used as economic hedges on certain non-functional currency denominated monetary assets
and liabilities. The decreases were partially offset by a net $146 million increase in investments,
primarily short-term marketable securities.

Cash provided by financing activities increased by $309 million primarily due to an increase in the
net proceeds from debt issuances of $497 million, partially offset by an increase in cash dividends paid
of $189 million including amounts paid to the former UOP Russell LLC noncontrolling shareholder.

Liquidity

Each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to increase operating cash flows
through revenue growth, margin expansion and improved working capital turnover. Considering the
current economic environment in which each of the businesses operate and their business plans and
strategies, including the focus on growth, cost reduction and productivity initiatives, we believe that
cash balances and operating cash flow will continue to be our principal source of liquidity. In addition to
the available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit
lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper markets, long-term borrowings, and access to the
public debt and equity markets.

We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a
daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield of those
funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any
one of these entities.

A source of liquidity is our ability to issue short-term debt in the commercial paper market.
Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from
date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate
purposes as well as for financing acquisitions. The weighted average interest rate on short-term
borrowings and commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2017 was (0.17%) and as of
December 31, 2016 was (0.13%).

Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is
affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our credit ratings are periodically
reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of December 31, 2017, Standard and
Poor’s (S&P), Fitch, and Moody’s have ratings on our long-term debt of A, A and A2 and short-term
debt of A-1, F1 and P1. S&P, Fitch and Moody’s have Honeywell’s rating outlook as “stable.” To date,
the Company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity.

We also have a current shelf registration statement

filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock and preferred stock
that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net
proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes,
including repayment of
existing indebtedness, share repurchases, capital expenditures and acquisitions.

See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 12 Long-term Debt and Credit Agreements of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of items impacting our liquidity.

In 2017, the Company repurchased $2,889 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive
impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting
and matching contributions under our savings plans. Additionally, we sought to reduce share count via
share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arose. In December 2017, the Board of
Directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $8 billion of Honeywell common stock, of which
$7.7 billion remained available as of December 31, 2017 for additional share repurchases. This
authorization included amounts remaining under and replaced the previously approved share
repurchase program. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to
time to generally offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including
option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. We will
continue to seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities
arise.

At December 31, 2017, a substantial portion of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were
held by foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company no longer intends to permanently
reinvest its historical foreign earnings and plans to repatriate at least $7 billion of such earnings to the
U.S. over the next two years.

27

In addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will
be to fund capital expenditures, dividends, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, employee benefit
obligations, environmental remediation costs, asbestos claims, severance and exit costs related to
repositioning actions and debt repayments.

Specifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2018 to be as follows:
• Capital expenditures—we expect to spend approximately $900 million for capital expenditures in
2018 primarily for growth, production and capacity expansion, cost reduction, maintenance, and
replacement.

• Share repurchases—under the Company’s share repurchase program, $7.7 billion is available
as of December 31, 2017 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to
repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-
based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching
contributions under our savings plans. Additionally, we will seek to reduce share count via share
repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. The amount and timing of
future
repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and our level of operating, financing and
other investing activities.

• Dividends—we increased our quarterly dividend rate by 12% to $.745 per share of common
stock effective with the fourth quarter 2017 dividend. The Company intends to continue to pay
quarterly dividends in 2018.

• Asbestos claims—we expect our cash spending for asbestos claims and our cash receipts for

related insurance recoveries to be approximately $350 million and $24 million in 2018.

• Pension contributions—in 2018, we are not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension
plans. We plan to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately
$140 million ($99 million of marketable securities were contributed in January 2018) to our non-
U.S. plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. The timing and amount of contributions to
both our U.S. and non-U.S. plans may be impacted by a number of factors, including the funded
status of the plans.

• Repositioning actions—we expect

that cash spending for severance and other exit costs

necessary to execute repositioning actions will be approximately $250 million in 2018.

• Environmental remediation costs—we expect to spend approximately $225 million in 2018 for

remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs.

• Spin-off separation costs—we expect to incur significant cash expenditures associated with the
announced spin-off transactions, including third party professional services and tax costs, the
amounts of which are still being determined.

We continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit,
market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and
identify business units that will most benefit
from increased investment. We identify acquisition
candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. We also
identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position,
relative profitability or growth potential. These businesses are considered for potential divestiture,
restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints. In 2016, we realized $565
million in cash proceeds from sales and a spin-off of non-strategic businesses.

Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will
be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Our available cash, committed credit lines and
access to the public debt and equity markets, provide additional sources of short-term and long-term
liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities.

Environmental Matters

Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were $287 million,
$195 million and $194 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015. In addition, in 2017 and 2016 we incurred
operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $82 million and $83 million relating to
compliance with environmental regulations.

Spending related to known environmental matters was $212 million, $228 million and $273 million
in 2017, 2016 and 2015 and is estimated to be approximately $225 million in 2018. We expect to fund
these environmental matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash
expenditures for
expenditures depends on several
litigation and settlements of
remediation liability, personal
injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup
projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreement with other
parties.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to
make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.
We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial
statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences
could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Contingent Liabilities—We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some
of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business
operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions,
government contracts, product
liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures,
employee benefit plans, intellectual property, legal and environmental, health and safety matters.
We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as
well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these
contingencies based on a thorough analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel
and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as
the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of
pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most
contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new
developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases
through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. See
Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a

30

discussion of management’s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our
environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies.

Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries—Honeywell’s involvement

in
asbestos related personal
injury actions relates to two predecessor companies. Regarding North
American Refractories Company (“NARCO”) asbestos related claims, we accrued for pending claims
based on terms and conditions in agreements with NARCO, its former parent company, and certain
asbestos claimants, and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for
bankruptcy protection. We also accrued for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos related
claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust. The estimate of future NARCO claims was
prepared in 2002, in the same year NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection, using NARCO tort system
litigation experience based on a commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy
courts addressing 524(g) trusts. Accordingly, the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos claims
was prepared before there was data on claims filings and payment rates in the NARCO Trust under the
Trust Distribution Procedures and also prepared when the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims was in
effect (which remained in effect until NARCO emerged from Bankruptcy protection). Some critical
assumptions underlying this commonly accepted methodology included claims filing rates, disease
criteria and payment values contained in the Trust Distribution Procedures, estimated approval rates of
claims submitted to the NARCO Trust and epidemiological studies estimating disease instances. The
estimated value of the future NARCO liability reflects claims expected to be asserted against NARCO
over a fifteen year period. This projection resulted in a range of estimated liability of $743 million to
$961 million. We believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount
and accordingly, we have recorded the minimum amount in the range. Given the Trust’s lack of
sufficient claims processing experience since NARCO emerged from bankruptcy protection, it is not yet
possible to reliably estimate future claim costs based on actual Trust experience. Regarding Bendix
Friction Materials (“Bendix”) asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending
claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We also accrued for the estimated
value of future anticipated claims related to Bendix for the next five years based on historic claims filing
experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort
system for the previous five years. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections,
as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a
reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years.

In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos
related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance
recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and
consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding
insurers. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual
carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. Projecting
future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos
related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty
in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance
recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant
factors that may impact future insurance recoveries.

See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
a discussion of management’s judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestos-
related liabilities and related insurance recoveries.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans—We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S.
defined benefit pension plans. For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension (income) expense
is calculated annually based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan
obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Changes in the discount rate and
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension (income)
expense amount. Annual pension (income) expense is comprised of service and interest cost,
assumed return on plan assets, prior service amortization (Pension Ongoing (Income) Expense) and a
potential mark-to-market adjustment (MTM Adjustment).

31

The key assumptions used in developing our 2017, 2016 and 2015 net periodic pension (income)

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The MTM Adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10%
of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation (the corridor).
Net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various
assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change. The primary factors
contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension
obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual
returns on plan assets. The mark-to-market accounting method results in the potential for volatile and
difficult to forecast MTM Adjustments. MTM charges were $87 million, $273 million and $67 million in
2017, 2016 and 2015.

We determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset
returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and
asset mix considerations (see Note 20 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset
allocation percentages for our pension plans). We plan to continue to use an expected rate of return on
plan assets of 7.75% for 2018 as this is a long-term rate based on historical plan asset returns over
varying long term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and the asset
mix of the plan’s investments.

The discount rate reflects the market rate on December 31 (measurement date) for high-quality
fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to
change each year. The discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon
prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. We used a 3.68% discount rate to determine
benefit obligations as of December 31, 2017, reflecting the decrease in the market interest rate
environment since the prior year-end.

In addition to the potential for MTM Adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan
assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing (income)
expense. The following table highlights the sensitivity of our U.S. pension obligations and ongoing
(income) expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant.
These estimates exclude any potential MTM Adjustment:

Pension ongoing income for all of our pension plans is expected to be approximately $984 million
in 2018 compared with pension ongoing income of $713 million in 2017. The expected increase is

32

primarily due to higher asset returns in 2017 in our U.S. and UK plans. Also, if required, an MTM
Adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 in accordance with our pension accounting
method as previously described. It is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a MTM
Adjustment in 2018, and if one is required, what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. MTM
Adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company
such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets.

Long-Lived Assets (including Tangible and Finite-Lived Intangible Assets)—The determina-
tion of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not tangible and intangible
assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which
could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from
such estimates and assumptions. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-
lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-
lived asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors in considering when to perform an
impairment review are as follows:

• Significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or

product line in relation to expectations;

• Annual operating plans or five-year strategic plans that

indicate an unfavorable trend in

operating performance of a business or product line;
• Significant negative industry or economic trends; or
• Significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets.
Once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured
by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash
flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping
is considered to be impaired. The impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying
amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. We endeavor to utilize the best information available to
measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 of the fair value
hierarchy, or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key
estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include assumptions as to expected industry and
business growth rates, sales volume, selling prices and costs, cash flows, and the discount rate
selected. These estimates are subject to changes in the economic environment, including market
interest rates and expected volatility. Management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair
values are reasonable; however, changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could
materially affect the valuations.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing—Goodwill and intangible
assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual, or more frequent if
necessary, impairment testing. In testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value is
estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year
strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions. These impairment tests
involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact
our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and
assumptions. To address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and
assumptions.

Income Taxes—On a recurring basis, we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our
deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence, such as past operating
results, projections of future taxable income, enacted tax law changes and the feasibility and impact of
tax planning initiatives. Our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and
assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of
taxable temporary differences.

Sales Recognition on Long-Term Contracts—In 2017, we recognized approximately 16% of
our total net sales using the percentage-of-completion method for long-term contracts. These long-term
contracts are measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-
delivery basis for production-type contracts. Accounting for these contracts involves management

33

judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost. Contract revenues are largely determined by
negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options,
change orders,
incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price
adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Contract costs are incurred over a
period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management
judgment. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms,
historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these
estimates include inflationary trends,
internal and subcontractor
performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements.
Revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances.
Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. We
maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to
reduce the risk of contract losses.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Accounting Principles—The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The
following is a description of Honeywell’s significant accounting policies.

Principles of Consolidation—The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Honeywell International Inc. and all of its subsidiaries and entities in which a controlling interest is
maintained. Our consolidation policy requires equity investments that we exercise significant influence
over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee’s activities to be
accounted for using the equity method.
Investments through which we are not able to exercise
significant influence over the investee and which we do not have readily determinable fair values are
accounted for under the cost method. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in
consolidation.

Property, Plant and Equipment—Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including
any asset retirement obligations, less accumulated depreciation. For financial reporting, the straight-
line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 50 years for buildings and
improvements and 2 to 16 years for machinery and equipment. Recognition of the fair value of
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal
obligation to incur such costs. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost is capitalized as part of the
related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding asset’s useful life.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets—Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of March 31, and whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This testing compares
carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to
fair value. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2017 and determined
that there was no impairment as of that date.

Other Intangible Assets with Determinable Lives—Other intangible assets with determinable
lives consist of customer lists, technology, patents and trademarks and other intangibles and are
amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 24 years.

Sales Recognition—Product and service sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, pricing is fixed or
determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Service sales, principally representing repair,
maintenance and engineering activities are recognized over the contractual period or as services are
rendered. Sales under long-term contracts are recorded on a percentage-of-completion method
measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for
production-type contracts. Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded in full
when such losses become evident. Revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements are
recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element provided the
delivered elements have value to customers on a standalone basis. Amounts allocated to each
element are based on its objectively determined fair value, such as the sales price for the product or
service when it is sold separately or competitor prices for similar products or services.

Environmental—We accrue costs related to environmental matters when it is probable that we
have incurred a liability related to a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
For additional information, see Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies.

Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries—We recognize a liability for any
asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. In connection
with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance
recoveries that are deemed probable. For additional
information, see Note 19 Commitments and
Contingencies.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Aerospace Sales Incentives—We provide sales incentives to commercial aircraft manufacturers
and airlines in connection with their selection of our aircraft equipment, predominately wheel and
braking system hardware, avionics, and auxiliary power units, for installation on commercial aircraft.
These incentives consist of free or deeply discounted products, credits for future purchases of product
and upfront cash payments. These costs are recognized in the period incurred as cost of products sold
or as a reduction to sales, as appropriate.

Research and Development—Research and development costs for company-sponsored
research and development projects are expensed as incurred. Such costs are principally included in
cost of products sold and were $1,835 million, $1,864 million and $1,856 million in 2017, 2016 and
2015. The 2016 research and development costs previously disclosed have been revised to reflect the
amounts recorded in the 2016 Consolidated Statement of Operations and had no impact on the results
of operations.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans—The principal awards issued under our stock-based
compensation plans, which are described in Note 18 Stock-Based Compensation Plans, are non-
qualified stock options and restricted stock units. The cost for such awards is measured at the grant
date based on the fair value of the award. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately
expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting
period of the equity award) and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Forfeitures
are estimated at the time of grant to recognize expense for those awards that are expected to vest and
are based on our historical forfeiture rates.

Pension Benefits—We recognize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of
the fair value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation (the corridor) annually in the
fourth quarter each year (MTM Adjustment), and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim
remeasurement
is triggered. The remaining components of pension (income) expense, primarily
service and interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are recognized on a quarterly basis
(Pension ongoing (income) expense).

Foreign Currency Translation—Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the
United States with a functional currency other than U.S. Dollars are translated into U.S. Dollars using
year-end exchange rates. Sales, costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in
effect during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary
environments,
including related expenses, are
remeasured at the exchange rate in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while monetary
assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for
these subsidiaries are included in earnings.

inventories and property, plant and equipment,

Derivative Financial

Instruments—We minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed
appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are used
to manage risk and are not used for trading or other speculative purposes. We do not use leveraged
derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting must
be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract.
Accordingly, changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair
value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract.

All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair
value. For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair
values of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current earnings. For derivatives
designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivatives are
recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings
when the hedged items impact earnings. Cash flows of such derivative financial
instruments are

42

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

classified consistent with the underlying hedged item. For derivative instruments that are designated
and qualify as a net investment hedge, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is reported
as a component of Other comprehensive income (loss) and recorded in Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss). The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings
when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated.

judgment

Income Taxes—Significant

is required in evaluating tax positions. We establish
additional reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable,
there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold. The approach for
evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance which
determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the
applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are
examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential
outcomes of
these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in
determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and
amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and
deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a change in estimate become known.

Cash and cash equivalents—Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid

investments having an original maturity of three months or less.

Earnings Per Share—Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding.

Reclassifications—Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current

year presentation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements—We consider

the applicability and impact of all
Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).
ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to
have minimal
impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows
(consolidated financial statements).

In May 2014, and in following related amendments, the FASB issued guidance on revenue from
contracts with customers that supersedes upon adoption previous revenue recognition guidance,
including industry-specific guidance. The underlying principle requires an entity to recognize revenue
for the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to
in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to
determine when and how revenue is recognized. Other major provisions include capitalization of
certain contract costs, consideration of time value of money in the transaction price, and in certain
circumstances, allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are
resolved. The guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and
uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers.

The Company has completed its evaluation of the new standard and has assessed the impacts of
adoption on the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures. Based on the evaluation of our
current contracts and revenue streams, revenue recognition is mostly consistent under both the
previous and new standard, with the exception of two key revenue streams within our Aerospace
segment, which are described below.

First,

the previous accounting policy for costs incurred for nonrecurring engineering and
development activities of our Aerospace products with commercial customers was generally to record
the expense as incurred. Any customer funding received for such efforts was recognized when earned
as a reduction of cost of sales. Upon adoption of the new standard, the customer funding is generally
classified as revenue and not as a reduction of cost of sales. Such revenues are deferred and

43

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

subsequently recognized as products are delivered to the customers. Additionally, under the new
guidance, expenses incurred, up to the customer agreed funded amount, are deferred as an asset and
subsequently recognized as cost of sales as products are delivered to the customer. As a result of
these changes, both deferred costs (assets) and deferred revenue (liability)
increased by
approximately $1,090 million effective January 1, 2018. The aforementioned change in classification
within the Consolidated Statement of Operations and timing difference in recognition is expected to
have a minor impact on our gross margin percentage but no change to gross profit.

Second, the accounting for revenues for our mechanical service programs at our Aerospace
segment are impacted. Our previous policy was to recognize revenue over time as costs were incurred
(input method). Upon adoption, we continue to recognize revenue over time, but recognition is based
on a series of distinct services using the output method. At adoption, this change results in unbilled
receivables and deferred revenue being eliminated through retained earnings.

We adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition
method. The cumulative effect recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings of the above
impacted revenue streams is $75 million.

The disclosures in our notes to Consolidated Financial Statements related to revenue recognition
will be significantly expanded under the new standard, specifically around the quantitative and
qualitative information about performance obligations, changes in contract assets and liabilities, and
disaggregation of revenue.

In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for leases which requires lessees to
recognize most leases on their balance sheets for the rights and obligations created by those leases.
The guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash
flows arising from leases that will be effective for
interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We expect to adopt the requirements of the new
standard effective January 1, 2019. The guidance requires the use of a modified retrospective
approach. We are currently evaluating our lease portfolio to assess overall financial statement impact
and planning for adoption and implementation of this standard. We will continue to evaluate the
adoption impact of this standard on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and
related notes to financial statements.

In October 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update which requires an entity to
recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, at
the time the entity transfer occurs rather than when the asset is ultimately transferred to a third party,
as required under current U.S. GAAP. The guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice,
particularly for transfers involving intellectual property. Subsequent to 2017 fiscal year, we adopted the
accounting standard update as of January 1, 2018. The guidance requires application on a modified
retrospective basis. The adoption of this guidance increases our deferred tax assets by approximately
$340 million with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings of the same amount.

In March 2017, the FASB issued guidance on presentation of net periodic pension cost and net
periodic postretirement benefit cost. The new standard requires that an employer disaggregate the
service cost component of net benefit cost. The employer is required to report the service cost
component in the same line item or items in the statement of operations as other compensation costs
arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of
net benefit cost are required to be presented in the statement of operations separately from the service
cost component, such as in other income and expense. The guidance is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2017. Subsequent to 2017 fiscal year, we adopted the accounting
standard update as of January 1, 2018. This guidance impacts the presentation of our Consolidated
Financial Statements. Our current presentation of the service cost component is consistent with the
requirements of
the other components within Other (income)
expense (we currently present the other components within Cost of products and services sold and

the new standard. We will present

44

(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Selling, general, and administrative expenses). All components will continue to be excluded from
Segment Profit (see Note 20 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits for components of net period
benefit cost).

In August 2017,

the FASB issued amendments to hedge accounting guidance. These
amendments are intended to better align a company’s risk management strategies and financial
reporting for hedging relationships. Under the new guidance, more hedging strategies will be eligible
for hedge accounting and the application of hedge accounting is simplified. In addition, the new
guidance amends presentation and disclosure requirements. The guidance is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted, including the interim periods within
those years. The guidance requires the use of a modified retrospective approach. We are currently
evaluating whether to early adopt
this amendment on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations, and related notes to financial statements.

Note 2. Acquisitions and Divestitures

During 2017 there were no significant acquisitions individually or in aggregate. During 2016, we

acquired businesses for an aggregate cost (net of cash and debt assumed) of $2,538 million.

In August 2016, the Company acquired Intelligrated, a leading provider of supply chain and
warehouse automation technologies, for an aggregate value, net of cash acquired, of $1,488 million.
Intelligrated is part of Safety and Productivity Solutions. In the third quarter of 2017, we completed our
evaluation of the fair value of all of the assets and liabilities acquired. Management recorded goodwill
and intangible assets acquired of, $1,121 million and $507 million, respectively. The Intelligrated
identifiable intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, technology, and trade name that
are being amortized over their estimated lives ranging from 1 to 15 years using straight line and
accelerated amortization methods. The goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes.

In April 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Xtralis International Holdings Limited
(“Xtralis”), a leading global provider of aspiration smoke detection and perimeter security technologies,
for an aggregate cost, net of cash acquired and debt assumed, of $515 million. Xtralis is part of Home
and Building Technologies.

In February 2016, the Company acquired 100 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of
COM DEV International (“COM DEV”), a leading satellite and space components provider, for an
aggregate value, net of cash acquired and debt assumed, of $347 million. COM DEV is part of
Aerospace.

In January 2016, the Company acquired the remaining 30 percent noncontrolling interest in UOP
Russell LLC, which develops technology and manufactures modular equipment to process natural gas,
for $240 million. UOP Russell LLC is part of Performance Materials and Technologies.

In December 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of the Elster Division of Melrose
Industries plc (“Elster”), for an aggregate value, net of cash acquired, of $4,899 million. Elster had 2015
revenues of $1,670 million and has been integrated into Home and Building Technologies and

The Elster identifiable intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, trade names and
technology that are being amortized over their estimated lives ranging from 1 to 20 years using straight
line and accelerated amortization methods. The goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes.

On October 1, 2016, the Company completed the tax-free spin-off of its Resins and Chemicals
business, part of Performance Materials and Technologies, into a standalone, publicly-traded company
(named AdvanSix Inc. (“AdvanSix”)) to Honeywell shareowners. The assets and liabilities associated
with AdvanSix have been removed from the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The results of
operations for AdvanSix are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations through the
effective date of the spin-off.

Honeywell shareowners of record as of the close of business on September 16, 2016 received
one share of AdvanSix common stock for every 25 shares of Honeywell common stock. Immediately
prior to the effective date of the spin-off, AdvanSix incurred debt to make a cash distribution of
$269 million to the Company. At the same time, AdvanSix also incurred $38 million of borrowings in
order to fund its post spin-off working capital.

In 2016 in connection with the spin-off,

the Company entered into certain agreements with
AdvanSix to effect our legal and structural separation including a transition services agreement with
AdvanSix to provide certain administrative and other services for a limited time. As of the end of 2017,
most of those agreements have ended.

On September 16, 2016, the Company completed the sale of Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc.
for a sale price of $300 million. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $176 million, which was
recorded in Other (income) expense. The Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. business was part of
Aerospace.

In 2017, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $507 million including severance costs of
$305 million related to workforce reductions of 7,096 manufacturing and administrative positions across
our segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in
connection with our productivity and ongoing functional
transformation initiatives and with site
transitions,
to more cost-effective locations. The repositioning charge
included asset impairments of $142 million principally in our Corporate segment related to the write-
down of legacy properties and certain equipment in connection with their planned disposition and the
write-down of a research and development facility in connection with a planned exit from such facility.
The repositioning charge included exit costs of $60 million principally for closure obligations associated
with site transitions in each of our segments and for lease exit obligations in our Corporate segment.

In 2016, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $369 million including severance costs of
$283 million related to workforce reductions of 6,585 manufacturing and administrative positions across
our segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in
connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives; the separation of the

former Automation and Control Solutions reporting segment into two new reporting segments; site
transitions in each of our segments to more cost-effective locations; and achieving acquisition-related
synergies. The repositioning charge included asset impairments of $43 million principally related to the
write-off of certain intangible assets in connection with the sale of a Performance Materials and
Technologies business. The repositioning charge included exit costs of $43 million principally for
expenses related to the spin-off of our AdvanSix business and closure obligations associated with site
transitions. Also, $109 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance, were returned
to income as a result of higher attrition than anticipated in prior severance programs resulting in lower
required severance payments, lower than expected severance costs in certain repositioning actions,
and changes in scope of previously announced repositioning actions.

In 2015, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $216 million including severance costs of
$197 million related to workforce reductions of 6,405 manufacturing and administrative positions across
our segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in
connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives. Also, $53 million of
previously established accruals, primarily for severance, were returned to income due principally to
higher attrition than anticipated in prior severance programs resulting in lower required severance
payments, and changes in scope of previously announced repositioning actions.

(1) Net of changes in valuation allowance

The effective tax rate increased by 50.6 percentage points in 2017 compared to 2016. The
increase was primarily attributable to the provisional impact of U.S. tax reform (see “The Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act” further below), partially offset by increased tax benefits from foreign tax credits and for
employee share-based payments. The Company’s non-U.S. effective tax rate was 71.4%, an increase
of approximately 54.7 percentage points compared to 2016. The year-over-year increase in the non-
U.S. effective tax rate was primarily driven by the Company’s change in assertion regarding foreign
unremitted earnings, increased expense for reserves in various jurisdictions and increased withholding
taxes, partially offset by higher earnings in low tax rate jurisdictions.

The effective tax rate decreased by 1.6 percentage points in 2016 compared to 2015. The
decrease was primarily attributable to excess tax benefits from employee share-based payments
arising from adoption of the FASB’s amended guidance related to employee share-based payment
accounting, partially offset by increased tax reserves in various jurisdictions and lower tax benefits from
manufacturing incentives. The Company’s non-U.S effective tax rate was 16.7%, a decrease of
approximately 2.8 percentage points compared to 2015. The year-over-year decrease in the non-U.S.
effective tax rate was primarily driven by higher earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions and a decrease
in the tax impact of restructuring and divestitures. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S.
federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to overall non-U.S. earnings taxed at lower rates.

As discussed further below under “The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” the Company no longer intends to
reinvest the historical earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and has recorded a
provisional deferred tax liability mainly comprised of non-U.S. withholding taxes of approximately
$2.1 billion.

Our gross deferred tax assets include $794 million related to non-U.S. operations comprised
principally of net operating losses, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards (mainly in Canada, France,
Germany, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom) and deductible temporary differences. We maintain a
valuation allowance of $660 million against a portion of the non-U.S. gross deferred tax assets. The
change in the valuation allowance resulted in increases of $4 million, $69 million and $114 million to
income tax expense in 2017, 2016 and 2015. In the event we determine that we will not be able to
realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, we will reduce such amounts through an increase to
income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Conversely, if we determine that we will
be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts, we will decrease the
recorded valuation allowance through a reduction to income tax expense in the period that such
determination is made.

Many jurisdictions impose limitations on the timing and utilization of net operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards. In those instances, whereby there is an expected permanent limitation on the
utilization of the net operating loss or tax credit carryforward, the deferred tax asset and amount of the
carryforward have been reduced.

Based on the outcome of these examinations, or as a result of the expiration of statute of
limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits for
tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns will materially change from those recorded as
liabilities in our financial statements. In addition, the outcome of these examinations may impact the
valuation of certain deferred tax assets (such as net operating losses) in future periods.

and $336 million, as of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) that instituted
fundamental changes to the taxation of multinational corporations. The Tax Act includes changes to the
taxation of foreign earnings by implementing a dividend exemption system, expansion of the current anti-
deferral rules, a minimum tax on low-taxed foreign earnings and new measures to deter base erosion.
The Tax Act also includes a permanent reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21%, repeal of the
corporate alternative minimum tax, expensing of capital investment, and limitation of the deduction for
interest expense. Furthermore, as part of the transition to the new tax system, a one-time transition tax is
imposed on a U.S. shareholder’s historical undistributed earnings of foreign affiliates. Although the Tax
Act is generally effective January 1, 2018, GAAP requires recognition of the tax effects of new legislation
during the reporting period that includes the enactment date, which was December 22, 2017.

As a result of the impacts of the Tax Act, the SEC provided guidance that allows the Company to
record provisional amounts for those impacts, with the requirement that the accounting be completed in a
period not to exceed one year from the date of enactment. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has
not completed the accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. Therefore, we have recorded provisional
amounts for the effects of the Tax Act. The primary impacts of the Tax Act relate to the re-measurement of
deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the change in the corporate tax rate (“Corporate Tax Rate
Change”); the one-time mandatory transition tax on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliates (“Mandatory
Transition Tax”); and deferred taxes in connection with a change in the Company’s intent to permanently
reinvest the historical undistributed earnings of its foreign affiliates (“Undistributed Foreign Earnings”).

Corporate Tax Rate Change—For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a tax benefit

of approximately $235 million due to the decrease in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.

At the date of enactment, the Company had a deferred tax liability for the excess of its net book
value over its tax basis of its U.S. assets and liabilities that will generate future taxable income in
excess of book income. Due to the Tax Act, this additional taxable income will be subject to tax at a
lower corporate tax rate, consequently reducing the Company’s deferred tax liability as of the date of
enactment.

Mandatory Transition Tax—For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a provisional
tax charge of approximately $1.9 billion due to the imposition of the mandatory transition tax (“MTT”)
on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings.

The Tax Act imposes a one-time tax on undistributed and previously untaxed post-1986 foreign
earnings and profits (E&P), as determined in accordance with U.S. tax principles, of certain foreign
corporations owned by U.S. shareholders. In general, we have estimated $20 billion of E&P related to
our foreign affiliates that is subject to the MTT. The MTT is imposed at a rate of 15.5% to the extent of
the cash and cash equivalents that are held by the foreign affiliates at certain testing dates; the
remaining E&P is taxed at a rate of 8.0%. In accordance with the Tax Act, the Company will elect to
pay the MTT liability over a period of eight years, with the first installment of $144 million due in 2018;
the remainder of the balance is recorded in Other liabilities (noncurrent). As of December 31, 2017, the
Company has recorded a provisional amount because certain information related to the computation of
E&P is not readily available, some of the testing dates to determine taxable amounts have not yet
occurred, and there is limited information from federal and state taxing authorities regarding the

53

(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

application and interpretation of the recently enacted legislation. The Company will disclose the impact
to the provisional amount in the reporting period in which the accounting is completed, which will not
exceed one year from the date of enactment of the Tax Act.

Undistributed Foreign Earnings—For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a
to no longer

tax charge of approximately $2.1 billion due to the Company’s intent

provisional
permanently reinvest the historical undistributed earnings of its foreign affiliates.

We previously considered substantially all of the earnings in our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be
permanently reinvested and, accordingly, recorded no deferred income taxes on such earnings. As a
result of the fundamental changes to the taxation of multinational corporations created by the Tax Act,
the Company no longer intends to permanently reinvest the historical undistributed earnings of its
foreign affiliates, which amounted to approximately $20 billion as of December 31, 2017 (including
current year earnings). GAAP requires recognition of a deferred tax liability in the reporting period in
which its intent to no longer permanently reinvest its historical undistributed foreign earnings is made.
Although no U.S. federal taxes will be imposed on such future distributions of foreign earnings, in many
cases the cash transfer will be subject to foreign withholding and other local taxes. Accordingly, at
December 31, 2017 the Company has included a provisional deferred tax liability, mostly related to
non-U.S. withholding taxes. The Company has recorded a provisional amount because certain
information related to the computation of E&P, distributable reserves and foreign exchange gains and
losses is not readily available. The Company will disclose the impact to the provisional amount in the
reporting period in which the accounting is completed, which will not exceed one year from the date of
enactment of the Tax Act. The provisional amount is based on the Company’s current legal ownership
structure which may change in the future. Any future tax impacts resulting from changes to the legal
ownership structure will not be considered changes to the provisional amount and will be recorded in
the reporting period in which a plan to modify the legal structure is adopted, which may exceed one
year from the date of enactment of the Tax Act.

Global Intangible Low Taxed Income—In addition to the changes described above, the Tax Act
imposes a U.S. tax on global intangible low taxed income (“GILTI”) that is earned by certain foreign
affiliates owned by a U.S. shareholder. The computation of GILTI is still subject to interpretation and
additional clarifying guidance is expected, but is generally intended to impose tax on the earnings of a
foreign corporation that are deemed to exceed a certain threshold return relative to the underlying
business investment. In accordance with guidance issued by FASB, the Company has made a policy
election to treat future taxes related to GILTI as a current period expense in the reporting period in
which the tax is incurred.

In November of 2017, the Company issued $445 million 3.812% Senior Notes due 2047 (the
“Exchange Notes”). The Exchange Notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of
Honeywell and rank equally with all of Honeywell’s existing and future senior unsecured debt and
senior to all of Honeywell’s subordinated debt. The Exchange Notes were issued in partial exchange
for the 6.625% Debentures due 2028, the 5.70% Notes due 2036, the 5.70% Notes due 2037 and the
5.375% Notes due 2041. The Company paid $133 million to bondholders in connection with the partial
exchange.

In the October of 2017, the Company issued $450 million Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2019
and $750 million 1.80% Senior Notes due 2019 (collectively, the “2017 Notes”). The 2017 Notes are
senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Honeywell and rank equally with all of Honeywell’s
existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior to all of Honeywell’s subordinated debt. The
offering resulted in gross proceeds of $1,200 million, offset by $5 million in discount and closing costs
related to the offering.

In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company repurchased the entire outstanding principal amount of
its $400 million 5.30 % Senior Notes due 2017, $900 million 5.30% Senior Notes due 2018 and $900
million 5.00% Senior Notes due 2019. The cost related to the early redemption, including the “make
whole premium”, was $126 million which was recorded in Other (income) expense.

In October 2016, the Company issued $1,250 million 1.40% Senior Notes due 2019, $250 million
Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2019, $1,500 million 1.85% Senior Notes due 2021 and $1,500 million
2.50% Senior Notes due 2026 (collectively,
the “Notes”). The Notes are senior unsecured and
unsubordinated obligations of Honeywell and rank equally with all of Honeywell’s existing and future
senior unsecured debt and senior to all of Honeywell’s subordinated debt. The offering resulted in
gross proceeds of $4,500 million, offset by $27 million in discount and closing costs related to the
offering.

In February 2016, the Company issued €1,000 million Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2018,
€1,000 million 0.65% Senior Notes due 2020, €1,250 million 1.30% Senior Notes due 2023 and
€750 million 2.25% Senior Notes due 2028 (collectively, the “Euro Notes”). The Euro Notes are senior
unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Honeywell and rank equally with all of Honeywell’s
existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior to all of Honeywell’s subordinated debt. The
offering resulted in gross proceeds of $4,438 million, offset by $23 million in discount and closing costs
related to the offering.

For the issuances described above, unless otherwise noted, all debt issuance costs are deferred
and recognized as a direct deduction to the related debt liability and are amortized to interest expense
over the debt term.

Note 14. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures

Credit and Market Risk—Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty
credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest and currency exchange
rates. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards,
diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit
risk. Our
counterparties in derivative transactions are substantial
investment and commercial banks with
significant experience using such derivative instruments. We monitor the impact of market risk on the
fair value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial
instruments considering reasonably
possible changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative
financial instruments to hedging activities.

We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit terms in the
normal course of business. The terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate or
eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. Our sales are not materially dependent
on a single customer or a small group of customers.

Foreign Currency Risk Management—We conduct our business on a multinational basis in a
wide variety of
foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency
exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency
denominated monetary assets and liabilities and transactions arising from international trade. Our
primary objective is to preserve the U.S. Dollar value of foreign currency denominated cash flows and
earnings. We attempt to hedge currency exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible

59

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency exchange forward and
option contracts (foreign currency exchange contracts) with third parties.

We hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Prior to
conversion into U.S. dollars, these assets and liabilities are remeasured at spot exchange rates in
effect on the balance sheet date. The effects of changes in spot rates are recognized in earnings and
included in other (income) expense. We partially hedge forecasted sales and purchases, which occur
in the next twelve months and are denominated in non-functional currencies, with foreign currency
exchange contracts. Changes in the forecasted non-functional currency cash flows due to movements
in exchange rates are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the foreign currency exchange
contracts designated as hedges. Market value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in
earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized. Open foreign currency exchange contracts
mature in the next twelve months. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had contracts with notional
amounts of $9,273 million and $9,554 million to exchange foreign currencies, principally the U.S.
Dollar, Euro, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Renminbi, Indian Rupee, Mexican Peso, and
Singapore Dollar.

We have also designated foreign currency debt and certain derivative contracts as hedges against
portions of our net investment in foreign operations during the year ended December 31, 2017. Gains
or losses on the effective portion of the foreign currency debt designated as a net investment hedge
are recorded in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments. The Company did not
have ineffectiveness related to net investment hedges during the year ended December 31, 2017.

Interest Rate Risk Management—We use a combination of financial instruments, including long-
term, medium-term and short-term financing, variable-rate commercial paper, and interest rate swaps
to manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. At
December 31, 2017 and 2016,
interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges
effectively changed $2,600 million and $1,850 million of fixed rate debt at rates of 2.93% and 3.39% to
LIBOR based floating rate debt. Our interest rate swaps mature at various dates through 2026.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments—The FASB’s accounting guidance defines fair value as the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).

Financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest
level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table sets forth the
Company’s financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as
of December 31, 2017 and 2016:

The foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements are valued using
broker quotations, or market transactions in either the listed or over-the-counter markets. As such,
these derivative instruments are classified within level 2. The Company also holds investments in
commercial paper, certificates of deposits, and time deposits that are designated as available for sale
and are valued using published prices based off observable market data. As such, these investments
are classified within level 2. The Company also holds available for sale investments in U.S.

government and corporate debt securities valued utilizing published prices based on quoted market
pricing, which are classified within level 1.

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts and notes receivables, payables,
commercial paper and short-term borrowings contained in the Consolidated Balance Sheet
approximates fair value. The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities
that were not carried at fair value:

The Company determined the fair value of the long-term receivables by discounting based upon
the terms of the receivable and counterparty details including credit quality. As such, the fair value of
these receivables is considered level 2. The Company determined the fair value of the long-term debt
and related current maturities utilizing transactions in the listed markets for identical or similar liabilities.
As such, the fair value of the long-term debt and related current maturities is considered level 2 as
well.

Interest rate swap agreements are designated as hedge relationships with gains or losses on the
derivative recognized in interest and other financial charges offsetting the gains and losses on the
underlying debt being hedged. Losses on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were
$29 million and $71 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and were $2 million in the
year ended December 31, 2015. Gains and losses are fully offset by losses and gains on the
underlying debt being hedged.

We also economically hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates principally with
forward contracts. These contracts are marked-to-market with the resulting gains and losses
recognized in earnings offsetting the gains and losses on the non-functional currency denominated
monetary assets and liabilities being hedged. We recognized $207 million of expense and $232 million
of
income in Other (income) expense in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. We
recognized $86 million of expense in Other (income) expense in the year ended December 31, 2015.
See Note 4 Other (Income) Expense for further details of the net impact of these economic foreign
currency hedges.

Note 18. Stock-Based Compensation Plans

The 2016 Stock Incentive Plan of Honeywell International Inc. and its Affiliates (2016 Plan) and
2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. (2016 Directors Plan)
were both approved by the shareowners at the Annual Meeting of Shareowners effective on April 25,
2016. Following approval of both plans, we have not and will not grant any new awards under any
previously existing stock-based compensation plans. At December 31, 2017, there were 42,025,990,
and 924,694 shares of Honeywell common stock available for future grants under terms of the 2016
Plan and 2016 Directors Plan, respectively.

Stock Options—The exercise price, term and other conditions applicable to each option granted
under our stock plans are generally determined by the Management Development and Compensation
Committee of the Board. The exercise price of stock options is set on the grant date and may not be
less than the fair market value per share of our stock on that date. The fair value is recognized as an
expense over the employee’s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award).
Options generally vest over a four-year period and expire after ten years.

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on our
common stock and historical volatility of our common stock. We used a Monte Carlo simulation model
to derive an expected term which represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain
outstanding. Such model uses historical data to estimate option exercise activity and post-vest
termination behavior. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on
the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

The following table summarizes the impact to the Consolidated Statement of Operations from

stock options:

Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies

Environmental Matters

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the
protection of
the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and
procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal
injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in
accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past
operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar
businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and
are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past
production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional
lawsuits, claims and costs
involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future.

With respect

to environmental matters involving site contamination, we continually conduct
studies, individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of
various remedial techniques. It is our policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters
when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably
estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to
complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts

information becomes available. Given the
progress or as additional
the impact of other
uncertainties regarding the status of
potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe
it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess
of our recorded liabilities. We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow.
The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of remedial
investigations and feasibility studies, the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability,
personal
injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, remedial
techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties.

We do not currently possess sufficient

information to reasonably estimate the amounts of
environmental liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and
neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be
determined although they could be material to our consolidated results of operations and operating
cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. However, considering our past experience and existing
reserves, we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position.

Onondaga Lake, Syracuse, NY—In 2016, we largely completed a dredging/capping remedy of
Onondaga Lake pursuant to a consent decree approved by the United States District Court for the
Northern District of New York in January 2007. Some additional long-term monitoring and maintenance
activities will continue, as required by the consent decree. Honeywell
is also conducting remedial
investigations and activities at other sites in Syracuse. We have recorded reserves for
these
investigations and activities where appropriate, consistent with the accounting policy described above.

Honeywell and the federal and New York State natural resource trustees have submitted a
consent decree to the federal court requesting approval for a negotiated settlement of natural resource
damages claims for this site.

Asbestos Matters

Honeywell is a defendant in asbestos related personal injury actions related to two predecessor

companies:

• North American Refractories Company (“NARCO”), which was sold in 1986, produced refractory
products (bricks and cement used in high temperature applications). Claimants consist largely of
individuals who allege exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing refractory products in an
occupational setting.

• Bendix Friction Materials (“Bendix”) business, which was sold in 2014, manufactured automotive
brake parts that contained chrysotile asbestos in an encapsulated form. Claimants consist
largely of individuals who allege exposure to asbestos from brakes from either performing or
being in the vicinity of individuals who performed brake replacements.

NARCO Products—In connection with NARCO’s emergence from bankruptcy on April 30, 2013, a
federally authorized 524(g) trust (NARCO Trust) was established for the evaluation and resolution of all
existing and future NARCO asbestos claims. Both Honeywell and NARCO are protected by a
permanent channeling injunction barring all present and future individual actions in state or federal
courts and requiring all asbestos related claims based on exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing
products to be made against the NARCO Trust. The NARCO Trust reviews submitted claims and
determines award amounts in accordance with established Trust Distribution Procedures approved by
the Bankruptcy Court which set forth the criteria claimants must meet to qualify for compensation
including, among other things, exposure and medical criteria that determine the award amount. In
addition, Honeywell provided, and continues to provide, input to the design of control procedures for
processing NARCO claims, and has on-going audit rights to review and monitor the claims processor’s
adherence to the established requirements of the Trust Distribution Procedures.

Honeywell

is obligated to fund NARCO asbestos claims submitted to the NARCO Trust which
qualify for payment under the Trust Distribution Procedures (Annual Contribution Claims), subject to
annual caps of $140 million in 2018 and $145 million for each year thereafter. However, the initial
$100 million of claims processed through the NARCO Trust (the Initial Claims Amount) will not count
against the annual cap and any unused portion of the Initial Claims Amount will roll over to subsequent
years until fully utilized. In 2015, Honeywell filed suit against the NARCO Trust in Bankruptcy Court
alleging breach of certain provisions of the Trust Agreement and Trust Distribution Procedures. The
parties agreed to dismiss the proceeding without prejudice pursuant
to an 18 month Standstill
Agreement. Claims processing continued during this period as the parties attempted to resolve
disputed issues. The Standstill Agreement expired on October 12, 2017. Notwithstanding its expiration,
claims processing continues, and Honeywell continues to negotiate and attempt to resolve remaining
disputed issues (that is, instances where Honeywell believes the Trust is not processing claims in
accordance with established Trust Distribution Procedures). Honeywell reserves its right
to seek
judicial intervention should negotiations fail or prove futile. As of December 31, 2017, Honeywell has
not made any payments to the NARCO Trust for Annual Contribution Claims.

Honeywell is also responsible for payments due to claimants pursuant to settlement agreements
reached during the pendency of the NARCO bankruptcy proceedings that provide for the right to
submit claims to the NARCO Trust subject
the settlement
agreements and Trust Distribution Procedures criteria (Pre-established Unliquidated Claims), which
amounts are estimated at $150 million and are expected to be paid during the initial years of trust
operations ($5 million of which has been paid since the effective date of the NARCO Trust). Such
payments are not subject to the annual cap described above.

Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for Pre-established Unliquidated
Claims ($145 million), as well as unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy
protection and operating and legal costs related to the Trust (collectively $19 million) and for the
estimated value of future NARCO asbestos claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust

($743 million). The estimate of future NARCO claims was prepared in 2002, in the same year NARCO
filed for bankruptcy protection, using NARCO tort system litigation experience based on a commonly
accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524(g) trusts. Accordingly, the
estimated value of future NARCO asbestos claims was prepared before there was data on claims
filings and payment rates in the NARCO Trust under the Trust Distribution Procedures and also
prepared when the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims was in effect (which remained in effect until
NARCO emerged from Bankruptcy protection). Some critical assumptions underlying this commonly
accepted methodology included claims filing rates, disease criteria and payment values contained in
the Trust Distribution Procedures, estimated approval rates of claims submitted to the NARCO Trust
and epidemiological studies estimating disease instances. The estimated value of the future NARCO
liability reflects claims expected to be asserted against NARCO over a fifteen year period. This
projection resulted in a range of estimated liability of $743 million to $961 million. We believe that no
amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount and accordingly, we have
recorded the minimum amount in the range. Given the Trust’s lack of sufficient claims processing
experience since NARCO emerged from bankruptcy protection,
is not yet possible to reliably
estimate future claim costs based on actual Trust experience.

it

Our insurance receivable corresponding to the estimated liability for pending and future NARCO
for portions of NARCO-related
asbestos claims reflects coverage which reimburses Honeywell
indemnity and defense costs and is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens
of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. We
conduct analyses to estimate the probable amount of insurance that is recoverable for asbestos
claims. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual
carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. We made
judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our
historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers.

Projecting future events is subject to many uncertainties that could cause the NARCO-related
asbestos liabilities or assets to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded. Given the
uncertainties, we review our estimates periodically, and update them based on our experience and
other relevant factors. Similarly, we will reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance
recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability or other developments that may impact
insurance recoveries.

It is not possible to predict whether resolution values for Bendix-related asbestos claims will

increase, decrease or stabilize in the future.

Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for resolution of pending (claims
actually filed as of the financial statement date) and future Bendix-related asbestos claims. We have
valued Bendix pending and future claims using average resolution values for the previous five years.
We update the resolution values used to estimate the cost of Bendix pending and future claims during
the fourth quarter each year.

The liability for future claims represents the estimated value of future asbestos related bodily injury
claims expected to be asserted against Bendix over the next five years. Such estimated cost of future
Bendix-related asbestos claims is based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates,
disease classifications, and resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. In light of
the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction
product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos
claims beyond the next five years. The methodology used to estimate the liability for future claims is
similar to that used to estimate the liability for future NARCO-related asbestos claims.

Our insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of pending and future Bendix
asbestos claims reflects coverage which is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by
dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market.
Based on our ongoing analysis of the probable insurance recovery, insurance receivables are recorded
in the financial statements simultaneous with the recording of the estimated liability for the underlying
asbestos claims. This determination is based on our analysis of the underlying insurance policies, our
historical experience with our insurers, our ongoing review of the solvency of our insurers, judicial
determinations relevant
the impacts of any
settlements reached with our insurers.

to our insurance programs, and our consideration of

Honeywell believes it has sufficient insurance coverage and reserves to cover all pending Bendix-
related asbestos claims and Bendix-related asbestos claims estimated to be filed within the next five
years. Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of either pending or future Bendix-related
asbestos claims, we do not believe that such claims would have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position in light of our insurance coverage and our prior experience in resolving
such claims. If the rate and types of claims filed, the average resolution value of such claims and the
period of time over which claim settlements are paid (collectively, the Variable Claims Factors) do not
substantially change, Honeywell would not expect future Bendix-related asbestos claims to have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in any fiscal year. No
assurances can be given, however, that the Variable Claims Factors will not change.

Other Matters

We are subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve
substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to
commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures,
employee benefit plans,
intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. We
recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We
continually assess the likelihood of adverse judgments of outcomes in these matters, as well as

(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

potential ranges of possible losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries), based on a
careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other
experts. Included in these other matters are the following:

Honeywell v. United Auto Workers (UAW) et. al—In September 2011, the UAW and certain
Honeywell retirees filed a suit in the Eastern District of Michigan alleging that the Master Collective
Bargaining Agreements (MCBAs) between Honeywell and the UAW do not provide for limitations on
Honeywell’s obligation to contribute toward healthcare coverage for former employees who retired
under the MCBAs (“CAPS”). Honeywell subsequently answered the UAW’s complaint and asserted
counterclaims.

Honeywell began enforcing the CAPS against

former employees who retired after the initial
inclusion of the CAPS in the 2003 MCBA (the post-2003 retirees) on January 1, 2014. The UAW and
certain of the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment with respect to the post-2003
retirees, seeking a ruling that the 2003 MCBA did not limit Honeywell’s obligation to contribute to
healthcare coverage for those retirees. That motion remains pending. Honeywell is confident that the
District Court will find that the 2003 MCBA does, in fact, limit Honeywell’s retiree healthcare obligation
for the post-2003 retirees. In the event of an adverse ruling, however, Honeywell’s other postretirement
benefits for post-2003 retirees would increase by approximately $79 million, reflecting the estimated
value of these CAPS.

In the second quarter of 2014, the parties agreed to stay the proceedings with respect to former
employees who retired before the initial
inclusion of the CAPS in the 2003 MCBA (the pre-2003
retirees) until the Supreme Court decided M&G Polymers USA, LLC v. Tackett. The Supreme Court
decided the case on January 26, 2015 and, based on the ruling, Honeywell began enforcing the CAPS
against the pre-2003 retirees on May 1, 2015. Honeywell is confident that the CAPS will be upheld by
the District Court and that its liability for healthcare coverage premiums with respect to the putative
class will be limited as negotiated and expressly set forth in the applicable MCBAs. In the event of an
adverse ruling, however, Honeywell’s other postretirement benefits for pre-2003 retirees would
increase by approximately $103 million, reflecting the estimated value of these CAPS.

Given the uncertainty inherent

in litigation and investigations (including the specific matter
referenced above), we do not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss in
excess of current accruals for these matters (other than as specifically set forth above). Considering
our past experience and existing accruals, we do not expect the outcome of these matters, either
individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position.
Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to
change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary
requirements, which could cause us to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to
equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating
cash flows in the periods recognized or paid.

Warranties and Guarantees

In the normal course of business we issue product warranties and product performance
guarantees. We accrue for the estimated cost of product warranties and performance guarantees
based on contract terms and historical experience at the time of sale. Adjustments to initial obligations
for warranties and guarantees are made as changes to the obligations become reasonably estimable.

Note 20. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

We sponsor a number of both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension
plans. Pension benefits for many of our U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory,
qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining
Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywell’s U.S.
defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S.
employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany,
and Canada. Other pension plans outside of

individually or in the aggregate.

the U.S. are not material

We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance
coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees. None of Honeywell’s U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree
medical subsidy from the Company. In addition, the vast majority of Honeywell’s U.S. retirees either
have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits our exposure
to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not
funded. Claims and expenses are paid from our operating cash flow.

The estimated net loss and prior service (credit) for other postretirement benefits that will be
amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive (income) loss into net periodic benefit (income) in
2018 are expected to be $9 million and ($52) million.

Major actuarial assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and net periodic benefit

(1) Discount rate was 3.65% for 1/1/17 through 2/28/17. Rate was changed to 3.60% for the remainder

of 2017 due to Plan remeasurement as of 3/1/17.

The discount rate for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefits plans reflects the current
rate at which the associated liabilities could be settled at the measurement date of December 31. To
determine discount rates for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we use a
modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflows of our benefit plans to a yield
curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments. We use the single

78

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

weighted-average yield of this hypothetical portfolio as a discount rate benchmark. The discount rate
used to determine the other postretirement benefit obligation is lower principally due to a shorter
expected duration of other postretirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations.

During the fourth quarter of 2015 we changed the methodology used to estimate the service and
interest cost components of net periodic benefit (income) cost
for our significant pension plans.
Previously, we estimated such cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate
derived from the yield curve used to measure the pension benefit obligation. The new methodology
utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these cost components by applying the specific
spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the pension benefit obligation to their
underlying projected cash flows and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest
costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and their corresponding spot rates.
The change did not affect the measurement of our pension obligation and was applied prospectively as
a change in estimate. For our U.S. pension plans, the single weighted average spot rates used to
determine service and interest costs for 2018 are 3.77% and 3.27%.

Our expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets of 7.75% is a long-term rate based on historical
plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad
asset mix considerations. We review the expected rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as
appropriate.

For non-U.S. benefit plans actuarial assumptions reflect economic and market factors relevant to

each country.

Accumulated benefit obligation for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $18.1 billion and
$17.3 billion and for our Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $6.9 billion and $6.4 billion at
December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Our asset investment strategy for our U.S. pension plans focuses on maintaining a diversified
portfolio using various asset classes in order to achieve our long-term investment objectives on a risk
adjusted basis. Our actual invested positions in various securities change over time based on short
and longer-term investment opportunities. To achieve our objectives, we have established long-term
target allocations as follows: 60%-70% equity securities, 10%-20% fixed income securities and cash,
5%-15% real estate investments, and 10%-20% other types of investments. Equity securities include
publicly-traded stock of companies located both inside and outside the United States. Fixed income
securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed
securities, and U.S. Treasuries. Real estate investments include direct investments in commercial
properties and investments in real estate funds. Other types of investments include investments in
private equity and hedge funds that follow several different strategies. We review our assets on a
regular basis to ensure that we are within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset
balances are adjusted back within target allocations.

Our non-U.S. pension assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees with the
Honeywell Corporate Investments group providing funding and investment guidance. Our non-U.S.

investment policies are different for each country as local regulations, funding requirements, and
financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each
country.

In accordance with ASU 2015-07, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)”, certain investments that
are measured at fair value using the net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) practical
expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in the
following tables are intended to permit reconciliation of
the fair value hierarchy to the amounts
presented for the total pension benefits plan assets.

The fair values of both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans assets by asset category are as

The Company enters into futures contracts to gain exposure to certain markets. Sufficient cash or
cash equivalents are held by our pension plans to cover the notional value of the futures contracts. At
December 31, 2017 and 2016, our U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $4,188 million
and $3,775 million. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, our non-U.S. plans had contracts with notional
amounts of $133 million and $55 million. In both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, the notional
derivative exposure is primarily related to outstanding equity futures contracts.

Common stocks, preferred stocks, real estate investment trusts, and short-term investments are
valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.
Corporate bonds, mortgages, asset-backed securities, and government securities are valued either by

using pricing models, bids provided by brokers or dealers, quoted prices of securities with similar
characteristics or discounted cash flows and as such include adjustments for certain risks that may not
be observable such as credit and liquidity risks. Certain securities are held in collective trust funds
which are valued using net asset values provided by the administrators of the funds. Investments in
private equity, debt, real estate and hedge funds and direct private investments are valued at
estimated fair value based on quarterly financial
information received from the investment advisor
and/or general partner. Investments in real estate properties are valued on a quarterly basis using the
income approach. Valuation estimates are periodically supplemented by third party appraisals.

Our general funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at
least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards. In 2017, 2016, and 2015, we were not required
to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans and no contributions were made. We are not required
to make any contributions to our U.S. pension plans in 2018. In 2017, contributions of $136 million
were made to our non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding requirements. In 2018, we
expect to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $142 million to our
non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. Contributions for both our U.S. and
non-U.S. pension plans do not reflect benefits paid directly from Company assets.

Benefit payments, including amounts to be paid from Company assets, and reflecting expected

future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:

Note 21. Segment Financial Data

We globally manage our business operations through four

reportable operating segments.
Segment information is consistent with how management reviews the businesses, makes investing and
resource allocation decisions and assesses operating performance.

Honeywell’s senior management evaluates segment performance based on segment profit.
Segment profit
income (loss) before taxes excluding general corporate
unallocated expense, other income (expense), interest and other financial charges, stock compensa-
tion expenses, pension and other postretirement benefits (expense), stock compensation expense and
repositioning and other charges.

is measured as segment

Effective October 2017, the Company realigned the Smart Energy business, previously part of the
Home and Building Technologies segment, into the Process Solutions business within the Performance
Materials and Technologies segment.

Effective July 2016, the Company realigned the business units comprising its Automation and
Control Solutions reporting segment by forming two new reportable operating segments: Home and
Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions.

These realignments have no impact on the Company’s historical consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current
period segment presentation.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

TO THE SHAREOWNERS AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Honeywell International Inc. and
subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
“financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management

is responsible for these financial statements,

for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that
a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over
(1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and

reporting includes those policies and procedures that

financial

88

dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Financial Disclosure

Not Applicable.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Honeywell management maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide
reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the specified time periods and accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. There have been no changes that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting that have
occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2017.

Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) at December 31, 2017. Based on these evaluations, our CEO and CFO concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 were
effective as of December 31, 2017.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Honeywell management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or

detect misstatements.

Management assessed the effectiveness of Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2017. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—
Integrated Framework (2013).

Based on this assessment, management determined that Honeywell maintained effective internal

control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017.

The effectiveness of Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017
has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which is included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

(1) Equity compensation plans approved by shareowners which are included in column (a) of the table
are the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan, the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan and the 2006 Stock Incentive
Plan (including 23,175,962 shares of Common Stock to be issued for options; 3,922,890 RSUs
subject to continued employment; and 1,896,307 deferred RSUs); and the 2016 Stock Plan for
Non-Employee Directors and the 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors (including 283,431
shares of Common Stock to be issued for options; and 20,545 RSUs subject
to continued
services). RSUs included in column (a) of the table represent the full number of RSUs awarded
and outstanding whereas the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon vesting will be
lower than what is reflected on the table because the value of shares required to meet employee
tax withholding requirements are not issued.

1,398,906 growth plan units were issued and remain outstanding for the performance cycle
commencing January 1, 2016 and ended December 31, 2017 pursuant to the 2011 Stock Incentive
Plan. The value of this growth plan award will be paid in cash and, thus, growth plan units are not
included in the table above.

Because the number of future shares that may be distributed to employees participating in the
Honeywell Global Stock Plan is unknown, no shares attributable to that plan are included in column
(a) of the table above.

(2) Column (b) relates to stock options and does not include any exercise price for RSUs because an
RSU’s value is dependent upon attainment of certain performance goals or continued employment
or service and they are settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis.

(3) The number of shares that may be issued under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan as of December 31,
2017 is 42,025,990 which includes the following additional shares that may again be available for
issuance: shares that are settled for cash, expire, are canceled, or under similar prior plans, are
tendered as option exercise price or tax withholding obligations, are reacquired with cash option
exercise price or with monies attributable to any tax deduction to Honeywell upon the exercise of
an option, or are under any outstanding awards assumed under any equity compensation plan of

92

an entity acquired by Honeywell. No securities are available for future issuance under the 2011
Stock Incentive Plan or the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan.

The number of shares that may be issued under the Honeywell Global Stock Plan as of
December 31, 2017 is 1,854,517. This plan is an umbrella plan for three plans described below
maintained solely for eligible employees of participating non-U.S. countries.
• The UK Sharebuilder Plan allows an eligible UK employee to invest

taxable earnings in
Common Stock. The Company matches those shares and dividends paid are used to purchase
additional shares of Common Stock. For the year ending December 31, 2017, 46,573 shares
were credited to participants’ accounts under the UK Sharebuilder Plan.

• The Honeywell International Technologies Employees Share Ownership Plan (Ireland) and the
Honeywell Measurex (Ireland) Limited Group Employee Profit Sharing Scheme, allow eligible
employees in Ireland to contribute specified percentages of base pay, bonus or performance
pay that are then invested in Common Stock. For the year ending December 31, 2017, 5,887
shares of Common Stock were credited to participants’ accounts under these two plans.

The remaining 924,694 shares included in column (c) are shares remaining under the 2016 Stock
Plan for Non-Employee Directors.

(4) Equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners included in the table refers to the

Supplemental Non-Qualified Savings Plan for Highly Compensated Employees.

The Supplemental Non-Qualified Savings Plan for Highly Compensated Employees is an
unfunded, non-tax qualified plan that provides benefits equal
to the employee deferrals and
company matching allocations that would have been provided under Honeywell’s U.S. tax-qualified
savings plan if the Internal Revenue Code limitations on compensation and contributions did not
apply. The Company matching contribution is credited to participants’ accounts in the form of
notional shares of Common Stock. The notional shares are distributed in the form of actual shares
of Common Stock. The number of shares to be issued under this plan based on the value of the
notional shares as of December 31, 2017 is 399,676.

The AlliedSignal Incentive Compensation Plan for Executive Employees was a cash incentive
compensation plan maintained by AlliedSignal
Inc. This plan has expired. Employees were
permitted to defer receipt of a cash bonus payable under the plan and invest the deferred bonus in
notional shares of Common Stock. The notional shares are distributed in the form of actual shares
of Common Stock. The number of shares of Common Stock that remain to be issued as of
December 31, 2017 is 4,372.

(5) Column (b) does not include any exercise price for notional shares allocated to employees under
Honeywell’s equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners because all of these shares
are only settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis.

(6) The amount of securities available for future issuance under the Supplemental Non-Qualified
Savings Plan for Highly Compensated Employees is not determinable because the number of
securities that may be issued under this plan depends upon the amount deferred to the plan by
participants in future years.

DIVIDENDS/SHAREOWNER MATTERS
Honeywell’s Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase
Plan provides for automatic reinvestment of common stock
dividends at market price. Participants also may add cash
for the purchase of additional shares of common stock
without payment of any brokerage commission or service
charge. Honeywell offers Direct Registration, or paperless
stock ownership. This means that instead of getting a
paper stock certificate to represent your shares, your
shares are held in your name and tracked electronically in
our records.

The company has established a Direct Deposit of
Dividends service enabling registered shareowners to
have their quarterly dividend payments sent electronically
to their bank accounts on the payment date.

For more information on these services or for answers to
questions about dividend checks, stock transfers, or other
shareowner matters, please contact Honeywell’s transfer
agent and registrar:
