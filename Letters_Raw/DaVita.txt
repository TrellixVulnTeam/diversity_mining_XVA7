Annual 
Report

2017

Dear Stakeholders:

• For 2017 DaVita Kidney Care clinical outcomes were once again the best or among the best in the

United States in virtually every category,

• In December 2017 we announced the entry into an agreement for the sale of DaVita Medical Group

(DMG) to Optum for $4.9 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments,

• DaVita generated over $1.9 billion in consolidated operating cash flow in 2017, which was used to

invest over $1.1 billion in acquisitions and development in kidney care businesses and over
$800 million in share repurchases,

• Through DaVita’s Trilogy of Care the company continued to invest in social and environmental

programs to care for our patients, each other, and the world around us.

Pending DMG Sale:

Clinical Outcomes and
Care Initiatives:

Financial:

In 2017, the company made the strategic decision to sell DaVita Medical
Group (DMG) to Optum for $4.9 billion in cash, subject
to certain
adjustments. While we are proud of our accomplishments during our past five
years of owning DMG—including our excellent clinical outcomes as reflected
in our star ratings performance, our strong emphasis on growing physician
leaders, our teammate engagement and advancing the care model, among
other things—we believe that selling DMG is in the best interest of creating
shareholder value. The transaction is subject
regulatory
approvals and other customary closing conditions, and we expect it to close
sometime in 2018 as previously announced.

to receipt of

Following this transaction, DaVita will continue to be a leader in population
health management, with a focus on our U.S. and international kidney care
businesses. We also expect to pursue other investments in health care
services outside of kidney care.

DaVita and our affiliated physicians collaborated to achieve outstanding
clinical outcomes in 2017.

For the fourth consecutive year, DaVita outperformed the rest of the dialysis
industry under the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Five-
Star Quality Rating system with the highest percentage of centers rated four
or five stars.

Our quality clinical care not only results in healthier patients, but also drives
reductions in total healthcare cost, which provides significant savings to the
U.S. healthcare system.

In 2017, operating income from continuing operations was $1.813 billion and
adjusted operating income from continuing operations was $1.616 billion,
excluding adjustments for certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a
reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP
measures please see page 5 of this report.

Consolidated cash flow from operations was $1.907 billion, of which
$1.556 billion was from continuing operations in 2017. Strong cash flows
allowed us to spend over $1.1 billion on development and acquisitions in our

Kidney Care businesses and over $800 million on repurchases of
approximately 13 million shares of our common stock, which represents
nearly 7 percent of our shares outstanding at the beginning of 2017.

Public Policy:

We remain in a period of healthcare policy uncertainty.

Integrated Kidney Care:

Corporate Citizenship:

In February 2018, the president signed legislation with provisions to help the
dialysis community including provisions

• to allow dialysis providers to seek private accreditation allowing us to open

new facilities faster,

• to reauthorize Medicare Advantage Special Needs Plans, including C-SNPs,

which had been set to expire January 1, 2019, and

• to allow PD and HHD patients and their physicians to substitute 2 out of
every 3 monthly in-person physician visits with a telehealth visit, which
should facilitate growth in home modalities.

Most of the kidney care community continues to advocate for the Dialysis
PATIENTS Act. Over the past decade, multiple models have proven the
effectiveness of integrated care for dialysis patients. The bipartisan Dialysis
PATIENTS Act builds on these historical models to allow broader scaling of
integrated care. To date, there are over 175 co-sponsors of the bill.

DaVita VillageHealth continued to grow its commercial and government
operations in 2017 with more than 10 health plan and health system
partnerships, eight Medicare Advantage Special Needs Plans and three ESRD
Seamless Care Organizations (ESCOs). DaVita’s renal population health
division actively manages 64,000 renal patients, with nearly 7,000 at-risk
patients.

Among VillageHealth programs are ESCOs. Through ESCOs, providers
including DaVita achieved savings of $75 million during the first performance
year of the pilot program, suggesting that the renal community is uniquely
positioned to deliver success on a large scale, which would positively benefit
patients, the health care system and participating providers.

Being a leader in American healthcare means being a responsible corporate
community. The Trilogy of Care—caring for our patients, each other, and the
world—is DaVita’s vision for social responsibility and is our philosophy for
balancing our business responsibilities with our social, economic and
environmental ones. For more than a decade, we have had a vision for
creating a true community—one that cares for our teammates as well as our
patients. This has inspired our teammates to realize their full potential and to
deliver ever-improving quality care to our patients.

• Through the DaVita Way of Giving program, $2.2 million of company
donations were directed to locally-based charities across the United States
with the participation our clinical teammates in 2017, spreading ripples
across local communities.

• DaVita teammates responded to several catastrophic natural disasters in
2017,
including Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, both of which collectively
impacted more than 34,000 patients, teammates and their families. Clinics
in hurricane-impacted areas were given $2,500 each to give within their

Sustainability:

community to those in need. In total, DaVita gave nearly $1 million to
disaster relief efforts in 2017.

• In honor of Earth Day 2017, approximately 2,600 DaVita teammates, their
families and friends volunteered nearly 15,000 hours through 194
environmental service projects across 12 countries.

• In 2017, more than 600 riders participated in Tour DaVita, DaVita’s charity
bike ride which raised over $1.2 million to support Bridge of Life, a
non-profit organization founded by DaVita to serve thousands of men,
women and children around the world through kidney care, primary care,
education and prevention, and medically supported camps for kids.

2017 marked the 10th anniversary of Village Green, DaVita’s sustainability
program created with the goal of reducing the environmental impact of the
company’s operations in field facilities and in business offices. Village Green
also educates both teammates and patients on the potentially positive
environmental impact of these changes and what they can do to help.

Since the inception of Village Green in 2007, we have made significant strides
toward our goal to be a leader in sustainable healthcare.

• DaVita was recognized in 2016 for the first time by the Dow Jones
Sustainability Indices (DJSI) as one of only six providers in the Health Care
Providers and Services Industry on the DJSI World Index.

• DaVita diverted 354,610 pounds of electronic waste from landfills since

2016.

• Through water conservation efforts at dialysis centers, DaVita has saved
645 million gallons since 2013, the equivalent of 976 Olympic-sized
swimming pools.

Our 2020 Environmental Goals, announced in 2016, include:

• Reducing energy use and carbon emissions by 10% per treatment,

• Adding solid waste recycling to at least 45% of kidney care locations,

• Conducting an annual sustainability review with all national vendors and
increasing the availability of environmentally preferable products and
equipment and reducing packaging, and

• Reducing water use by 30% per treatment.

We invite you to review our work and be inspired to help change your
community. Our 2017 Community Care social responsibility report is available
at https://www.DaVita.com/CommunityCare.

Our December 2017 announcement of the agreement to sell DMG inaugurates a time of upcoming change for
the company. We are excited about the opportunities ahead of us in our kidney care business as we continue
on our mission to be “the greatest healthcare community the world has ever seen.”

I offer heartfelt thanks to our 74,500 teammates around the world. Their resilience and tenacity in
simultaneously meeting the needs of so many diverse constituencies is remarkable. Working together, we will
continue to focus our efforts on the creation of significant value for the company’s stakeholders.

Respectfully submitted,

Kent J. Thiry
Chairman and CEO

Management’s Discussion And Analysis of Financial Condition

and Results of Operation

Forward-looking statements

This Annual Report, including this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

Operations, contains statements that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities
laws. All statements that do not concern historical facts are forward-looking statements and include, among other
things, statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions and/or strategies for the future. These forward-looking
statements may include statements regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects, such as
expectations for treatment growth rates, revenue per treatment, expense growth, levels of the provision for
uncollectible accounts receivable, operating income, cash flow, operating cash flow, estimated tax rates, estimated
charges and accruals, capital expenditures, the development of new dialysis centers and dialysis center acquisitions,
government and commercial payment rates, revenue estimating risk and the impact of our level of indebtedness on
our financial performance, and including earnings per share. These statements involve substantial known and
unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in the
forward-looking statements, including risks resulting from the concentration of profits generated by higher- paying
commercial payor plans for which there is continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates, and a
reduction in the number of patients under such plans, including as a result of restrictions or prohibitions on the use
and/or availability of charitable premium assistance, which may result in the loss of revenues or patients, or our
making incorrect assumptions about how our patients will respond to any change in financial assistance from
charitable organizations; the extent to which the ongoing implementation of healthcare exchanges or changes in or
new legislation, regulations or guidance, or enforcement thereof, including among other things those regarding the
exchanges, results in a reduction in reimbursement rates for our services from and/or the number of patients enrolled
in higher-paying commercial plans; a reduction in government payment rates under the Medicare End Stage Renal
Disease program or other government-based programs; the impact of the Medicare Advantage benchmark structure;
risks arising from potential and proposed federal and/or state legislation or regulation, including healthcare-related
and labor-related legislation or regulation, that could have a material adverse effect on our operations and
profitability; the impact of the changing political environment and related developments on the current health care
marketplace and on our business, including with respect to the future of the Affordable Care Act, the exchanges and
many other core aspects of the current health care marketplace; uncertainties related to the impact of federal tax
reform legislation; changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies, or
pharmaceutical pricing; legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government
regulations and the provisions of our current Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) and current or potential
investigations by various government entities and related government or private-party proceedings, and restrictions
on our business and operations required by our corporate integrity agreement and other current or potential
settlement terms, and the financial impact thereof and our ability to recover any losses related to such legal matters
from third parties; continued increased competition from large- and medium-sized dialysis providers that compete
directly with us; our ability to reduce administrative expenses while maintaining targeted levels of service and
operating performance, including our ability to achieve anticipated savings from our recent restructurings; our ability
to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, changing affiliation models for physicians, and the emergence
of new models of care introduced by the government or private sector, that may erode our patient base and
reimbursement rates, such as accountable care organizations (ACOs), independent practice associations (IPAs) and
integrated delivery systems; our ability to complete acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we might announce or
be considering, on terms favorable to us or at all, or to integrate and successfully operate any business we may
acquire or have acquired, or to successfully expand our operations and services to markets outside the United States,
or to businesses outside of dialysis; noncompliance by us or our business associates with any privacy laws or any
security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential
information; the variability of our cash flows; factors that may impact our ability to repurchase stock under our stock
repurchase program and the timing of any such stock repurchases, including market conditions, the price of our
common stock, our cash flow position and leverage ratios, and legal, regulatory and contractual requirements; the risk
that we might invest material amounts of capital and incur significant costs in connection with the growth and

1

development of our international operations, yet we might not be able to operate them profitably anytime soon, if at
all; risks arising from the use of accounting estimates, judgments and interpretations in our financial statements;
impairment of our goodwill, investments or other assets; the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing,
conditions and receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other closing conditions of the DMG sale
transaction, potential disruption in connection with the DMG sale transaction making it more difficult to maintain
business and operational relationships, and uncertainties related to our use of proceeds from the DMG sale
transaction, including our ability to repurchase stock; the risk that laws regulating the corporate practice of medicine
could restrict the manner in which DMG conducts its business; the risk that the cost of providing services under
DMG’s agreements may exceed our compensation; the risk that reductions in reimbursement rates, including
Medicare Advantage rates, and future regulations may negatively impact DMG’s business, revenue and profitability;
the risk that DMG may not be able to successfully establish a presence in new geographic regions or successfully
address competitive threats that could reduce its profitability; the risk that a disruption in DMG’s healthcare provider
networks could have an adverse effect on DMG’s business operations and profitability; the risk that reductions in the
quality ratings of health maintenance organization plan customers of DMG could have an adverse effect on DMG’s
business; the risk that health plans that acquire health maintenance organizations may not be willing to contract with
DMG or may be willing to contract only on less favorable terms; and the other risk factors set forth in this Annual
Report. We base our forward-looking statements on information currently available to us, and we undertake no
obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors,
new information, future events or otherwise.

The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements.

Company overview

The Company has consisted of two major divisions, DaVita Kidney Care (Kidney Care) and DaVita

Medical Group (DMG). Kidney Care is comprised of our U.S. dialysis and related lab services, our ancillary
services and strategic initiatives, including our international operations, and our corporate administrative
support. Our U.S. dialysis and related lab services business is our largest line of business and is a leading
provider of kidney dialysis services in the U.S. for patients suffering from chronic kidney failure, also known as
end stage renal disease (ESRD). DMG is a patient- and physician-focused integrated healthcare delivery and
management company with over two decades of providing coordinated, outcomes-based medical care in a
cost-effective manner.

On December 5, 2017, we entered into an equity purchase agreement to sell our DMG division to
Collaborative Care Holdings, LLC (Optum), a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group Inc. The transaction is
expected to close in 2018 and is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. As a
result of this pending transaction, the DMG business is classified as held for sale and its results of operations
are reported as discontinued operations. In addition, prior periods’ presentation has been revised to conform
to current year presentation and DMG is not included in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis below.

The overall financial performance of our U.S. dialysis and related lab services in 2017 benefited from

increased treatment volume from acquired and non-acquired growth and cost control initiatives in our dialysis
business. This was partially offset by an increase in labor costs and other center related costs.

Some of our major accomplishments and financial operating performance indicators in 2017 and year

over year were as follows:

•

•

improved clinical outcomes in our U.S. dialysis operations, including the fifth consecutive year as a
leader in CMS’ Quality Incentive Program;

consolidated net revenue growth of 1.6%, which included 2.4% total net revenue growth in our U.S.
dialysis segment, despite a decrease of $5 in average dialysis net patient service revenue per
treatment;

2

•

•

•

•

•

solid performance in our normalized non-acquired U.S. dialysis treatment growth of 3.5%, which
contributed to an increase of approximately 4.1% in the overall number of U.S. dialysis treatments;

a net increase of 160 U.S. dialysis centers, including dialysis centers from the Renal Ventures
acquisition, and a net increase of 83 international dialysis centers;

an increase in our overall number of patients we serve in the U.S. of approximately 5.4% in 2017;

a decrease in U.S. dialysis and lab related services patient care costs of approximately $2 per
treatment and a decrease in general and administrative expenses of approximately $1 per treatment;
and

consolidated operating cash flows of $1.9 billion, or $1.6 billion from continuing operations, which
included the net VA settlement of $332 million.

We believe 2018 will be challenging. We continue to expect clinical costs to increase due to inflation and

a tight labor market and we do not foresee an opportunity to offset these pressures with productivity
improvements. With labor cost inflation continuing to outpace Medicare reimbursement, we anticipate that
margins on our Medicare business will continue to experience pressure. In addition, we will experience an
increase in benefit costs as we transition to a 401(k) plan match program as our 2017 benefit costs did not
include a comparable expense. In 2018 we also anticipate additional reimbursement pressure on our
pharmacy business. We remain committed to our plans for international expansion in certain regions, which
will continue to require investment. We anticipate that these challenges will be partially offset in 2018 by the
expected reduction in income taxes as a result of recent U.S. tax reform legislation. In addition, in connection
with our previously announced capital allocation strategy, in 2018 we plan to continue our evaluation of
strategic alternatives for various assets in our portfolio.

Following is a summary of our consolidated operating results for reference in the discussion that follows.

(1) For the periods presented in the table above adjusted operating income is defined as operating income

before certain items which we do not believe are indicative of ordinary results, including goodwill
impairment charges, investment and other asset impairments, restructuring charges, a net settlement
gain, gains on ownership changes, estimated accruals for certain legal matters and a settlement charge.
Adjusted operating income as so defined is a non-GAAP measure and is not intended as a substitute for
GAAP operating income. We have presented these adjusted amounts because management believes
that these presentations enhance a user’s understanding of our normal consolidated operating income by
excluding certain items which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results of operations. As a
result, adjusting for these amounts allows for comparison to our normalized prior period results.

Consolidated net revenues

Consolidated net revenues for 2017 increased by approximately $170 million, or 1.6%, from 2016. This

increase in consolidated net revenues was due to an increase in U.S. dialysis and related lab services net
revenues of approximately $222 million, principally as a result of solid volume growth from additional
treatments, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $5 in average dialysis net patient service revenue
per treatment and by one less treatment day in 2017, as discussed below. Revenue for 2017 was negatively
impacted by a decrease of approximately $25 million from 2016 in our ancillary services and strategic
initiatives driven primarily from decreases in revenue from our pharmaceutical business, partially offset by an
increase in net revenues from expansion in our international business and increases in VillageHealth
revenues, as described below.

5

Consolidated net revenues for 2016 increased by approximately $725 million, or 7.3%, from 2015. This

increase in consolidated net revenues was due to an increase in U.S. dialysis and related lab services net
revenues of approximately $496 million, principally resulted from solid volume growth from additional
treatments, one additional treatment day in 2016, and an increase of $4 in the average dialysis net patient
service revenue per treatment, as discussed below. In addition, revenue for 2016 increased by approximately
$239 million from 2015 in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives driven primarily from growth in our
pharmaceutical business and from expansion in our international business and other strategic initiatives.

Consolidated operating income

Consolidated operating income of $1.813 billion for 2017, which includes goodwill impairment charges of
$35 million related to our vascular access reporting unit, an equity investment loss of $6 million for goodwill
impairments at our APAC JV, an impairment of $280 million on our investment in the APAC JV, an asset
impairment of $15 million related to the restructuring of our pharmacy business, restructuring charges in our
international business of $3 million, a net gain on settlement of $530 million, and a gain adjustment on the
2016 ownership change of our APAC JV of $6 million, as discussed below, decreased by $217 million as
compared to 2016, which included goodwill impairment charges of $28 million, an investment impairment of
$15 million, an estimated gain on the ownership change of our APAC JV of $374 million and estimated
accruals for legal matters of $16 million. Excluding these items from their respective periods, adjusted
consolidated operating income for 2017 decreased by approximately $99 million due to an increase in
adjusted operating losses in our ancillary and strategic initiatives of $59 million, an increase in expenses in our
corporate administrative support of $31 million, and a decrease in adjusted operating income in U.S. dialysis
and related lab services of $9 million, as described below.

Consolidated operating income of $2.030 billion for 2016, which included goodwill impairment charges

of $28 million related to our vascular access reporting unit, an investment impairment of $15 million, an
estimated gain on the ownership change of our APAC JV of $374 million and estimated accruals for legal
matters of $16 million increased by approximately $893 million from 2015, which included estimated
impairment charges of approximately $4 million, estimated accruals for legal matters of $22 million and a
settlement charge of $495 million. Excluding these items from their respective periods, adjusted consolidated
operating income for 2016 increased by approximately $57 million. Adjusted consolidated operating income
increased primarily as a result of an increase in adjusted operating income in U.S. dialysis and related lab
services of $22 million, a decrease in adjusted operating losses in our ancillary and strategic initiatives of $30
million, and a decrease in expenses in our corporate administrative support of $5 million, as described below.

U.S. dialysis and related lab services business

Our U.S. dialysis and related lab services business is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services through

a network of 2,510 outpatient dialysis centers which we own and manage through management services
agreements, in 46 states and the District of Columbia, serving a total of approximately 197,800 patients. We
also provide acute inpatient dialysis services in approximately 900 hospitals. We estimate that we have
approximately a 37% share of the U.S. dialysis market based upon the number of patients we serve. In 2017,
our overall network of U.S. outpatient dialysis centers increased by 160 dialysis centers, primarily as a result
of opening new dialysis centers and from acquisitions of existing dialysis centers. The overall number of
patients that we serve in the U.S. increased by approximately 5.4% in 2017, including dialysis patients from
the Renal Ventures acquisition, as compared to 2016.

The stated mission of our U.S. dialysis and related lab services is to be the provider, partner and employer

of choice. We believe our attention to these three stakeholders—our patients, our business partners, and our
teammates—represents a major driver of our long-term performance, although we are subject to the impact
of external factors such as government policy, physician practice patterns, commercial payor payment rates
and the mix of commercial and government patients, as further described in Risk Factors. Two principal non-

6

financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. We have developed our own
composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the DaVita
Quality Index (DQI). Our clinical outcomes as measured by DQI have improved over each of the past several
years, which we believe directly decreases patient mortalities. Our patient mortality percentages have
decreased from 19.0% in 2001 to 13.8% in 2016. For the fifth year in a row, we have been a leader in the
industry in QIP standards and for the last three years for which data is available, we have been a leader in the
industry under the CMS Five-Star Quality Rating systems. Over the last two years our clinical teammate
turnover has increased slightly due to increased competition for skilled clinical personnel; however, despite
this headwind, we have continued to improve our clinical performance. We will continue to focus on these
three stakeholders and our clinical outcomes as we believe these are fundamental long-term value drivers.

We believe our national scale, size and commitment to our patients, among other things, allows us to

provide industry- leading quality care with superior clinical outcomes that attracts patients, referring
physicians, and qualified medical directors to our network, which in turn provides our dialysis patient base
with a large number of outpatient dialysis centers to choose from with convenient locations and access to a
full range of other integrated services, which in turn provides us the ability to effectively and efficiently
manage a patient’s care and certain costs while still maintaining strong legal and compliance programs.

The following graph summarizes our U.S. dialysis services revenues by modality for the year ended

December 31, 2017:

Hospital inpatient

hemodialysis

5%

Peritoneal dialysis and

home-based
hemodialysis

16%

Outpatient hemodialysis

centers

79%

Approximately 86% of our 2017 consolidated net revenues were derived directly from our U.S. dialysis
and related lab services business. Approximately 79% of our 2017 dialysis services revenues were derived
from outpatient hemodialysis services in our 2,471 consolidated U.S. dialysis centers. Other dialysis services,
which are operationally integrated with our dialysis operations, are peritoneal dialysis, home-based
hemodialysis, hospital inpatient hemodialysis and management and administrative services provided to
dialysis centers in which we own a noncontrolling interest or which are wholly owned by third parties. These
services collectively accounted for the balance of our 2017 U.S. dialysis and related lab services revenues.

The principal drivers of our U.S. dialysis and related lab services revenues are:
•

the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring
approximately three treatments per week as well as, to a lesser extent, the number of treatments for
peritoneal dialysis and home- based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis; and
average dialysis net patient service revenue per treatment, including the mix of commercial and
government patients.

•

The total U.S. dialysis patient base is a relatively stable and growing factor, and is fundamentally
influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis services, as well as mortality rates that are
common for patients with ESRD. The United States Renal Data System has reported an approximate
compound annual growth rate of 3.8% from 2000 to 2015 for the U.S. dialysis patient population.

7

We believe our ability to maintain a stable or growing share of the U.S. dialysis patient base is influenced
by the quality of our relationships with referring physicians and the quality of our clinical care, which can lead
to reduced patient mortality rates, as described above, as well as our ability to open and acquire new dialysis
centers.

Our average U.S. dialysis and related lab services net patient service revenue per treatment is driven by

changes in our mix of commercial and government (principally Medicare and Medicaid) patients, commercial
and government payment rates, and our billing and collecting operations performance.

On average, dialysis-related payment rates from contracted commercial payors are significantly higher

than Medicare, Medicaid and other government program payment rates, and therefore the percentage of
commercial patients in relation to total patients represents a major driver of our total average dialysis net
patient service revenue per treatment. The percentage of commercial patients covered under contracted
plans as compared to commercial patients with out-of-network providers has continued to increase, which
can significantly affect our average dialysis net patient service revenue per treatment since commercial
payment rates for patients with out-of-network providers are on average higher than in-network payment
rates that are covered under commercial contracted plans.

In addition, growth of our government-based patients outpaced the growth of our commercial patients in

2017 due to a decrease in exchange patients. Government dialysis-related payment rates in the U.S. are
principally determined by federal Medicare and state Medicaid policy. For patients with Medicare coverage,
all ESRD payments for dialysis treatments are made under a single bundled payment rate which provides a
fixed payment rate encompassing all goods and services provided during the dialysis treatment, including
certain pharmaceuticals such as Epogen® (EPO), vitamin D analogs and iron supplements, irrespective of the
amount of pharmaceuticals administered to the patient or additional services performed. Most lab services
are also included in the bundled payment. Under the ESRD PPS, the bundled payments to a dialysis facility
may be reduced by as much as 2% based on the facility’s performance in specified quality measures set
annually by CMS through QIP, which was established by the Medicare Improvements for Patients and
Providers Act of 2008. The bundled payment rate is also adjusted for certain patient characteristics, a
geographic usage index and certain other factors.

This bundled payment system presents certain operating, clinical and financial risks as further described
in the risk factor in Risk Factors under the heading “Changes in the structure of and payment rates under the
Medicare ESRD program could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.” For example, with regard to the expanded list of case-mix adjustors, there is a risk that
our dialysis centers or billing and other systems may not accurately document and track the appropriate
patient-specific characteristics, resulting in a reduction or overpayment in the amounts of the payments that
we would otherwise be entitled to receive. In addition, as new drugs, services or labs are added to the ESRD
bundle, CMS’ failure to adequately calculate the costs associated with the drugs, services or labs could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Uncertainty about future payment rates remains a material risk to our business, as well as the potential
implementation of or changes in coverage determinations or other rules or regulations by CMS or MACs that
may impact reimbursement. An important provision in the law is an annual adjustment, or market basket
inflation update, to the ESRD PPS base rate. Absent action by Congress, the PPS base rate is automatically
updated annually by a formulaic inflation adjustment.

In December 2013, CMS issued the 2014 final rule for the ESRD PPS, which phases in the payment

reductions mandated by ATRA, as modified by the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 which reduced
our market basket inflation adjustment by 1.25% in 2016 and 2017, and by 1% in 2018. In November 2017,
CMS published the 2018 final rule for the ESRD PPS, which increased dialysis facilities’ bundled payment rate
for 2018 relative to prior years. In particular, CMS projects that the 2018 final rule for the ESRD PPS will

8

(i) increase the total payments to all ESRD facilities by 0.5% in 2018 compared to 2017; (ii) increase total
payments to hospital-based ESRD facilities by 0.7% in 2018 compared to 2017; and (iii) increase total
payments for freestanding facilities by 0.5% in 2018 compared to 2017. The 2018 final rule for ESRD PPS also
implements changes to the PPS outlier policy, broadening the pricing methodologies used to determine the
cost of certain service drugs and biologicals in computing outlier payments when average sales price data is
not available.

As a result of the BCA and subsequent activity in Congress, a $1.2 trillion sequester (across-the-board
spending cuts) in discretionary programs took effect on April 1, 2013, reducing Medicare payments by 2%
which was subsequently extended through fiscal year 2027. These across-the-board spending cuts have
affected and will continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The CMS Innovation Center is working with various healthcare providers to develop, refine and

implement ACOs and other innovative models of care for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. We are
uncertain of the extent to which the long-term operation and evolution of these models of care, including
ACOs, Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Initiative, the CEC Model (which includes the development
of ESCOs), the Comprehensive Primary Care Initiative, the Duals Demonstration, or other models, will impact
the healthcare market over time. Our U.S. dialysis business may choose to participate in one or several of
these models either as a partner with other providers or independently. We currently participate in the CEC
Model with the Innovation Center, including with the ESCO organizations in the Arizona, Florida, and adjacent
New Jersey and Pennsylvania markets. In areas where we are not directly participating in this or other
Innovation Center models, some of our patients may be assigned to an ACO, another ESRD Care Model, or
another program, in which case the quality and cost of care that we furnish will be included in an ACO’s,
another ESRD Care Model’s or other programs’ calculations.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has also pledged to tie 50% of Medicare

payments to quality or alternate payment models by the end of 2018. As new models of care emerge and
evolve, we may be at risk for losing our Medicare patient base, which would have a material adverse effect on
our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Other initiatives in the government or private sector may also arise,
including the development of models similar to ACOs, independent practice associations (IPAs) and
integrated delivery systems or evolutions of those concepts which could adversely impact our business.

We anticipate that we will continue to experience increases in our operating costs in 2018 that will

outpace any net Medicare rate increases that we may receive, which could significantly impact our operating
results. In particular, we expect to continue experiencing increases in operating costs that are subject to
inflation, such as labor and supply costs, including increases in maintenance costs and capital expenditures to
improve, renovate and maintain our facilities, equipment and information technology to meet changing
regulatory requirements, regardless of whether there is a compensating inflation- based increase in Medicare
payment rates or in payments under the bundled payment rate system.

Dialysis payment rates from commercial payors can vary and a major portion of our commercial rates are

set at contracted amounts with payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. Our commercial
payment rates also include payments for out-of-network patients that on average are higher than our in-
network commercial contract rates. We continue to enter into some commercial contracts covering certain
patients that will primarily pay us a single bundled payment rate for all dialysis services provided to these
patients. However, some contracts will pay us for certain other services and pharmaceuticals in addition to
the bundled payment. We are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial
payors, and if our negotiations result in overall commercial contract payment rate reductions in excess of our
commercial contract payment rate increases, or if commercial payors implement plans that restrict access to
coverage or the duration or breadth of benefits or impose restrictions or limitations on patient access to
commercial plans on non-contracted or out-of-network providers, it could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if there is an increase in job losses in

9

the U.S., or depending upon changes to the healthcare regulatory system by CMS and/or the impact of
healthcare insurance exchanges, we could experience a decrease in the number of patients covered under
commercial insurance plans and/or an increase in uninsured or underinsured patients. Patients with
commercial insurance who cannot otherwise maintain coverage frequently rely on financial assistance from
charitable organizations, such as the American Kidney Fund. If these patients are unable to obtain or continue
to receive or receive for a limited duration, such financial assistance, or if our assumptions about how patients
will respond to any change in such financial assistance are incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition. For further details, see the risk factor in Risk
Factors under the heading “If patients in commercial plans are subject to restriction in plan designs or the
average rates that commercial payors pay us decline significantly, it would have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.”

Our operating performance with respect to dialysis services billing and collection can also be a significant

factor in the average U.S. dialysis and related lab services net patient service revenue per treatment we
recognize and are able to collect. Over the past several years we have invested heavily in upgrades to our
systems and internal processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduced
our regulatory compliance risks, and we expect to continue to improve these systems and processes. We
continue to upgrade our billing and other systems; however, as we continue to make upgrades to our systems
and processes, or as payors change their systems and requirements, such as changes to what is included in
the bundled payment from Medicare, we could experience a negative impact to our cash collection
performance, which would affect our average U.S. dialysis and related lab services net patient service revenue
per treatment.

Our U.S. dialysis and related lab services revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. Our

estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the
reasonably assured collectability of our billings as of the reporting date based upon our actual historical
collection experience. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then-current period financial statements
based upon on-going actual experience and trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on
the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies.

Our average U.S. dialysis and related lab services net patient service revenue per treatment can be

significantly impacted by several major factors, including our commercial payment rates; government
payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments covered under Medicare’s
bundled payment rate system, including our ability to capture certain patient characteristics; and changes in
the mix of government and commercial patients and the number of commercial patients that are either
covered under commercial contracts or are out of network.

Our annual average U.S. dialysis and related lab services net patient service revenue per treatment was
approximately $330, $336 and $332 for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2017, our average U.S. dialysis
and related lab services net patient service revenue per treatment decreased by approximately $5 per
treatment due to a decrease in our commercial treatment volume, a decline in our commercial payor mix,
including exchange patients, and an increase in our provision for uncollectible accounts. In 2016, our average
U.S. dialysis and related lab services net patient service revenue per treatment increased by approximately $4
per treatment due to an increase in our average commercial payment rates and improvements in our
commercial payor mix, partially offset by an increase in our provision for uncollectible accounts.

The principal drivers of our U.S. dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are clinical hours per

treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, utilization levels of pharmaceuticals, business
infrastructure costs, which include the operating costs of our dialysis centers, and certain professional fees.
However, other cost categories can also present significant cost variability, such as employee benefit costs,
payroll taxes, insurance costs and medical supply costs. In addition, currently pending and future proposed
ballot initiatives or referendums, legislation or policy changes could cause us to incur substantial costs to

10

challenge and, if implemented, impose additional requirements on our operations, including increases in the
required staffing levels or staffing ratios for clinical personnel, minimum transition times between treatments,
limits on how much patients may be charged for care, limitations as to the amount that can be spent on
certain medical costs, and a ceiling on the percent of profit for such care. Changes such as these mandated by
currently pending and future ballot initiatives or referendums, legislation or policy changes would likely
materially reduce our revenues and increase our operating expense and impact our ability to staff our clinics
to the new, elevated staffing levels, in particular given the ongoing nationwide shortage of healthcare workers,
especially nurses.

Our average clinical hours per treatment, or productivity levels, were flat in 2017 compared to 2016. We

are always striving for improved productivity levels, however, changes in federal and state policies or
regulatory billing requirements can lead to increased labor costs in order to implement these new
requirements, which can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. In addition,
improvements in the U.S. economy have stimulated additional competition for skilled clinical personnel
resulting in slightly higher teammate turnover in 2017, which we believe negatively affected productivity
levels. In 2017 and 2016, we experienced an increase in our clinical labor rates of approximately 4.0% and
2.8%, respectively, consistent with general industry trends, mainly due to the high demand for and nationwide
shortage of skilled clinical personnel, along with general inflation increases. In 2018, we will have a year-over-
year accounting headwind of up to $100 million as we finish the transition from a profit sharing program to a
401(k) match program. With the old program, we accrued for the expense in the calendar year before payout;
with the new program, we will accrue for the expense as we pay out. This accounting change created a one-
year gap in 2017 when we did not need to accrue for any such payouts. We also continue to experience
increases in the infrastructure and operating costs of our dialysis centers, primarily due to the number of new
dialysis centers opened, and general increases in rent, utilities and repairs and maintenance. In 2017, we
continued to implement certain cost control initiatives to manage our overall operating costs, including labor
productivity.

Our U.S. dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses represented 8.1% and

8.2% of our U.S. dialysis and related lab services net revenues in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Although
slightly down as a percent of net revenues, general and administrative expenses increased by $9 million,
primarily due to an increase in labor and benefit costs and occupancy costs, partially offset by a decrease in
long-term compensation, profit sharing and travel expenses. Increases in general and administrative expenses
over the last several years were primarily related to strengthening our dialysis business, improving our
regulatory compliance and other operational processes, responding to certain legal and compliance matters,
and professional fees associated with enhancing our information technology systems. We expect that these
levels of expenditures on our U.S. dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses will
continue in 2018 and could possibly increase as we seek out new business opportunities within the dialysis
industry and continue to invest in improving our information technology infrastructure and the level of
support required for our regulatory compliance and legal matters.

(1) For the periods presented in the table above adjusted operating income is defined as operating income

before certain items which we do not believe are indicative of ordinary results, including a net settlement
gain and a settlement charge related to a legal matter. Adjusted operating income as so defined is a non-
GAAP measure and is not intended as a substitute for GAAP operating income. We have presented
these adjusted amounts because management believes that these presentations enhance a user’s
understanding of our normal consolidated operating income by excluding certain items which we do not
believe are indicative of our ordinary results of operations. As a result, adjusting for these amounts
allows for comparison to our normalized prior period results.

Net revenues

U.S. dialysis and related lab services net revenues for 2017 increased by approximately $222 million, or
2.4%, from 2016. This increase in net revenues was primarily driven by solid volume growth from additional
treatments of approximately 4.1% due to an increase in acquired and non-acquired treatments, including the

12

acquisition of Renal Ventures. U.S. dialysis and related lab services’ net revenues was negatively impacted by
approximately one less treatment day in 2017 as compared to 2016, a decrease in the average dialysis net
patient service revenue per treatment of approximately $5, primarily due to a decrease in our commercial
payor mix, including exchange patients. In addition, our provision for uncollectible accounts increased by $52
million in 2017.

U.S. dialysis and related lab services net revenues for 2016 increased by approximately $496 million, or
5.7%, from 2015. This increase in net revenues was primarily driven by solid volume growth from additional
treatments of approximately 4.5% due to an increase in acquired and non-acquired treatment growth at
existing and new dialysis centers, as well as one additional treatment day in 2016 as compared to 2015. U.S.
dialysis and related lab services’ net revenues also benefited from an increase in the average dialysis net
patient service revenue per treatment of approximately $4, primarily due to an increase in our average
commercial payment rates and improvements in our commercial payor mix. In addition, our provision for
uncollectible accounts increased by $24 million in 2016.

Approximately 67% of our total U.S. dialysis services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017
were from government-based programs, principally Medicare, Medicaid, Medicare-assigned and Managed
Medicaid plans, representing approximately 89.5% of our total patients. Over the last year we have seen a
decline in our commercial patients, which have been outpaced by the growth of our government-based
patients. Less than 1% of our U.S. dialysis and related lab services revenues are due directly from patients.
There is no single commercial payor that accounted for more than 10% of total U.S. dialysis and related lab
services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017.

On average, dialysis-related payment rates from contracted commercial payors are significantly higher

than Medicare, Medicaid and other government program payment rates, and therefore the percentage of
commercial patients as a relationship to total patients represents a major driver of our total average dialysis
net patient service revenue per treatment. For a patient covered by a commercial insurance plan, Medicare
generally becomes the primary payor after 33 months, which includes the three month waiting period, or
earlier if the patient’s commercial insurance plan coverage terminates. When Medicare becomes the primary
payor, the payment rates we receive for that patient shift from the commercial insurance plan rates to
Medicare payment rates, which on average are significantly lower than commercial insurance rates. Medicare
payment rates are insufficient to cover our costs associated with providing dialysis services, and we therefore
lose money on each Medicare treatment that we provide.

Nearly all of our net earnings from our U.S. dialysis and related lab services are derived from commercial

payors, some of which pay at established contract rates and others of which pay negotiated payment rates
based on our usual and customary fee schedule for out-of-network patients, which are typically higher than
commercial contracted rates. If we experience an overall net reduction in our contracted and non-contracted
commercial payment rates as a result of negotiations, restrictions or changes to the healthcare regulatory
system, including the potential impact of healthcare insurance exchanges, it could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Operating expenses and charges

Patient care costs. U.S. dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are those costs directly

associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and consist principally of labor, benefits,
pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and other operating costs of the dialysis centers. U.S. dialysis and related
lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis were $224 and $226 for 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The $2 decrease in per treatment costs in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to a decrease
in pharmaceutical unit costs due to a net price reduction as well as a decrease in profit sharing expense. These
decreases were partially offset by an increase in labor and benefit costs due to an increase in teammates and
clinical labor rates, and an increase in other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers,
including the impact of the hurricanes during the third quarter of 2017.

U.S. dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis were $226 and $221 for

2016 and 2015, respectively. The $5 increase in per treatment costs in 2016 as compared to 2015 was
primarily attributable to an increase in labor and benefit costs due to a decrease in productivity, increased
turnover and clinical labor rates, an increase in other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis
centers and an increase in pharmaceutical unit costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in
professional fees.

General and administrative expenses. U.S. dialysis and related lab services general and administrative

expenses in 2017 increased by approximately $9 million as compared to 2016. This increase was primarily
due to an increase in our labor and benefit costs, and occupancy costs, partially offset by a decrease in long-
term incentive compensation, profit sharing and travel expenses.

U.S. dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses in 2016 increased by

approximately $42 million as compared to 2015. This increase was primarily due to an increase in our labor
and benefit costs, occupancy, and legal costs, partially offset by a decrease in long-term incentive
compensation expense.

Depreciation and amortization. U.S. dialysis and related lab services depreciation and amortization

expenses for 2017 increased by approximately $38 million as compared to 2016 and increased by $45 million
in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increases were primarily due to both growth through new dialysis center
developments and acquisitions as well as additional informational technology initiatives.

Gain on settlement, net. During the first quarter of 2017, we reached an agreement with the government

for amounts owed to us for dialysis services provided from 2005 through 2011 to patients covered by the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). As a result of this settlement we recognized a one-time net gain of
$527 million as well as equity investment income of $3 million for our share of the settlement recognized by
our nonconsolidated joint ventures. As such, the total effect of this settlement on our operating income was
an increase of $530 million.

Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable for our

U.S. dialysis and related lab services business was 4.9% for 2017 and 4.5% for both 2016 and 2015. We
continue to experience higher amounts of accounts receivable write-offs due to uninsured and underinsured
patients. We assess our level of provision for uncollectible accounts based upon our historical cash collection
experience and trends, and have and will continue to adjust the provision as necessary as a result of changes
in expectations based on our cash collections.

Equity investment income. Equity investment income was approximately $25 million, $18 million and $15
million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increases in equity investment income over the last three
years were primarily due to the increase in the number of our nonconsolidated dialysis joint ventures and an
increase in profitability at some of these joint ventures.

14

Segment operating income

U.S. dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2017, which includes a net gain on the VA
settlement of $530 million, increased by approximately $520 million as compared to 2016. Excluding this
item from 2017, U.S. dialysis and related lab services adjusted operating income decreased by approximately
$9 million from 2016. This decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily due to a decrease in the
average dialysis net patient service revenue per treatment of approximately $5, one less treatment day,
partially offset by treatment growth, as described above. Adjusted operating income also decreased due to an
increase in general and administrative expenses, partially offset by lower patient care costs, as described
above.

U.S. dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2016 increased by approximately $517 million
as compared to 2015, which included a settlement charge of $495 million. Excluding this item from 2015, U.S.
dialysis and related lab services adjusted operating income increased by $22 million. This increase in adjusted
operating income was primarily due to treatment growth as a result of additional dialysis treatments, one
additional treatment day, and an increase in the average dialysis net patient service revenue per treatment of
approximately $4, as described above. Adjusted operating income also increased due to a decrease in long-
term incentive compensation expense, partially offset by higher patient care costs and an increase in general
and administrative expenses, as described above.

Other—Ancillary services and strategic initiatives business

Our other operations include ancillary services and strategic initiatives which are primarily aligned with

our core business of providing dialysis services to our network of patients. As of December 31, 2017, these
consisted primarily of pharmacy services, disease management services, vascular access services, clinical
research programs, physician services, direct primary care, ESRD seamless care organizations, and
comprehensive care as well as our international operations.

Our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including our pharmacy services and international
operations among others, generated approximately $1.6 billion of net revenues in 2017, representing
approximately 14% of our consolidated net revenues. We expect to add additional service offerings to our
business and pursue additional strategic initiatives in the future as circumstances warrant, which could
include healthcare services not related to dialysis. In addition, in connection with our previously announced
capital allocation strategy, in 2018 we plan to continue our evaluation of strategic alternatives for various
assets in our portfolio. Any significant change in market conditions, or business performance, or in the
political, legislative or regulatory environment, may impact the economic viability of any of our strategic
initiatives. If any of our ancillary services or strategic initiatives, including our pharmacy services and our
international operations, are unsuccessful, it would have a negative impact on our business, results of
operations and financial condition, and we may determine to exit the line of business. We could incur
significant termination costs if we were to exit certain of these lines of business. In addition, we may incur a
material write-off or an impairment of our investment, including goodwill, in one or more of our ancillary
services or strategic initiatives. In that regard, we have taken, and may in the future take, impairment charges
related to our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including in our international and pharmacy
businesses.

As of December 31, 2017, our international dialysis operations provided dialysis and administrative

services to a total of 237 outpatient dialysis centers located in 11 countries outside of the U.S. The total net
revenues generated from our international operations, as reflected below, were approximately 3% of our 2017
consolidated net revenues.

Certain columns, rows or percentages may not sum or recalculate due to the use of rounded numbers.

(1) For the periods presented in the table above adjusted operating loss is defined as operating loss before
certain items which we do not believe are indicative of ordinary results, including goodwill impairment
charges, investment and other asset impairments, restructuring charges, gains on ownership changes
and accruals for legal matters. Adjusted operating loss as so defined is a non-GAAP measure and is not
intended as a substitute for GAAP operating (loss) income. We have presented these adjusted amounts
because management believes that these presentations enhance a user’s understanding of our normal
consolidated operating (loss) income by excluding certain items which we do not believe are indicative of
our ordinary results of operations. As a result, adjusting for these amounts allows for comparison to our
normalized prior period results.

16

Net revenues

Ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues for 2017 decreased by approximately $25 million,

or 1.5%, as compared to 2016. This decrease was primarily related to a decrease in volume in our
pharmaceutical business, partially offset by an increase in pharmaceutical rates, an increase in VillageHealth
special needs plan revenues, an increase in shared savings revenue recognized by our ESCO joint ventures
and an increase in net revenues from expansions in our international business and other strategic initiatives.

Ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues for 2016 increased by approximately $239

million, or 17.3%, as compared to 2015. This increase was primarily related to an increase in pharmaceutical
rates, a decrease in reserves due to refunds of pharmacy reimbursements taken in 2015 that did not reoccur in
2016, an increase in VillageHealth special needs plan revenues and an increase in net revenues from
expansions in our international business and other strategic initiatives. These increases were partially offset
by a decrease in our pharmacy services volume.

Operating and general expenses

Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating and general expenses for 2017, which includes
restructuring charges related to our international business of $3 million, increased by approximately $25
million from 2016, which included an estimated accrual for certain legal matters of $16 million. Excluding
these items from their respective periods, ancillary services and strategic initiatives adjusted operating
expenses increased by $38 million. This increase in adjusted operating and general expenses was primarily
related to an increase in medical costs at VillageHealth, an increase in labor and benefits costs and additional
expenses associated with our international dialysis expansion, including losses from adverse changes in
foreign exchange rates included in equity investment income, partially offset by a decrease in pharmaceutical
costs due to decreased volume in our pharmacy services business.

Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating and general expenses for 2016, which includes an

estimated accrual for certain legal matters of $16 million, increased by approximately $203 million from 2015,
which included an estimated accrual for certain legal matters of $22 million. Excluding these items from their
respective periods, ancillary services and strategic initiatives adjusted operating expenses increased by $209
million. This increase in adjusted operating and general expenses was primarily due to an increase in
pharmaceutical unit costs, labor and benefit costs, professional fees, other general and administration
expenses, and additional expenses associated with our international dialysis expansion, partially offset by a
decrease in prescription dispensing volume, long-term incentive compensation expense and foreign currency
gains.

Investment and other asset impairments

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a non-cash other-than-temporary impairment

charge of $280 million on our investment in the APAC JV. This charge resulted from changes in our
expectations for the joint venture based on continuing market research and assessments by both us and the
DaVita Care Pte. Ltd. (the APAC JV) concerning the size of the addressable market available to the joint
venture at attractive risk-adjusted returns. We estimated the fair value of our retained interest in the APAC JV
with the assistance of an independent third party valuation firm based on information available to
management as of December 31, 2017. After this charge, our investment in the APAC JV was carried at $160
million as of December 31, 2017.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we also recognized other asset impairment charges of $15

million related to a restructuring of our pharmacy business.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized an impairment of $15 million related to an

investment in one of our international reporting units.

17

Goodwill impairment charges

During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $28 million

related to our vascular access reporting unit as a result of changes in future governmental reimbursement
rates for this business and our expected ability to mitigate them. Specifically, on November 2, 2016, CMS
released the 2017 Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule and the Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment Final Rule
which reflected significant changes in reimbursement structure for this business unit.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized an additional goodwill impairment charge of
$35 million at our vascular access reporting unit. This charge resulted primarily from continuing changes in
our outlook for this business unit as our partners and operators continued to evaluate and make decisions
concerning changes in operations, including termination of their management services agreements and center
closures as a result of the changes in reimbursement structure discussed above. As of December 31, 2017,
there was no goodwill remaining at our vascular access reporting unit.

We also recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $2 million at one of our international reporting units

during the year ended December 31, 2017 and $4 million at another international reporting unit during the
year ended December 31, 2015.

Restructuring charges

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized total restructuring charges related to our

international business of $2 million and recognized equity investment losses of $1 million related to
restructuring charges at our APAC JV. These restructuring charges were related to a reorganization of our
international general and administrative infrastructure at the global, regional and county levels in order to
improve efficiency.

Gain on changes in ownership interests in APAC JV

As a result of our agreement with Khazanah Nasional Berhad (Khazanah) and Mitsui and Co., Ltd

(Mitsui) concerning the APAC JV, we recorded an additional $6 million non-cash gain during the year ended
December 31, 2017 related to a change in estimate of pending post-closing adjustments for the 2016
formation of this joint venture.

In 2016 we deconsolidated our Asia Pacific dialysis business and recognized an initial non-cash non-

taxable estimated gain of $374 million on our retained investment in the APAC JV net of contingent
obligations as a result of adjusting the carrying value of our retained interest in the APAC JV to our
proportionate share of the estimated fair value of the business.

Segment operating (loss) income

Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating results for 2017, which include goodwill impairment
charges of $35 million at our vascular access reporting unit, an impairment of $280 million on our investment
in the APAC JV, an asset impairment of $15 million related to the restructuring of our pharmacy business,
equity investment losses of $6 million related to goodwill impairments at our APAC JV, restructuring charges
related to our international business of $3 million and an adjustment to the gain on the 2016 ownership
change of our APAC JV of $6 million, decreased by approximately $706 million from the same period in 2016,
which included an estimated gain on the ownership change of our APAC JV of $374 million, a goodwill
impairment charge of $28 million at our vascular access reporting unit, an estimated accrual for certain legal
matters of $16 million and an investment impairment of $15 million. Excluding these items from their
respective periods, adjusted operating losses increased by $59 million, primarily due to a decrease in
revenues in our pharmacy services business, an increase in medical costs, higher labor and benefits costs, and

18

additional expenses associated with our international operations, partially offset by an increase in
VillageHealth special needs plan revenues, an increase in shared savings revenue recognized by our ESCO
joint ventures, an increase in net revenues from expansion in our international business, and a decrease in
pharmaceutical costs due to decreased volume in our pharmacy services business.

Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating results for 2016, which includes an estimated gain on

the ownership change of our APAC JV of $374 million, a goodwill impairment charge of $28 million at our
vascular access reporting unit, an estimated accrual for certain legal matters of $16 million and an investment
impairment of $15 million, increased by approximately $372 million from 2015, which included an estimated
accrual for certain legal matters of $22 million, as well as a goodwill impairment charge of $4 million related
to our international operations. Excluding these items from their respective periods, adjusted operating losses
decreased by $30 million. This decrease in adjusted operating losses was primarily due to an increase in
pharmaceutical rates, a decrease in reserves due to refunds of pharmacy reimbursements taken in 2015 that
did not reoccur in 2016, an increase in VillageHealth special needs plan revenues and an increase in net
revenues from our expansion in our international business and other strategic initiatives. The decrease in
adjusted operating losses was partially offset by an increase in pharmaceutical unit costs, higher labor and
benefits costs and additional expenses associated with our international dialysis expansion.

Corporate level charges

Debt expense. Debt expense for 2017, 2016, and 2015 consisted of interest expense of approximately

$407 million, $394 million and $390 million, respectively, and amortization and accretion of debt discounts
and premiums, amortization of deferred financing costs and amortization of interest rate cap agreements of
approximately $24 million, $20 million, and $18 million, respectively. The increase in debt expense in 2017 as
compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in our average interest rate, partially offset by a decrease
in our average outstanding balance. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2017 was 4.70% as
compared to 4.43% in 2016.

The increase in debt expense in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily related to an increase in our

weighted average outstanding principal balances as a result of a full year of interest on our 5.0% Senior
Notes, which were issued in April 2015, and an increase in our interest rate on the amortization of our cap
agreements in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2016 was
4.43% as compared to 4.42% in 2015.

Corporate administrative support. Corporate administrative support consists primarily of labor, benefits
and long-term incentive compensation expense, as well as professional fees for departments which provide
support to all of our various operating lines of business. This is partially offset by internal management fees
charged to our other lines of business for that support.

Corporate administrative support costs were approximately $45 million in 2017 and $14 million 2016.

Corporate administrative support costs increased $31 million due to a decrease in internal management fees
charged to our ancillary lines of business and increases in long-term incentive compensation and labor and
benefits expenses, partially offset by decreases in professional fees and other general and administrative
expenses.

Corporate administrative support costs were approximately $14 million in 2016 and $19 million in 2015.
Corporate administrative support costs decreased $5 million primarily attributable to a decrease in long-term
incentive compensation expense, primarily due to reductions in ultimate expected pay-outs as well as the
departure of a senior executive, partially offset by increases in labor and benefits, professional fees, and other
general and administrative expenses.

Other income. Other income was approximately $18 million in 2017 and $8 million in both 2016 and 2015,

and consisted principally of interest income. Other income in 2017 as compared to 2016 increased

19

approximately $10 million, primarily due to a decrease in foreign currency transaction losses. Other income in
2016 as compared to 2015 was flat, as short- term investment interest income increased but was offset by an
increase in foreign currency transaction losses.

Provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes for 2017, 2016 and 2015 represented an

effective annualized tax rate of 23.1%, 26.6% and 30.1% of income from continuing operations, respectively.
The effective tax rate in 2017 was lower primarily due to the enactment of new U.S. federal tax reform
legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act) as signed into law on December 22, 2017.
The 2017 Tax Act, among other changes, reduces the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%,
effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a net income net tax benefit of $252 million in 2017 primarily related to a
remeasurement of our net deferred tax liability. Excluding this item, our effective tax rate from continuing
operations for 2017 was 41.1%. The effective tax rate in 2016 was lower primarily due to the gain on the APAC
JV ownership changes, offset by goodwill impairment charges. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial
statements for further information.

Noncontrolling interests

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2017, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $167

million, $153 million and $158 million, respectively. The increase in noncontrolling interests in 2017 was
primarily due to additional income to noncontrolling interests related to the net gain on the settlement with
the VA of $24 million, partially offset by the impairment of our vascular access reporting unit, which reduced
income to noncontrolling interests by $2 million year over year.

The decrease in noncontrolling interests in 2016 was primarily due to the impairment of our vascular
access reporting unit, which resulted in a decrease in income to noncontrolling interest of $8 million. The
percentage of net U.S. dialysis and related lab services revenues generated from dialysis-related joint ventures
was approximately 24% in 2017, and 23% in both 2016 and 2015.

Accounts receivable

Our consolidated accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were

$1.715 billion and $1.504 billion, respectively, representing approximately 57 days and 52 days of revenue,
respectively, net of the allowance for uncollectible accounts. The increase in consolidated DSO was primarily
related to our U.S. dialysis and related lab services business and was due to changes we made in our
collection policies and procedures to improve overall collections. We expect DSO to decline two to three days
over the next few quarters as we continue to adjust and refine our collection operations for these new
protocols. Our DSO calculation is based on the current quarter’s average revenues per day. There were no
significant changes during 2017 from 2016 in the amount of unreserved accounts receivable over one year old
or the amounts pending approval from third-party payors.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our net patient services accounts receivable balances more than six
months old represents approximately 21% and 16% of our dialysis accounts receivable balances, respectively.
The increase was primarily due to changes we made in our collection policies and procedures to improve
overall collections. There were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. Approximately 1% of our
revenues are classified as patient pay. Substantially all revenue realized is from government and commercial
payors, as discussed above.

Amounts pending approval from third-party payors associated with Medicare bad debt claims as of
December 31, 2017 and 2016, other than the standard monthly billing, consisted of approximately $104
million and $105 million, respectively, and are classified as other receivables. Currently, a significant portion of
our Medicare bad debt claims are typically paid to us before the Medicare fiscal intermediary audits the
claims. However, payments received from Medicare are subject to adjustment based upon the actual results
of these audits. Such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed.

Liquidity and capital resources

Available liquidity. As of December 31, 2017, our cash balance was $508 million and we also had
approximately $44 million in short-term investments. We had $300 million drawn on our $1.0 billion
revolving line of credit under our senior secured credit facilities, in addition to the approximately $14 million
committed for outstanding letters of credit. We also have approximately $90 million of additional outstanding
letters of credit related to Kidney Care and $0.2 million of committed outstanding letters of credit related to
DMG, which is backed by a certificate of deposit. We believe that we will have sufficient liquidity, operating
cash flows and access to borrowings to fund our scheduled debt service payments and other obligations for
the foreseeable future. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings.

Consolidated cash flows from operations during 2017 was $1.9 billion, of which $1.6 billion was from
continuing operations, compared with consolidated cash flows from operations of $2.0 billion for 2016, of
which $1.7 billion was from continuing operations. Consolidated cash flows declined due to an increase in
DSO and the timing of other working capital items, partially offset by the payment received from the
settlement with the VA, net of associated tax payments. Cash flows from operations in 2017 included cash
interest payments of approximately $425 million and cash tax payments of $387 million. Cash flows from
operations in 2016 included cash interest payments of approximately $407 million and cash tax payments of
$339 million.

Non-operating cash outflows in 2017 included $905 million for capital asset expenditures, including

$559 million for new center developments and relocations and $346 million for maintenance and information
technology. We also spent an additional $804 million for acquisitions. In addition, during 2017 we received
$21 million associated with stock award exercises and other share issuances. We also made distributions to
noncontrolling interests of $211 million, which included $24 million related to the noncontrolling interest
portion of the VA settlement gain, and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $75 million
associated with new or existing joint ventures. We also repurchased a total of 12,966,672 shares of our
common stock for $811 million, or an average price of $62.54 per share, of which $8 million was unsettled at
December 31, 2017.

Consolidated cash flows from operations during 2016 was $2.0 billion, of which $1.7 billion was from

continuing operations, compared with cash flows from operations of $1.6 billion for 2015, of which $1.2 billion
was from continuing operations. The increase in our operating cash flows in 2016 as compared to 2015 was
primarily due to payments of $494 million, or $304 million after-tax, made in connection with the settlement
of a private civil suit in 2015 and the timing of other working capital items, offset by an increase in our income
tax payments and a slight increase in our cash interest payments. Cash flows from operations in 2016
included cash interest payments of approximately $407 million and cash tax payments of $339 million. Cash
flows from operations in 2015 included cash interest payments of approximately $405 million and cash tax
payments of $156 million.

Non-operating cash outflows in 2016 included $829 million for capital asset expenditures, including

$470 million for new center developments and relocations and $359 million for maintenance and information
technology. We also spent an additional $564 million for acquisitions. During 2016, we also received $1.3
billion from the maturity and sale of investments, however these proceeds were principally used to
repurchase other investments or to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. In addition,
during 2016 we received $37 million associated with stock award exercises and other share issuances and
related excess tax benefits. We also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $192 million, and
received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $48 million associated with new or existing joint
ventures. We also repurchased a total of 16,649,090 shares of our common stock for $1.1 billion, or an
average price of $64.41 per share. In addition, we settled $25 million in share repurchases related to 2015.

During 2017, in the U.S. we opened 121 dialysis centers, acquired 66 dialysis centers, including dialysis

centers from the Renal Ventures acquisition, closed and merged ten dialysis centers, closed nine dialysis

21

centers, divested six dialysis centers, deconsolidated seven dialysis centers which we continue to operate
under management services agreements, and terminated two management services agreements. In addition,
our international dialysis operations acquired 68 dialysis centers, opened eight dialysis centers, and closed
one dialysis center. In addition, our APAC JV acquired two dialysis centers, opened nine dialysis centers and
closed three dialysis centers.

During 2017, our DMG business acquired four primary care physician practices, including the acquisition

of Magan, seven private medical practices, and one independent physician association.

On December 5, 2017, we entered into an equity purchase agreement to sell our DMG division to Optum,

a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group Inc., for $4.9 billion in cash, subject to net working capital and other
customary adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in 2018 and is subject to regulatory approval and
other customary closing conditions.

During 2016, in the U.S. we opened 100 new dialysis centers, acquired a total of eight dialysis centers,

closed and merged five centers, added two centers which we operate under a management and
administrative services agreement, terminated two management and administration services agreements,
deconsolidated three centers which we now operate under management and administrative services
agreements and closed four centers. Outside the U.S., we acquired 21 dialysis centers and opened 12 new
dialysis and hospital operated centers. In addition, our APAC JV acquired three dialysis and hospital operated
centers.

During 2016, our DMG business acquired three primary care physician practices including the acquisition

of TEC, and four private medical practices.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we made mandatory principal payments under our senior

secured credit facilities totaling $88 million on Term Loan A and $35 million on Term Loan B. During the year
ended December 31, 2016, we made mandatory principal payments under our senior secured credit facilities
totaling $63 million on Term Loan A and $35 million on Term Loan B.

Interest rate cap agreements

As of December 31, 2017, we maintain several currently effective interest rate cap agreements that were

entered into in November 2014 with notional amounts totaling $3.5 billion. These cap agreements became
effective September 30, 2016 and have the economic effect of capping the LIBOR variable component of our
interest rate at a maximum of 3.50% on an equivalent amount of our debt. These cap agreements expire on
June 30, 2018. As of December 31, 2017, these cap agreements had an immaterial fair value. During the year
ended December 31, 2017, we recognized debt expense of $8.3 million from these caps. During the year
ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a loss of $0.1 million in other comprehensive income due to a
decrease in the unrealized fair value of these cap agreements.

As of December 31, 2017, we also maintain several forward interest rate cap agreements that were

entered into in October 2015 with notional amounts totaling $3.5 billion. These forward cap agreements will
become effective June 29, 2018 and will have the economic effect of capping the LIBOR variable component
of our interest rate at a maximum of 3.50% on an equivalent amount of its debt. These cap agreements expire
on June 30, 2020. As of December 31, 2017, the total fair value of these cap agreements was an asset of
approximately $1.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a loss of $8.8 million in
other comprehensive income due to a decrease in the unrealized fair value of these cap agreements.

Other items

As of December 31, 2017, our Term Loan B debt bears interest at LIBOR plus an interest rate margin of

2.75%. Term Loan B is subject to interest rate caps if LIBOR should rise above 3.50%. Term Loan A bears

22

interest at LIBOR plus an interest rate margin of 2.00%. The capped portion of Term Loan A is $122.5 million.
In addition, the uncapped portion of Term Loan A, which is subject to the variability of LIBOR, is $652.5
million. Interest rates on our senior notes are fixed by their terms.

Our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the senior secured credit facilities was 4.45%,

based on the current margins in effect of 2.00% for Term Loan A and the Revolver and 2.75% for Term Loan
B, as of December 31, 2017.

As of December 31, 2017, our interest rates are fixed on approximately 52% of our total debt.

Our overall weighted average effective interest rate during the year ended December 31, 2017 was

4.70% and as of December 31, 2017 was 4.88%.

As of December 31, 2017, we had $300 million drawn on our $1.0 billion revolving line of credit under our
senior secured credit facilities, in addition to approximately $14.4 million committed for outstanding letters of
credit. We also have approximately $90.1 million of additional outstanding letters of credit related to Kidney
Care and $0.2 million of committed outstanding letters of credit related to DMG, which is backed by a
certificate of deposit.

We believe that we will generate significant operating cash flows and will have sufficient liquidity to fund

our scheduled debt service and other obligations for the foreseeable future, including the next 12 months,
under the terms of our debt agreements. However, our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations
and cash from borrowings, including general, economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors
that are beyond our control, as described in the risk factor in Risk Factors under the heading “The level of our
current and future debt could have an adverse impact on our business and our ability to generate cash to
service our indebtedness and for other intended purposes depends on many factors beyond our control.”

Goodwill

We elected to early adopt ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the

Test for Goodwill Impairment, effective January 1, 2017. The amendments in this ASU simplify the test for
goodwill impairment by eliminating the second step in the assessment. All goodwill impairment tests
performed during 2017 have been performed under this new guidance.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $28 million

related to our vascular access reporting unit as a result of changes in future governmental reimbursement
rates for this business and our expected ability to mitigate them. Specifically, on November 2, 2016, CMS
released the 2017 Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule and the Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment Final Rule
which reflected significant changes in reimbursement structure for this business unit.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized an additional goodwill impairment charge of
$35 million at our vascular access reporting unit. This charge resulted primarily from continuing changes in
our outlook for this business unit as our partners and operators continued to evaluate and make decisions
concerning changes in operations, including termination of their management services agreements and center
closures, as a result of the changes in reimbursement structure discussed above. As of December 31, 2017,
there was no goodwill remaining at our vascular access reporting unit.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we also performed annual impairment assessments for

various other reporting units. As a result of these assessments, we also recognized a goodwill impairment
charge of $2 million at one of our international reporting units during the year ended December 31, 2017.
During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $4 million in
another international reporting unit.

23

Based on our most recent assessments, we determined that reductions in reimbursement rates, changes

in actual or expected growth rates, or other significant adverse changes in expected future cash flows or
valuation assumptions could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future for the following reporting
units, which remain at risk of goodwill impairment as of December 31, 2017:

(3) Potential impact on estimated fair value of an increase in discount rates of 100 basis points as of the

latest assessment date.

There were no major changes in the business, prospects, or expected future results of these reporting

units from their latest assessment date through December 31, 2017.

Except as described above, none of our various other reporting units was considered at risk of significant

goodwill impairment as of December 31, 2017. Since the dates of our last annual goodwill impairment tests,
there have been certain developments, events, changes in operating performance and other changes in key
circumstances that have affected our businesses. However, except as further described above, these did not
cause management to believe it is more likely than not that the fair values of any of our reporting units would
be less than their respective carrying amounts as of December 31, 2017.

Long-term incentive compensation

Long-term incentive program (LTIP) compensation includes both stock-based awards (principally stock-

settled stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and performance stock units) as well as long-term
performance-based cash awards. Long-term incentive compensation expense, which was primarily general
and administrative in nature, was attributed among our U.S. dialysis and related lab services business,
corporate administrative support, and the ancillary services and strategic initiatives.

Our stock-based compensation awards are measured at their estimated fair values on the date of grant if

settled in shares or at their estimated fair values at the end of each reporting period if settled in cash. The
value of stock-based awards so measured is recognized as compensation expense on a cumulative straight-
line basis over the vesting terms of the awards, adjusted for expected forfeitures.

During 2017, we granted approximately 1,692,154 stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SSARs) with

an aggregate grant-date fair value of $24.5 million and a weighted-average expected life of approximately 4.2
years and approximately 528,968 stock units with an aggregate grant-date fair value of $34.8 million and a
weighted-average expected life of approximately 3.4 years. We also granted 15,000 cash-settled stock-based
awards with an aggregate grant-date fair value of $0.3 million.

For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, long-term incentive compensation expense of $62.0

million and $65.0 million decreased by approximately $3.0 million and $59.0 million as compared to 2016
and 2015, respectively. This decrease in long-term incentive compensation expense was primarily due to
cumulative revaluation of liability-based awards for reductions in estimated ultimate payouts, as well as the
final vesting of a prior broad grant that is no longer contributing expense.

24

As of December 31, 2017, there was $98.0 million in total estimated but unrecognized long-term

incentive compensation expense for LTIP awards outstanding, including $61.2 million relating to stock-based
awards under our equity compensation plans. We expect to recognize the performance-based cash
component of these LTIP costs over a weighted average remaining period of 1.1 years and the stock-based
component of these LTIP costs over a weighted average remaining period of 1.4 years.

For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we received $13.5 million, $28.4 million and
$45.7 million, respectively, in actual tax benefits upon the exercise of stock awards. Since we issue stock-
settled stock appreciation rights rather than stock options, we did not receive cash proceeds from stock
option exercises during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Stock repurchases

We repurchased a total of 12,966,672 shares for $811 million, or an average price of $62.54 during the

year ended December 31, 2017. We also repurchased a total of 16,649,090 shares for $1.1 billion, or an
average price of $64.41 during the year ended December 31, 2016 and a total of 7,779,958 shares for $575
million, or an average price of $73.96 during the year ended December 31, 2015. Subsequent to December 31,
2017, we have repurchased 1,237,800 additional shares of our common stock for $93 million, or an average
price of $74.96 per share, through February 22, 2018.

On October 10, 2017, our Board of Directors approved an additional share repurchase authorization in

the amount of $1.3 billion. This share repurchase authorization was in addition to the $247 million remaining
at that time under our Board of Directors’ prior share repurchase authorization announced in July 2016.
Accordingly, as of February 22, 2018, we have a total of $1.0 billion available under the current Board
repurchase authorizations for additional share repurchases. Although these share repurchase authorizations
do not have expiration dates, we remain subject to share repurchase limitations under the terms of our senior
secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our senior notes.

Off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations

In addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with

operating leases and letters of credit, as well as potential obligations associated with our equity investments
in nonconsolidated businesses and to dialysis centers that are wholly-owned by third parties. Substantially all
of our U.S. dialysis facilities are leased. We have potential obligations to purchase the noncontrolling interests
held by third parties in several of our majority-owned joint ventures and other nonconsolidated entities. These
obligations are in the form of put provisions that are exercisable at the third- party owners’ discretion within
specified periods as outlined in each specific put provision. If these put provisions were exercised, we would
be required to purchase the third-party owners’ equity interests at either the appraised fair market value or a
predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flows attributable to the equity interests put to us, which is
intended to approximate fair value. The methodology we use to estimate the fair values of noncontrolling
interests subject to put provisions assumes the higher of either a liquidation value of net assets or an average
multiple of earnings, based on historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators that can
affect future results, as well as other factors. The estimated fair values of noncontrolling interests subject to
put provisions are a critical accounting estimate that involves significant judgments and assumptions and may
not be indicative of the actual values at which the noncontrolling interests may ultimately be settled, which
could vary significantly from our current estimates. The estimated fair values of noncontrolling interests
subject to put provisions can fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these noncontrolling
interests obligations may be settled will vary significantly depending upon market conditions including
potential purchasers’ access to the capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and
non-dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted
marketability of the third-party owners’ equity interests. The amount of noncontrolling interests subject to put
provisions that employ a contractually predetermined multiple of earnings rather than fair value are
immaterial. For additional information see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.

25

We also have certain other potential commitments to provide operating capital to several dialysis

centers that are wholly- owned by third parties or centers in which we own a noncontrolling equity interest as
well as to physician-owned vascular access clinics or medical practices that we operate under management
and administrative services agreements.

In 2010, we entered into and subsequently extended an agreement with FMC to purchase a certain

amount of dialysis equipment, parts and supplies from FMC through December 31, 2017. In January 2018, we
entered into a new agreement extending this agreement with FMC through December 31, 2020. The actual
amount of purchases in future years from FMC will depend upon a number of factors, including the operating
requirements of our centers, the number of centers we acquire, and growth of our existing centers.

We are party to agreements with Baxter Healthcare Corporation (Baxter) that commit us to purchase a

certain amount of hemodialysis non-equipment product supplies, such as dialyzers, at fixed prices through
2018. In addition, in February 2018 we amended our agreement with Baxter related to certain peritoneal
dialysis supplies. Under this new contract with Baxter we have committed to purchase a certain amount of
peritoneal dialysis supplies at fixed prices (as set forth in the contract for each year) through 2022.

In January 2017, we entered into a Sourcing and Supply Agreement with Amgen USA Inc. (Amgen) that

expires on December 31, 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, we will purchase EPO in amounts
necessary to meet no less than 90% of our requirements for ESAs through the expiration of the contract. The
actual amount of EPO that we will purchase will depend upon the amount of EPO administered during dialysis
as prescribed by physicians and the overall number of patients that we serve.

26

Settlements of approximately $33 million of existing income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits,

including interest, penalties and other long-term tax liabilities, are excluded from the above table as
reasonably reliable estimates of their timing cannot be made.

Supplemental information concerning certain Physician Groups and unrestricted subsidiaries

The following information is presented as supplemental data as required by the indentures governing our

senior notes.

We provide services to certain physician groups, including those within our DMG business, which while
consolidated in our financial statements for financial reporting purposes, are not subsidiaries of or owned by
us, do not constitute “Subsidiaries” as defined in the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes, and
do not guarantee those senior notes. In addition, we have entered into management agreements with these
physician groups pursuant to which we receive management fees from the physician groups.

As of December 31, 2017, if these physician groups were not consolidated in our financial statements, our

consolidated assets would have been approximately $18.522 billion and our consolidated other liabilities
would have been approximately $3.342 billion. Our consolidated indebtedness would have remained
approximately $9.400 billion due to these physician groups being classified as held for sale. For the year
ended December 31, 2017, if these physician groups were not consolidated in our financial statements, our
consolidated net income would have been reduced by approximately $21 million. Our consolidated total net
revenues and consolidated operating income would have remained approximately $10.877 billion and $1.813
billion, respectively, due to these physician groups being reported as discontinued operations.

In addition, our DMG business owns a 67% equity interest in California Medical Group Insurance

(CMGI), which is an Unrestricted Subsidiary as defined in the indentures governing our outstanding senior
notes, and does not guarantee those senior notes. DMG’s equity interest in CMGI is accounted for under the
equity method of accounting, meaning that, although CMGI is not consolidated in our financial statements for
financial reporting purposes, our consolidated income statement reflects our pro rata share of CMGI’s net
income within net loss from discontinued operations.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, excluding DMG’s equity investment income attributable to CMGI,

our consolidated net income would be decreased by approximately $19 thousand. See Note 29 to the
consolidated financial statements for further details.

Contingencies

The information in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements of this report is incorporated by

reference in response to this item.

Critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments

Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with United

States generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting principles require us to make estimates,
judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities,
contingencies and temporary equity. All significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed
based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when
necessary. Actual results will generally differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in our
financial statements in the period of change based upon on-going actual experience trends, or subsequent
settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies.
Interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. Certain accounting estimates,
including those concerning revenue recognition and accounts receivable, impairments of goodwill and

27

investments, accounting for income taxes, quarterly and annual variable compensation accruals, consolidation
of variable interest entities, and fair value estimates are considered to be critical to evaluating and
understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application
requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates.

U.S. dialysis and related lab services revenue recognition and accounts receivable. There are significant

estimating risks associated with the amount of U.S. dialysis and related lab services revenue that we
recognize in a given reporting period. Payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to
wide variations in the coverage terms of the commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments.
In addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of
contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. Net revenue
recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will
ultimately be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with
regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters.

Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are recognized based on (a) the payment

rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government
payor (e.g., 80% for Medicare patients) and (b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the
estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary
coverage (e.g., Medicaid secondary coverage), the patient’s commercial health plan secondary coverage, or
the patient. Our dialysis related reimbursements from Medicare are subject to certain variations under
Medicare’s single bundled payment rate system whereby our reimbursements can be adjusted for certain
patient characteristics and certain other factors. Our revenue recognition depends upon our ability to
effectively capture, document and bill for Medicare’s base payment rate and these other factors. In addition,
as a result of the potential range of variations that can occur in our dialysis-related reimbursements from
Medicare under the single bundled payment rate system, our revenue recognition is subject to a greater
degree of estimating risk.

Commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed-care payors, are billed at our usual and

customary rates; however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services
provided. Net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients covered under
commercial healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non-contracted commercial healthcare
plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical
trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection
processes that can result in denied claims for payments, a slowdown in collections, a reduction in the
amounts that we expect to collect and regulatory compliance issues. Determining applicable primary and
secondary coverage for our approximately 197,800 U.S. dialysis patients at any point in time, together with
the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource-intensive processes.
Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years or longer after
services are provided.

We generally expect the range of our U.S. dialysis and related lab services revenues estimating risk to be

within 1% of its revenue, which can represent as much as approximately 5% of U.S. dialysis and related lab
services’ adjusted operating income. Changes in estimates are reflected in the then-current financial
statements based on on-going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations
depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Changes in revenue estimates
for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer
term trend analyses, and have not been significant.

Laboratory service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net

realizable amounts to be received.

28

Impairments of goodwill and investments. We account for impairments of goodwill and equity method and

other investments in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance. Goodwill is not
amortized, but is assessed for impairment when changes in circumstances warrant and at least annually. An
impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of a reporting unit’s goodwill
exceeds its estimated fair value. Equity method and other investments are assessed for other-than-temporary
impairment when changes in circumstances warrant. An other-than- temporary impairment charge is
recorded when the fair value of an investment has fallen below its carrying amount and the shortfall is
expected to be indefinitely or permanently unrecoverable.

Such changes can include, among others, changes in the legal environment, addressable market,

business strategy, development or business plans, reimbursement structure, operating performance, future
prospects, relationships with partners, and/or market value indications for the subject business. We use a
variety of factors to assess changes in the financial condition, future prospects and other circumstances
concerning the subject businesses and to estimate their fair value when applicable. Any change in the factors,
assessments or assumptions involved could impact a determination of whether and when to assess goodwill
or an investment for impairment as well as the outcome of such an assessment. These assessments and the
related valuations can involve significant uncertainties and require significant judgment on various matters,
some of which could be subject to reasonable disagreement.

Accounting for income taxes. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for
unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be
paid. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous state and foreign jurisdictions, and
changes in tax laws or regulations may be proposed or enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax
liability. The actual impact of any such laws or regulations, including the 2017 Tax Act, could be materially
different from our current estimates.

Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our consolidated income tax expense.
Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and
their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the
future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise,
we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax
liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations,
assumptions about the amount of future federal, state, and foreign pre-tax operating income adjusted for
items that do not have tax consequences. The assumptions about future taxable income require significant
judgments and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying
businesses. To the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. The allowance is
regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about
the realizability of the related deferred tax assets.

Variable compensation accruals. We estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the
amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate-specific
and/or corporate financial and operating goals. Our estimates, which include compensation incentives for
bonuses and other awards, including long-term incentive programs, are updated periodically based on
changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final payment
amount. Actual results reflected in each fiscal quarter may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating
fulfillment of specific and/or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by
our Board of Directors, as applicable.

Consolidation of variable interest entities. We rely on the operating activities of certain entities that we do

not directly own or control, but over which we have indirect influence and of which we are considered the
primary beneficiary. Under accounting guidance applicable to variable interest entities, we have determined
that these entities are to be included in our consolidated financial statements. The analyses upon which these

29

determinations rest are complex, involve uncertainties, and require significant judgment on various matters,
some of which could be subject to reasonable disagreement. While these determinations have a meaningful
effect on the description and classification of various amounts in our consolidated financial statements, non-
consolidation of these entities would not have had a material effect on our results of operations.

Fair value estimates. We rely on fair value measurements and estimates for purposes that require the

recording, reassessment, or adjustment of the carrying amounts of certain assets, liabilities and
noncontrolling interest subject to put provisions (temporary equity). These purposes can include the
accounting for business combination transactions, impairment assessments for goodwill, investments, or
other long-lived assets, and stock-based compensation, among others. The criticality of a particular fair value
estimate to our consolidated financial statements depends upon the nature and size of the item being
measured and the extent of uncertainties involved and the nature and magnitude or potential effect of
assumptions and judgments required. Critical fair value estimates can involve significant uncertainties and
require significant judgment on various matters, some of which could be subject to reasonable disagreement.

The FASB defines fair value as the amount at which an asset (or liability) could be bought (or incurred) or

sold (or settled) between willing parties, that is, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Critical fair value
estimates can be required for measurement of goodwill and equity method and other investment
impairments, as discussed previously. Fair value estimates can also be critical in accounting for major
acquisitions or business combination transactions of significant size involving businesses or industries in
which we and/or our professional valuation advisors do not have significant experience. In these cases, the
nature and size of the item being measured and the extent of uncertainties involved, as well as the nature and
magnitude or potential effect of assumptions and judgments required, can make the fair value estimate a
critical accounting estimate.

Managements Report of Internal Control

Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over
financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles and which includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

During the last fiscal year, the Company conducted an evaluation, under the oversight of the Chief

Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. This evaluation was completed based on the criteria
established in the report titled “Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Based upon our evaluation under the COSO framework, we have concluded that the Company’s internal

control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an attestation
report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which report is included in this Annual
Report.

DaVita Inc.:

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of DaVita Inc. and subsidiaries (the

Company) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, equity, and cash flow for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, and the
related notes and financial statement Schedule II-Valuation and Qualifying Accounts (collectively, the
consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the threeyear period ended December 31, 2017, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 23, 2018 expressed
an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our

responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are
a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that

we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due
to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining,
on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our
audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2000.

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
DaVita Inc.:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited DaVita Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017,
based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2017
and 2016, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flow for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and financial
statement Schedule II—Valuation and Qualifying Accounts (collectively, the consolidated financial
statements), and our report dated February 23, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial

reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in
the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a
public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

33

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

1. Organization and summary of significant accounting policies

Organization

DaVita Inc. (the Company) has consisted of two major divisions, DaVita Kidney Care (Kidney Care) and

DaVita Medical Group (DMG). The Kidney Care division is comprised of the Company’s U.S. dialysis and
related lab services, its ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including its international operations, and its
corporate administrative support. The Company’s largest line of business is its U.S. dialysis and related lab
services business, which operates kidney dialysis centers in the U.S. for patients suffering from chronic kidney
failure also known as end stage renal disease (ESRD). As of December 31, 2017, the Company operated or
provided administrative services through a network of 2,510 U.S. outpatient dialysis centers in 46 states and
the District of Columbia, serving a total of approximately 197,800 patients. In addition, as of December 31,
2017, the Company operated or provided administrative services to a total of 237 outpatient dialysis centers
serving approximately 22,900 patients located in 11 countries outside of the U.S.

The Company’s DMG division is a patient- and physician-focused integrated healthcare delivery and

management company that provides medical services to members primarily through capitation contracts with
some of the nation’s leading health plans. On December 5, 2017, the Company entered into an equity
purchase agreement to sell its DMG division to Collaborative Care Holdings, LLC (Optum), a subsidiary of
UnitedHealth Group Inc. The transaction is expected to close in 2018 and is subject to regulatory approval
and other customary closing conditions. As a result of this pending transaction, the DMG business has been
reclassified as held for sale and its results of operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods
presented in these consolidated financial statements. For financial information about the DMG business, see
Note 21.

The Company’s U.S. dialysis and related lab services business qualifies as a separately reportable
segment and the Company’s other ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including its international
operations, have been combined and disclosed in the other segments category.

These consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States generally

accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The financial statements include DaVita Inc. and its subsidiaries,
partnerships and other entities in which it maintains a majority voting interest or other controlling financial
interest (collectively, the Company). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated. Non-marketable equity investments are recorded under the equity or cost method of accounting
based upon whether the Company has significant influence over the investee. For the Company’s international
subsidiaries, local currencies are considered their functional currencies. Translation adjustments result from
translating the Company’s international subsidiaries’ financial statements from their functional currencies into
the Company’s reporting currency (USD). Prior year balances and amounts have been reclassified to conform
to the current year presentation.

The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date these consolidated financial

statements were issued and has included all necessary adjustments and disclosures.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and

assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, contingencies and
noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions. Although actual results in subsequent periods will differ

41

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

from these estimates, such estimates are developed based on the best information available to management
and management’s best judgments at the time. All significant assumptions and estimates underlying the
amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes are regularly reviewed and updated
when necessary. Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based upon on-going actual
experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of
the estimates and contingencies. Interim changes in estimates related to annual operating costs are applied
prospectively within annual periods.

The most significant assumptions and estimates underlying these financial statements and

accompanying notes involve revenue recognition and accounts receivable, contingencies, impairments of
goodwill and investments, accounting for income taxes, long-term variable compensation accruals,
consolidation of variable interest entities, and certain fair value estimates. Specific estimating risks and
contingencies are further addressed within these notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Patient service net revenues and accounts receivable

U.S. dialysis and related lab services

U.S. dialysis patient service net revenues are recognized in the period services are provided. Revenues

consist primarily of payments from Medicare, Medicaid and commercial health plans for dialysis and ancillary
services provided to patients. A usual and customary fee schedule is maintained for the Company’s dialysis
treatments and other patient services; however, actual collectible revenue is normally recognized at a
discount from the fee schedule.

Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are recognized based on: (a) the payment
rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of payment rates paid by the government
payor (e.g., 80% for Medicare patients) and (b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor,
estimates of the amounts ultimately collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage
(e.g., Medicaid secondary coverage), the patient’s commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient.
The Company’s reimbursements from Medicare are subject to certain variations under Medicare’s single
bundled payment rate system, whereby reimbursements can be adjusted for certain patient characteristics
and other factors. The Company’s revenue recognition will depend upon its ability to effectively capture,
document and bill for Medicare’s base payment rate as well as these other variable factors.

Revenues associated with commercial health plans are estimated based on contractual terms for the

patients under healthcare plans with which the Company has formal agreements, non-contracted health plan
coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of
refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in the Company’s billing and collection
processes that can result in denied claims for payments, and regulatory compliance matters.

Commercial revenue recognition also involves significant estimating risks. With many larger, commercial

insurers the Company has several different contracts and payment arrangements, and these contracts often
include only a subset of the Company’s centers. It is often not possible to determine which contract, if any,
should be applied prior to billing. In addition, for services provided by non-contracted centers, final collection
may require specific negotiation of a payment amount, typically at a significant discount from the Company’s
usual and customary rates.

Under Medicare’s bundled payment rate system, services covered by Medicare are subject to estimating

risk, whereby reimbursements from Medicare can vary significantly depending upon certain patient

42

characteristics and other variable factors. Even with the bundled payment rate system, Medicare payments
for bad debt claims as established by cost reports require evidence of collection efforts. As a result, billing and
collection of Medicare bad debt claims can be delayed significantly and final payment is subject to audit.

Medicaid payments, when Medicaid coverage is secondary, can also be difficult to estimate. For many

states, Medicaid payment terms and methods differ from Medicare, and may prevent accurate estimation of
individual payment amounts prior to billing.

The Company’s range of revenue estimating risk for the U.S. dialysis and related lab services segment is

generally expected to be within 1% of its revenue. Changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are not
material.

Other revenues

Other revenues consist of the revenues associated with the ancillary services and strategic initiatives,
management and administrative support services that are provided to outpatient dialysis centers that the
Company does not own or in which the Company owns a noncontrolling interest, and administrative and
management support services to certain other non-dialysis joint ventures in which the Company owns a
noncontrolling interest. Revenues associated with pharmacy services are recognized as prescriptions are filled
and shipped to patients. Revenues associated with disease management services, medical consulting services,
clinical research programs, physician services, ESRD seamless care organizations, and comprehensive care
are recognized in the period services are provided. Revenues associated with direct primary care are
recognized over the membership period. Management fees are principally determined as a percentage of the
managed operations’ revenues or cash collections and in some cases an additional component based upon a
percentage of operating income. Management fees are included in net revenues when earned.

Allowance for uncollectible accounts

Net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the

amounts that will ultimately be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be
associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters. The Company’s policy is to write
off any uncollectible accounts receivable balance only after all collection efforts have been exhausted or when
write off is mandated by federal or state policies or required by certain payor contracts. It is also the
Company’s policy to write off any accounts receivable balance associated with any payors or patients when
the Company receives notification of a bankruptcy filing.

Other income

Other income includes interest income on cash and cash-equivalents and short- and long-term

investments, other non- operating gains from investment transactions, and foreign currency transaction gains
and losses.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at date

of purchase.

Investments in debt and equity securities

The Company classifies certain debt securities as held-to-maturity and records them at amortized cost
based on the Company’s intentions and strategies concerning those investments. Equity securities that have
readily determinable fair values, and certain other financial instruments that have readily determinable fair
values or redemption values, are classified as available for sale and recorded at estimated fair value.

43

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market and consist principally of

pharmaceuticals and dialysis-related supplies. Rebates related to inventory purchases are recorded when
earned and are based on certain qualification requirements which are dependent on a variety of factors
including future pricing levels by the manufacturer and data submission.

Property and equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization and is further
reduced by any impairments. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and
amortization expenses are computed using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets
estimated as follows: buildings, 20 to 40 years; leasehold improvements, the shorter of their economic useful
life or the expected lease term; and equipment and information systems, principally three to eight years.
Disposition gains and losses are included in current operating expenses.

Amortizable intangibles

Amortizable intangible assets and liabilities include non-competition and similar agreements, lease

agreements and hospital acute services contracts, each of which have finite useful lives. Amortization
expense is computed using the straight- line method over the useful lives of the assets estimated as follows:
non-competition and similar agreements, two to ten years; and lease agreements and hospital acute service
contracts, over the term of the lease or contract period, respectively.

Indefinite-lived intangibles

Indefinite-lived intangible assets include international licenses and accreditations that allow the

Company to be reimbursed for providing dialysis services to patients, each of which has an indefinite useful
life.

Equity method and other investments

Equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values are carried on the cost or equity
method, as applicable, net of any other-than-temporary impairment. The Company classifies its cost and
equity method investments as “Equity method and other investments” on its balance sheet. See Note 9 to
these consolidated financial statements for further details.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the difference between the fair value of businesses acquired and the fair value of the

identifiable tangible and intangible net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is assessed by
individual reporting unit for impairment as circumstances warrant and at least annually. An impairment
charge is recorded when a reporting unit’s carrying amount is determined to exceed its fair value. The
Company operates multiple reporting units. See Note 10 to these consolidated financial statements for further
details.

Impairment of equity method and other investments

Equity method and other investments are assessed for other-than-temporary impairment when

significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other-than-temporary impairment may have
occurred. An other-than-temporary impairment charge is recorded when the fair value of an investment has
fallen below its carrying amount and the shortfall is expected to be indefinitely or permanently unrecoverable.

44

Impairment of other long-lived assets

Other long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets, are reviewed for

possible impairment whenever significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment
may have occurred. Such changes can include changes in the Company’s business strategy and plans,
changes in the quality or structure of its relationships with its partners or deteriorating performance of
individual outpatient dialysis centers or other business units. An impairment of an amortizable or depreciable
asset is indicated when the sum of the expected future undiscounted net cash flows identifiable to the related
asset group is less than its carrying amount. Impairment losses are measured based on the difference
between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of the subject asset group and are included in
operating expenses.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment at least annually and whenever

significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred.

Self-insurance

The Company is predominantly self-insured with respect to professional and general liability and

workers’ compensation risks through wholly-owned captive insurance companies, with excess or reinsurance
coverage for additional risk. The Company is also predominantly self-insured with respect to employee
medical and other health benefits. The Company records insurance liabilities for the professional and general
liability, workers’ compensation, and employee health benefit risks that it retains and estimates its liability for
those risks using third party actuarial calculations that are based upon historical claims experience and
expectations for future claims.

Income taxes

Federal and state income taxes are computed at currently enacted tax rates less tax credits using the

asset and liability method. Deferred taxes are adjusted both for items that do not currently have tax
consequences and for the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those previously used to
determine deferred tax assets or liabilities. Tax provisions include amounts that are currently payable,
changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities that arise because of temporary differences between the timing
of when items of income and expense are recognized for financial reporting and income tax purposes,
changes in the recognition of tax positions and any changes in the valuation allowance caused by a change in
judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is established when
necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized.

The Company uses a recognition threshold of more-likely-than-not and a measurement attribute on all

tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in order to be recognized in the financial
statements. Once the recognition threshold is met, the tax position is then measured to determine the actual
amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements.

Stock-based compensation

The Company’s stock-based compensation awards are measured at their estimated fair values on the

date of grant if settled in shares or at their estimated fair values at the end of each reporting period if settled in
cash. The value of stock-based awards so measured is recognized as compensation expense on a cumulative
straight-line basis over the vesting terms of the awards, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Stock-based
compensation to be settled in shares is recorded to the Company’s shareholders’ equity, while stock-based
compensation to be settled in cash is recorded to a liability.

Interest rate cap and swap agreements

The Company often carries a combination of currently effective interest rate caps, forward interest rate

caps, or interest rate swaps on portions of its variable rate debt as a means of hedging its exposure to changes

45

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

in LIBOR interest rates as part of its overall interest rate risk management strategy. These interest rate caps
and swaps are not held for trading or speculative purposes and are typically designated as qualifying cash
flow hedges. See Note 13 to these consolidated financial statements for further details.

Noncontrolling interests

Noncontrolling interests represent third-party equity ownership interests in entities which are

consolidated by the Company for financial statement reporting purposes. As of December 31, 2017, third
parties held noncontrolling equity interests in 589 consolidated legal entities, including 586 legal entities
classified as continuing operations.

Fair value estimates

The Company relies on fair value measurements and estimates for purposes that require the recording,
reassessment, or adjustment of the carrying amounts of certain assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests
subject to put provisions (temporary equity). These purposes can include the accounting for business
combination transactions, impairment assessments for goodwill, investments, or other long-lived assets, and
stock-based compensation, as well as recurring valuations of available for sale securities, noncontrolling
interests in temporary equity, derivative instruments, and/or contingent consideration, as applicable. The
Company has also classified its assets, liabilities and temporary equity into the appropriate fair value
hierarchy levels as defined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). See Note 24 to these
consolidated financial statements for further details.

New accounting standards

On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which
requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of
promised goods or services to customers. In 2015 and 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, ASU2016-08,
ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-11, and ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), each of
which amends the guidance in ASU 2014-09. These ASUs will replace most existing revenue recognition
guidance in U.S. GAAP.

The Company will adopt these ASUs beginning January 1, 2018 using the cumulative effect method and

will apply these ASUs only to those contracts that are not completed contracts as of that date with no
cumulative effect adjustment. In preparation for the adoption of these ASUs, the Company has concluded that
this guidance will result in a change to the presentation of its revenues, provision for uncollectible accounts
and allowance for doubtful accounts, which will result in the Company’s provision for uncollectible accounts
being recorded as a reduction to revenue. The guidance will also require additional disaggregated revenue
disclosures. The guidance will not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position,
results of operations, equity or cash flows. The Company expects to benefit from certain policy elections
related to its adoption of these standards of approximately $30,000 in the first half of 2018.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10):

Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The amendments in this ASU revise
accounting related to (i) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (ii) the
presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities at fair value. The amendments in this ASU are
effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2018 and are to be applied through a cumulative effect
adjustment to the statement of financial position. Early adoption is permitted under certain circumstances.
The Company is still evaluating certain aspects of this ASU as well as the related impacts it may have on its
consolidated financial statements when adopted on January 1, 2018.

46

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The amendments in this ASU

revise the accounting related to lessee accounting. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to
recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for substantially all leases with lease terms in excess of
twelve months. The new lease guidance also simplifies the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions
primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. The amendments in this ASU are
effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2019 and are to be applied through a modified
retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest
comparative period presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has
assembled an internal lease task force that meets regularly to discuss and evaluate the overall impact of this
guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, as well as the expected timing of
adoption. The Company is currently gathering information from its existing leases and believes that the new
standard will have a material impact on its consolidated balance sheet but will not have a material impact on
its results of operations or liquidity. The Company expects to adopt this ASU on January 1, 2019, and
continues to evaluate the effect that the implementation of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial
statements, related disclosures and controls.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic
323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting. The amendments in this ASU eliminate the
requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the
level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of
operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in
effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The amendments in this ASU were
effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2017 and were applied prospectively. The adoption of this
ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718):

Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The changes required by this ASU involve several
aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences,
classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flow, and an
election on estimating forfeitures. The amendments in this ASU were effective for the Company beginning
January 1, 2017. The method of adoption differs for each of the topics covered by the ASU. The primary effect
of this ASU for the Company is the presentation of excess tax benefits or deficiencies as a component of
income tax expense within the Company’s consolidated statements of income rather than within additional
paid-in capital on its consolidated balance sheet. In addition, these excess tax benefits or deficiencies are
presented as an operating activity rather than as a financing activity on the consolidated statements of cash
flow.

The Company elected to apply the presentation requirements for cash flows related to excess tax

benefits prospectively. Additionally, the Company has elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to
occur in determining the amount of compensation expense to be recognized each period. While this new
standard may cause volatility in the Company’s effective tax rates and diluted earnings per share due to tax
effects of stock awards being recorded within the Company’s consolidated statements of operations, adoption
of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 2017.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of

Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. The amendments in this ASU clarify how certain cash receipts and cash
payments should be classified on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for the Company
beginning January 1, 2018 and is to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. The adoption of this ASU is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements when adopted on January 1,
2018.

47

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of

Assets Other Than Inventory. The amendments in this ASU allow entities to recognize the income tax
consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The
current guidance does not allow recognition until the asset has been sold to an outside party. The
amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2018 and are to be applied on
a modified retrospective basis. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements when adopted on January 1, 2018.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350):

Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The amendments in this ASU simplify the test for goodwill
impairment by eliminating the second step in goodwill impairment assessments. The Company early adopted
this ASU as of January 1, 2017.

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted

Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. The amendments in this ASU better align an entity’s risk
management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both the
designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge
results. The amendments in the new ASU are effective for the Company on January 1, 2019 and are to be
applied prospectively. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements when adopted on January 1, 2018.

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-2, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income
(Topic 220), Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which allows
for the reclassification of certain income tax effects related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act between
“Accumulated other comprehensive income” and “Retained earnings.” This ASU relates to the requirement
that adjustments to deferred tax liabilities and assets related to a change in tax laws or rates to be included in
“Income from continuing operations”, even in situations where the related items were originally recognized in
“Other comprehensive income” (rather than in “Income from continuing operations”). The amendments in
this ASU are effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of this ASU is to be applied either in the
period of adoption or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the change in the tax laws or rates
were recognized. The Company is still evaluating certain aspects of this ASU as well as the related impacts it
may have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to the Company, adjusted for

any change in noncontrolling interest redemption rights in excess of fair value, by the weighted average
number of common shares and vested stock units outstanding, net of shares held in escrow that under certain
circumstances may be returned to the Company.

Diluted earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of outstanding stock-settled stock appreciation

rights (SSARs) and unvested stock units (under the treasury stock method) as well as shares held in escrow
that the Company expects will remain outstanding.

based on the Company’s intentions and strategies concerning those investments. Equity securities that have
readily determinable fair values, and certain other financial instruments that have readily determinable fair

The cost of certificates of deposit, commercial paper and money market funds at December 31, 2017 and
2016 approximate their fair value. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, available for sale investments included
$8,416 and $3,701, respectively, of gross pre-tax unrealized gains. During 2017 and 2016 the Company
recorded gross pre-tax unrealized gains of $5,075 and $1,802, respectively, in other comprehensive income
associated with changes in the fair value of these investments. During 2017, the Company sold investments in
mutual funds and common stock for net proceeds of $6,408, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $360, or $220
after tax, that was previously recorded in other comprehensive income. During 2016, the Company sold
investments in mutual funds and common stock for net proceeds of $14,971, and recognized a pre-tax gain of
$690, or $423 after tax, that was previously recorded in other comprehensive income.

Investments in mutual funds classified as available for sale are held within trusts to fund existing

obligations associated with several of the Company’s non-qualified deferred compensation plans.

4. Accounts receivable

Approximately 21% and 16% of the Company’s net patient services accounts receivable balances as of

December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were more than six months old. The increase was primarily due to
changes the Company made in its collection policies and procedures to improve overall collections. There
were no significant balances over one year old.

Accounts receivable are principally from Medicare and Medicaid programs and commercial insurance

plans. Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts. In evaluating the ultimate
collectability of its accounts receivable, the Company analyzes its historical cash collection experience and
trends for each payor to estimate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts and the amount of the
provision for uncollectible accounts. Management regularly updates its analysis based upon the most recent
information available to it to determine its current provision for uncollectible accounts and the adequacy of its
allowance for doubtful accounts.

For receivables associated with U.S. dialysis and related lab services covered by government payors, like

Medicare, the Company receives 80% of the payment directly from Medicare as established under the
government’s bundled payment system and determines an appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts and
provision for uncollectible accounts on the remaining balance due depending upon the Company’s estimate of

50

the amounts ultimately collectible from other secondary coverage sources or from the patients. For
receivables associated with services to patients covered by commercial payors that are either based upon
contractual terms or for non-contracted health plan coverage, the Company provides an allowance for
doubtful accounts by recording a provision for uncollectible accounts based upon its historical collection
experience, potential inefficiencies in its billing processes and for which collectability is determined to be
unlikely.

Approximately 1% of the Company’s U.S. dialysis and related lab services net accounts receivable are

associated with patient pay and it is the Company’s policy to reserve 100% of the outstanding accounts
receivable balances for dialysis services when those amounts due are outstanding for more than three
months.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts decreased by

$20,498. The decrease in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in write-offs of aged balances from an
increase in uninsured and underinsured uncollectible patient balances related to the U.S. dialysis and related
lab business. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts
decreased by $12,837. The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in the write-offs of patient pay
billings in the Company’s U.S. dialysis business. The decrease was also due to a reduction in accounts
receivable older than six months.

Equity method and other investments

Equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values are carried on the cost or equity

method, as applicable. The Company maintains equity method investments in nonconsolidated investees as
well as minor cost method investments in private securities of certain other healthcare businesses. The
Company classifies its non-marketable cost- and equity method investments as “Equity method and other
investments” on its balance sheet.

As described in Note 20, effective as of August 1, 2016, the Company deconsolidated its Asia Pacific

dialysis business held by DaVita Care Pte. Ltd. (the APAC JV), adjusted its retained investment in the APAC
JV to estimated fair value at that time, and has accounted for this retained investment on the equity method
since that time.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized a non-cash other-than-temporary
impairment charge of $280,066 on its investment in the APAC JV. This charge resulted from changes in its
expectations for the joint venture based on continuing market research and assessments by both the
Company and the APAC JV concerning the size of the addressable market available to the joint venture at
attractive risk-adjusted returns. The Company estimated the fair value of its retained interest in the APAC JV
with the assistance of an independent third party valuation firm based on information available to
management as of December 31, 2017. After this charge, the Company’s investment in the APAC JV was
carried at $160,481 as of December 31, 2017.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded an impairment of $14,993 related to

an investment at one of its other international reporting units.

Total equity method and other investments in nonconsolidated businesses were $245,534 and $492,039

at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in these equity investments was primarily due to

53

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

the impairment of the Company’s investment in the APAC JV. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company
recognized equity investment (loss) income of $(8,640), $16,874 and $13,919, respectively, from its equity
method investments in nonconsolidated businesses.

The Company elected to early adopt ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350):

Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment effective January 1, 2017. The amendments in this ASU simplify the
test for goodwill impairment by eliminating the second step in the assessment. All goodwill impairment tests
performed during 2017 have been performed under this new guidance.

Each of the Company’s operating segments described in Note 25 to these consolidated financial

statements represents an individual reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes, except that each
sovereign jurisdiction within the Company’s international operating segments is considered a separate
reporting unit.

Within the U.S. dialysis and related lab services operating segment, the Company considers each of its

dialysis centers to constitute an individual business for which discrete financial information is available.
However, since these dialysis centers have similar operating and economic characteristics, and the allocation
of resources and significant investment decisions concerning these businesses are highly centralized and the
benefits broadly distributed, the Company has aggregated these centers and deemed them to constitute a
single reporting unit.

The Company has applied a similar aggregation to the vascular access service centers in its vascular
access services reporting unit, to the physician practices in its physician services and direct primary care
reporting units, and to the dialysis centers within each international reporting unit. For the Company’s other
operating segments, discrete business components below the operating segment level constitute individual
reporting units.

54

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of

$28,415 related to the Company’s vascular access reporting unit as a result of changes in future governmental
reimbursement rates for this business and the Company’s expected ability to mitigate them. Specifically, on
November 2, 2016, CMS released the 2017 Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule and the Ambulatory Surgical
Center Payment Final Rule which reflected significant changes in reimbursement structure for this business
unit.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized an additional goodwill impairment

charge of $34,696 at its vascular access reporting unit. This charge resulted primarily from continuing
changes in the Company’s outlook for this business unit as the Company’s partners and operators continued
to evaluate and make decisions concerning changes in operations, including termination of their management
services agreements and center closures, as a result of the changes in reimbursement structure discussed
above. As of December 31, 2017, there was no goodwill remaining at the Company’s vascular access reporting
unit.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company also performed annual impairment assessments

for various other reporting units. As a result of these assessments, the Company also recognized a goodwill
impairment charge of $1,500 at one of its international reporting units during the year ended December 31,
2017. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company also recognized a goodwill impairment charge
of $4,066 at another international reporting unit.

Based on the most recent assessments, the Company determined that reductions in reimbursement
rates, changes in actual or expected growth rates, or other significant adverse changes in expected future
cash flows or valuation assumptions could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future for the
following reporting units, which remain at risk of goodwill impairment as of December 31, 2017:

There were no major changes in the business, prospects, or expected future results of these reporting

units from their latest assessment date through December 31, 2017.

Except as described above, none of the Company’s other reporting units were considered at risk of
significant goodwill impairment as of December 31, 2017. Since the dates of the Company’s last annual
goodwill impairment tests, there have been certain developments, events, changes in operating performance
and other changes in key circumstances that have affected the Company’s businesses. However, except as
further described above, these did not cause management to believe it is more likely than not that the fair
values of any of the Company’s reporting units would be less than their respective carrying amounts as of
December 31, 2017.

Income taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the

recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have
been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined on the basis of the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.

On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the tax legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act (the 2017 Tax Act). The 2017 Tax Act includes a number of changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impact
the Company, most notably a reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% effective
January 1, 2018. The 2017 Tax Act also provides for full expensing of qualified assets placed into service after
September 27, 2017, as well as prospective changes beginning in 2018, imposes a one-time transition tax on
certain foreign subsidiaries, and changes how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax prospectively.

The Company recognized the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act in its 2017 financial statements in
accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which provides SEC staff guidance for the application of
ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, in the reporting period in which the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law. As
such, the Company’s financial results reflect the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act for which accounting
under ASC Topic 740 is complete and provisional amounts, primarily as it relates to the full expensing
provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, for those specific income tax effects for which the accounting is incomplete
but a reasonable estimate could be determined.

The Company has completed the accounting for income taxes with respect to the mandatory one-time

tax on accumulated earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and has determined that there is no mandatory
repatriation and therefore no income tax liability associated with this one-time tax.

The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the
years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid. Accordingly, the Company’s
deferred tax assets and liabilities were remeasured to reflect a reasonable estimate of the reduction in the U.S.
corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, resulting in a provisional $251,510 net tax benefit.

While the Company has substantially completed its provisional analysis of the income tax effects of the

2017 Tax Act and recorded a reasonable estimate of such effects, the net one-time benefit related to the 2017
Tax Act may differ, possibly materially, due to, among other things, further refinement of the underlying

calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions that the Company has made, additional guidance
that may be issued by the U.S. Government, and actions and related accounting policy decisions the Company
may take as a result of the 2017 Tax Act. The Company will complete its analysis over a one-year
measurement period ending December 22, 2018, and any adjustments during this measurement period will be
included in net earnings from continuing operations as an adjustment to income tax expense in the reporting
period in which such adjustments are determined.

At December 31, 2017, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately

$137,852 that expire through 2036, although a substantial amount expire by 2028. The Company also had
state net operating loss carryforwards of $445,554 that expire through 2036 and international net operating
loss carryforwards of $138,717, some of which have an indefinite life. The utilization of a portion of these
losses may be limited in future years based on the profitability of certain entities. The net increase of $5,266
in the valuation allowance is primarily due to newly created net operating loss carryforwards in state and
foreign jurisdictions that the Company does not anticipate being able to utilize.

The 2017 Tax Act includes a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries,
and as a result, all previously unremitted earnings for which no U.S. deferred tax liability had been accrued
would now be subject to U.S. tax. Irrespective of the fact that the Company will not experience any one-time
tax under this provision of the 2017 Tax Act, it intends to continue to indefinitely reinvest these earnings, as
well as capital invested and future earnings from its foreign subsidiaries to fund its international operations. In
addition, the Company expects future U.S. cash generation will be sufficient to meet future U.S. cash needs.
Determination of the amount of any applicable deferred taxes on the earnings is not practical since the
computation would depend on a number of factors that cannot be known unless a decision is made to
repatriate the earnings.

As of December 31, 2017, the Company’s total liability for unrecognized tax benefits relating to tax
positions that do not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold is $32,776, all of which would impact the
Company’s effective tax rate if recognized. This balance represents an increase of $8,710 from the
December 31, 2016 balance of $24,066, primarily due to additions for tax positions related to the current year.

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in its

income tax expense. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had approximately $4,195 and $2,595,
respectively, accrued for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, net of federal tax benefit.

The Company and its subsidiaries file U.S. federal and state income tax returns and various foreign

income tax returns. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal and state examinations by tax
authorities for years before 2013 and 2008, respectively.

Term Loans

Total outstanding borrowings under Term Loan A and Term Loan B can consist of various individual

tranches that can range in maturity from one month to twelve months (currently all tranches are one month in
duration). For Term Loan A and Term Loan B, each tranche bears interest at a London Interbank Offered Rate
(LIBOR) that is determined by the duration of such tranche plus an interest rate margin. The LIBOR variable
component of the interest rate for each tranche is reset as such tranche matures and a new tranche is
established. At December 31, 2017, the overall weighted average interest rate for Term Loan A was
determined based upon the LIBOR interest rates in effect for all of the individual tranches plus the interest
rate margin of 2.00%. At December 31, 2017, Term Loan B bears interest at LIBOR (floor of 0.75%) plus a
margin of 2.75%. The Company is subject to LIBOR-based interest rate volatility on Term Loan B as the
LIBOR-based component of the interest rate exceeded the floor of 0.75% as of December 31, 2017. The
overall weighted average interest rate for Term Loan B was determined based upon the LIBOR interest rates in
effect for all individual tranches plus the interest rate margin.

The Company has several interest rate cap agreements that have the economic effect of capping the

LIBOR variable component of the Company’s interest rate at a maximum of 3.50% on $3,500,000 of
outstanding principal debt. The remaining $652,500 outstanding principal balance of Term Loan A would still
be subject to LIBOR-based interest rate volatility. In addition, the Company maintains several forward interest
rate cap agreements with notional amounts totaling $3,500,000, which will be effective June 29, 2018. The
cap agreements will have the economic effect of capping the LIBOR variable component of the Company’s
interest rate at a maximum of 3.50% on an equivalent amount of the Company’s debt. See below for further
details. The Company is restricted from paying dividends under the terms of its senior secured credit facilities.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company made mandatory principal payments under its

senior secured credit facilities totaling $87,500 on Term Loan A and $35,000 on Term Loan B.

Revolving lines of credit

The Company has $300,000 drawn on its $1,000,000 revolving line of credit under its senior secured

credit facilities, in addition to approximately $14,383 committed for outstanding letters of credit. The
Company also has approximately $90,085 of additional outstanding letters of credit related to Kidney Care
and $211 of committed outstanding letters of credit related to DMG, which is backed by a certificate of
deposit.

Senior Notes

The Company’s senior notes as of December 31, 2017 consisted of $1,500,000 of 5.0% Senior Notes due

2025, $1,750,000 5 1/8% senior notes due 2024 and $1,250,000 of 5 3/4% senior notes due 2022
(collectively Senior Notes).

60

The Senior Notes are unsecured obligations, rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s

existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness, and are guaranteed by substantially all of the Company’s
direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries and require semi-annual interest payments. The
Company may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at any time on or after certain specific dates and at
certain specific redemption prices as outlined in each senior note agreement. The Company is restricted from
paying dividends under the indentures governing its Senior Notes.

Interest rate cap and swap agreements

During the year ended December 31, 2017 the Company had several currently effective and forward

interest rate cap agreements as a means of hedging its exposure to and volatility from variable-based interest
rate changes as part of its overall interest rate risk management strategy. These agreements were not held for
trading or speculative purposes and had the economic effect of capping the Company’s maximum exposure to
LIBOR variable interest rate changes on specific portions of the Company’s floating rate debt, as described
below. These cap agreements are also designated as cash flow hedges and, as a result, changes in the fair
values of these cap agreements are reported in other comprehensive income. The amortization of the original
cap premium is recognized as a component of debt expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the cap
agreements. The cap agreements do not contain credit-risk contingent features.

As of December 31, 2017, the Company maintains several currently effective interest rate cap

agreements that were entered into in November 2014 with notional amounts totaling $3,500,000. These cap
agreements became effective September 30, 2016 and have the economic effect of capping the LIBOR
variable component of the Company’s interest rate at a maximum of 3.50% on an equivalent amount of the
Company’s debt. These cap agreements expire on June 30, 2018. As of December 31, 2017, these cap
agreements had an immaterial fair value. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized
debt expense of $8,278 from these caps. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a
loss of $115 in other comprehensive income due to a decrease in the unrealized fair value of these cap
agreements.

As of December 31, 2017, the Company also maintains several forward interest rate cap agreements that

were entered into in October 2015 with notional amounts totaling $3,500,000. These forward cap
agreements will become effective June 29, 2018 and will have the economic effect of capping the LIBOR
variable component of the Company’s interest rate at a maximum of 3.50% on an equivalent amount of its
debt. These cap agreements expire on June 30, 2020. As of December 31, 2017, the total fair value of these
cap agreements was an asset of approximately $1,032. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the
Company recorded a loss of $8,782 in other comprehensive income due to a decrease in the unrealized fair
value of these cap agreements.

As of December 31, 2017, the Company’s Term Loan B debt bears interest at LIBOR plus an interest rate
margin of 2.75%. Term Loan B is subject to an interest rate cap if LIBOR should rise above 3.50%. Term Loan
A bears interest at LIBOR plus an interest rate margin of 2.00%. The capped portion of Term Loan A is
$122,500. In addition, the uncapped portion of Term Loan A, which is subject to the variability of LIBOR, is
$652,500. See above for further details. Interest rates on the Company’s Senior Notes are fixed by their
terms.

The Company’s overall weighted average effective interest rate on the senior secured credit facilities was

4.45%, based upon the current margins in effect of 2.00% for Term Loan A and the Revolver and 2.75% for
Term Loan B, as of December 31, 2017.

The Company’s overall weighted average effective interest rate during the year ended December 31, 2017

was 4.70% and as of December 31, 2017 was 4.88%.

Debt expense

Debt expense consisted of interest expense of $406,341, $394,013 and $389,755 and the amortization
and accretion of debt discounts and premiums, amortization of deferred financing costs and the amortization
of interest rate cap agreements of $24,293, $20,103 and $18,625 for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The
interest expense amounts are net of capitalized interest.

14. Leases

The majority of the Company’s facilities are leased under non-cancellable operating leases ranging in

terms from five to fifteen years and which contain renewal options of five to ten years at the fair rental value
at the time of renewal. The Company’s leases are generally subject to periodic consumer price index increases
or contain fixed escalation clauses. The Company also leases certain facilities and equipment under capital
leases.

Rent expense under all operating leases for 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $530,748, $478,531 and

$440,601, respectively. Rent expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for leases
that contain fixed escalation clauses or include abatement provisions. Leasehold improvement incentives are
deferred and amortized to rent expense over the term of the lease. The net book value of property and
equipment under capital leases was $257,772 and $263,438 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Capital lease obligations are included in long-term debt. See Note 13 to these consolidated financial
statements.

15. Employee benefit plans

The Company has a savings plan for substantially all of its Kidney Care employees which has been

established pursuant to the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). The plan allows
for employees to contribute a percentage of their base annual salaries on a tax-deferred basis not to exceed
IRC limitations. The Company has not provided any matching contributions for its Kidney Care employees
through December 31, 2017.

Beginning in 2018, the Company has implemented a 401(k) matching program under which the

Company will match 50% of the employee’s contribution up to 6% of the employee’s salary, subject to
certain limitations. The matching contributions will be subject to certain eligibility and vesting conditions.

The Company also maintains a voluntary compensation deferral plan, the DaVita Voluntary Deferral

Plan. This plan is non-qualified and permits certain employees whose annualized base salary equals or
exceeds a minimum annual threshold amount as set by the Company to elect to defer all or a portion of their
annual bonus payment and up to 50% of their base salary into a deferral account maintained by the
Company. Total contributions to this plan in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $4,497, $5,344 and $4,234,
respectively. Deferred amounts are generally paid out in cash at the participant’s election either in the first or
second year following retirement or in a specified future period at least three to four years after the deferral
election was effective. During 2017, 2016 and 2015 the Company distributed $1,731, $916 and $1,270,
respectively, to participants in this plan. Participants are credited with their proportional amount of annual
earnings from the plan. The assets of this plan are held in a rabbi trust and as such are subject to the claims of
the Company’s general creditors in the event of its bankruptcy. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the total
fair value of assets held in this plan’s trust were $38,816 and $30,192, respectively.

The Company also maintains a legacy Executive Retirement Plan for certain members of management.

This plan is non- qualified and contributions to the plan were made at the discretion of DVA Renal Healthcare
based upon a pre-determined percentage of a participant’s base salary. Effective November 2005, all

63

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

contributions to this plan were discontinued and the balance of the plan assets will be paid out upon
termination or retirement of each individual participant. During 2017, 2016 and 2015 the Company distributed
$1,058 and $149, $25 respectively, to participants in this plan. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the total
fair value of assets held under this plan’s trust was $79 and $1,005, respectively.

The fair value of all of the assets held in plan trusts as of December 31, 2017, and 2016 totaled $38,895

and $31,197, respectively. The assets of these plans are available for sale and as such are recorded at fair value
with changes in the fair market values being recorded in other comprehensive income. Any fair value changes
to the corresponding liability balance are recorded as compensation expense. See Note 3 to these
consolidated financial statements.

Most of the Company’s outstanding employee stock plan awards include a provision accelerating the
vesting of the award in the event of a change of control. The Company also maintains a change of control
protection program for its employees who do not have a significant number of stock awards, which has been
in place since 2001, and which provides for cash bonuses to employees in the event of a change of control.
Based on the market price of the Company’s common stock and shares outstanding on December 31, 2017,
these cash bonuses would total approximately $520,778 if a change of control transaction occurred at that
price and the Company’s Board of Directors did not modify the program. This amount has not been accrued at
December 31, 2017, and would only be accrued upon a change of control. These change of control provisions
may affect the price an acquirer would be willing to pay for the Company.

16. Contingencies

The majority of the Company’s revenues are from government programs and may be subject to

adjustment as a result of: (i) examination by government agencies or contractors, for which the resolution of
any matters raised may take extended periods of time to finalize; (ii) differing interpretations of government
regulations by different Medicare contractors or regulatory authorities; (iii) differing opinions regarding a
patient’s medical diagnosis or the medical necessity of services provided; and (iv) retroactive applications or
interpretations of governmental requirements. In addition, the Company’s revenues from commercial payors
may be subject to adjustment as a result of potential claims for refunds, as a result of government actions or
as a result of other claims by commercial payors.

The Company operates in a highly regulated industry and is a party to various lawsuits, claims, qui tam
suits, governmental investigations and audits (including investigations resulting from its obligation to self-
report suspected violations of law) and other legal proceedings. The Company records accruals for certain
legal proceedings and regulatory matters to the extent that the Company determines an unfavorable outcome
is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2017 and
December 31, 2016, the Company’s total recorded accruals, including DMG, with respect to legal proceedings
and regulatory matters, net of anticipated third party recoveries, were approximately $6,000 and $69,000,
respectively. While these accruals reflect the Company’s best estimate of the probable loss for those matters
as of the dates of those accruals, the recorded amounts may differ materially from the actual amount of the
losses for those matters, and any anticipated third party recoveries for any such losses may not ultimately be
recoverable. Additionally, in some cases, no estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of
amounts accrued, if any, can be made because of the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings and
regulatory matters, which also may be impacted by various factors, including that they may involve
indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or non-monetary remedies;
present novel legal theories or legal uncertainties; involve disputed facts; represent a shift in regulatory policy;
are in the early stages of the proceedings; or result in a change of business practices. Further, there may be
various levels of judicial review available to the Company in connection with any such proceeding.

64

The following is a description of certain lawsuits, claims, governmental investigations and audits and

other legal proceedings to which the Company is subject.

Inquiries by the Federal Government and Certain Related Civil Proceedings

2015 U.S. Office of Inspector General (OIG) Medicare Advantage Civil Investigation: In March 2015, JSA

HealthCare Corporation (JSA), a subsidiary of DMG, received a subpoena from the Office of Inspector
General (OIG) for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) requesting documents and
information for the period from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2013, for certain MA plans for which
JSA provided services. It also requests information regarding JSA’s communications about patient diagnoses
as they relate to certain MA plans generally, and more specifically as related to two Florida physicians with
whom JSA previously contracted. The Company is producing the requested information and is cooperating
with the government’s investigation.

In addition to the subpoena described above, in June 2015, the Company received a civil subpoena from

the OIG covering the period from January 1, 2008 through the present and seeking production of a wide range
of documents relating to the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ (including DMG’s and its subsidiary JSA’s)
provision of services to MA plans and related patient diagnosis coding and risk adjustment submissions and
payments. The Company believes that the request is part of a broader industry investigation into MA patient
diagnosis coding and risk adjustment practices and potential overpayments by the government. The
information requested includes information relating to patient diagnosis coding practices for a number of
conditions, including potentially improper historical DMG coding for a particular condition. With respect to
that condition, the guidance related to that coding issue was discontinued following the Company’s
November 1, 2012 acquisition of HealthCare Partners (now known as the Company’s DMG business), and the
Company notified CMS in April 2015 of the coding practice and potential overpayments. In that regard, the
Company has identified certain additional coding practices which may have been problematic, some of which
were the subject of the Swoben Private Civil Suit, and is in discussions with the DOJ relating to those
practices. The Company is cooperating with the government. In addition, the Company is continuing to review
other DMG coding practices to determine whether there were any improper coding issues. In connection with
the Company’s acquisition of DMG in 2012, the Company has certain indemnification rights against the
sellers and an escrow was established as security for the indemnification. The Company has submitted an
indemnification claim against the sellers secured by the escrow for any and all liabilities incurred relating to
these matters and intends to pursue recovery from the escrow. However, the Company can make no
assurances that the indemnification and escrow will cover the full amount of the Company’s potential losses
related to these matters.

2016 U.S. Attorney Prescription Drug Investigation: In early February 2016, the Company announced that
its pharmacy services’ wholly-owned subsidiary, DaVita Rx, received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from
the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas. The government is conducting a federal False
Claims Act (FCA) investigation concerning allegations that DaVita Rx presented or caused to be presented
false claims for payment to the government for prescription medications, as well as into the Company’s
relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers. The CID covers the period from January 1, 2006 through the
present. In the spring of 2015, the Company initiated an internal compliance review of DaVita Rx during which
it identified potential billing and operational issues, including potential write-offs and discounts of patient co-
payment obligations, and credits to payors for returns of prescription drugs related to DaVita Rx. The
Company notified the government in September 2015 that it was conducting this review of DaVita Rx and
began providing regular updates of its review. Upon completion of its review, the Company filed a self-
disclosure with the OIG in February 2016 and has been working to address and update the practices it
identified in the self-disclosure, some of which overlap with information requested by the U.S. Attorney’s
Office. The OIG informed the Company in February 2016 that its submission was not accepted. They
indicated that the OIG is not expressing an opinion regarding the conduct disclosed or the Company’s legal

65

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

positions. In connection with the Company’s ongoing efforts working with the government the Company
learned that a qui tam complaint had been filed covering some of the issues in the CID and the Company’s
self-disclosure. In December 2017, the Company finalized and executed a settlement agreement with the
government and relators in the qui tam matter and that included total monetary consideration of $63,700, as
previously announced, of which $41,500 was an incremental cash payment and $22,200 was for amounts
previously refunded, and all of which was previously accrued. The government’s investigation into the
Company’s relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers is ongoing and the Company is continuing to
cooperate with the government in this investigation.

2017 U.S. Attorney American Kidney Fund Investigation: On January 4, 2017, the Company was served

with an administrative subpoena for records by the United States Attorney’s Office, District of
Massachusetts, relating to an investigation into possible federal health care offenses. The subpoena covers
the period from January 1, 2007 through the present, and seeks documents relevant to charitable patient
assistance organizations, particularly the American Kidney Fund, including documents related to efforts to
provide patients with information concerning the availability of charitable assistance. The Company is
cooperating with the government and is producing the requested information.

* * *

Although the Company cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these

matters may be resolved (other than as described above), it is not unusual for inquiries such as these to
continue for a considerable period of time through the various phases of document and witness requests and
on-going discussions with regulators. In addition to the inquiries and proceedings specifically identified above,
the Company is frequently subject to other inquiries by state or federal government agencies and/or private
civil qui tam complaints filed by relators. Negative findings or terms and conditions that the Company might
agree to accept as part of a negotiated resolution of pending or future government inquiries or relator
proceedings could result in, among other things, substantial financial penalties or awards against the
Company, substantial payments made by the Company, harm to the Company’s reputation, required changes
to the Company’s business practices, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other
federal health care programs and, if criminal proceedings were initiated against the Company, possible
criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

Shareholder Claims

Peace Officers’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Georgia Securities Class Action Civil Suit: On February 1,

2017, the Peace Officers’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Georgia filed a putative federal securities class action
complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado against the Company and certain executives.
The complaint covers the time period of August 2015 to October 2016 and alleges, generally, that the
Company and its executives violated federal securities laws concerning the Company’s financial results and
revenue derived from patients who received charitable premium assistance from an industry-funded non-
profit organization. The complaint further alleges that the process by which patients obtained commercial
insurance and received charitable premium assistance was improper and “created a false impression of
DaVita’s business and operational status and future growth prospects.” In November 2017, the court
appointed the lead plaintiff and an amended complaint was filed on January 12, 2018. The Company’s
response is due March 13, 2018. The Company disputes these allegations and intends to defend this action
accordingly.

In re DaVita Inc. Stockholder Derivative Litigation: On August 15, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the

District of Delaware consolidated the three previously disclosed shareholder derivative lawsuits: the

66

Blackburn Shareholder action filed on February 10, 2017, the Gabilondo Shareholder action filed on May 30,
2017, and the City of Warren Police and Fire Retirement System Shareholder action filed on June 9, 2017. The
complaint covers the time period from 2015 to present and alleges, generally, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust
enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, corporate waste, and misrepresentations and/or
failures to disclose certain information in violation of the federal securities laws in connection with an alleged
practice to direct patients with government-subsidized health insurance into private health insurance plans to
maximize the Company’s profits. An amended complaint was filed in September 2017, and on December 18,
2017 the Company filed a motion to dismiss and a motion to stay proceedings in the alternative. The
Company disputes these allegations and intends to defend this action accordingly.

Other Proceedings

In addition to the foregoing, from time to time the Company is subject to other lawsuits, demands,
claims, governmental investigations and audits and legal proceedings that arise due to the nature of its
business, including contractual disputes, such as with payors, suppliers and others, employee-related matters
and professional and general liability claims. From time to time, the Company also initiates litigation or other
legal proceedings as a plaintiff arising out of contracts or other matters.

Resolved Matters

Swoben Private Civil Suit: On July 13, 2009, pursuant to the qui tam provisions of the FCA and the

California False Claims Act, James M. Swoben, as relator, filed his initial qui tam action in the United States
District Court for the Central District of California purportedly on behalf of the United States of America and
the State of California against SCAN, and certain other defendants whose identities were under seal. In April
2013, HealthCare Partners (HCP), now known as the Company’s DMG subsidiary, was one of several
defendants served with a civil complaint filed by a former employee of SCAN Health Plan (SCAN), an HMO.
The allegations in the complaint relate to alleged overpayments received from government healthcare
programs, including allegations of violations of the federal FCA and the California False Claims Act and
allegations against HCP relating to patient diagnosis coding. The complaint sought monetary damages and
civil penalties as well as costs and expenses. On October 18, 2017, the relator filed a Notice of Dismissal of the
action as to HCP, and the government consented to the dismissal, as a result of which the suit is now
dismissed, without prejudice.

Solari Post-Acquisition Matter: In 2016, HCP Nevada disclosed to the OIG for the HHS that proper

procedures for clinical and eligibility determinations may not have been followed by Las Vegas Solari Hospice
(Solari), which was acquired in March 2013 and sold in September 2016 by HCP Nevada. In June 2016, the
Company was notified by the OIG that the disclosure submission had been accepted into the OIG’s Self
Disclosure Protocol. HCP Nevada had previously made a disclosure and repayment of overpayments to
National Government Services (NGS), the Medicare Administrative Contractor for HCP Nevada, for claims
submitted by Solari to the federal government prior to DMG’s acquisition of Solari and claims made to the
government post-acquisition for which the sellers had certain responsibilities pursuant to a management
services agreement. In October 2017, the Company finalized and executed a settlement agreement with the
OIG including payment of an immaterial amount.

2011 Suit against the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs: As previously disclosed, the Company had a

pending lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims against the federal government which was originally filed in
May 2011. The lawsuit related to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) underpayment of dialysis
services the Company provided from 2005 through 2011 to veterans pursuant to VA regulations. In the first
quarter of 2017, the Company received a payment of $538,000 related to the settlement with the VA. The
Company’s consolidated entities recognized a net gain of $527,000 on this settlement. The Company’s
nonconsolidated and managed entities recognized a gain of $9,000, of which the Company’s equity investment
share was $3,000. The net effect was a net increase of $530,000 to the Company’s operating income.

2015 U.S. Department of Justice Vascular Access Investigation and Related Qui Tam Litigation: In

November 2015, the Company announced that RMS Lifeline, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
that operates under the name Lifeline Vascular Access (Lifeline), received a CID from the DOJ. The CID
relates to two vascular access centers in Florida that are part of Lifeline’s vascular access business. The CID
covers the period from January 1, 2008 through the present. The Company acquired these two centers in
December 2012. Based on the language of the CID, the DOJ appeared to be looking at whether angiograms
performed at the two centers were medically unnecessary and therefore whether related claims filed with
federal healthcare programs possibly violated the FCA. Lifeline does not perform dialysis services but instead
provides vascular access management services for dialysis patients. The Company cooperated with the
government and produced the requested information. The DOJ investigation was initiated pursuant to a
complaint brought under the qui tam provisions of the FCA (the Complaint). The Complaint was originally
filed under seal in August 2014 in the U.S. District Court, Middle District of Florida, United States ex. rel James
Spafford v. DaVita HealthCare Partners, Inc., et al., Case Number 6:14-cv-1251-Orl-41DAB, naming several
doctors along with the Company as defendants. In December 2015, a First Amended Complaint was filed
under seal. In May 2016, the First Amended Complaint was unsealed. The First Amended Complaint alleged
violations of the FCA due to the submission of claims to the government for allegedly medically unnecessary
angiograms and angiography procedures at the two vascular access centers as well as employment-related
claims. The Complaint covers alleged conduct dating from July 2008, prior to the Company’s acquisition of
the centers, to the present. The DOJ declined to intervene. In January 2017, the Company finalized and
executed a settlement agreement with the relator and the government for an immaterial amount, and in April
2017, the court dismissed the case with prejudice.

Vainer Private Civil Suit: As previously disclosed, the Company received a subpoena for documents from

the OIG relating to the pharmaceutical products Zemplar, Hectorol, Venofer, Ferrlecit and erythropoietin
(EPO), as well as other related matters, covering the period from January 2003 to December 2008. The
Company subsequently learned that the allegations underlying this inquiry were made as part of a civil
complaint filed by relators, Daniel Barbir and Dr. Alon Vainer, pursuant to the qui tam provisions of the federal
FCA. The relators also alleged that the Company’s drug administration practices for the Company’s dialysis
operations for Vitamin D and iron agents from 2003 through 2010 fraudulently created unnecessary waste,
which was billed to and paid for by the government. In June 2015, the Company finalized the terms of the
settlement with plaintiffs, including a settlement amount of $450,000 and attorney fees and other costs of
$45,000 which was paid in 2015.

* * *

Other than as described above, the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of the various legal
proceedings and regulatory matters to which the Company is or may be subject from time to time, including
those described in this Note 16, or the timing of their resolution or the ultimate losses or impact of
developments in those matters, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s revenues,
earnings and cash flows. Further, any legal proceedings or regulatory matters involving the Company, whether
meritorious or not, are time consuming, and often require management’s attention and result in significant
legal expense, and may result in the diversion of significant operational resources, or otherwise harm the
Company’s business, financial results or reputation.

17. Noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions and other commitments

Noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions

The Company has potential obligations to purchase the equity interests held by third parties in several of
its majority- owned joint ventures and other nonconsolidated entities. These obligations are in the form of put

68

provisions that are exercisable at the third-party owners’ discretion within specified periods as outlined in
each specific put provision. If these put provisions were exercised, the Company would be required to
purchase the third-party owners’ equity interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined
multiple of earnings or cash flows attributable to the equity interests put to the Company, which is intended
to approximate fair value. The methodology the Company uses to estimate the fair values of noncontrolling
interests subject to put provisions assumes the higher of either a liquidation value of net assets or an average
multiple of earnings, based on historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators that can
affect future results, as well as other factors. The estimated fair values of noncontrolling interests subject to
put provisions are a critical accounting estimate that involves significant judgments and assumptions and may
not be indicative of the actual values at which the noncontrolling interests may ultimately be settled, which
could vary significantly from the Company’s current estimates. The estimated fair values of noncontrolling
interests subject to put provisions can fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these
noncontrolling interests obligations may be settled will vary significantly depending upon market conditions
including potential purchasers’ access to the capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for
dialysis and non-dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted
marketability of the third-party owners’ equity interests. The amount of noncontrolling interests subject to put
provisions that employ a contractually predetermined multiple of earnings rather than fair value are
immaterial.

The Company has certain other potential commitments to provide operating capital to a number of

dialysis centers that are wholly-owned by third parties or businesses in which the Company owns a
noncontrolling equity interest as well as to physician-owned vascular access clinics or medical practices that
the Company operates under management and administrative service agreements of approximately $5,385.

Certain consolidated joint ventures are originally contractually scheduled to dissolve after terms ranging

from 10 to 50 years. While noncontrolling interests in these limited life entities qualify as mandatorily
redeemable financial instruments, they are subject to a classification and measurement scope exception from
the accounting guidance generally applicable to other mandatorily redeemable financial instruments. Future
distributions upon dissolution of these entities would be valued below the related noncontrolling interest
carrying balances in the consolidated balance sheet.

Other commitments

In January 2017, the Company entered into a Sourcing and Supply Agreement with Amgen USA Inc.

(Amgen) that expires on December 31, 2022, replacing the Company’s prior agreement that was to expire in
2018. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will purchase EPO in amounts necessary to meet no
less than 90% of its requirements for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) through the expiration of the
contract from Amgen. The actual amount of EPO that the Company will purchase will depend upon the
amount of EPO administered during dialysis as prescribed by physicians and the overall number of patients
that the Company serves.

In 2010, the Company entered into an agreement with Fresenius Medical Care (FMC) which committed
the Company to purchase a certain amount of dialysis equipment, parts and supplies from FMC through 2013.
This agreement has been subsequently extended through December 31, 2020. During 2017, 2016 and 2015,
the Company purchased $176,212, $164,766 and $154,566, respectively, of certain equipment, parts and
supplies from FMC.

In 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with Baxter Healthcare (Baxter) which committed the

Company to purchase a certain amount of its hemodialysis non-equipment product supplies, such as
dialyzers, at fixed prices through 2018. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company purchased $166,764,
$162,109 and $112,931 of hemodialysis product supplies from Baxter under this agreement.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

Other than operating leases disclosed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the letters of

credit disclosed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, and the arrangements as described
above, the Company has no off balance sheet financing arrangements as of December 31, 2017.

18. Long-term incentive compensation and shareholders’ equity

Long-term incentive compensation

Long-term incentive program (LTIP) compensation includes both stock-based awards (principally stock-

settled stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and performance stock units) as well as long-term
performance-based cash awards. Long-term incentive compensation expense, which was primarily general
and administrative in nature, was attributed to the Company’s U.S. dialysis and related lab services business,
corporate administrative support, and the ancillary services and strategic initiatives.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718):

Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The changes required by this ASU involve several
aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences,
classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flows, and an
election on estimating forfeitures. The amendments in this ASU were effective for the Company beginning
January 1, 2017. See the New accounting standards section in Note 1 for further details.

The Company’s stock-based compensation awards are measured at their estimated fair values on the

date of grant if settled in shares or at their estimated fair values at the end of each reporting period if settled in
cash. The value of stock-based awards so measured is recognized as compensation expense on a cumulative
straight-line basis over the vesting terms of the awards, adjusted for expected forfeitures.

Stock-based compensation to be settled in shares is recorded to the Company’s shareholders’ equity,

while stock-based compensation to be settled in cash is recorded to a liability. Shares issued upon exercise of
stock awards have generally been issued from authorized but unissued shares.

Long-term incentive compensation plans

The Company’s 2011 Incentive Award Plan (the 2011 Plan) is the Company’s omnibus equity

compensation plan and provides for grants of stock-based awards to employees, directors and other
individuals providing services to the Company, except that incentive stock options may only be awarded to
employees. The 2011 Plan authorizes the Company to award stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock units, restricted stock, and other stock-based or performance-based awards, and is designed
to enable the Company to grant equity and cash awards that qualified as performance-based compensation
under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code for tax years 2017 and prior. The 2011 Plan mandates a
maximum award term of five years and stipulates that stock appreciation rights and stock options be granted
with prices not less than fair market value on the date of grant. The 2011 Plan also requires that full value
share awards such as restricted stock units reduce shares available under the 2011 Plan at a ratio of 3.5:1. The
Company’s nonqualified stock appreciation rights and stock units awarded under the 2011 Plan generally vest
over 36 to 48 months from the date of grant. At December 31, 2017, there were 6,648,199 stock-settled stock
appreciation rights, 1,075,572 stock-settled stock units, 23,000 cash-settled stock appreciation rights and
1,600 cash-settled stock units outstanding, and 27,369,515 shares available for future grants, under the 2011
Plan.

A combined summary of the status of the Company’s stock-settled awards under the 2011 Plan, including

base shares for stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SSARs) and stock-settled stock unit awards is as

The Company granted 15,000 cash-settled stock-based awards during 2017. Liability-classified stock-

based awards contributed $114, $376 and $(236) to stock-based compensation expense for the years ended
December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 the Company had 24,600 liability-
classified stock-based awards outstanding, none of which were vested, and a total stock-based compensation
liability balance of $99.

For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, the aggregate intrinsic value of stock-based
awards exercised was $34,895, $73,944 and $117,260, respectively. At December 31, 2017, the aggregate
intrinsic value of stock-based awards outstanding was $117,722 and the aggregate intrinsic value of stock
awards exercisable was $25,609.

Estimated fair value of stock-based compensation awards

The Company has estimated the grant-date fair value of stock-settled stock appreciation rights awards

using the Black- Scholes-Merton valuation model and stock-settled stock unit awards at intrinsic value on the
date of grant, except for portions of the Company’s performance stock unit awards for which a Monte Carlo
simulation was used to estimate the grant-date fair value. The following assumptions were used in estimating
these values and determining the related stock-based compensation expense attributable to the current
period:

Expected term of the awards: The expected term of awards granted represents the period of time that they
are expected to remain outstanding from the date of grant. The Company determines the expected term of its

71

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

stock awards based on its historical experience with similar awards, considering the Company’s historical
exercise and post-vesting termination patterns, and the terms expected by peer companies in near industries.

Expected volatility: Expected volatility represents the volatility anticipated over the expected term of the award.
The Company determines the expected volatility for its awards based on the volatility of the price of its common stock
over the most recent retrospective period commensurate with the expected term of the award, considering the
volatility expectations implied by the market price of its exchange-traded options and the volatilities expected by peer
companies in near industries.

Expected dividend yield: The Company has not paid dividends on its common stock and does not currently expect

to pay dividends during the term of stock awards granted.

Risk-free interest rate: The Company bases the expected risk-free interest rate on the implied yield currently

available on stripped interest coupons of U.S. Treasury issues with a remaining term equivalent to the expected term
of the award.

A summary of the weighted average valuation inputs described above used for estimating the grant-date

fair value of stock-settled stock appreciation rights awards granted in the periods indicated is as follows:

Expected term . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The Company estimates expected forfeitures based upon historical experience with separate groups of
employees that have exhibited similar forfeiture behavior in the past. Stock-based compensation expense is
recorded only for awards that are expected to vest.

Employee stock purchase plan

The Employee Stock Purchase Plan entitles qualifying employees to purchase up to $25 of the Company’s

common stock during each calendar year. The amounts used to purchase stock are accumulated through
payroll withholdings or through optional lump sum payments made in advance of the first day of the purchase
right period. This compensatory plan allows employees to purchase stock for the lesser of 100% of its fair
market value on the first day of the purchase right period or 85% of its fair market value on the last day of the
purchase right period. Purchase right periods begin on January 1 and July 1, and end on December 31.
Contributions used to purchase the Company’s common stock under this plan for the 2017, 2016 and 2015
participation periods were $22,131, $23,902 and $24,523, respectively. Shares purchased pursuant to the
plan’s 2017, 2016 and 2015 participation periods were 360,368, 438,002 and 413,859, respectively. At
December 31, 2017, there were 7,124,027 shares remaining available for future grants under this plan, after an
additional 7,500,000 shares were approved to the plan by stockholders on June 20, 2016.

The fair value of participants’ purchase rights was estimated as of the beginning dates of the purchase

right periods using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model with the following weighted average
assumptions for purchase right periods in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively: expected volatility of 23%, 22%
and 26%; risk-free interest rate of 1.3%, 0.8% and 0.2%, and no dividends. Using these assumptions, the
weighted average estimated fair value of these purchase rights was $15.19, $16.73 and $18.76 for 2017, 2016
and 2015, respectively.

Long-term incentive compensation expense and proceeds

For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $61,978, $64,956 and
$123,957, respectively, in total long-term incentive program (LTIP) expense, of which $34,431, $34,530 and
$52,665, respectively, was stock-based compensation expense for stock appreciation rights, stock units and
discounted employee stock plan purchases, which are primarily included in general and administrative
expenses. The estimated tax benefits recorded for stock-based compensation in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were
$7,717, $12,731 and $19,689, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, there was $98,015 total estimated
unrecognized compensation expense for outstanding LTIP awards, including $61,166 related to stock- based
compensation arrangements under the Company’s equity compensation and stock purchase plans. The
Company expects to recognize the performance-based cash component of this LTIP expense over a weighted
average remaining period of 1.1 years and the stock-based component of this LTIP expense over a weighted
average remaining period of 1.4 years.

For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company received $13,473, $28,397 and
$45,749, respectively, in actual tax benefits upon the exercise of stock awards. Since the Company issues
stock-settled stock appreciation rights rather than stock options, there have been no cash proceeds from
stock option exercises during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Stock repurchases

During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company repurchased a total of 12,966,672

shares and 16,649,090 shares of its common stock for $810,949 and $1,072,377, or an average price of
$62.54 and $64.41 per share, respectively, pursuant to previously announced authorizations by the Board of
Directors. The Company also repurchased 1,237,800 shares of its common stock for $92,790, or an average
price of $74.96 per share, subsequent to December 31, 2017 through February 22, 2018.

On October 10, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an additional share repurchase
authorization in the amount of $1,252,961. This share repurchase authorization was in addition to the
$247,039 remaining at that time under the Company’s Board of Directors’ prior share repurchase
authorization announced in July 2016. Accordingly, as of February 22, 2018, the Company has a total of
$1,026,326 available under the current Board repurchase authorizations for additional share repurchases.
Although these share repurchase authorizations do not have expiration dates, the Company remains subject
to share repurchase limitations under the terms of its senior secured credit facilities and the indentures
governing its senior notes.

The Company retired all shares held in its treasury effective as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Charter documents & Delaware law

The Company’s charter documents include provisions that may deter hostile takeovers, delay or prevent
changes of control or changes in management, or limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that
they may otherwise determine to be in their best interests. These include provisions prohibiting stockholders
from acting by written consent, requiring 90 days advance notice of stockholder proposals or nominations to
the Board of Directors and granting the Board of Directors the authority to issue up to five million shares of
preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without the need for
further stockholder approval.

The Company is also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which, subject to

exceptions, would prohibit the Company from engaging in any business combinations with any interested
stockholder, as defined in that section, for a period of three years following the date on which that stockholder
became an interested stockholder. These restrictions may discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control
of the Company.

20. Acquisitions and divestitures

Acquisition of Renal Ventures

On May 1, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of 100% of the equity of Colorado-based Renal

Ventures Management, LLC (Renal Ventures) for approximately $359,913 in net cash. Renal Ventures
operated 36 dialysis centers, one uncertified dialysis center and one home program, that provided services to
approximately 2,600 patients in six states. As a part of this transaction, the Company was required to divest

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

three Renal Ventures outpatient dialysis centers, and three outpatient dialysis centers and one uncertified
dialysis center of the Company for approximately $21,219 in net cash. The Company also incurred
approximately $11,950 in transaction and integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2017
associated with this acquisition that are included in general and administrative expenses.

The initial purchase price allocation for the Renal Ventures acquisition is recorded at estimated fair

values based upon the best information available to management and will be finalized when certain
information arranged to be obtained has been received. In particular, certain working capital items, income tax
amounts and the fair value of intangibles and fixed assets are pending final audit, issuance of final tax returns
and valuation reports.

The following table summarizes the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transactions and

recognized at the acquisition date at estimated fair values:

Other routine acquisitions

During 2017, the Company also acquired 30 dialysis centers in the U.S. and 68 dialysis centers outside
the U.S. for a total of $308,550 in net cash, earn-outs of $2,692, and deferred purchase price and liabilities
assumed of $23,748. During 2016, the Company acquired eight dialysis centers in the U.S. and 21 dialysis
centers outside the U.S. for a total of $165,108 in net cash, earn-outs of $1,511, and deferred purchase price of

U.S. for a total of $54,551 in net cash and deferred purchase price of $7,452. The assets and liabilities for all
acquisitions were recorded at their estimated fair values at the dates of the acquisitions and are included in
the Company’s financial statements and operating results from the effective dates of the acquisitions. For
several of the 2017 acquisitions, certain income tax amounts are pending final evaluation and quantification of
any pre-acquisition tax contingencies. In addition, valuation of intangibles and certain other working capital
items relating to several of these acquisitions are pending final quantification.

and 2015 had weighted-average estimated useful lives of seven, seven and eleven years, respectively. The
total amount of goodwill deductible for tax purposes associated with these acquisitions for 2017, 2016, and
2015 was approximately $237,363, $169,379 and $43,823, respectively.

Change in ownership interests in Asia Pacific joint venture

On August 1, 2016, the Company consummated an agreement with Khazanah Nasional Berhad

(Khazanah) and Mitsui and Co., Ltd (Mitsui) whereby Khazanah and Mitsui subscribed to invest a total of
$300,000 over three years in exchange for a 40% total equity interest in the Company’s APAC JV. Khazanah
and Mitsui made initial investments of $50,000 each on August 1, 2016 as well as additional subscribed
contributions of $50,000 each on August 1, 2017. Subsequent to those contributions, the Company now holds
a 60% voting interest and a 73.3% current economic interest in the APAC JV.

Based on the governance structure and voting rights put in place upon the formation of the APAC JV,

certain key decisions affecting the JV’s operations are no longer at the unilateral discretion of the Company,
but rather are shared with the noncontrolling investors. As a result, the Company deconsolidated its Asia
Pacific dialysis business in the third quarter of 2016 and recognized an initial non-cash non-taxable estimated
gain of $374,374 on its retained investment, net of contingent obligations. This retained interest was adjusted
to the Company’s proportionate share of the estimated fair value of the business, as implied by the Khazanah
and Mitsui investment and adjusted for certain time value of money and uncertainty discounts. The Company
then recognized an additional $6,293 gain in the first quarter of 2017 upon resolution of certain post-closing
adjustments related to this transaction.

The Company’s non-cash gain on its retained investment in the APAC JV in the third quarter of 2016 was

computed with the assistance of an independent third party valuation firm and was based upon the best
information available to management at that time. Subsequent to its deconsolidation on August 1 2016, the
Company’s retained interest in the APAC JV has been accounted for under the equity method. See Note 9 for
further details on the accounting for this retained investment and a subsequent other-than-temporary
impairment thereof recognized in 2017.

Contingent earn-out obligations

The Company has several contingent earn-out obligations associated with acquisitions that could result
in the Company paying the former shareholders of acquired companies a total of up to approximately $11,466
if certain EBITDA, operating income performance targets or quality margins are met over the next two to six
years.

Contingent earn-out obligations are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the

contingencies are resolved with changes in the liability due to the remeasurement recognized in earnings. See
Note 24 to these consolidated financial statements for further details. As of December 31, 2017, the Company
estimated the fair value of these contingent earn-out obligations to be $6,388, of which a total of $216 is
included in other liabilities, and the remaining $6,172 is included in other long-term liabilities in the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

21. Held for sale and discontinued operations

DaVita Medical Group (DMG)

On December 5, 2017, we entered into an equity purchase agreement to sell our DMG division to Optum,

a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group Inc., for $4,900,000 in cash, subject to net working capital and other
customary adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in 2018 and is subject to regulatory approval and
other customary closing conditions. As a result of this pending transaction, the DMG business has been
reclassified as held for sale and its results of operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods
presented.

As previously disclosed, the Company’s DMG business has continued to experience declining operating

results in recent years, and prior to being reclassified as held for sale the Company recorded goodwill and
other asset impairment charges for the DMG business of $651,659, $253,000 and $206,169 in 2017, 2016
and 2015, respectively. These charges resulted from continuing developments in the Company’s DMG
business, including recent annual updates to Medicare Advantage benchmark reimbursement rates, changes
in expectations concerning future government reimbursement rates and the Company’s expected ability to
mitigate them, medical cost and utilization trends, commercial pricing pressures, underperformance of certain
DMG business units and other market factors.

DMG acquisitions

During 2017, the Company’s DMG business acquired other medical businesses for a total of $135,416 in

net cash, deferred purchase price of $1,038, and liabilities assumed of $10,145. During 2016, the Company
acquired other medical businesses for a total of $398,748 in net cash and deferred purchase price and
liabilities assumed of $7,694. During 2015, the Company acquired other medical businesses for a total of
$41,918 in net cash and deferred purchase price of $944. For several of the 2017 acquisitions, certain income
tax amounts are pending final evaluation and quantification of any pre-acquisition tax contingencies. In
addition, valuation of medical claims liabilities and certain other working capital items relating to several of
these acquisitions are pending final quantification. The assets and liabilities for all acquisitions were recorded
at their estimated fair values at the dates of the acquisitions and are included in the Company’s current held
for sale assets and liabilities.

22. Variable interest entities

The Company relies on the operating activities of certain entities that it does not directly own or control,

but over which it has indirect influence and of which it is considered the primary beneficiary. These entities
are subject to the consolidation guidance applicable to variable interest entities (VIEs).

Under U.S. GAAP, VIEs typically include entities for which (i) the entity’s equity is not sufficient to

finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support; (ii) the equity holders as a group lack
the power to direct the activities that most significantly influence the entity’s economic performance, the
obligation to absorb the entity’s expected losses, or the right to receive the entity’s expected returns; or
(iii) the voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their obligations to absorb the entity’s losses.

The Company has determined that substantially all of the entities it is associated with that qualify as

VIEs must be included in its consolidated financial statements. A number of these VIEs are within the
Company’s DMG business, which has been reclassified as held for sale and as a discontinued operation in
these financial statements. The Company manages these entities and provides operating and capital funding
as necessary for the entities to accomplish their operational and strategic objectives. A number of these
entities are subject to nominee share ownership or share transfer restriction agreements that effectively
transfer the majority of the economic risks and rewards of their ownership to the Company. In other cases the
Company’s management agreements with these entities include both financial terms and protective and
participating rights to the entities’ operating, strategic and non-clinical governance decisions which transfer
substantial powers over and economic responsibility for the entities to the Company. In some cases such
entities are subject to broad exclusivity or noncompetition restrictions that benefit the Company. Further, in
some cases the Company has contractual arrangements with its related party nominee owners that
effectively indemnify these parties from the economic losses from, or entitle the Company to the economic
benefits of, these entities.

The analyses upon which these consolidation determinations rest are complex, involve uncertainties, and

require significant judgment on various matters, some of which could be subject to different interpretations.

80

At December 31, 2017, these consolidated financial statements include total assets of VIEs of $870,314 and
total liabilities and noncontrolling interests of VIEs to third parties of $475,143, including assets of $595,670
and liabilities and noncontrolling interests of $319,777 related to the Company’s DMG business which is
classified as held for sale.

The Company also sponsors certain deferred compensation plans whose trusts qualify as VIEs and the

Company consolidates each of these plans as their primary beneficiary. The assets of these plans are
recorded in short-term or long-term investments with related liabilities recorded in accrued compensation
and benefits and other long-term liabilities. See Note 15 to these consolidated financial statements for
disclosures on the assets of these consolidated non-qualified deferred compensation plans.

23. Concentrations

Approximately 67%, 64% and 66% of total U.S. dialysis services revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015,

respectively, are from government-based programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid. Related net accounts
receivable and other receivables from Medicare, including Medicare-assigned plans, and Medicaid, including
Managed Medicaid plans, were approximately $869,083 and $831,445, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016,
respectively.

There is no single commercial payor that accounted for more than 10% of total consolidated accounts

receivable or consolidated net revenues at December 31, 2017 and 2016.

24. Fair values of financial instruments

The Company measures the fair value of certain assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to

put provisions (temporary equity) based upon certain valuation techniques that include observable or
unobservable inputs and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing these assets, liabilities,
temporary equity and commitments. The Company has also classified certain assets, liabilities and temporary
equity that are measured at fair value into the appropriate fair value hierarchy levels as defined by the FASB.

Available for sale securities represent investments in various open-ended registered investment

companies, or mutual funds, and are recorded at fair value estimated based upon redemption prices reported
by each mutual fund. See Note 3 to these consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

The interest rate cap agreements are recorded at fair value estimated from valuation models utilizing the
income approach and commonly accepted valuation techniques that use inputs from closing prices for similar
assets and liabilities in active markets as well as other relevant observable market inputs at quoted intervals
such as current interest rates, forward yield curves, implied volatility and credit default swap pricing. The
Company does not believe the ultimate amount that could be realized upon settlement of these interest rate
cap agreements would be materially different from the fair value estimates currently reported. See Note 13 to
these consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

The estimated fair value measurements of contingent earn-out obligations are primarily based on
unobservable inputs, including projected EBITDA. The estimated fair value of these contingent earn-out
obligations is remeasured as of each reporting date and could fluctuate based upon any significant changes in
key assumptions, such as changes in the Company credit risk adjusted rate that is used to discount
obligations to present value.

See Note 17 to these consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company’s methodology

for estimating the fair values of noncontrolling interests subject to put obligations.

Other financial instruments consist primarily of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, other

accrued liabilities and debt. The balances of non-debt financial instruments are presented in the consolidated

82

financial statements at December 31, 2017 and 2016 at their approximate fair values due to the short-term
nature of their settlements. The carrying amount of the Company’s senior secured credit facilities totaled
$4,428,376 as of December 31, 2017, and their fair value was approximately $4,495,649 based upon quoted
market prices. The carrying amount of the Company’s Senior Notes was approximately $4,460,176 at
December 31, 2017 and their fair value was approximately $4,566,175 at December 31, 2017 based upon
quoted market prices.

25. Segment reporting

The Company has consisted of two major divisions, DaVita Kidney Care (Kidney Care) and DaVita

Medical Group (DMG). The Kidney Care division is comprised of the Company’s U.S. dialysis and related lab
services business, various ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including its international operations, and
the Company’s corporate administrative support. The Company’s U.S. dialysis and related lab services
business is its largest line of business and is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services in the U.S. for
patients suffering from chronic kidney failure, also known as ESRD. The Company’s ancillary services and
strategic initiatives consist primarily of pharmacy services, disease management services, vascular access
services, clinical research programs, physician services, direct primary care, ESRD seamless care
organizations and comprehensive care as well as the Company’s international operations.

The Company’s DMG division is a patient- and physician-focused integrated healthcare delivery and
management company with over two decades of providing coordinated outcomes-based medical care in a
cost-effective manner. On December 5, 2017, the Company entered into an equity purchase agreement to sell
its DMG division to Optum, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group Inc. The transaction is expected to close in
2018 and is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. As a result of this pending
transaction, the DMG business has been reclassified as held for sale and its results of operations are reported
as discontinued operations for all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.

The Company’s operating segments have been defined based on the separate financial information that

is regularly produced and reviewed by the Company’s chief operating decision maker in making decisions
about allocating resources to and assessing the financial performance of the Company’s various operating
lines of business. The chief operating decision maker for the Company is its Chief Executive Officer.

The Company’s separate operating segments include its U.S. dialysis and related lab services business,
each of its ancillary services and strategic initiatives, its consolidated international kidney care operations in
each country and under the Saudi Ministry of Health charter, its equity method investment in the Asia Pacific
joint venture, and its other health operations in Europe. The U.S. dialysis and related lab services business
qualifies as a separately reportable segment, and all other ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating
segments, including the international operating segments, have been combined and disclosed in the other
segments category.

The Company’s operating segment financial information included in this report is prepared on the

internal management reporting basis that the chief operating decision maker uses to allocate resources and
assess the financial performance of the Company’s operating segments. For internal management reporting,
segment operations include direct segment operating expenses but generally exclude corporate
administrative support costs, which consist primarily of indirect labor, benefits and long-term incentive-based
compensation expenses of certain departments which provide support to all of the Company’s various
operating lines of business, except to the extent that such costs are charged to and borne by certain ancillary
services and strategic initiatives via internal management fees. These corporate administrative support costs
are reduced by internal management fees received from the Company’s ancillary lines of business.

Subsequent to the issuance of the Company’s fiscal year 2016 consolidated financial statements and

their inclusion in its Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
February 24, 2017 (the 2016 10-K), the Company determined that it had misstated its disclosure of segment
assets at December 31, 2016 in Note 25 to those consolidated financial statements. This misstatement
resulted in an overstatement of “U.S. dialysis and related lab services” segment assets of $338,963 and a
corresponding understatement of “Other—ancillary services and strategic initiatives” segment assets of the
same amount. The Company performed an assessment of the materiality of this misstatement and concluded
that this misstatement as originally disclosed was not materially misleading in its 2016 consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole. The Company therefore has not amended its financial statements filed on its
2016 10-K to correct this misstatement, but has provided the corrected disclosure here.

The following information is presented in accordance with Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X. The operating

and investing activities of the separate legal entities included in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements are fully interdependent and integrated. Revenues and operating expenses of the separate legal
entities include intercompany charges for management and other services. The Company’s Senior Notes are
guaranteed by substantially all of its domestic subsidiaries. Each of the guarantor subsidiaries has guaranteed
the Senior Notes on a joint and several basis. However, the guarantor subsidiaries can be released from their
obligations in the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such subsidiary,
including by merger or consolidation or the sale of all equity interests in such subsidiary owned by the
Company, if such subsidiary guarantor is designated as an unrestricted subsidiary or otherwise ceases to be a
restricted subsidiary, and if such subsidiary guarantor no longer guaranties any other indebtedness of the
Company. Certain domestic subsidiaries, foreign subsidiaries, joint ventures, partnerships and third parties
are not guarantors of the Senior Notes.

Risk Factors

This Annual Report contains statements that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal

securities laws. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties including those discussed
below. The risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones facing our business. In addition, please read
the cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements under the heading “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Risk factors related to our overall business:
If we fail to adhere to all of the complex government laws and regulations that apply to our business, we
could suffer severe consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition and stock price.

Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local government laws and regulations, such as

Medicare and Medicaid payment rules and regulations, federal and state anti-kickback laws, the Stark Law
and analogous state self-referral prohibition statutes, the 21st Century Cures Act, Federal Acquisition
Regulations, the False Claims Act (FCA), the Civil Monetary Penalty statute, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(FCPA) and federal and state laws regarding the collection, use and disclosure of patient health information
(e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)) and the storage, handling,
shipment, disposal and/or dispensing of pharmaceuticals and blood products and other biological materials.
The Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rules impose complex and extensive requirements upon
healthcare providers as well. Moreover, additional laws and regulations potentially affecting providers
continue to be promulgated that may impact us. A violation or departure from any of these legal requirements
may result in government audits, lower reimbursements, significant fines and penalties, the potential loss of
certification, recoupment efforts or voluntary repayments, among other things.

We endeavor to comply with all legal requirements; however, there is no guarantee that we will be able

to adhere to all of the complex government regulations that apply to our business. We further endeavor to
structure all of our relationships with physicians and providers to comply with state and federal anti-kickback
and physician self-referral laws. We utilize considerable resources to monitor laws and regulations and
implement necessary changes. However, the laws and regulations in these areas are complex, changing and
often subject to varying interpretations. For example, if an enforcement agency were to challenge the level of
compensation that we pay our medical directors or the number of medical directors whom we engage, we
could be required to change our practices, face criminal or civil penalties, pay substantial fines or otherwise
experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition as a result
of a challenge to these arrangements.

In addition, failure to report and return overpayments within 60 days of when the overpayment is

identified can lead to a violation of the FCA and associated penalties, as described in further detail below, and
exclusion and penalties under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty statute, including civil monetary penalties of
up to $20,000 (adjusted for inflation) for each item or service for which a person received an identified
overpayment and failed to report and return such overpayment. These obligations to report and return
overpayments could subject our procedures for identifying and processing overpayments to greater scrutiny.
We have made investments in resources to decrease the time it takes to identify, quantify and process
overpayments, and we may be required to make additional investments in the future. From time to time we
may conduct internal compliance reviews, the results of which may involve the identification of overpayments
or other liabilities. An acceleration in our ability to identify and process overpayments could result in us
refunding overpayments to government and other payors more rapidly than we have in the past which could
have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows. Overpayments subject us to refunds and related
damages and potential liabilities.

Additionally, the federal government has used the FCA to prosecute a wide variety of alleged false claims
and fraud allegedly perpetrated against Medicare and state health care programs. Moreover, amendments to

99

Risk Factors (continued)

the federal Anti-Kickback Statute in the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) make claims tainted by anti-
kickback violations potentially subject to liability under the FCA, including qui tam or whistleblower suits. The
penalties for a violation of the FCA range from $5,500 to $11,000 (adjusted for inflation) for each false claim
plus three times the amount of damages caused by each such claim which generally means the amount
received directly or indirectly from the government. On February 3, 2017, the Department of Justice (DOJ)
issued a final rule announcing adjustments to FCA penalties, under which the per claim penalty range
increases to a range from $10,957 to $21,916 for penalties assessed after February 3, 2017, so long as the
underlying conduct occurred after November 2, 2015. Given the high volume of claims processed by our
various operating units, the potential is high for substantial penalties in connection with any alleged FCA
violations.

In addition to the provisions of the FCA, which provide for civil enforcement, the federal government can

use several criminal statutes to prosecute persons who are alleged to have submitted false or fraudulent
claims for payment to the federal government.

Certain civil investigative demands received by us or our subsidiaries specifically reference that they are
in connection with FCA investigations alleging, among other things, that we or our subsidiaries presented or
caused to be presented false claims for payment to the government. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial
statements included in this report for further details.

We are subject to a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) which, for our domestic dialysis business,
requires us to report probable violations of criminal, civil or administrative laws applicable to any federal
health care program for which penalties or exclusions may be authorized under applicable healthcare laws
and regulations. See “If we fail to comply with our Corporate Integrity Agreement, we could be subject to
substantial penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs that could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.”

If any of our operations are found to violate these or other government laws or regulations, we could

suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition and stock price, including:

•

Suspension or termination of our participation in government payment programs;

• Refunds of amounts received in violation of law or applicable payment program requirements;

•

•

Loss of required government certifications or exclusion from government payment programs;

Loss of licenses required to operate healthcare facilities or administer pharmaceuticals in some of
the states in which we operate;

• Reductions in payment rates or coverage for dialysis and ancillary services and related

pharmaceuticals;

• Criminal or civil liability, fines, damages or monetary penalties for violations of healthcare fraud and
abuse laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, Stark Law violations, FCA or other failures
to meet regulatory requirements;

•

Enforcement actions by governmental agencies and/or state claims for monetary damages by
patients who believe their protected health information (PHI) has been used, disclosed or not
properly safeguarded in violation of federal or state patient privacy laws, including HIPAA and the
Privacy Act of 1974;

• Mandated changes to our practices or procedures that significantly increase operating expenses;

100

•

Imposition of and compliance with corporate integrity agreements that could subject us to ongoing
audits and reporting requirements as well as increased scrutiny of our billing and business practices
which could lead to potential fines;

• Termination of relationships with medical directors; and

• Harm to our reputation which could impact our business relationships, affect our ability to obtain

financing and decrease access to new business opportunities, among other things.

We are, and may in the future be, a party to various lawsuits, demands, claims, qui tam suits,
governmental investigations and audits (including investigations resulting from our obligation to self-
report suspected violations of law) and other legal proceedings, any of which could result in, among other
things, substantial financial penalties or awards against us, substantial payments made by us, required
changes to our business practices, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other
federal healthcare programs and possible criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and materially harm our reputation.

We are the subject of a number of investigations and audits by the federal government, as further

described in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. We may be subject to
other investigations and audits by state or federal government agencies and/or private civil qui tam
complaints filed by relators and other lawsuits, demands, claims and legal proceedings.

Responding to subpoenas, investigations and other lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings as well as

defending ourselves in such matters will continue to require management’s attention and cause us to incur
significant legal expense. Negative findings or terms and conditions that we might agree to accept as part of a
negotiated resolution of pending or future government inquiries or relator proceedings could result in, among
other things, substantial financial penalties or awards against us, substantial payments made by us, harm to
our reputation, required changes to our business practices, exclusion from future participation in the
Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs and, in certain cases, criminal penalties, any of
which could have a material adverse effect on us. It is possible that criminal proceedings may be initiated
against us and/ or individuals in our business in connection with investigations by the federal government.
Other than as described in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, we cannot
predict the ultimate outcomes of the various legal proceedings and regulatory matters to which we are or may
be subject from time to time, including those described in the aforementioned sections of this report, or the
timing of their resolution or the ultimate losses or impact of developments in those matters, which could have
a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition. See Note 16 to the
consolidated financial statements included in this report for further details regarding these and other matters.

Disruptions in federal government operations and funding create uncertainty in our industry and could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

A substantial portion of our revenues is dependent on federal healthcare program reimbursement, and

any disruptions in federal government operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition. If the U.S. government defaults on its debt, there could be broad
macroeconomic effects that could raise our cost of borrowing funds, and delay or prevent our future growth
and expansion. Any future federal government shutdown, U.S. government default on its debt and/or failure
of the U.S. government to enact annual appropriations could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, disruptions in federal government operations may
negatively impact regulatory approvals and guidance that are important to our operations, and create
uncertainty about the pace of upcoming healthcare regulatory developments.

101

Risk Factors (continued)

Healthcare reform could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

We cannot predict how employers, private payors or persons buying insurance might react to the

changes brought on by federal and state healthcare reform legislation, including the ACA and any subsequent
legislation, or what form many of these regulations will take before implementation.

The ACA introduced healthcare insurance exchanges, which provide a marketplace for eligible

individuals and small employers to purchase healthcare insurance. The business and regulatory environment
continues to evolve as the exchanges mature, and statutes and regulations are challenged, changed and
enforced. If commercial payor participation in the exchanges continues to decrease, it could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we cannot predict the
short- or long-term effects of these factors, we believe the healthcare insurance exchanges could result in a
reduction in ESRD patients covered by traditional commercial insurance policies and an increase in the
number of patients covered through the exchanges under more restrictive commercial plans with lower
reimbursement rates or higher deductibles and co-payments that patients may not be able to pay. To the
extent that the ongoing implementation of such exchanges or changes in statutes or regulations, or
enforcement of statutes or regulations regarding the exchanges results in a reduction in reimbursement rates
for our services from commercial and/or government payors, it could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

The ACA also added several new tax provisions that, among other things, impose various fees and excise
taxes, and limit compensation deductions for health insurance providers and their affiliates. These rules could
negatively impact our cash flow and tax liabilities. In addition, the ACA broadened the potential for penalties
under the FCA for the knowing and improper retention of overpayments collected from government payors
and reduced the timeline to file Medicare claims. As a result, we made significant investments in new
resources to accelerate the time it takes us to identify, quantify and process overpayments and we deployed
significant resources to reduce our timeline and improve our claims processing methods to ensure that our
Medicare claims are filed in a timely fashion. However, we may be required to make additional investments in
the future. Failure to timely identify and return overpayments may result in significant penalties, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Failure to file a
claim within the one year window could result in payment denials, adversely affecting our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

With the ACA, new models of care emerge and evolve and other initiatives in the government or private

sector may arise, which could adversely impact our business. For example, the CMS Innovation Center
(Innovation Center) is currently working with various healthcare providers to develop, refine and implement
Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) and other innovative models of care for Medicare and Medicaid
beneficiaries, including Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Initiative, CEC Model (which includes the
development of ESRD Seamless Care Organizations), the Duals Demonstration, and other models. We are
currently participating in the CEC Model with the Innovation Center, including with organizations in Arizona,
Florida, and adjacent markets in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Our U.S. dialysis business may choose to
participate in additional models either as a partner with other providers or independently. Even in areas where
we are not directly participating in these or other Innovation Center models, some of our patients may be
assigned to an ACO, another ESRD Care Model, or another program, in which case the quality and cost of care
that we furnish will be included in an ACO’s, another ESRD Care Model’s, or other program’s calculations.
Additionally, CMS instituted new screening procedures, as required by the ACA, which we expect will delay
the Medicare contractor approval process, potentially causing a delay in reimbursement. We anticipate the
new screening and enrollment requirements will require additional personnel and financial resources and will
potentially delay the enrollment and revalidation of our centers which in turn will delay payment. These delays
could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The BBA revised the manner

102

in which beneficiaries are assigned to an ACO, specifically giving ACOs the choice to have beneficiaries
assigned prospectively at the beginning of a performance year and giving beneficiaries the option to
voluntarily align to the ACO in which the beneficiary’s main primary care provider participates. While
prospective assignment may allow ACOs to identify beneficiaries for whom they will be held accountable and
proactively take steps to ensure appropriate care, the ultimate impact of such changes on our business,
results of operations and financial condition is not yet known.

Other ACA reform measures allow CMS to place a moratorium on new enrollment of providers and to

suspend payment to providers upon a credible allegation of fraud from any source. These types of reform
measures, as well as other measures, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial
condition, depending on the scope and breadth of the implementing regulations.

There is also a considerable amount of uncertainty as to the prospective implementation of the ACA and

what similar measures or other changes might be enacted at the federal and/or state level. There have been
multiple attempts through legislative action and legal challenges to repeal or amend the ACA. In addition, the
2016 Presidential and Congressional elections and subsequent developments in 2017 have caused the future
state of the exchanges and other ACA reforms to be unclear. For example, in October 2017, the federal
government announced that cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers would end, effective immediately,
unless Congress appropriated the funds, and, in December 2017, Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,
which includes a provision that eliminates the penalty under the ACA’s individual mandate and could impact
the future state of the exchanges. Further, in February 2018, Congress passed the BBA which, among other
things, repealed the Independent Payment Advisory Board that was established by the ACA and intended to
reduce the rate of growth in Medicare spending. While certain provisions of the BBA may increase the scope
of benefits available for certain chronically ill Federal health care program beneficiaries beginning in 2020, the
ultimate impact of such changes cannot be predicted. While there may be significant changes to the
healthcare environment in the future, the specific changes and their timing are not yet apparent. As a result,
there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the ACA including the exchanges, and, indeed, many core
aspects of the current health care marketplace. Previously enacted reforms and future changes could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including, for example,
by limiting the scope of coverage or the number of patients who are able to obtain coverage through the
exchanges and other health insurance programs, lowering or eliminating the cost-sharing reduction subsidies
under the ACA, lowering our reimbursement rates, and/or increasing our expenses.

In addition, in December 2016, CMS published an interim final rule that questioned the use of charitable
premium assistance for ESRD patients and would have established new conditions for coverage standards for
dialysis facilities. In January 2017, a federal district court in Texas issued a preliminary injunction on CMS’
interim final rule and in June 2017, at the request of CMS, the court stayed the proceedings while CMS
pursues new rulemaking options. In November 2017, when CMS published the 2018 final rule that updates
payment policies and rates under the ESRD PPS, and the 2019 proposed Notice of Benefit and Payment
Parameters, it did not pursue further discussion or rule making related to charitable premium assistance or
propose changes to historical charitable premium assistance guidelines. This does not preclude CMS or
another regulatory agency or legislative authority from issuing a new rule or guidance that challenges
charitable premium assistance. Additionally, any other law, rule, or guidance issued by CMS or other
regulatory or legislative authorities restricting or prohibiting the ability of patients with access to alternative
coverage from selecting a marketplace plan on or off exchange, and/or otherwise restricting or prohibiting the
use of charitable premium assistance, could adversely impact dialysis centers across the U.S. making certain
centers economically unviable, restrict the ability of dialysis patients to obtain and maintain optimal insurance
coverage, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

103

Risk Factors (continued)

Privacy and information security laws are complex, and if we fail to comply with applicable laws,
regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize sensitive
personal information on our behalf, or if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data, protect our
proprietary rights to our systems or defend against cybersecurity attacks, we may be subject to
government or private actions due to privacy and security breaches, any of which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or harm our reputation.

We must comply with numerous federal and state laws and regulations in both the U.S. and the foreign
jurisdictions in which we operate governing the collection, dissemination, access, use, security and privacy of
PHI, including HIPAA and its implementing privacy, security, and related regulations, as amended by the
federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) and collectively
referred to as HIPAA. We are also required to report known breaches of PHI consistent with applicable breach
reporting requirements set forth in applicable laws and regulations. From time to time, we may be subject to
both federal and state inquiries or audits related to HIPAA, HITECH and related state laws associated with
complaints, desk audits, and self-reported breaches. If we fail to comply with applicable privacy and security
laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize sensitive
personal information, including PHI, on our behalf, properly maintain the integrity of our data, protect our
proprietary rights, or defend against cybersecurity attacks, it could harm our reputation or have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Information security risks have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation
of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct our operations,
and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external
parties, including foreign state agents. Our business and operations rely on the secure processing,
transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer systems and
networks, including sensitive personal information, including PHI, social security numbers, and credit card
information of our patients, teammates, physicians, business partners and others.

We are continuously implementing multiple layers of security measures through technology, processes,

and our people. We utilize security technologies to protect and maintain the integrity of our information
systems and data and our defenses are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties.
Despite these efforts, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be
vulnerable to privacy and security incidents; security attacks and breaches; acts of vandalism or theft;
computer viruses and other malicious code; coordinated attacks by activist entities; emerging cybersecurity
risks; misplaced or lost data; programming and/or human errors; or other similar events that could impact the
security, reliability, and availability of our systems. Internal or external parties may attempt to circumvent our
security systems, and we have in the past, and expect that we will in the future, experience external attacks on
our network including reconnaissance probes, denial of service attempts, malicious software attacks including
attacks intended to render our internal operating systems unavailable, and phishing attacks. Cybersecurity
requires ongoing investment and diligence against evolving threats. Emerging and advanced security threats,
including coordinated attacks, require additional layers of security which may disrupt or impact efficiency of
operations. As with any security program, there always exists the risk that employees will violate our policies
despite our compliance efforts or that certain attacks may be beyond the ability of our security and other
systems to detect. There can be no assurance that investments and diligence will be sufficient to prevent or
timely discover an attack.

Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of

confidential information, including PHI, financial data, competitively sensitive information, or other proprietary
data, whether by us or a third party, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
and results of operations and materially harm our reputation. We may be required to expend significant

104

additional resources to modify our protective measures, to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other
exposures, or to make required notifications. The occurrence of any of these events could, among other
things, result in interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of data, cessations in the availability of systems
and liability under privacy and security laws, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or results of operations, materially harm our reputation and trigger regulatory actions and
private party litigation. If we are unable to protect the physical and electronic security and privacy of our
databases and transactions, we could be subject to potential liability and regulatory action, our reputation and
relationships with our patients and vendors would be harmed, and our business, results of operations and
financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Failure to adequately protect and maintain the
integrity of our information systems (including our networks) and data, or to defend against cybersecurity
attacks, could subject us to monetary fines, civil suits, civil penalties or criminal sanctions and requirements to
disclose the breach publicly, and could further result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition or harm our reputation. As malicious cyber activity escalates, including
activity that originates outside of the United States, the risks we face relating to transmission of data and our
use of service providers outside of our network, as well as the storing or processing of data within our
network, intensify. There have been increased federal and state HIPAA and other privacy and security
enforcement efforts and we expect this trend to continue. While we maintain cyber liability insurance, this
insurance may not cover us for all types of losses and may not be sufficient to protect us against the amount
of all losses.

We may engage in acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or dispositions, which may affect our results of
operations, debt- to-capital ratio, capital expenditures or other aspects of our business, and if businesses
we acquire have liabilities we are not aware of, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our business strategy includes growth through acquisitions of dialysis centers and other businesses, as

well as entry into joint ventures. We may engage in acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or dispositions or
expand into new business models, which may affect our results of operations, debt-to-capital ratio, capital
expenditures or other aspects of our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify
suitable acquisition targets or merger partners or buyers for dispositions or that, if identified, we will be able
to agree to terms with merger partners, acquire these targets or make these dispositions on acceptable terms
or on the desired timetable. There can also be no assurance that we will be successful in completing any
acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we announce, executing new business models or integrating any
acquired business into our overall operations. There is no guarantee that we will be able to operate acquired
businesses successfully as stand- alone businesses, or that any such acquired business will operate profitably
or will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. Further, we cannot be certain that key talented individuals at the business being acquired will
continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they will be able to continue to successfully manage or
have adequate resources to successfully operate any acquired business. In addition, certain of our newly and
previously acquired dialysis centers and facilities have been in service for many years, which may result in a
higher level of maintenance costs. Further, our facilities, equipment and information technology may need to
be improved or renovated to maintain or increase operational efficiency, compete for patients and medical
directors, or meet changing regulatory requirements. Increases in maintenance costs and capital expenditures
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Businesses we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities or liabilities that are in excess of the
amounts that we originally estimated, and may have other issues, including those related to internal controls
over financial reporting or issues that could affect our ability to comply with healthcare laws and regulations
and other laws applicable to our expanded business. As a result, we cannot make any assurances that the
acquisitions we consummate will be successful. Although we generally seek indemnification from the sellers
of businesses we acquire for matters that are not properly disclosed to us, we are not always successful. In
addition, even in cases where we are able to obtain indemnification, we may discover liabilities greater than

105

Risk Factors (continued)

the contractual limits, the amounts held in escrow for our benefit (if any), or the financial resources of the
indemnifying party. In the event that we are responsible for liabilities substantially in excess of any amounts
recovered through rights to indemnification or alternative remedies that might be available to us, or any
applicable insurance, we could suffer severe consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

Additionally, joint ventures, including our Asia Pacific Joint Venture (APAC JV), and minority

investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially
increasing the financial, legal, operational and/ or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or
minority investment. In addition, we may be dependent on joint venture partners, controlling shareholders or
management who may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Business
decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partner, controlling shareholders or management
may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, result in
reputational harm to us or adversely affect the value of our investment or partnership.

If we are not able to continue to make acquisitions at the desired pace or at all, or maintain an acceptable
level of non- acquired growth, or if we face significant patient attrition to our competitors or we are not
able to retain or contract with an adequate number of medical directors or associated physicians, it could
adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Acquisitions, patient retention and medical director and physician retention are an important part of our

growth strategy. We face intense competition from other companies for acquisition targets. In our U.S.
dialysis business, we continue to face increased competition from large and medium-sized providers, which
compete directly with us for the limited acquisition targets as well as for individual patients and medical
directors. In addition, we compete for individual patients and medical directors based in part on the quality of
our facilities. Moreover, as we continue our international expansion into various international markets, we will
face competition from large and medium-sized providers for these acquisition targets as well. As we and our
competitors continue to grow and open new dialysis centers, each center is required by applicable regulations
to have a medical director, and we may not be able to retain an adequate number of nephrologists to serve as
medical directors. Because of the ease of entry into the dialysis business and the ability of physicians to be
medical directors for their own centers, competition for growth in existing and expanding markets is not
limited to large competitors with substantial financial resources. Individual nephrologists have opened their
own dialysis units or facilities. In addition, Fresenius USA, our largest competitor, manufactures a full line of
dialysis supplies and equipment in addition to owning and operating dialysis centers. This may give it cost
advantages over us because of its ability to manufacture its own products. If we are not able to continue to
make acquisitions at the desired pace or at all, continue to maintain acceptable levels of non-acquired growth,
or if we face significant patient attrition to our competitors or if a physician chooses not to refer to DaVita, it
could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

If certain of our suppliers do not meet our needs, if there are material price increases, if we are not
reimbursed or adequately reimbursed for drugs we purchase or if we are unable to effectively access new
technology or superior products, it could negatively impact our ability to effectively provide the services
we offer and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

We have significant suppliers that may be the sole or primary source of products critical to the services
we provide, or to which we have committed obligations to make purchases, sometimes at particular prices. If
any of these suppliers do not meet our needs for the products they supply, including in the event of a product
recall, shortage or dispute, and we are not able to find adequate alternative sources, if we experience material
price increases from these suppliers that we are unable to mitigate, or if some of the drugs that we purchase

106

are not reimbursed or not adequately reimbursed by commercial or government payors, it could have a
material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the
technology related to the products critical to the services we provide is subject to new developments which
may result in superior products. If we are not able to access superior products on a cost-effective basis or if
suppliers are not able to fulfill our requirements for such products, we could face patient attrition which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

DMG operates in a different line of business from our historical business, and we face challenges managing
DMG and may not realize anticipated benefits.

DMG operates in a different line of business from our historical business. We may not have the expertise,

experience and resources to pursue all of our businesses at once, and we may be unable to successfully
operate all businesses in the combined company. The administration of DMG requires implementation of
appropriate operations, management, forecasting, and financial reporting systems and controls. We have
experienced difficulties in effectively implementing these and other systems. The management of DMG
requires and will continue to require the focused attention of our management team, including a significant
commitment of its time and resources. The need for management to focus on these matters could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If the DMG operations
continue to be less profitable than we currently anticipate or we do not have the experience, the appropriate
expertise or the resources to pursue all businesses in the combined company, our results of operations and
financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. In that regard, we have taken goodwill
impairment charges of $1.093 billion in total and may continue incurring additional impairment charges.

Laws regulating the corporate practice of medicine could restrict the manner in which DMG and other
subsidiaries of ours are permitted to conduct their respective business, and the failure to comply with such
laws could subject these entities to penalties or require a restructuring of these businesses.

Some states have laws that prohibit business entities, such as DMG and other subsidiaries of ours,

including but not limited to, Nephrology Practice Solutions, Paladina Health, DaVita Health Solutions,
VillageHealth, and Lifeline, from practicing medicine, employing physicians to practice medicine, exercising
control over medical decisions by physicians (also known collectively as the corporate practice of medicine)
or engaging in certain arrangements, such as fee-splitting, with physicians. In some states these prohibitions
are expressly stated in a statute or regulation, while in other states the prohibition is a matter of judicial or
regulatory interpretation. Of the states in which DMG currently operates, California, Colorado, Nevada and
Washington generally prohibit the corporate practice of medicine, and other states may as well.

DMG and other DaVita entities operate by maintaining long-term contracts with their associated
physician groups which are each owned and operated by physicians and which employ or contract with
additional physicians to provide physician services. Under these arrangements, DMG and such other DaVita
entities provide management services and receive a management fee for providing non-medical management
services; however, DMG and such other DaVita entities do not represent that they offer medical services, and
do not exercise influence or control over the practice of medicine by the physicians or the associated
physician groups.

In addition to the above management arrangements, DMG has certain contractual rights relating to the

orderly transfer of equity interests in certain of its physician groups through succession agreements and other
arrangements with their physician equity holders. However, such equity interests cannot be transferred to or
held by DMG or by any non-professional organization. Accordingly, neither DMG nor DMG’s subsidiaries
directly own any equity interests in any physician groups in California, Colorado, Nevada and Washington.
The other DaVita entities operating in these and multiple other states have similar agreements and
arrangements. In the event that any of these associated physician groups fail to comply with the management
arrangement or any management arrangement is terminated and/or DMG or any of the other DaVita entities

107

Risk Factors (continued)

is unable to enforce its contractual rights over the orderly transfer of equity interests in its associated
physician groups, such events could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and
financial condition of DMG and such other DaVita entities.

It is possible that a state regulatory agency or a court could determine that DMG’s agreements with

physician equity holders of certain managed California, Colorado, Nevada and Washington associated
physician groups and the way DMG carries out these arrangements as described above, either independently
or coupled with the management services agreements with such associated physician groups, are in violation
of the corporate practice of medicine doctrine. As a result, these arrangements could be deemed invalid,
potentially resulting in a loss of revenues and an adverse effect on results of operations derived from such
associated physician groups. Such a determination could force a restructuring of DMG’s management
arrangements with associated physician groups in California, Colorado, Nevada and/or Washington, which
might include revisions of the management services agreements, including a modification of the management
fee and/or establishing an alternative structure that would permit DMG to contract with a physician network
without violating the corporate practice of medicine prohibition. There can be no assurance that such a
restructuring would be feasible, or that it could be accomplished within a reasonable time frame without a
material adverse effect on DMG’s business, results of operations and financial condition. These same risks
exist for the other DaVita entities utilizing similar structures.

In December 2013, DHPC obtained a restricted Knox-Keene license in California, which permits DHPC to

contract with health plans in California to accept global risk without violating the corporate practice of
medicine prohibition. However, DMG and DMG’s Colorado, Nevada and Washington associated physician
groups, as well as those physician equity holders of associated physician groups who are subject to
succession agreements with DMG, could be subject to criminal or civil penalties or an injunction for practicing
medicine without a license or aiding and abetting the unlicensed practice of medicine.

The level of our current and future debt could have an adverse impact on our business and our ability to
generate cash to service our indebtedness and for other intended purposes depends on many factors
beyond our control.

We have substantial debt outstanding, we incurred a substantial amount of additional debt in connection
with the acquisition of DMG and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including in anticipation
of receiving the cash proceeds from the sale of DMG. For additional details regarding specific risks we face
regarding the sale of DMG, see the discussion in the risk factors under the heading “Risk factors related to the
sale of DMG.” Our inability to generate sufficient cash to service our substantial indebtedness and for other
intended purposes could have important consequences to you, for example, it could:

• make it difficult for us to make payments on our debt securities;

•

•

•

•

•

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our
indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital
expenditures, acquisitions and investments, repurchases of stock at the levels intended or
announced, or at all, and other general corporate purposes;

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which
we operate;

expose us to interest rate volatility that could adversely affect our business, results of operations
and financial condition, and our ability to service our indebtedness;

place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and

108

•

limit our ability to borrow additional funds, or to refinance existing debt on favorable terms when
otherwise available.

In addition, we expect to continue to incur additional indebtedness in the future, and the amount of that

additional indebtedness may be substantial. Although the indentures governing our senior notes and the
agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities include covenants that could limit our indebtedness,
we currently have the ability to incur substantial additional debt. If new debt is added to current debt levels,
the related risks described above could intensify, in particular, if we were to borrow new debt in anticipation
of receiving the cash proceeds from the pending sale of DMG and if there is a delay in closing the sale of DMG
or the sale of DMG does not close.

Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness, to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion
efforts, including any strategic acquisitions we may make in the future, to repurchase our stock at the levels
intended or announced and to meet our other liquidity needs, will depend on our ability to generate cash. This,
to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are
beyond our control.

After the pending sale of DMG closes, our cash flows will be reduced accordingly. We cannot provide
assurances that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future or that future
borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund
other liquidity needs, including those described above. If we are unable to generate sufficient funds to service
our outstanding indebtedness or to meet our other liquidity needs, including the intended purposes described
above, we may be required to refinance, restructure, or otherwise amend some or all of such obligations, sell
assets, change our intended or announced uses or strategy for capital deployment, including for stock
repurchases, reduce capital expenditures or planned expansions or raise additional cash through the sale of
our equity. We cannot make any assurances that any such refinancing, restructurings, sales of assets, or
issuances of equity can be accomplished or, if accomplished, can be accomplished on favorable terms or that
if accomplished that they would raise sufficient funds to meet these obligations or our other liquidity needs.

The borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are guaranteed by a substantial portion of our

direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, including certain of DMG’s subsidiaries, and are
secured by a substantial portion of our and our subsidiaries’ assets, including those of certain of DMG’s
subsidiaries. After the sale of DMG closes, we will have fewer assets with which to secure future debt or
refinance or restructure existing debt. This will likely reduce the total amount of secured debt that we will be
able to incur and may increase the interest rate we are required to pay on our existing secured debt and any
secured debt we issue in the future. In addition, by reducing the amount of assets available to meet the claims
of our secured creditors, it may also adversely affect the interest rates on our existing unsecured debt and any
unsecured debt we issue in the future.

We may be subject to liability claims for damages and other expenses that are not covered by insurance or
exceed our existing insurance coverage that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations, financial condition and reputation.

Our operations and how we manage our Company may subject us, as well as our officers and directors to
whom we owe certain defense and indemnity obligations, to litigation and liability for damages. Our business,
profitability and growth prospects could suffer if we face negative publicity or we pay damages or defense
costs in connection with a claim that is outside the scope or limits of coverage of any applicable insurance
coverage, including claims related to adverse patient events, contractual disputes, professional and general
liability and directors’ and officers’ duties. In addition, we have received notices of claims from commercial
payors and other third parties, as well as subpoenas and CIDs from the federal government, related to our
business practices, including our historical billing practices and the historical billing practices of acquired
businesses. Although the ultimate outcome of these claims cannot be predicted, an adverse result with

109

Risk Factors (continued)

respect to one or more of these claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. We maintain insurance coverage for those risks we deem are appropriate
to insure against and make determinations about whether to self- insure as to other risks or layers of
coverage. However, a successful claim, including a professional liability, malpractice or negligence claim
which is in excess of any applicable insurance coverage, or that is subject to our self-insurance retentions,
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.
Additionally, as a result of the broad scope of our DMG division’s medical practice, we are exposed to medical
malpractice claims, as well as claims for damages and other expenses, that may not be covered by insurance
or for which adequate limits of insurance coverage may not be available.

In addition, if our costs of insurance and claims increase, then our earnings could decline. Market rates
for insurance premiums and deductibles have been steadily increasing. Our business, results of operations
and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by any of the following:

•

•

•

•

the collapse or insolvency of our insurance carriers;

further increases in premiums and deductibles;

increases in the number of liability claims against us or the cost of settling or trying cases related to
those claims; or

an inability to obtain one or more types of insurance on acceptable terms, if at all.

If we fail to successfully maintain an effective internal control over financial reporting, the integrity of our
financial reporting could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
accurately report our financial results and the market’s perception of our business and our stock price.

The integration of acquisitions and addition of new business lines into our internal control over financial
reporting has required and will continue to require significant time and resources from our management and
other personnel and has increased, and will continue to, increase our compliance costs. Failure to maintain an
effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to accurately report
our financial results and the market’s perception of our business and our stock price. In addition, we could be
required to restate our financial results in the event of a significant failure of our internal control over financial
reporting or in the event of inappropriate application of accounting principles.

Deterioration in economic conditions and further disruptions in the financial markets could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Deterioration in economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. Among other things, the potential decline in federal and state revenues
that may result from such conditions may create additional pressures to contain or reduce reimbursements
for our services from Medicare, Medicaid and other government sponsored programs. Increases in job losses
in the U.S. as a result of adverse economic conditions has and may continue to result in a smaller percentage
of our patients being covered by an employer group health plan and a larger percentage being covered by
lower paying Medicare and Medicaid programs. Employers may also select more restrictive commercial plans
with lower reimbursement rates. To the extent that payors are negatively impacted by a decline in the
economy, we may experience further pressure on commercial rates, a further slowdown in collections and a
reduction in the amounts we expect to collect. In addition, uncertainty in the financial markets could adversely
affect the variable interest rates payable under our credit facilities or could make it more difficult to obtain or
renew such facilities or to obtain other forms of financing in the future, if at all. Any or all of these factors, as
well as other consequences of a deterioration in economic conditions which cannot currently be anticipated,
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

110

We could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our
tax positions.

We are subject to tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments as well as

various foreign jurisdictions. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the
jurisdictions in which we operate. As the tax rates vary among jurisdictions, a change in earnings attributable
to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax
provision.

From time to time, changes in tax laws or regulations may be proposed or enacted that could adversely

affect our overall tax liability. For example, the recent U.S. tax legislation enacted on December 22, 2017
represents a significant overhaul of the U.S. federal tax code. This tax legislation significantly reduced the U.S.
statutory corporate tax rate and made other changes that we expect will reduce our effective U.S. federal tax
rate in future periods. However, the tax legislation also included a number of provisions, including, but not
limited to, the limitation or elimination of various deductions or credits (including for interest expense and for
performance-based compensation under Section 162(m)), the imposition of taxes on certain cross- border
payments or transfers, the changing of the timing of the recognition of certain income and deductions or their
character, and the limitation of asset basis under certain circumstances, any of which could significantly and
adversely affect our U.S. federal income tax position. The legislation also made significant changes to the tax
rules applicable to insurance companies and other entities with which we do business. The estimated impact
of the new law is based on management’s current knowledge and assumptions. We are continuing to evaluate
the overall impact of this tax legislation on our operations and U.S. federal and state income tax position. The
actual impact of the new law could be materially different from our current estimates based on our actual
results and our further analysis of the new law. There can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or
regulations, both within the U.S. and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, will not materially and
adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly,
changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our patients, business partners and counterparties or the
economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and any

significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise
to substantial penalties and liabilities. We are regularly subject to audits by tax authorities and, although we
believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could
be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Any changes in enacted tax
laws (such as the recent U.S. tax legislation), rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations; any adverse
outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction; or any change in the pronouncements relating to
accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our effective tax rate, tax payments,
financial condition and results of operations.

Expansion of our operations to and offering our services in markets outside of the U.S. subjects us to
political, economic, legal, operational and other risks that could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

We are continuing to expand our operations by offering our services and entering new lines of business
in certain markets outside of the U.S., which increases our exposure to the inherent risks of doing business in
international markets. Depending on the market, these risks include those relating to:

•

•

•

•

changes in the local economic environment;

political instability, armed conflicts or terrorism;

social changes;

intellectual property legal protections and remedies;

111

Risk Factors (continued)

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

trade regulations;

procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement and marketing of
products and services;

foreign currency;

repatriating or moving to other countries cash generated or held abroad, including considerations
relating to tax- efficiencies and changes in tax laws;

export controls;

lack of reliable legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce contractual rights;

changes in local laws or regulations;

potentially longer ramp-up times for starting up new operations and for payment and collection
cycles;

financial and operational, and information technology systems integration;

failure to comply with U.S. laws, such as the FCPA, or local laws that prohibit us, our partners, or our
partners’ or our intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose
of obtaining or retaining business; and

•

data and privacy restrictions.

Issues relating to the failure to comply with any of the above may also impact our domestic business

and/or raise scrutiny on our domestic practices.

Additionally, some factors that will be critical to the success of our international business and operations

will be different than those affecting our domestic business and operations. For example, conducting
international operations requires us to devote significant management resources to implement our controls
and systems in new markets, to comply with local laws and regulations and to overcome the numerous new
challenges inherent in managing international operations, including those based on differing languages,
cultures and regulatory environments, and those related to the timely hiring, integration and retention of a
sufficient number of skilled personnel to carry out operations in an environment with which we are not
familiar.

Any expansion of our international operations through acquisitions or through organic growth could

increase these risks. Additionally, while we may invest material amounts of capital and incur significant costs
in connection with the growth and development of our international operations, including to start up or
acquire new operations, we may not be able to operate them profitably on the anticipated timeline, or at all.

These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial

condition.

Risk factors related to the sale of DMG:

The announcement and pendency of the sale of DMG may adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

The announcement and pending sale of DMG may be disruptive to our business and may adversely affect

our relationships with current and prospective teammates, patients, physicians, payors, suppliers and other

112

business partners. Uncertainties related to the pending sale of DMG may impair our ability to attract, retain
and motivate key personnel and could cause suppliers and other business partners to defer entering into
contracts with us or seek to change existing business relationships with us. The loss or deterioration of
significant business and operational relationships could have an adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. In addition, activities relating to the pending sale and related uncertainties
could divert the attention of our management and other teammates from our day-to-day business or disrupt
our operations in preparation for and during the post-closing separation of DMG. It is also possible that we
could have stranded costs following the closing of the pending sale, which could be material. If we are unable
to effectively manage these risks, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely
affected.

If we fail to complete the proposed sale of DMG, or if there is a significant delay in completing the sale, our
business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price may be materially adversely affected.

The completion of the proposed sale of DMG is subject to customary closing conditions, including the

expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the approval of a notice of material modification by the
California Department of Managed Health Care. If any condition to the closing of the sale of DMG is neither
satisfied nor, where permissible, waived, the sale of DMG will not be completed. In addition, satisfying the
closing conditions to the sale of DMG may take longer than expected. Regulators may impose material
conditions, terms, obligations, costs or restrictions in connection with their approval of or consent to the sale
of DMG, which could delay completion of the transaction, or if such approvals or consents are not obtained,
could prevent completion of the transaction. There can be no assurance that all of the closing conditions will
be satisfied or waived or that other events will not intervene to delay, or result in a failure to close, the sale of
DMG. In addition, either we or Optum may terminate the equity purchase agreement if, among other things,
the sale has not been consummated by June 4, 2018 (subject to two three-month extensions that can be
exercised by either party unilaterally). If the equity purchase agreement is terminated and our Board of
Directors seeks an alternative transaction or another acquiror for the sale of the DMG business, we may not
be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the
equity purchase agreement with Optum.

If the sale of DMG is not completed for any reason, investor confidence could decline. A failed

transaction may result in negative publicity and may affect our relationships with teammates, patients,
physicians, payors, suppliers, regulators and other business partners. In addition, in the event of a failed
transaction, we will have expended significant management resources in an effort to complete the sale, we
have incurred additional debt in anticipation of receiving the sale proceeds but not have received the sale
proceeds to repay such debt, and we will have incurred significant transaction costs, including legal fees,
financial advisor fees and other related costs, without any commensurate benefit. Accordingly, if the proposed
sale of DMG is not completed, or if there is a significant delay in completing the sale, our business, results of
operations, financial condition and stock price may be materially adversely affected.

We may not be able to use the proceeds from the sale of DMG as planned or we may spend or invest the
proceeds in ways that may not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common
stock.

The purchase price for the sale of the DMG business is subject to customary adjustments, both upward
and downward, which could be significant. We plan to use the proceeds from the sale of DMG for significant
stock repurchases, to repay debt and for general corporate purposes, including growth investments. A number
of factors may impact our ability to repurchase stock and the timing of any such stock repurchases, including
market conditions, the price of our common stock, our cash flow position, leverage ratios, and legal, regulatory
and contractual requirements and restrictions.

113

Risk Factors (continued)

In addition, we may identify investments or other uses for the proceeds from the sale of DMG that we

believe are more attractive than our current intended uses. Further, there can be no assurance that any
investment of the proceeds from the sale of DMG will yield a favorable return.

Under the terms of the equity purchase agreement, we are subject to certain contractual restrictions while
the sale of DMG is pending, and certain post-closing contractual obligations that, in some cases, could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Under the terms of the equity purchase agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct
of the DMG business prior to completing the sale of DMG, which may adversely affect our ability to execute
certain of our business strategies, including the ability in certain cases to enter into or amend contracts,
acquire or dispose of assets, incur indebtedness or incur capital expenditures. Such limitations could
negatively affect our business and operations prior to the completion of the sale of DMG. Each of these risks
may be exacerbated by delays or other adverse developments with respect to the completion of the sale of
DMG.

In addition, we agreed to retain certain liabilities of the DMG business for which we have certain
indemnification rights against the original 2012 HealthCare Partners (“HCP”) sellers. An escrow was
established in connection with our acquisition of the DMG business from the HCP sellers as security for these
indemnification rights, including with respect to the OIG investigation into certain patient diagnosis coding
practices. We have submitted an indemnification claim against the sellers secured by the escrow for any and
all liabilities incurred relating to these matters and intend to pursue recovery from the escrow. However, we
can make no assurances that the indemnification and escrow will cover the full amount of our potential losses
related to these matters, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

Risk factors related to our U.S. dialysis and related lab services, ancillary services and strategic initiatives:

If patients in commercial plans are subject to restriction in plan designs or the average rates that
commercial payors pay us decline significantly, it would have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

Approximately 33% of our dialysis services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were

generated from patients who have commercial payors (including hospital dialysis services) as their primary
payor. The majority of these patients have insurance policies that pay us on terms and at rates that are
generally significantly higher than Medicare rates. The payments we receive from commercial payors
generate nearly all of our profit and all of our nonacute dialysis profits come from commercial payors. We
continue to experience downward pressure on some of our commercial payment rates as a result of general
conditions in the market, including as employers shift to less expensive options for medical services, recent
and future consolidations among commercial payors, increased focus on dialysis services and other factors. In
addition, many commercial payors that sell individual plans both on and off exchange have publicly
announced losses in the marketplace. These payors may seek discounts on rates for marketplace plans on and
off exchange. Commercial payment rates could be materially lower in the future.

We continuously are in the process of negotiating existing and potential new agreements with

commercial payors who aggressively negotiate terms with us. Sometimes many significant agreements are
being renegotiated at the same time. In the event that our continual negotiations result in overall commercial
rate reductions in excess of overall commercial rate increases, the cumulative effect could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Consolidations have significantly
increased the negotiating leverage of commercial payors. Our negotiations with payors are also influenced by

114

competitive pressures, and we may experience decreased contracted rates with commercial payors or
experience decreases in patient volume as our negotiations with commercial payors continue. In addition to
downward pressure on contracted commercial payor rates, payors have been attempting to design and
implement plans to restrict access to coverage, and the duration and/or the breadth of benefits, which may
result in decreased payments. In addition, payors have been attempting to impose restrictions and limitations
on patient access to commercial exchange plans and non-contracted or out-of-network providers, and in
some circumstances designate our centers as out-of-network providers. Rates for commercial exchange
products and out-of-network providers are on average higher than rates for government products and in-
network providers, respectively.

A number of commercial payors have incorporated policies into their provider manuals limiting or

refusing to accept charitable premium assistance from non-profit organizations, such as the American Kidney
Fund, which may impact the number of patients who are able to afford commercial exchange plans. Paying for
coverage is a significant financial burden for many patients, and ESRD disproportionately affects the low-
income population. Charitable premium assistance supports continuity of coverage and access to care for
patients, many of whom are unable to continue working full-time as a result of their severe condition. A
material restriction in patients’ ability to access charitable premium assistance may restrict the ability of
dialysis patients to obtain and maintain optimal insurance coverage, and may adversely impact a large
number of dialysis centers across the U.S. by making certain centers economically unviable, and may have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We also believe commercial payors have or will begin to restructure their benefits to create disincentives

for patients to stay with commercial insurance or to select or remain with out-of-network providers. In addition,
payors may seek to decrease payment rates for out-of-network providers. Decreases in the number of patients
with commercial plans, decreases in out-of- network rates and restrictions on out-of-network access, our
turning away new patients in instances where we are unable to come to agreement on rates, or decreases in
contracted rates could result in a significant decrease in our overall revenues derived from commercial payors. If
the average rates that commercial payors pay us decline significantly, or if we see a decline in commercial
patients, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
For additional details regarding specific risks we face regarding regulatory changes that could result in fewer
patients covered under commercial plans or an increase of patients covered under more restrictive commercial
plans with lower reimbursement rates, see the discussion in the risk factor under the heading “Healthcare reform
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”

If the number of patients with higher-paying commercial insurance declines, it could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our revenue levels are sensitive to the percentage of our patients with higher-paying commercial

insurance coverage. A patient’s insurance coverage may change for a number of reasons, including changes in
the patient’s or a family member’s employment status. Any changes impacting our highest paying commercial
payors will have a disproportionate impact on us. In addition, many patients with commercial and government
insurance rely on financial assistance from charitable organizations, such as the American Kidney Fund.
Certain payors have challenged our patients’ and other providers’ patients’ ability to utilize assistance from
charitable organizations for the payment of premiums, including through litigation and other legal
proceedings. Regulators have also questioned the use of charitable premium assistance for ESRD patients.
CMS or another regulatory agency or legislative authority may issue a new rule or guidance that challenges
charitable premium assistance. If any of these challenges to kidney patients’ use of premium assistance are
successful or restrictions are imposed on the use of financial assistance from such charitable organizations
such that kidney patients are unable to obtain, or continue to receive or receive for a limited duration, such
financial assistance, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. In addition, if our assumptions about how kidney patients will respond to any change in financial
assistance from charitable organizations are incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

115

Risk Factors (continued)

When Medicare becomes the primary payor, the payment rate we receive for that patient decreases

from the employer group health plan or commercial plan rate to the lower Medicare payment rate. The
number of our patients who have government-based programs as their primary payors could increase and the
percentage of our patients covered under commercial insurance plans could be negatively impacted as a
result of improved mortality or declining macroeconomic conditions. To the extent there are sustained or
increased job losses in the U.S., independent of whether general economic conditions improve, we could
experience a decrease in the number of patients covered under commercial plans and/or an increase in
uninsured and underinsured patients. We could also experience a further decrease in the payments we
receive for services if changes to the healthcare regulatory system result in fewer patients covered under
commercial plans or an increase of patients covered under more restrictive commercial plans with lower
reimbursement rates. In addition, our continual negotiations with commercial payors under existing and
potential new agreements could result in a decrease in the number of our patients covered by commercial
plans to the extent that we cannot reach agreement with commercial payors on rates and other terms,
resulting in termination or non-renewals of existing agreements and our inability to enter into new
agreements. Commercial payors have taken and may continue to take steps to control the cost of and/or the
eligibility for access to healthcare services, including relative to products on and off the healthcare exchanges.
These efforts could impact the number of our patients who are eligible to enroll in commercial insurance
plans, and remain on the plans, including plans offered through healthcare exchanges. Additionally, we
continue to experience higher amounts of write-offs due to uninsured and underinsured patients, which has
resulted in an increase in uncollectible accounts. Commercial payors could also cease paying in the primary
position after providing 30 months of coverage resulting in a material reduction in payment as the patient
moves to Medicare primary. If there is a significant reduction in the number of patients under higher-paying
commercial plans relative to government-based programs that pay at lower rates or a significant increase in
the number of patients that are uninsured and underinsured, it would have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

Changes in the structure of and payment rates under the Medicare ESRD program could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Approximately 42% of our dialysis services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were

generated from patients who have Medicare as their primary payor. For patients with Medicare coverage, all
ESRD payments for dialysis treatments are made under a single bundled payment rate which provides a fixed
payment rate to encompass all goods and services provided during the dialysis treatment, including
pharmaceuticals that were historically separately reimbursed to the dialysis providers, such as EPO, vitamin D
analogs and iron supplements, irrespective of the level of pharmaceuticals administered or additional services
performed. Most lab services are also included in the bundled payment. Under the ESRD PPS, the bundled
payments to a dialysis facility may be reduced by as much as 2% based on the facility’s performance in
specified quality measures set annually by CMS through the ESRD Quality Incentive Program, which was
established by the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008. The bundled payment
rate is also adjusted for certain patient characteristics, a geographic usage index and certain other factors. In
addition, the ESRD PPS is subject to rebasing, which can have a positive financial effect, or a negative one if
the government fails to rebase in a manner that adequately addresses the costs borne by dialysis facilities.
Similarly, as new drugs, services or labs are added to the ESRD bundle, CMS’ failure to adequately calculate
the costs associated with the drugs, services or labs could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

116

The current bundled payment system presents certain operating, clinical and financial risks, which

include:

• Risk that our rates are reduced by CMS. Uncertainty about future payment rates remains a material

risk to our business. Each year, CMS publishes a final rule for the PPS, which has been phasing in
reductions to the PPS base rate mandated by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 as modified
by the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014.

• Risk that CMS, through its contracted MACs or otherwise, implements Local Coverage

Determinations (LCDs) or other decisions that limit the frequency a provider can bill Medicare for
home dialysis treatments or other rules that may impact reimbursement. Such coverage
determinations could have an adverse impact on our revenue. There is also risk commercial insurers
could incorporate the requirements or limitations associated with such LCDs into their contracted
terms with dialysis providers, which could have an adverse impact on our revenue.

• Risk that a MAC, or multiple MACs, change their interpretations of existing regulations, manual

provisions and/or guidance; or seek to implement or enforce new interpretations that are
inconsistent with how we have interpreted existing regulations, manual provisions and/or guidance.

• Risk that increases in our operating costs will outpace the Medicare rate increases we receive. We
expect operating costs to continue to increase due to inflationary factors, such as increases in labor
and supply costs, including increases in maintenance costs and capital expenditures to improve,
renovate and maintain our facilities, equipment and information technology to meet changing
regulatory requirements, regardless of whether there is a compensating inflation-based increase in
Medicare payment rates or in payments under the bundled payment rate system.

• Risk of federal budget sequestration cuts. As a result of the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the BBA,

an annual 2% reduction to Medicare payments took effect on April 1, 2013 and has been extended
through 2027. These across- the-board spending cuts have affected and will continue to adversely
affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

• Risk that, if our clinical systems fail to accurately capture the data we report to CMS in connection

with claims for which at least part of the government’s payments to us is based on clinical
performance or patient outcomes or co- morbidities, we might be over-reimbursed by the
government, which could subject us to certain liability. For example, CMS published a final rule that
implemented a provision of the ACA, requiring providers to report and return Medicare and
Medicaid overpayments within the later of (a) 60 days after the overpayment is identified, or (b)
the date any corresponding cost report is due, if applicable. An overpayment impermissibly retained
under this statute could subject us to liability under the FCA, exclusion, and penalties under the
federal Civil Monetary Penalty statute.

For additional details regarding the risks we face for failing to adhere to our Medicare and Medicaid

regulatory compliance obligations, see the risk factor above under the heading “If we fail to adhere to all of the
complex government laws and regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences
that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock
price.”

Changes in state Medicaid or other non-Medicare government-based programs or payment rates could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Approximately 25% of our dialysis services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were

generated from patients who have state Medicaid or other non-Medicare government-based programs, such
as coverage through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), as their primary coverage. As state
governments and other governmental organizations face increasing budgetary pressure, we may in turn face

117

Risk Factors (continued)

reductions in payment rates, delays in the receipt of payments, limitations on enrollee eligibility or other
changes to the applicable programs. For example, certain state Medicaid programs and the VA have recently
considered, proposed or implemented payment rate reductions.

The VA adopted Medicare’s bundled PPS pricing methodology for any veterans receiving treatment from

non-VA providers under a national contracting initiative. Since we are a non-VA provider, these
reimbursements are tied to a percentage of Medicare reimbursement, and we have exposure to any dialysis
reimbursement changes made by CMS. Approximately 3% of our dialysis services revenues for the year
ended December 31, 2017 were generated by the VA.

In 2013, we entered into a five-year Nationwide Dialysis Services contract with the VA which is subject to
one-year renewal periods, consistent with all provider agreements with the VA under this contract. During the
length of the contract, the VA has elected not to make adjustments to reimbursement percentages that are
tied to a percentage of Medicare reimbursement rates. These agreements provide the VA with the right to
terminate the agreements without cause on short notice. Should the VA renegotiate, or not renew or cancel
these agreements for any reason, we may cease accepting patients under this program and may be forced to
close centers or experience lower reimbursement rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

State Medicaid programs are increasingly adopting Medicare-like bundled payment systems, but

sometimes these payment systems are poorly defined and are implemented without any claims processing
infrastructure, or patient or facility adjusters. If these payment systems are implemented without any
adjusters and claims processing changes, Medicaid payments will be substantially reduced and the costs to
submit such claims may increase, which will have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and
financial condition. In addition, some state Medicaid program eligibility requirements mandate that citizen
enrollees in such programs provide documented proof of citizenship. If our patients cannot meet these proof
of citizenship documentation requirements, they may be denied coverage under these programs, resulting in
decreased patient volumes and revenue. These Medicaid payment and enrollment changes, along with similar
changes to other non- Medicare government programs could reduce the rates paid by these programs for
dialysis and related services, delay the receipt of payment for services provided and further limit eligibility for
coverage which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

Changes in clinical practices, payment rates or regulations impacting EPO and other pharmaceuticals could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and negatively
impact our ability to care for patients.

Medicare bundles EPO into the PPS such that dosing variations do not change the amount paid to a

dialysis facility. Although some Medicaid programs and other payors suggest movement towards a bundled
payment system inclusive of EPO, some non-Medicare payors continue to pay for EPO separately from the
treatment rate.

Additionally, evaluations on the utilization and reimbursement for ESAs, which have occurred in the past

and may occur in the future, and related actions by the U.S. Congress and federal agencies, could result in
further restrictions on the utilization and reimbursement for ESAs. Commercial payors have increasingly
examined their administration policies for EPO and, in some cases, have modified those policies. Changes in
labeling of EPO and other pharmaceuticals in a manner that alters physician practice patterns, including their
independent determinations as to appropriate EPO dosing, or accepted clinical practices, and/or changes in
private and governmental payment criteria, including the introduction of EPO administration policies could

118

have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further increased
utilization of EPO for patients for whom the cost of EPO is included in a bundled reimbursement rate, or
further decreases in reimbursement for EPO and other pharmaceuticals that are not included in a bundled
reimbursement rate, could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition. Additionally, as of January 1, 2018, calcimimetics entered the Medicare ESRD bundle. We
implemented processes to provide the drug as required under the regulations and prescribed by physicians
and have entered into agreements to provide for access to and distribution of the drug. If Medicare Advantage
plans and/or Medicaid do not pay as required or the processes we have implemented to provide the drug do
not perform as anticipated, then we could be subject to both financial and operational risk.

We may be subject to increased inquiries or audits from a variety of governmental bodies or claims by

third parties. Although we believe our anemia management practices and other pharmaceutical
administration practices have been compliant with existing laws and regulations, increased inquiries or audits
from governmental bodies or claims by third parties would require management’s attention, and could result
in significant legal expense. Any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties or repayment
obligations, the imposition of certain obligations on and changes to our practices and procedures as well as
the attendant financial burden on us to comply with the obligations, or exclusion from future participation in
the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

If we fail to comply with our Corporate Integrity Agreement, we could be subject to substantial penalties
and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs that could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

In October 2014, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the United States and relator David

Barbetta to resolve the then pending 2010 and 2011 U.S. Attorney physician relationship investigations and
paid $406 million in settlement amounts, civil forfeiture, and interest to the United States and certain states.
In connection with the resolution of these matters, and in exchange for the OIG’s agreement not to exclude us
from participating in the federal healthcare programs, we have entered into a five-year CIA with the OIG. The
CIA (i) requires that we maintain certain elements of our compliance programs; (ii) imposes certain expanded
compliance-related requirements during the term of the CIA; (iii) requires ongoing monitoring and reporting
by an independent monitor, imposes certain reporting, certification, records retention and training obligations,
allocates certain oversight responsibility to the Board’s Compliance Committee, and necessitates the creation
of a Management Compliance Committee and the retention of an independent compliance advisor to the
Board; and (iv) contains certain business restrictions related to a subset of our joint venture arrangements,
including our agreeing to (1) unwind 11 joint venture transactions that were created through partial
divestitures to, or partial acquisitions from, nephrologists, and that cover 26 of our 2,119 clinics that existed at
the time we entered into the Settlement Agreement, all of which have been completed, (2) not enter into
certain types of partial divestiture joint venture transactions with nephrologists during the term of the CIA,
(3) non- enforcement of certain patient-related non-solicitation restrictions, and (4) certain other restrictions.
The costs associated with compliance with the CIA could be substantial and may be greater than we currently
anticipate. In addition, in the event of a breach of the CIA, we could become liable for payment of certain
stipulated penalties, and could be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs. The OIG
notified us that it considered us to be previously in breach of the CIA because of three implementation
deficiencies. While we have remediated the deficiencies and have paid certain stipulated penalties, we cannot
provide any assurances that we may not be found in breach of the CIA in the future. In general, the costs
associated with compliance with the CIA, or any liability or consequences associated with a breach, could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For our domestic
dialysis business, we are required under the CIA to report to the OIG (i) probable violations of criminal, civil or
administrative laws applicable to any federal health care program for which penalties or exclusions may be
authorized under applicable laws and regulations; (ii) substantial overpayments of amounts of money we
have received in excess of the amounts due and payable under the federal healthcare program requirements;

119

Risk Factors (continued)

and (iii) employment of or contracting with individuals ineligible from participating in the federal healthcare
programs (we refer to these collectively as Reportable Events). We have provided the OIG notice of
Reportable Events, and we may identify and report additional events in the future. If any of our operations are
found to violate government laws and regulations, we could suffer severe consequences that could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, including
those consequences described under the risk factor “If we fail to adhere to all of the complex government
laws and regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.”

Delays in state Medicare and Medicaid certification or other licensing and/or anything impacting the
licensing of our dialysis centers could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

Before we can begin billing for patients treated in our outpatient dialysis centers who are enrolled in

government-based programs, we are required to obtain state and federal certification for participation in the
Medicare and Medicaid programs. As state agencies responsible for surveying dialysis centers on behalf of
the state and Medicare program face increasing budgetary pressure, certain states are having difficulty
keeping up with certifying dialysis centers in the normal course resulting in significant delays in certification. If
state governments continue to have difficulty keeping up with certifying new centers in the normal course and
we continue to experience significant delays in our ability to treat and bill for services provided to patients
covered under government programs, it could cause us to incur write-offs of investments or accelerate the
recognition of lease obligations in the event we have to close centers or our centers’ operating performance
deteriorates, and it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Although the BBA passed in February 2018 allows for organizations approved by the Department of Health
and Human Services (HHS) to accredit dialysis facilities and imposes certain timing requirements regarding
the initiation of initial surveys to determine if certain conditions and requirements for payment have been
satisfied, the ultimate impact of these changes cannot be predicted. In addition to certifications for Medicare
and Medicaid, some states have licensing requirements for ESRD facilities. Delays in licensure, denials of
licensure, or withdrawal of licensure could also adversely affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

If our joint ventures were found to violate the law, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

As of December 31, 2017, we owned a controlling interest in numerous dialysis-related joint ventures,

which represented approximately 24% of our net U.S. dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year
ended December 31, 2017. In addition, we also owned noncontrolling equity investments in several other
dialysis related joint ventures. We may continue to increase the number of our joint ventures. Many of our
joint ventures with physicians or physician groups also have certain physician owners providing medical
director services to centers we own and operate. Because our relationships with physicians are governed by
the federal and state anti-kickback statutes, we have sought to structure our joint venture arrangements to
satisfy as many federal safe harbor requirements as we believe are commercially reasonable. However,
although our joint venture arrangements do not satisfy all of the elements of any safe harbor under the federal
Anti-Kickback Statute, they are not automatically prohibited under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute but are
susceptible to government scrutiny. For example, in October 2014, we entered into a Settlement Agreement
with the United States and relator David Barbetta to resolve the then pending 2010 and 2011 U.S. Attorney
physician relationship investigations regarding certain of our joint ventures and paid $406 million in
settlement amounts, civil forfeiture, and interest to the United States and certain states. For further details,
see “If we fail to comply with our Corporate Integrity Agreement, we could be subject to substantial penalties
and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs that could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition”.

120

There are significant risks associated with estimating the amount of dialysis revenues and related refund
liabilities that we recognize, and if our estimates of revenues and related refund liabilities are materially
inaccurate, it could impact the timing and the amount of our revenues recognition or have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

There are significant risks associated with estimating the amount of U.S. dialysis and related lab services

revenues and related refund liabilities that we recognize in a reporting period. The billing and collection
process is complex due to ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing
interpretations of contract coverage and other payor issues. Determining applicable primary and secondary
coverage for approximately 197,800 U.S. patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient
coverage that occur each month, requires complex, resource-intensive processes. Errors in determining the
correct coordination of benefits may result in refunds to payors. Revenues associated with Medicare and
Medicaid programs are also subject to estimating risk related to the amounts not paid by the primary
government payor that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary
coverage, the patient’s commercial health plan secondary coverage or the patient. Collections, refunds and
payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years and longer after services are provided. We
generally expect our range of U.S. dialysis and related lab services revenues estimating risk to be within 1% of
net revenues for the segment. If our estimates of U.S. dialysis and related lab services revenues and related
refund liabilities are materially inaccurate, it could impact the timing and the amount of our revenues
recognition and have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including our pharmacy services and our international
operations, that we invest in now or in the future may generate losses and may ultimately be unsuccessful.
In the event that one or more of these activities is unsuccessful, our business, results of operations and
financial condition may be negatively impacted and we may have to write off our investment and incur
other exit costs.

Our ancillary services and strategic initiatives are subject to many of the same risks, regulations and
laws, as described in the risk factors related to our dialysis business set forth in Risk Factors, and are also
subject to additional risks, regulations and laws specific to the nature of the particular strategic initiative. We
expect to add additional service offerings to our business and pursue additional strategic initiatives in the
future as circumstances warrant, which could include healthcare services not related to dialysis. Many of
these initiatives require or would require investments of both management and financial resources and can
generate significant losses for a substantial period of time and may not become profitable in the expected
timeframe or at all. There can be no assurance that any such strategic initiative will ultimately be successful.
Any significant change in market conditions, or business performance, or in the political, legislative or
regulatory environment, may impact the economic viability of any of these strategic initiatives.

If any of our ancillary services or strategic initiatives, including our pharmacy services and our

international operations, are unsuccessful, it would have a negative impact on our business, results of
operations and financial condition, and we may determine to exit that line of business. We could incur
significant termination costs if we were to exit certain of these lines of business. In addition, we may incur a
material write-off or an impairment of our investment, including goodwill, in one or more of our ancillary
services or strategic initiatives. In that regard, we have taken, and may in the future take, impairment charges
related to our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including in our international and pharmacy
businesses.

121

Risk Factors (continued)

If a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, whether due
to regulatory or other reasons, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

Physicians, including medical directors, choose where they refer their patients. We believe that

physicians prefer to have their patients treated at dialysis centers where they or other members of their
practice supervise the overall care provided as medical director of the center. As a result, the primary referral
source for most of our centers is often the physician or physician group providing medical director services to
the center.

Our medical director contracts are for fixed periods, generally ten years, and at any given time a large
number of them could be up for renewal at the same time. Medical directors have no obligation to extend
their agreements with us and if we are unable to enforce noncompetition provisions contained in terminated
medical director agreements, our former medical directors may choose to provide medical director services
for competing providers or establish their own dialysis centers in competition with ours. Neither our current
nor former medical directors have an obligation to refer their patients to our centers.

The aging of the nephrologist population and opportunities presented by our competitors may negatively
impact a medical director’s decision to enter into or extend his or her agreement with us. Moreover, different
affiliation models in the changing healthcare environment that limit a nephrologist’s choice in where he or she
can refer patients, such as an increase in the number of physicians becoming employed by hospitals or a
perceived decrease in the quality of service levels at our centers, may limit a nephrologist’s ability or desire to
refer patients to our centers or otherwise negatively impact treatment volumes.

In addition, we may take actions to restructure existing relationships or take positions in negotiating

extensions of relationships to assure compliance with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, Stark Law and other
similar laws. If the terms of any existing agreement are found to violate applicable laws, we may not be
successful in restructuring the relationship, which could lead to the early termination of the agreement. These
actions, in an effort to comply with applicable laws and regulations, could negatively impact the decision of
physicians to extend their medical director agreements with us. If a significant number of physicians were to
cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition.

If there are shortages of skilled clinical personnel, or if changes to state staffing ratios are implemented
with which we are required to comply, we may experience disruptions in our business operations and
increases in operating expenses, among other things, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

We face increasing labor costs generally, and in particular, face increased labor costs and difficulties in

hiring nurses due to a nationwide shortage of skilled clinical personnel. We compete for nurses with hospitals
and other healthcare providers. This nursing shortage may limit our ability to expand our operations.
Furthermore, changes in certification requirements can impact our ability to maintain sufficient staff levels,
including to the extent our teammates are not able to meet new requirements, among other things. In
addition, if we experience a higher than normal turnover rate for our skilled clinical personnel, our operations
and treatment growth may be negatively impacted, which could adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

In addition, currently pending and future proposed ballot initiatives or referendums, legislation or policy

changes could cause us to incur substantial costs to challenge and, if implemented, impose additional
requirements on our operations, including increases in the required staffing levels or staffing ratios for clinical

122

personnel, minimum transition times between treatments, limits on how much patients may be charged for
care, limitations as to the amount that can be spent on certain medical costs, and a ceiling on the percent of
profit for such care. Changes such as these mandated by currently pending and future ballot initiatives or
referendums, legislation or policy changes would likely materially reduce our revenues and increase our
operating expense and impact our ability to staff our clinics to the new, elevated staffing levels, in particular
given the ongoing nationwide shortage of healthcare workers, especially nurses. Any of these events or
circumstances could materially reduce our revenues and increase our operating and other costs, require us to
close dialysis centers or reduce shifts, and could have a material adverse effect on our employee relations,
treatment growth, productivity, business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our business is labor intensive and could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to maintain
satisfactory relations with our employees or if union organizing activities or legislative changes result in
significant increases in our operating costs or decreases in productivity.

Our business is labor intensive, and our financial and operating results have been and continue to be

subject to variations in labor-related costs, productivity and the number of pending or potential claims against
us related to labor and employment practices. Political efforts at the national or local level could result in
actions or proposals that increase the likelihood or success of union organizing activities at our facilities and
union organizing activities could increase for other reasons. Labor and employment claims, including the filing
of class action suits, or work stoppages, wages and benefits or adverse outcomes of these types of claims
could trend upwards. Any of these events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our
employee relations, treatment growth, productivity, business, results of operations and financial condition.

Complications associated with our billing and collections system could materially adversely affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our billing system is critical to our billing operations. If there are defects in the billing system, we may
experience difficulties in our ability to successfully bill and collect for services rendered, including a delay in
collections, a reduction in the amounts collected, increased risk of retractions from and refunds to commercial
and government payors, an increase in our provision for uncollectible accounts receivable and noncompliance
with reimbursement regulations, any or all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.

Risk factors primarily related to DMG:

DMG is subject to many of the same risks to which our dialysis business is subject.

As a participant in the healthcare industry, DMG is subject to many of the same risks as our dialysis

business is, as described in the risk factors set forth above in Risk Factors, any of which could have a material
adverse effect on DMG’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

Under most of DMG’s agreements with health plans, DMG assumes some or all of the risk that the cost of
providing services will exceed its compensation.

Approximately 83% of DMG’s revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 is derived from fixed per

member per month (PMPM) fees paid by health plans under capitation agreements with DMG or its
associated physician groups. While there are variations specific to each arrangement, DMG, through DaVita
Health Plan of California, Inc. (DHPC), a subsidiary of HealthCare Partners Holdings, LLC and a restricted
Knox-Keene licensed entity, and, in certain instances, DMG’s associated physician groups generally contract
with health plans to receive a PMPM fee for professional services and assume the financial responsibility for
professional services only. In some cases, the health plans separately enter into capitation contracts with third
parties (typically hospitals) who receive directly a PMPM fee and assume contractual financial responsibility
for hospital services. In other cases, the health plan does not pay any portion of the PMPM fee to the hospital,

123

Risk Factors (continued)

but rather administers claims for hospital expenses itself. In both scenarios, DMG enters into managed care-
related administrative services agreements or similar arrangements with those third parties (typically
hospitals) under which DMG agrees to be responsible for utilization review, quality assurance, and other
managed care-related administrative functions and claim payments. As compensation for such administrative
services, DMG is entitled to receive a percentage of the amount by which the institutional capitation revenue
received from health plans exceeds institutional expenses; any such risk-share amount to which DMG is
entitled is recorded as medical revenues, and DMG is also responsible for a percentage of any short-fall in the
event that institutional expenses exceed institutional revenues. To the extent that members require more care
than is anticipated and/or the cost of care increases, aggregate fixed PMPM amounts, or capitation
payments, may be insufficient to cover the costs associated with treatment. If medical costs and expenses
exceed estimates, except in very limited circumstances, DMG will not be able to increase the PMPM fee
received under these risk agreements during their then-current terms and could, directly or indirectly through
its contracts with its associated physician groups, suffer losses with respect to such agreements.

Changes in DMG’s or its associated physician groups’ anticipated ratio of medical expense to revenue
can significantly impact DMG’s financial results. Accordingly, the failure to adequately predict and control
medical costs and expenses and to make reasonable estimates and maintain adequate accruals for incurred
but not reported claims, could have a material adverse effect on DMG’s business, results of operations and
financial condition.

Historically, DMG’s and its associated physician groups’ medical costs and expenses as a percentage of

revenue have fluctuated. Factors that may cause medical expenses to exceed estimates include:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

the health status of members;

higher than expected utilization of new or existing healthcare services or technologies;

an increase in the cost of healthcare services and supplies, including pharmaceuticals, whether as a
result of inflation or otherwise;

changes to mandated benefits or other changes in healthcare laws, regulations and practices;

periodic renegotiation of provider contracts with specialist physicians, hospitals and ancillary
providers;

periodic renegotiation of contracts with DMG’s affiliated primary care physicians and specialists;

changes in the demographics of the participating members and medical trends;

contractual or claims disputes with providers, hospitals or other service providers within a health
plan’s network;

the occurrence of catastrophes, major epidemics or acts of terrorism; and

the reduction of health plan premiums.

Risk-sharing arrangements that DMG and its associated physician groups have with health plans and
hospitals could result in their costs exceeding the corresponding revenues, which could reduce or eliminate
any shared risk profitability.

Most of the agreements between health plans and DMG and its associated physician groups contain
risk-sharing arrangements under which the physician groups can earn additional compensation from the
health plans by coordinating the provision of quality, cost-effective healthcare to members. However, such
arrangements may require the physician group to assume a portion of any loss sustained from these
arrangements, thereby reducing DMG’s net income. Under these risk-sharing arrangements, DMG and its

124

associated physician groups are responsible for a portion of the cost of hospital services or other services that
are not capitated. The terms of the particular risk-sharing arrangement allocate responsibility to the
respective parties when the cost of services exceeds the related revenue, which results in a deficit, or permit
the parties to share in any surplus amounts when actual costs are less than the related revenue. The amount
of non-capitated medical and hospital costs in any period could be affected by factors beyond the control of
DMG, such as changes in treatment protocols, new technologies, longer lengths of stay by the patient and
inflation. Certain of DMG’s agreements with health plans stipulate that risk-sharing pool deficit amounts are
carried forward to offset any future years’ surplus amounts DMG would otherwise be entitled to receive.
DMG accrues for any such risk-sharing deficits. To the extent that such non-capitated medical and hospital
costs are higher than anticipated, revenue may not be sufficient to cover the risk-sharing deficits the health
plans and DMG are responsible for, which could have a material adverse effect on DMG’s business, results of
operations and financial condition.

Renegotiation, renewal or termination of capitation agreements with health plans could have a material
adverse effect on DMG’s business, results operations and financial condition.

Under most of DMG’s and its associated physician groups’ capitation agreements with health plans, the

health plan is generally permitted to modify the benefit and risk obligations and compensation rights from
time to time during the terms of the agreements. If a health plan exercises its right to amend its benefit and
risk obligations and compensation rights, DMG and its associated physician groups are generally allowed a
period of time to object to such amendment. If DMG or its associated physician group so objects, under some
of the risk agreements, the relevant health plan may terminate the applicable agreement upon 90 to 180 days
written notice. If DMG or its associated physician groups enter into capitation contracts or other risk sharing
arrangements with unfavorable economic terms, or a capitation contract is amended to include unfavorable
terms, DMG could, directly or indirectly through its contracts with its associated physician groups, suffer
losses with respect to such contract. Since DMG does not negotiate with CMS or any health plan regarding
the benefits to be provided under their Medicare Advantage plans, DMG often has just a few months to
familiarize itself with each new annual package of benefits it is expected to offer. Depending on the health
plan at issue and the amount of revenue associated with the health plan’s risk agreement, the renegotiated
terms or termination could have a material adverse effect on DMG’s business, results of operations and
financial condition.

If DMG’s agreements or arrangements with any physician equity holder(s) of associated physicians,
physician groups or IPAs are deemed invalid under state law, including laws against the corporate practice
of medicine, or federal law, or are terminated as a result of changes in state law, or if there is a change in
accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or the interpretation thereof
affecting consolidation of entities, it could have a material adverse effect on DMG’s consolidation of total
revenues derived from such associated physician groups.

DMG’s financial statements are consolidated in accordance with applicable accounting standards and

include the accounts of its majority-owned subsidiaries and certain non-owned DMG-associated and
managed physician groups. Such consolidation for accounting and/or tax purposes does not, is not intended
to, and should not be deemed to, imply or provide to DMG any control over the medical or clinical affairs of
such physician groups. In the event of a change in accounting standards promulgated by FASB or in
interpretation of its standards, or if there is an adverse determination by a regulatory agency or a court, or a
change in state or federal law relating to the ability to maintain present agreements or arrangements with
such physician groups, DMG may not be permitted to continue to consolidate the total revenues of such
organizations. A change in accounting for consolidation with respect to DMG’s present agreement or
arrangements would diminish DMG’s reported revenues but would not be expected to materially and
adversely affect its reported results of operations, while regulatory or legal rulings or changes in law
interfering with DMG’s ability to maintain its present agreements or arrangements could materially diminish
both revenues and results of operations.

125

Risk Factors (continued)

If DHPC is not able to satisfy financial solvency or other regulatory requirements, we could become subject
to sanctions and its license to do business in California could be limited, suspended or terminated, which
could have a material adverse effect on DMG’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

Knox-Keene requires healthcare service plans operating in California to comply with financial solvency

and other requirements overseen by the California Department of Managed HealthCare (DMHC). Under
Knox-Keene, DHPC is required to, among other things:

• Maintain, at all times, a minimum tangible net equity (TNE);

•

Submit periodic financial solvency reports to the DMHC containing various data regarding
performance and financial solvency;

• Comply with extensive regulatory requirements; and

•

Submit to periodic regulatory audits and reviews concerning DHPC operations and compliance with
Knox-Keene.

In the event that DHPC is not in compliance with the provisions of Knox-Keene, we could be subject to

sanctions, or limitations on, or suspension of its license to do business in California, which could have a
material adverse effect on DMG’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

If DMG’s associated physician group is not able to satisfy the California DMHC’s financial solvency
requirements, DMG’s associated physician group could become subject to sanctions and DMG’s ability to
do business in California could be limited or terminated, which could have a material adverse effect on
DMG’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

The California DMHC has instituted financial solvency regulations to monitor the financial solvency of

capitated physician groups. Under these regulations, DMG’s associated physician group is required to, among
other things:

• Maintain, at all times, a minimum cash-to-claims ratio (where cash-to-claims ratio means the

organization’s cash, marketable securities and certain qualified receivables, divided by the
organization’s total unpaid claims liability). The regulation currently requires a cash-to-claims ratio
of 0.75.

•

Submit periodic reports to the California DMHC containing various data and attestations regarding
performance and financial solvency, including incurred but not reported calculations and
documentation, and attestations as to whether or not the organization was in compliance with
Knox-Keene requirements related to claims payment timeliness, had maintained positive TNE (i.e.,
at least $1.00) and had maintained positive working capital (i.e., at least $1.00).

In the event that DMG’s associated physician group is not in compliance with any of the above criteria,

DMG’s associated physician group could be subject to sanctions, or limitations on, or removal of, its ability to
do business in California, which could have a material adverse effect on DMG’s business, results of operations
and financial condition.

Reductions in Medicare Advantage health plan reimbursement rates stemming from recent healthcare
reforms and any future related regulations could have a material adverse effect on DMG’s business,
results of operations and financial condition.

A significant portion of DMG’s revenue is directly or indirectly derived from the monthly premium

payments paid by CMS to health plans for medical services provided to Medicare Advantage enrollees. As a

126

result, DMG’s results of operations are, in part, dependent on government funding levels for Medicare
Advantage programs. Any changes that limit or reduce Medicare Advantage reimbursement levels, such as
reductions in or limitations of reimbursement amounts or rates under programs, reductions in funding of
programs, expansion of benefits without adequate funding, elimination of coverage for certain benefits, or
elimination of coverage for certain individuals or treatments under programs, could have a material adverse
effect on DMG’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

Each year, CMS issues a final rule to establish the Medicare Advantage benchmark payment rates for the
following calendar year. Any reduction to Medicare Advantage rates impacting DMG that is greater compared
to the industry average rate may have material adverse effect on DMG’s business, results of operations and
financial condition. The final impact of the Medicare Advantage rates can vary from any estimate we may
have and may be further impacted by the relative growth of DMG’s Medicare Advantage patient volumes
across markets as well as by the benefit plan designs submitted. It is possible that we may underestimate the
impact of the Medicare Advantage rates on our business, which could have a material adverse effect on
DMG’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

We took impairment charges against the goodwill of several of our DMG reporting units in five of the

nine quarters since the fourth quarter of 2015 based on continuing developments in our DMG business,
including recent annual updates to Medicare Advantage benchmark reimbursement rates, changes in our
expectations concerning future government reimbursement rates and our expected ability to mitigate them,
medical cost and utilization trends, commercial pricing pressures, commercial membership rates,
underperformance of certain at-risk reporting units and other market factors. We may also need to take
additional impairment charges against earnings in a future period, depending on the impact of continuing
developments on the value of our DMG business. Specifically, if DMG’s fair value less the costs incurred in the
sale of DMG falls below its carrying amount, we may need to recognize additional impairment charges on this
business, and the amount of such charges, if any, could be significant. Our estimates of the fair value of this
business rely on certain estimates and assumptions, including the terms and pricing agreed for the sale of this
business, as well as applicable market multiples, discount and long-term growth rates, market data and future
reimbursement rates, as applicable. Our estimates of the fair value of the DMG business could differ from the
actual value that a market participant would pay for this business.

DMG’s Medicare Advantage revenues may continue to be volatile in the future, which could have a

material adverse impact on DMG’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

The ACA contains a number of provisions that negatively impact Medicare Advantage plans, each of

which could have a material adverse effect on DMG’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
These provisions include the following:

• Medicare Advantage benchmarks for 2011 were frozen at 2010 levels. From 2012 through 2016,

Medicare Advantage benchmark rates were phased down from prior levels. The new benchmarks
were fully phased-in in 2017 and range between 95% and 115% of the Medicare FFS costs,
depending on a plan’s geographic area. If our costs escalate faster than can be absorbed by the level
of revenues implied by these benchmark rates, then it could have a material adverse effect on
DMG’s business and results of operations.

• Rebates received by Medicare Advantage plans that were reduced, with larger reductions for plans

failing to receive certain quality ratings.

• The Secretary of the HHS has been granted the explicit authority to deny Medicare Advantage plan
bids that propose significant increases in cost sharing or decreases in benefits. If the bids submitted
by plans contracted with DMG are denied, this could have a material adverse effect on DMG’s
business and results of operations.

• Medicare Advantage plans with medical loss ratios below 85% are required to pay a rebate to the
Secretary of HHS. The rebate amount is the total revenue under the contract year multiplied by the

127

Risk Factors (continued)

difference between 85% and the plan’s actual medical loss ratio. The Secretary of HHS will halt
enrollment in any plan failing to meet this ratio for three consecutive years, and terminate any plan
failing to meet the ratio for five consecutive years. If a DMG- contracting Medicare Advantage plan
experiences a limitation on enrollment or is otherwise terminated from the Medicare Advantage
program, it could have a material adverse effect on DMG’s business and results of operations.

•

Prescription drug plans are required to provide coverage of certain drug categories on a list
developed by the Secretary of HHS, which could increase the cost of providing care to Medicare
Advantage enrollees, and thereby reduce DMG’s revenues and earnings. The Medicare Part D
premium amount subsidized for high-income beneficiaries has been reduced, which could lower the
number of Medicare Advantage enrollees, which would have a negative impact on DMG’s business
and results of operations.

• CMS increased coding intensity adjustments for Medicare Advantage plans beginning in 2014 and

continuing through 2018, which reduces CMS payments to Medicare Advantage plans, which in turn
will likely reduce the amounts payable to DMG and its associated physicians, physician groups, and
IPAs under its capitation agreements.

Recent legislative and executive efforts to enact further healthcare reform legislation have caused the

future state of the exchanges, other ACA reforms, and many core aspects of the current U.S. health care
system to be unclear. For example, in October 2017, the federal government announced that cost-sharing
reduction payments to insurers would end, effective immediately, unless Congress appropriated the funds,
and, in December 2017, Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which includes a provision that
eliminates the penalty under the ACA’s individual mandate and could impact the future state of the
exchanges. Further, in February 2018, Congress passed the BBA which, among other things, repealed the
Independent Payment Advisory Board that was established by the ACA and intended to reduce the rate of
growth in Medicare spending. While certain provisions of the BBA may increase the scope of benefits
available for certain chronically ill Federal health care program beneficiaries beginning in 2020, the ultimate
impact of such changes cannot be predicted. While specific changes and their timing are not yet apparent,
enacted reforms and future legislative, regulatory, or executive changes could have a material adverse effect
on DMG’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

There is also uncertainty regarding both Medicare Advantage payment rates and beneficiary enrollment,

which, if reduced, would reduce DMG’s overall revenues and net income. For example, although the
Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicted in 2010 that Medicare Advantage participation would drop
substantially by 2020, the CBO has more recently predicted, without taking into account potential future
reforms, that enrollment in Medicare Advantage (and other contracts covering Medicare Parts A and B) could
reach 31 million by 2027. Although Medicare Advantage enrollment increased by approximately 5.6 million,
or by 50%, between the enactment of the ACA in 2010 and 2015, there can be no assurance that this trend
will continue. Further, fluctuation in Medicare Advantage payment rates are evidenced by CMS’s annual
announcement of the expected average change in revenue from the prior year: for 2017, CMS announced an
average increase of 0.85%; and for 2018, 0.45%. Uncertainty over Medicare Advantage enrollment and
payment rates present a continuing risk to DMG’s business.

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), Medicare Advantage enrollment continues to be highly

concentrated among a few payors, both nationally and in local regions. In 2017, the KFF reported that three
payors together accounted for more than half of Medicare Advantage enrollment and eight firms accounted
for approximately 75% of the lives. In 441 counties in 2018, only one company will offer Medicare Advantage
plans. Consolidation among Medicare Advantage plans in certain regions, or the Medicare program’s failure
to attract additional plans to participate in the Medicare Advantage program, could have a material adverse
effect on DMG’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

128

DMG’s operations are dependent on competing health plans and, at times, a health plan’s and DMG’s
economic interests may diverge.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, 68% of DMG’s consolidated capitated medical revenues were

earned through contracts with three health plans.

DMG expects that, going forward, substantially all of its revenue will continue to be derived from its

contracts with health plans. Each health plan may immediately terminate any of DMG’s contracts and/or any
individual credentialed physician upon the occurrence of certain events. They may also amend the material
terms of the contracts under certain circumstances. Failure to maintain the contracts on favorable terms, for
any reason, would materially and adversely affect DMG’s results of operations and financial condition. A
material decline in the number of members could also have a material adverse effect on DMG’s results of
operations.

Notwithstanding each health plan’s and DMG’s current shared interest in providing service to DMG’s

members who are enrolled in the subject health plans, the health plans may have different and, at times,
opposing economic interests from those of DMG. The health plans provide a wide range of health insurance
services across a wide range of geographic regions, utilizing a vast network of providers. As a result, they and
DMG may have different views regarding the proper pricing of services and/or the proper pricing of the
various service providers in their provider networks, the cost of which DMG bears to the extent that the
services of such service providers are utilized. These health plans may also have different views than DMG
regarding the efforts and expenditures that they, DMG, and/or other service providers should make to
achieve and/or maintain various quality ratings. In addition, several health plans have acquired or announced
their intent to acquire provider organizations. If health plans with which DMG contracts acquire a significant
number of provider organizations, they may not continue to contract with DMG or contract on less favorable
terms or seek to prevent DMG from acquiring or entering into arrangements with certain providers. Similarly,
as a result of changes in laws, regulations, consumer preferences, or other factors, the health plans may find it
in their best interest to provide health insurance services pursuant to another payment or reimbursement
structure. In the event DMG’s interests diverge from the interests of the health plans, DMG may have limited
recourse or alternative options in light of its dependence on these health plans. There can be no assurances
that DMG will continue to find it mutually beneficial to work with these health plans. As a result of various
restrictive provisions that appear in some of the managed care agreements with health plans, DMG may at
times have limitations on its ability to cancel an agreement with a particular health plan and immediately
thereafter contract with a competing health plan with respect to the same service area.

DMG and its associated physicians, physician groups and IPAs and other physicians may be required to
continue providing services following termination or renegotiation of certain agreements with health
plans.

There are circumstances under federal and state law pursuant to which DMG and its associated

physician groups, IPAs and other physicians could be obligated to continue to provide medical services to
DMG members in their care following a termination of their applicable risk agreement with health plans and
termination of the receipt of payments thereunder. In certain cases, this obligation could require the physician
group or IPA to provide care to such member following the bankruptcy or insolvency of a health plan.
Accordingly, the obligations to provide medical services to DMG members (and the associated costs) may
not terminate at the time the applicable agreement with the health plan terminates, and DMG may not be
able to recover its cost of providing those services from the health plan, which could have a material adverse
effect on DMG’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

DMG operates primarily in California, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico, Washington and Colorado and may
not be able to successfully establish a presence in new geographic regions.

DMG derives substantially all of its revenue from operations in California, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico,

Washington and Colorado (which we refer to as the Existing Geographic Regions). As a result, DMG’s

129

Risk Factors (continued)

exposure to many of the risks described herein is not mitigated by a greater diversification of geographic
focus. Furthermore, due to the concentration of DMG’s operations in the Existing Geographic Regions, it may
be adversely affected by economic conditions, natural disasters (such as earthquakes or hurricanes), or acts
of war or terrorism that disproportionately affect the Existing Geographic Regions as compared to other states
and geographic markets.

To expand the operations of its network outside of the Existing Geographic Regions, DMG must devote

resources to identify and explore perceived opportunities. Thereafter, DMG must, among other things, recruit
and retain qualified personnel, develop new offices, establish potential new relationships with one or more
health plans, and establish new relationships with physicians and other healthcare providers. The ability to
establish such new relationships may be significantly inhibited by competition for such relationships and
personnel in the healthcare marketplace in the targeted new geographic regions. Additionally, DMG may face
the risk that a substantial portion of the patients served in a new geographic area may be enrolled in a
Medicare FFS program and will not desire to transition to a Medicare Advantage program, such as those
offered through the health plans that DMG serves, or they may enroll with other health plans with whom
DMG does not contract to receive services, which could reduce substantially DMG’s perceived opportunity in
such geographic area. In addition, if DMG were to seek to expand outside of the Existing Geographic Regions,
DMG would be required to comply with laws and regulations of states that may differ from the ones in which
it currently operates, and could face competitors with greater knowledge of such local markets. DMG
anticipates that any geographic expansion may require it to make a substantial investment of management
time, capital and/or other resources. There can be no assurance that DMG will be able to establish profitable
operations or relationships in any new geographic markets.

Reductions in the quality ratings of the health plans DMG serves could have a material adverse effect on
its business, results of operations and financial condition.

As a result of the ACA, the level of reimbursement each health plan receives from CMS is dependent, in

part, upon the quality rating of the Medicare plan. Such ratings impact the percentage of any cost savings
rebate and any bonuses earned by such health plan. Since a significant portion of DMG’s revenue is expected
to be calculated as a percentage of CMS reimbursements received by these health plans with respect to DMG
members, reductions in the quality ratings of a health plan that DMG serves could have a material adverse
effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.

Given each health plan’s control of its plans and the many other providers that serve such plans, DMG

believes that it will have limited ability to influence the overall quality rating of any such plan. The BBA passed
in February 2018 implements certain changes to prevent artificial inflation of star ratings for Medicare
Advantage plans offered by the same organization. In addition, CMS has terminated plans that have had a
rating of less than three stars for three consecutive years, whereas Medicare Advantage plans with five stars
are permitted to conduct enrollment throughout almost the entire year. Although CMS’ authority to terminate
plans solely for failing to achieve the minimum quality star ratings has been suspended through the end of
plan year 2018, low quality ratings can still potentially lead to the termination of a plan that DMG serves,
DMG may not be able to prevent the potential termination of a contracting plan or a shift of patients to other
plans based upon quality issues which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on DMG’s business,
results of operations and financial condition.

DMG’s records and submissions to a health plan may contain inaccurate or unsupportable information
regarding risk adjustment scores of members, which could cause DMG to overstate or understate its
revenue and subject it to various penalties.

DMG, on behalf of itself and its associated physicians, physician groups and IPAs, submits to health

plans claims and encounter data that support the Medicare Risk Adjustment Factor (RAF) scores attributable

130

to members. These RAF scores determine, in part, the revenue to which the health plans and, in turn, DMG is
entitled for the provision of medical care to such members. The data submitted to CMS by each health plan is
based, in part, on medical charts and diagnosis codes prepared and submitted by DMG. Each health plan
generally relies on DMG and its employed or affiliated physicians to appropriately document and support
such RAF data in DMG’s medical records. Each health plan also relies on DMG and its employed or affiliated
physicians to appropriately code claims for medical services provided to members. Erroneous claims and
erroneous encounter records and submissions could result in inaccurate PMPM fee revenue and risk
adjustment payments, which may be subject to correction or retroactive adjustment in later periods. This
corrected or adjusted information may be reflected in financial statements for periods subsequent to the
period in which the revenue was recorded. DMG might also need to refund a portion of the revenue that it
received, which refund, depending on its magnitude, could damage its relationship with the applicable health
plan and could have a material adverse effect on DMG’s business, results of operations and financial
condition.

In June 2015, we received a subpoena from the OIG requesting information relating to our and our

subsidiaries’ (including DMG’s and its subsidiary JSA’s) provision of services to Medicare Advantage plans
and related patient diagnosis coding and risk adjustment submissions and payments. See Note 16 to the
consolidated financial statements included in this report for further details and discussions of legal
proceedings elsewhere in these Risk Factors.

Additionally, CMS audits Medicare Advantage plans for documentation to support RAF-related

payments for members chosen at random. The Medicare Advantage plans ask providers to submit the
underlying documentation for members that they serve. It is possible that claims associated with members
with higher RAF scores could be subject to more scrutiny in a CMS or plan audit. There is a possibility that a
Medicare Advantage plan may seek repayment from DMG should CMS make any payment adjustments to
the Medicare Advantage plan as a result of its audits. The plans also may hold DMG liable for any penalties
owed to CMS for inaccurate or unsupportable RAF scores provided by DMG. In addition, DMG could be liable
for penalties to the government under the FCA that range from $5,500 to $11,000 (adjusted for inflation) for
each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages caused by each false claim, which can be as
much as the amounts received directly or indirectly from the government for each such false claim. On
February 3, 2017, the DOJ issued a final rule announcing adjustments to FCA penalties, under which the per
claim penalty range increases from $10,957 to $21,916 for penalties assessed after February 3, 2017, so long
as the underlying conduct occurred after November 2, 2015.

CMS has indicated that payment adjustments will not be limited to RAF scores for the specific Medicare

Advantage enrollees for which errors are found but may also be extrapolated to the entire Medicare
Advantage plan subject to a particular CMS contract. CMS has described its audit process as plan-year
specific and stated that it will not extrapolate audit results for plan years prior to 2011. Because CMS has not
stated otherwise, there is a risk that payment adjustments made as a result of one plan year’s audit would be
extrapolated to prior plan years after 2011.

There can be no assurance that a health plan will not be randomly selected or targeted for review by
CMS or that the outcome of such a review will not result in a material adjustment in DMG’s revenue and
profitability, even if the information DMG submitted to the plan is accurate and supportable.

Separately, as described in further detail in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in
this report, on March 13, 2015, JSA, a subsidiary of DMG, received a subpoena from the OIG that relates, in
part, to risk adjustment practices and data. See also discussions of legal proceedings elsewhere in these Risk
Factors.

131

Risk Factors (continued)

A failure to accurately estimate incurred but not reported medical expense could adversely affect DMG’s
results of operations.

Patient care costs include estimates of future medical claims that have been incurred by the patient but

for which the provider has not yet billed DMG. These claim estimates are made utilizing actuarial methods
and are continually evaluated and adjusted by management, based upon DMG’s historical claims experience
and other factors, including an independent assessment by a nationally recognized actuarial firm.
Adjustments, if necessary, are made to medical claims expense and capitated revenues when the
assumptions used to determine DMG’s claims liability changes and when actual claim costs are ultimately
determined.

Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with the factors used in these estimates and changes in the

patterns and rates of medical utilization, materially different amounts could be reported in DMG’s financial
statements for a particular period under different conditions or using different, but still reasonable,
assumptions. It is possible that DMG’s estimates of this type of claim may be inadequate in the future. In such
event, DMG’s results of operations could be adversely impacted. Further, the inability to estimate these
claims accurately may also affect DMG’s ability to take timely corrective actions, further exacerbating the
extent of any adverse effect on DMG’s results of operations.

DMG faces certain competitive threats which could reduce DMG’s profitability and increase competition
for patients.

DMG faces certain competitive threats based on certain features of the Medicare programs, including

the following:

• As a result of the direct and indirect impacts of the ACA, many Medicare beneficiaries may decide

that an original Medicare FFS program is more attractive than a Medicare Advantage plan. As a
result, enrollment in the health plans DMG serves may decrease.

• Managed care companies offer alternative products such as regional preferred provider

organizations (PPOs) and private FFS plans. Medicare PPOs and private FFS plans allow their
patients more flexibility in selecting physicians than Medicare Advantage health plans, which
typically require patients to coordinate care with a primary care physician. The Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 has encouraged the creation of
regional PPOs through various incentives, including certain risk corridors, or cost reimbursement
provisions, a stabilization fund for incentive payments, and special payments to hospitals not
otherwise contracted with a Medicare Advantage plan that treat regional plan enrollees. The
formation of regional Medicare PPOs and private FFS plans may affect DMG’s relative attractiveness
to existing and potential Medicare patients in their service areas.

• The payments for the local and regional Medicare Advantage plans are based on a competitive

bidding process that may indirectly cause a decrease in the amount of the PMPM fee or result in an
increase in benefits offered.

• The annual enrollment process and subsequent lock-in provisions of the ACA may adversely affect
DMG’s level of revenue growth as it will limit the ability of a health plan to market to and enroll new
Medicare beneficiaries in its established service areas outside of the annual enrollment period.

• CMS allows Medicare beneficiaries who are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan with a quality

rating of 4.5 stars or less to enroll in a 5-star rated Medicare Advantage plan at any time during the
benefit year. Therefore, DMG may face a competitive disadvantage in recruiting and retaining
Medicare beneficiaries.

132

In addition to the competitive threats intrinsic to the Medicare programs, competition among health

plans and among healthcare providers may also have a negative impact on DMG’s profitability. For example,
due to the large population of Medicare beneficiaries, DMG’s Existing Geographic Regions have become
increasingly attractive to health plans that may compete with DMG. DMG may not be able to continue to
compete profitably in the healthcare industry if additional competitors enter the same market. If DMG cannot
compete profitably, the ability of DMG to compete with other service providers that contract with competing
health plans may be substantially impaired. Furthermore, if DMG is unable to obtain new members or
experiences a loss of existing members to competitors during the open enrollment period for Medicare it
could have a material adverse effect on DMG’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

DMG competes directly with various regional and local companies that provide similar services in DMG’s
Existing Geographic Regions. DMG’s competitors vary in size and scope and in terms of products and services
offered. DMG believes that some of its competitors and potential competitors may be significantly larger than
DMG and have greater financial, sales, marketing and other resources. Furthermore, it is DMG’s belief that
some of its competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among
themselves.

A disruption in DMG’s healthcare provider networks could have a material adverse effect on DMG’s
operations and profitability.

In any particular service area, healthcare providers or provider networks could refuse to contract with

DMG, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher healthcare costs, disruption
of benefits to DMG’s members, or difficulty in meeting applicable regulatory or accreditation requirements. In
some service areas, healthcare providers or provider networks may have significant market positions. If
healthcare providers or provider networks refuse to contract with DMG, use their market position to negotiate
favorable contracts, or place DMG at a competitive disadvantage, then DMG’s ability to market or to be
profitable in those service areas could be adversely affected. DMG’s provider networks could also be
disrupted by the financial insolvency of a large provider group. Any disruption in DMG’s provider networks
could result in a loss of members or higher healthcare costs.

DMG’s revenues and profits could be diminished if DMG fails to retain and attract the services of key
primary care physicians.

Key primary care physicians with large patient enrollment could retire, become disabled, terminate their

provider contracts, get lured away by a competing independent physician association or medical group, or
otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with DMG or its
associated physicians, physician groups or IPAs. In addition, DMG’s associated physicians, physician groups
and IPAs could view the business model as unfavorable or unattractive to such providers, which could cause
such associated physicians, physician groups or IPAs to terminate their relationships with DMG. Moreover,
given limitations relating to the enforcement of post-termination noncompetition covenants in California, it
would be difficult to restrict a primary care physician from competing with DMG’s associated physicians,
physician groups or IPAs. As a result, members who have been served by such physicians could choose to
enroll with competitors’ physician organizations or could seek medical care elsewhere, which could reduce
DMG’s revenues and profits. Moreover, DMG may not be able to attract new physicians to replace the
services of terminating physicians or to service its growing membership.

Participation in ACO programs is subject to federal regulation, supervision, and evolving regulatory
developments that may result in financial liability.

The ACA established the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) for ACOs, which took effect in

January 2012. Under the MSSP, eligible organizations are accountable for the quality, cost and overall care of
Medicare beneficiaries assigned to an ACO and may be eligible to share in any savings below a specified

133

Risk Factors (continued)

benchmark amount. The Secretary of HHS is also authorized, but not required, to use capitation payment
models with ACOs. DMG has formed an MSSP ACO through a subsidiary, which operates in California,
Florida, and Nevada and is evaluating whether to participate in more ACOs in the future. The continued
development and expansion of ACOs will have an uncertain impact on DMG’s revenue and profitability.
DaVita Kidney Care is also participating as a dialysis provider in Arizona, Florida, New Jersey, and
Pennsylvania for the Innovation Center’s CEC Model.

The ACO programs are relatively new and therefore operational and regulatory guidance is limited. It is

possible that the operations of DMG’s subsidiary ACO may not fully comply with current or future regulations
and guidelines applicable to ACOs, may not achieve quality targets or cost savings, or may not attract or
retain sufficient physicians or patients to allow DMG to meet its objectives. Additionally, poor performance
could put the DMG ACO at financial risk with a potential obligation to CMS. Traditionally, other than fee-for-
service billing by the medical clinics and healthcare facilities operated by DMG, DMG has not directly
contracted with CMS and has not operated any health plans or provider sponsored networks. Therefore, DMG
may not have the necessary experience, systems or compliance to successfully achieve a positive return on its
investment in the ACO or to avoid financial or regulatory liability. DMG believes that its historical experience
with fully delegated managed care will be applicable to operation of its subsidiary ACO, but there can be no
such assurance.

California hospitals may terminate their agreements with HealthCare Partners Affiliates Medical Group
and DaVita Health Plan of California, Inc. (formerly HealthCare Partners Plan, Inc., and, together with
HealthCare Partners Affiliates Medical Group (AMG)) or reduce the fees they pay to DMG.

In California, AMG maintains significant hospital arrangements designed to facilitate the provision of
coordinated hospital care with those services provided to members by AMG and its associated physicians,
physician groups and IPAs. Through contractual arrangements with certain key hospitals, AMG provides
utilization review, quality assurance and other management services related to the provision of patient care
services to members by the contracted hospitals and downstream hospital contractors. In the event that any
one of these key hospital agreements is amended in a financially unfavorable manner or is otherwise
terminated, such events could have a material adverse effect on DMG’s business, results of operations and
financial condition.

DMG’s professional liability and other insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover DMG’s potential
liabilities.

DMG maintains primary professional liability insurance and other insurance coverage through California

Medical Group Insurance Company, Risk Retention Group, an Arizona corporation in which DMG is the
majority owner, and through excess coverage contracted through third-party insurers. DMG believes such
insurance is adequate based on its review of what it believes to be all applicable factors, including industry
standards. Nonetheless, potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage
or may be unable to meet their obligations, the amount of insurance coverage and/or related reserves may be
inadequate, or the amount of any DMG self-insured retention may be substantial. There can be no assurances
that DMG will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future, or that insurance will continue to be
available on a cost-effective basis, if at all. Moreover, even if claims brought against DMG are unsuccessful or
without merit, DMG would have to defend itself against such claims. The defense of any such actions may be
time-consuming and costly and may distract DMG management’s attention. As a result, DMG may incur
significant expenses and may be unable to effectively operate its business.

134

Changes in the rates or methods of third-party reimbursements may materially adversely affect DMG
business, results of operations and financial condition.

Any negative changes in governmental capitation or FFS rates or methods of reimbursement for the

services DMG provides could have a material adverse effect on DMG’s business, results of operations and
financial condition. Since governmental healthcare programs generally reimburse on a fee schedule basis
rather than on a charge-related basis, DMG generally cannot increase its revenues from these programs by
increasing the amount it charges for its services. Moreover, if DMG’s costs increase, DMG may not be able to
recover its increased costs from these programs. Government and private payors have taken and may
continue to take steps to control the cost, eligibility for, use, and delivery of healthcare services due to
budgetary constraints, and cost containment pressures as well as other financial issues. DMG believes that
these trends in cost containment will continue. These cost containment measures, and other market changes
in non-governmental insurance plans have generally restricted DMG’s ability to recover, or shift to non-
governmental payors, any increased costs that DMG experiences. DMG’s business, results of operations and
financial condition may be materially adversely affected by these cost containment measures, and other
market changes.

DMG’s business model depends on numerous complex management information systems and any failure
to successfully maintain these systems or implement new systems could materially harm DMG’s
operations and result in potential violations of healthcare laws and regulations.

DMG depends on a complex, specialized, and integrated management information system and

standardized procedures for operational and financial information, as well as for DMG’s billing operations.
DMG may experience unanticipated delays, complications or expenses in implementing, integrating, and
operating these integrated systems. Moreover, DMG may be unable to enhance its existing management
information system or implement new management information systems where necessary. DMG’s
management information system may require modifications, improvements or replacements that may require
both substantial expenditures as well as interruptions in operations. DMG’s ability to implement and operate
its integrated systems is subject to the availability of information technology and skilled personnel to assist
DMG in creating and maintaining these systems.

DMG’s failure to successfully implement and maintain all of its systems could have a material adverse

effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, DMG’s failure to successfully
operate its billing systems could lead to potential violations of healthcare laws and regulations. If DMG is
unable to handle its claims volume, or if DMG is unable to pay claims timely, DMG may become subject to a
health plan’s corrective action plan or de-delegation until the problem is corrected, and/or termination of the
health plan’s agreement with DMG. This could have a material adverse effect on DMG’s operations and
profitability. In addition, if DMG’s claims processing system is unable to process claims accurately, the data
DMG uses for its incurred but not reported (IBNR) estimates could be incomplete and DMG’s ability to
accurately estimate claims liabilities and establish adequate reserves could be adversely affected. Finally, if
DMG’s management information systems are unable to function in compliance with applicable state or
federal rules and regulations, including medical information confidentiality laws such as HIPAA, possible
penalties and fines due to this lack of compliance could have a material adverse effect on DMG’s financial
condition, and results of operations.

DMG may be impacted by eligibility changes to government and private insurance programs.

Due to potential decreased availability of healthcare through private employers, the number of patients

who are uninsured or participate in governmental programs may increase. The ACA has increased the
participation of individuals in the Medicaid program in states that elected to participate in the expanded
Medicaid coverage. A shift in payor mix from managed care and other private payors to government payors as
well as an increase in the number of uninsured patients may result in a reduction in the rates of

Risk Factors (continued)

reimbursement to DMG or an increase in uncollectible receivables or uncompensated care, with a corresponding
decrease in net revenue. Changes in the eligibility requirements for governmental programs such as the
Medicaid program under the ACA and state decisions on whether to participate in the expansion of such
programs also could increase the number of patients who participate in such programs and the number of
uninsured patients. Even for those patients who remain in private insurance plans, changes to those plans could
increase patient financial responsibility, resulting in a greater risk of uncollectible receivables. These factors and
events could have a material adverse effect on DMG’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

Negative publicity regarding the managed healthcare industry generally or DMG in particular could
adversely affect DMG’s results of operations or business.

Negative publicity regarding the managed healthcare industry generally, the Medicare Advantage

program or DMG in particular, may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices
that further increase DMG’s costs of doing business and adversely affect DMG’s results of operations or
business by:

•
•

•

•

requiring DMG to change its products and services;
increasing the regulatory, including compliance, burdens under which DMG operates, which, in turn,
may negatively impact the manner in which DMG provides services and increase DMG’s costs of
providing services;
adversely affecting DMG’s ability to market its products or services through the imposition of
further regulatory restrictions regarding the manner in which plans and providers market to
Medicare Advantage enrollees; or
adversely affecting DMG’s ability to attract and retain members.

Risk factors related to ownership of our common stock:
Provisions in our charter documents, compensation programs and Delaware law may deter a change of
control that our stockholders would otherwise determine to be in their best interests.

Our charter documents include provisions that may deter hostile takeovers, delay or prevent changes of

control or changes in our management, or limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that
they may otherwise determine to be in their best interests. These include provisions prohibiting our
stockholders from acting by written consent; requiring 90 days advance notice of stockholder proposals or
nominations to our Board of Directors (or 120 days for nominations made using proxy access); and granting
our Board of Directors the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of
the preferred stock without the need for further stockholder approval.

Most of our outstanding employee stock-based compensation awards include a provision accelerating

the vesting of the awards in the event of a change of control. We also maintain a change of control protection
program for our employees who do not have a significant number of stock awards, which has been in place
since 2001, and which provides for cash bonuses to the employees in the event of a change of control. Based
on the market price of our common stock and shares outstanding on December 31, 2017, these cash bonuses
would total approximately $521 million if a change of control transaction occurred at that price and our Board
of Directors did not modify this program. These change of control provisions may affect the price an acquirer
would be willing to pay for our Company.

We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law that, subject to exceptions,
would prohibit us from engaging in any business combinations with any interested stockholder, as defined in
that section, for a period of three years following the date on which that stockholder became an interested
stockholder.

136

These provisions may discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition of our Company at a price that our
stockholders may find attractive. These provisions could also make it more difficult for our stockholders to
elect directors and take other corporate actions and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay
for shares of our common stock.

Interest rate sensitivity

The tables below provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in

interest rates. The table below presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on
our debt obligations as of December 31, 2017. The variable rates presented reflect the weighted average
LIBOR rates in effect for all debt tranches plus interest rate margins in effect as of December 31, 2017. The
Term Loan A margin in effect at December 31, 2017 is 2.00%, and along with the revolving line of credit, is
subject to adjustment depending upon changes in certain of our financial ratios, including a leverage ratio.
Term Loan B currently bears interest at LIBOR plus an interest rate margin of 2.75%.

(dollars in millions)

Our senior secured credit facilities, which include Term Loan A and Term Loan B, consist of various

individual tranches of debt that can range in maturity from one month to twelve months (currently, all
tranches are one month in duration). For Term Loan A and Term Loan B, each tranche bears interest at a
LIBOR rate that is determined by the duration of such tranche plus an interest rate margin. The LIBOR variable
component of the interest rate for each tranche is reset as such tranche matures and a new tranche is
established. LIBOR can fluctuate significantly depending upon conditions in the credit and capital markets.

As of December 31, 2017, our Term Loan A bears interest at LIBOR plus an interest rate margin of 2.00%

and our Term Loan B debt bears interest at LIBOR plus an interest rate margin of 2.75%. LIBOR was greater
than the 0.75% embedded LIBOR floor on Term Loan B, resulting in Term Loan B being subject to LIBOR-
based interest rate volatility on the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate as of December 31, 2017.
The LIBOR-based interest component is effectively limited to a maximum LIBOR rate of 3.50% on the
outstanding principal debt on Term Loan B and on $122.5 million of Term Loan A as a result of the interest
rate cap agreements, as described below. In addition, the uncapped portion of Term Loan A, which is subject
to the variability of LIBOR, is $652.5 million. Interest rates on our senior notes are fixed by their terms.

As of December 31, 2017, we maintain several currently effective interest rate cap agreements that were

entered into in November 2014 with notional amounts totaling $3.5 billion. These cap agreements became
effective September 30, 2016 and have the economic effect of capping the LIBOR variable component of our
interest rate at a maximum of 3.50% on an equivalent amount of our debt. These cap agreements expire on
June 30, 2018. As of December 31, 2017, these cap agreements had an immaterial fair value. During the year
ended December 31, 2017, we recognized debt expense of $8.3 million from these caps. During the year
ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a loss of $0.1 million in other comprehensive income due to a
decrease in the unrealized fair value of these cap agreements.

As of December 31, 2017, we also maintain several forward interest rate cap agreements that were

entered into in October 2015 with notional amounts totaling $3.5 billion. These forward cap agreements will
become effective June 29, 2018 and will have the economic effect of capping the LIBOR variable component
of our interest rate at a maximum of 3.50% on an equivalent amount of its debt. These cap agreements expire

142

on June 30, 2020. As of December 31, 2017, the total fair value of these cap agreements was an asset of
approximately $1.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a loss of $8.8 million in
other comprehensive income due to a decrease in the unrealized fair value of these cap agreements.

Our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the senior secured credit facilities was 4.45%,

based on the current margins in effect of 2.00% for Term Loan A and the Revolver and 2.75% for Term Loan
B, as of December 31, 2017.

Our overall weighted average effective interest rate during the year ended December 31, 2017 was

4.70% and as of December 31, 2017 was 4.88%.

As of December 31, 2017, we had $300 million drawn on our $1.0 billion revolving line of credit under our
senior secured credit facilities, in addition to approximately $14.4 million committed for outstanding letters of
credit. We also have approximately $90.1 million of additional outstanding letters of credit related to Kidney
Care and $0.2 million of committed outstanding letters of credit related to DMG, which is backed by a
certificate of deposit.

We believe that we will generate significant operating cash flows and will have sufficient liquidity to fund

our scheduled debt service and other obligations and working capital needs for the foreseeable future,
including the next 12 months, under the terms of our debt agreements. Our primary sources of liquidity are
cash from operations and cash from borrowings.

One means of assessing exposure to debt-related interest rate changes is a duration-based analysis that
measures the potential loss in net income resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis
points across all variable rate maturities (referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve). Under this model,
with all else constant, it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately
$27.6 million, $11.6 million, and $9.3 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and
2015, respectively.

Exchange rate sensitivity

While our business is predominantly conducted in the U.S. we have developing operations in 11 other
countries as well. For financial reporting purposes, the U.S. dollar is our reporting currency. However, the
functional currencies of our operating businesses in other countries are typically those of the countries in
which they operate. Therefore, changes in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and the local
currencies in which our international operations are conducted affect our results of operations and financial
position as reported in our consolidated financial statements.

We have consolidated the balance sheets of our non-U.S. dollar denominated operations into U.S. dollars
at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date and have translated their revenues and expense at
average exchange rates during the period. Additionally, our individual subsidiaries are exposed to
transactional risks mainly resulting from intercompany transactions between and among subsidiaries with
different functional currencies. This exposes the subsidiaries to fluctuations in the rate of exchange between
the invoicing or obligation currencies and the currency in which their local operations are conducted.

We evaluate our exposure to foreign exchange risk through the judgment of our regional and corporate
management teams. Through 2017, our international operations remained fairly small relative to the size of
our consolidated financial statements, constituting less than 6% of our consolidated assets as of
December 31, 2017 and approximately 3% of our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31,
2017. In addition, our foreign currency translation gains (losses) were less than approximately 6%, (2)%, and
(3)% of our consolidated operating income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk (continued)

Given the still small size of our international operations, management does not consider our exposure to
foreign exchange risk to be significant to the consolidated enterprise. As such, through December 31, 2017 we
have not engaged in transactions to hedge the exposure of our international transactions or net investments
to foreign currency risk. However, we may do so in the future.
