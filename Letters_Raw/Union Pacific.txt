2007 ANNUAL REPORT 

Fellow Shareholders: 

 

By nearly every measure, 2007 was one of the best years in our Company’s history. We achieved 
this  success  by  fulfilling  our  commitments  to  customers,  communities,  employees  and  our 
shareholders.  
 

(cid:131)  We operated a safer railroad for our customers, employees and communities.   
 
(cid:131)  We overcame the challenges of a weaker economy and record-high diesel fuel prices to set 

numerous financial records.   

(cid:131)  We  increased  our  value  to  customers  through  improved  service.  Customers  recognized 
these efforts, rewarding us with their highest satisfaction survey marks since our merger 
with the Southern Pacific.   

(cid:131)  We  contributed  to  the  communities  where  we  operate  by  offering  good  jobs  and 

supporting economic development and community organizations. 

 

 

 

The  progress  we  made  in  these  areas  enabled  us  to  deliver  strong  shareholder  returns.  During 
2007, Union Pacific’s stock price appreciated nearly 37 percent, dividends increased 47 percent, 
and shareholders received $1.5 billion through share repurchases. 
 
We expect 2008 will be another record year. Although we will be challenged by economic softness 
and volatile diesel fuel prices, we expect to offset these issues as the long-term initiatives we began 
a few years ago continue to pay off.  
 
America’s transportation infrastructure needs capacity investment. Union Pacific has pledged to 
do its part by investing for growth as we improve our financial returns. The “proof statement” 
can be seen in our actions. We invested a record $3.1 billion during 2007, as we earned record 
profits  and  improved  our  return  on  invested  capital.  Our  plans  for  2008  are  similar  -  generate 
record  profits,  increase  returns  and  invest  an  additional  $3.1  billion  for  safety,  service,  growth 
and efficiency. 
 
Union  Pacific  plays  a  critical  role  in  our  nation’s  pursuit  of  energy  independence  and 
environmental  responsibility.  Railroads  are  the  most  fuel  efficient,  environmentally  friendly 
mode of ground freight transportation, moving one ton more than 790 miles on a gallon of diesel 
fuel.  In  addition,  our  numerous  technology  and  process  innovations  are  driving  even  greater 
conservation, already having saved nearly 21 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2007. One example is 
a new switch locomotive that reduces emissions as much as 80 percent and is at least 15 percent 
more fuel efficient. 
 
The  men  and  women  of  Union  Pacific  are  the  driving  force  behind  our  success  as  a  company. 
They  are  prepared  to  handle  the  challenges  ahead  as  we  recruit,  train  and  develop  one  of  the 
nation’s  most  productive  workforces.  The  Union  Pacific  team  is  dedicated  to  continuing  the 
strong tradition built over the past 146 years, and we look forward to a very successful future.

OPERATIONS 
 
The Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one reportable operating segment. Although 
revenue is analyzed by commodity group, we analyze the net financial results of the Railroad as one segment 
due  to  the  integrated  nature  of  our  rail  network.  Additional  information  regarding  our  business  and 
operations,  including  revenue  and  financial  information  and  data  and  other  information  regarding 
environmental matters, is presented in Selected Financial Data, Item 6; Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Item 7; and the Financial Statements and Supplementary 
Data, Item 8.  
 
Operations – UPRR is a Class I railroad operating in 
the United States. We have 32,205 route miles, linking 
Pacific Coast and Gulf Coast ports with the Midwest 
and  eastern  United  States  gateways  and  providing 
several corridors to key Mexican gateways. We serve 
the  western  two-thirds  of  the  country  and  maintain 
coordinated schedules with other rail carriers to move 
freight  to  and  from  the  Atlantic  Coast,  the  Pacific 
Coast,  the  Southeast,  the  Southwest,  Canada,  and 
Mexico. Export and import traffic moves through Gulf 
Coast and Pacific Coast ports and across the Mexican 
and Canadian borders. Our freight traffic consists of 
bulk, manifest, and premium business. Bulk traffic is 
primarily coal, grain, rock, or soda ash in unit trains – 
trains  transporting  a  single  commodity  from  one 
source to one destination. Manifest traffic is individual carload or less than train-load business, including 
commodities such as lumber, steel, paper, and food. The transportation of finished vehicles and intermodal 
containers is part of our premium business. In 2007, we generated commodity revenue totaling $15.5 billion 
from the following six commodity groups: 
 
Agricultural – Transporting agricultural products, including whole grains, commodities produced from these 
grains, and food and beverage products, provided 17% of our 2007 commodity revenue. With access to most 
major grain markets, we provide a critical link between the Midwest and western producing areas and export 
terminals in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) and Gulf ports, as well as Mexico. Unit trains of grain efficiently 
shuttle between producers and export terminals or domestic markets. We also serve significant domestic 
markets, including grain processors, animal feeders, and ethanol producers in the Midwest, West, South, and 
Rocky  Mountain  states.  Primary  food  commodities  consist  of  a  variety  of  fresh  and  frozen  fruits  and 
vegetables,  dairy  products,  and  beverages,  which  are  moved  to  major  U.S.  population  centers  for 
consumption. Express Lane and our Produce Unit Train, our premium perishables services that move fruits 
and vegetables from the PNW and California with priority service to destinations in the East, compete with 
the  trucking  industry.  We  transport  frozen  meat  and  poultry  to  the  West  Coast  ports  for  export,  while 
beverages, primarily beer, enter the U.S. from Mexico.  
 
Automotive  –  We  are  the  largest  automotive  carrier  west  of  the  Mississippi  River,  serving  seven  vehicle 
assembly plants and distributing imported vehicles from six West Coast ports and Houston. We off-load 
finished vehicles at 38 vehicle distribution centers for delivery by truck to all major western U.S. cities. In 
addition to transporting finished vehicles, we provide expedited handling of automotive parts in both boxcars 
and intermodal containers to several assembly plants. We carry automotive materials bound for assembly 
plants in Mexico, the U.S., and Canada, and we also transport finished vehicles from manufacturing facilities 
in Mexico. In 2007, transportation of finished vehicles and automotive materials accounted for 9% of our 
commodity revenue.  
 
Chemicals – Transporting chemicals provided 15% of our commodity revenue in 2007. Our franchise enables 
us to serve the chemical producing areas along the Gulf Coast, as well as the Rocky Mountain region. Two-

4 
 

 

thirds of the chemicals business consists of liquid and dry chemicals, plastics, and liquid petroleum products. 
In addition to transporting plastics, customers also leverage our storage-in-transit yards for intermediate 
storage of plastic resins. Soda ash shipments originate in southwestern Wyoming and California destined 
primarily for glass producing markets in the East, the West, and abroad. Fertilizer movements originate 
primarily in the Gulf Coast region, as well as the West and Canada, bound for major agricultural users in the 
Midwest and the western U.S.  
 
Energy – Coal transportation accounted for 20% of our 2007 commodity revenue. Our geographic network 
allows us to transport coal destined for utilities and industrial facilities in 27 states, as well as to the Gulf and 
rail/barge/ship facilities on the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers and the Great Lakes. We serve mines located in the 
Southern  Powder  River  Basin  of  Wyoming  (SPRB),  Colorado,  Utah,  southern  Wyoming,  and  southern 
Illinois. SPRB coal represents the largest growth segment of the market, as utilities continue to favor its lower 
cost and low-sulfur content.  
 
Industrial  Products  –  Our  extensive  network  enables  our  industrial  products  group  to  move  numerous 
commodities  between  thousands  of  origin  and  destination  points  throughout  North  America.  Lumber 
shipments originate primarily in the PNW and Canada for destinations throughout the United States for new 
home construction and repair and remodeling. Commercial and highway construction drives shipments of 
steel and construction products, consisting of rock, cement, and roofing materials. Paper and consumer 
goods,  including  furniture  and  appliances,  are  shipped  to  major  metropolitan  areas  for  consumers. 
Nonferrous metals and industrial minerals are moved for industrial manufacturing. In addition, we provide 
efficient and safe transportation for government entities and waste companies. In 2007, transporting industrial 
products provided 20% of our commodity revenue.  
 
Intermodal – Our intermodal business, which represented 19% of our 2007 commodity revenue, includes 
international, domestic, and premium shipments. International business consists of imported container traffic 
that  arrives  at  West  Coast  ports  via  steamship  for  destinations  throughout  the  United  States.  Domestic 
business  includes  domestic  container  and  trailer  traffic  for  intermodal  marketing  companies  (primarily 
shipper agents and consolidators) and truckload carriers. Less-than-truckload and package carriers with time-
sensitive business requirements account for the majority of our premium service.  
 
Seasonality – Some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons, reflecting either or both the 
nature of the commodity, such as certain agricultural and food products that have specific growing and 
harvesting seasons, and the demand cycle for the commodity, such as intermodal traffic, which generally has a 
peak shipping season during the third quarter to meet holiday-related demand for consumer goods during the 
fourth quarter. The peak shipping seasons for these commodities can vary considerably from year to year 
depending  upon  various  factors,  including  the  strength  of  domestic  and  international  economies  and 
currencies and the strength of harvests and market prices of agricultural products. In response to an annual 
request delivered by the Surface Transportation Board (STB) to all of the Class I railroads operating in the 
U.S., we issue a letter during the third quarter detailing our plans for handling traffic during the third and 
fourth quarters and providing other information requested by the STB.  
 
Working Capital – We currently have, and historically have had, a working capital deficit, which is common 
in our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity or financial stability. We maintain adequate resources 
to meet our daily cash requirements, and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities. 

 

Competition – We are subject to competition from other railroads, motor carriers, ship and barge operators, 
and pipelines. Our main rail competitor is Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation. Its rail subsidiary, 
BNSF Railway Company (BNSF), operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors. In addition, 
we operate in corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers. Motor carrier competition is particularly 
strong for five of our six commodity groups (excluding energy). Because of the proximity of our routes to 
major inland and Gulf Coast waterways, barge competition can be particularly effective, especially for grain 
and bulk commodities. In addition to price competition, we face competition with respect to transit times and 
quality and reliability of service. While we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system, trucks and 

5 
 

 

barges  are  able  to  use  public  rights-of-way  maintained  by  public  entities.  Any  future  improvements  or 
expenditures  materially  increasing  the  quality  or  reducing  the  costs  of  these  alternative  modes  of 
transportation, or legislation releasing motor carriers from their size or weight limitations, could have a 
material adverse effect on our business. 
 
Equipment Suppliers – We depend on two key domestic suppliers of locomotives. Due to the capital intensive 
nature and sophistication of this equipment, potential new suppliers face high barriers to entry with respect to 
this industry. Therefore, if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives, we could 
experience a significant cost increase and risk reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our 
operations. 
 
Employees – Approximately 86% of our 50,089 full-time-equivalent employees are represented by 14 major 
rail unions. In January 2005, the U.S. railroads began the current round of negotiations with the unions. In 
June 2007, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way 
Employees, the Brotherhood of Railway Signalmen, the National Conference of Firemen and Oilers, the 
International Brotherhood of Boilermakers and Blacksmiths, and the Sheet Metal Workers ratified a five-year 
agreement that provides for wage increases and increased employee health and welfare cost sharing. The 
annual wage increases (including retroactive increases) are as follows:  July 2005 2.5%; July 2006 3.0%; July 
2007 3.0%; July 2008 4.0%; July 2009 4.5%. A second bargaining group consisting of the Transportation 
Communications  International  Union,  the  Brotherhood  of  Railway  Carman,  and  the  International 
Brotherhood  of  Electrical  Workers  ratified  the  same  agreement  in  September  of  2007.  However,  the 
International Association of Machinists (IAM) failed to ratify this agreement in September. We also settled 
with  the  American  Railway  and  Airway  Supervisors  Association  in  September.  We  reached  a  tentative 
agreement with the United Transportation Union in January of 2008. Therefore, we remain in negotiations 
with the IAM and United Supervisors Council of America (Yardmasters). Existing agreements with these two 
unions continue in effect until new agreements are reached or the Railway Labor Act’s procedures (which 
include  mediation,  cooling-off  periods,  and  the  possibility  of  Presidential  intervention)  are  exhausted. 
Contract negotiations with the various unions generally take place over an extended period of time, and we 
rarely experience work stoppages during negotiations. The current agreements provide for periodic cost of 
living increases until new agreements are reached.   
 
GOVERNMENTAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION 
 
Governmental Regulation – Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local regulations, 
generally  applicable  to  all  businesses  (see  also  the  discussion  of  certain  regulatory  proceedings  in  Legal 
Proceedings, Item 3).  
 
The operations of the Railroad are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the STB of the United States 
Department of Transportation (DOT). The operations of the Railroad are also subject to the regulations of the 
Federal Railroad Administration of the DOT and other federal and state agencies. The STB has jurisdiction 
over  rates  charged  on  certain  regulated  rail  traffic;  freight  car  compensation;  transfer,  extension,  or 
abandonment of rail lines; and acquisition of control of rail common carriers. On January 26, 2007, the STB 
issued a decision limiting the manner in which U.S. railroads can calculate fuel surcharges on traffic regulated 
by the STB, and we have complied with this regulation. The STB also has adopted new mechanisms for 
regulating some of our rates, adopted a new methodology for calculating the cost of capital for railroads, and 
expanded  its  review  of  line  sales  and  leases.  Various  appeals  may  affect  these  regulations  prior  to  final 
implementation.  
 
DOT, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the Department of Homeland Security, along 
with other federal agencies, have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety, movement of hazardous materials, 
movement and disposal of hazardous waste, emissions requirements, and equipment standards. Various state 
and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of 
hazardous materials in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law.

Environmental  Regulation  –  We  are  subject  to  extensive  federal  and  state  environmental  statutes  and 
regulations pertaining to public health and the environment. The statutes and regulations are administered 
and monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and by various state environmental agencies. 
The primary laws affecting our operations are the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, regulating the 
management  and  disposal  of  solid  and  hazardous  wastes;  the  Comprehensive  Environmental  Response, 
Compensation,  and  Liability  Act,  regulating  the  cleanup  of  contaminated properties; the Clean Air Act, 
regulating air emissions; and the Clean Water Act, regulating waste water discharges.  
 
Information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth 
in  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  –  Critical 
Accounting Policies – Environmental, Item 7.  
 
Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
The information set forth in this Item 1A should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information 
included in this report, including Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations, and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  
 
We Are Subject to Significant Governmental Regulation – We are subject to governmental regulation by a 
significant  number  of  federal,  state,  and  local  authorities  covering  a  variety  of  health,  safety,  labor, 
environmental (as discussed below), and other matters.  Many laws and regulations require us to obtain and 
maintain various licenses, permits, and other authorizations, and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to 
be able to do so. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse 
effect on us. Governments may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which we operate 
without  providing  us  any  recourse  to  address  any  adverse  effects  on  our  business,  including,  without 
limitation, regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution, business relationships with other 
railroads, calculation of our cost of capital or other inputs relevant to determining or estimating our revenue 
adequacy, and costs and expenses. Increased regulation of the rail industry likely would restrict our ability to 
determine  prices  for  certain  rail  services,  affect  our  ability  to  control  traffic  volume,  and  reduce  capital 
spending on our rail network, facilities and equipment, resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of 
operations, financial condition, and liquidity.  Additionally, one or more consolidations of Class I railroads 
could lead to increased regulation of the rail industry.  
 
We May Be Affected by General Economic Conditions – Prolonged negative changes in domestic and global 
economic conditions affecting the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry may have a material 
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
  
We May Be Subject to Various Claims and Lawsuits That Could Result in Significant Expenditures – The nature 
of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, 
personal  injury,  property  damage,  environmental  liability,  and  other  matters.  Any  material  changes  to 
litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving any or all of property damage, 
personal injury, and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, 
financial condition, and liquidity.  
 
We Are Required to Transport Hazardous Materials – Federal laws require railroads, including us, to transport 
hazardous materials regardless of risk or potential exposure of loss. Any rail accident or other incident or 
accident  on  our  network,  at  our  facilities,  or  at  the  facilities  of  our  customers  involving  the  release  of 
hazardous  materials,  including  toxic  inhalation  hazard  (or  TIH)  materials  such  as  certain  chlorine 
compounds,  could  involve  significant  costs  and  claims  for  personal  injury,  property  damage,  and 
environmental  penalties  and  remediation,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  results  of 
operations, financial condition, and liquidity.  
 
We  Must  Manage  Both  Significant  Demand  for  Our Services and Network Capacity – We may experience 
network difficulties, including congestion and reduced velocity, which may compromise the level of service we 

7 
 

 

provide to our customers. This level of demand may compound the impact of weather and weather-related 
events  on  our  operations  and  velocity.  Although  we  continue  to  improve  our  transportation  plan,  add 
capacity, and improve operations at our yards and other facilities, we cannot be sure that these measures will 
fully or adequately address any service shortcomings.  We may experience other difficulties related to network 
capacity, dramatic and unplanned increases or decreases of demand for rail service with respect to one or 
more  of  our  commodity  groups,  or  other  events  that  could  have  a  negative  impact  on  our  operational 
efficiency, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, 
and liquidity.  
 
Severe Weather Could Result in Significant Business Interruptions and Expenditures – Severe weather conditions, 
events, and other natural phenomena, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, mudslides or landslides, 
extreme temperatures, and significant precipitation may cause business interruptions, including line outages 
on our rail network that can adversely affect our entire rail network and result in increased costs, increased 
liabilities, and decreased revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, 
financial condition, and liquidity.  
 
Strikes or Work Stoppages Could Adversely Affect Our Operations as the Majority of Our Employees Belong to 
Labor Unions and Labor Agreements – We are a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor 
unions. Disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable 
contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages, or other slowdowns 
by the affected workers. If unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, or 
other employees were to become unionized, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations or 
higher ongoing labor costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, 
financial condition, and liquidity. Additionally, future national labor agreements, or renegotiation of labor 
agreements or provisions of labor agreements, could compromise our service reliability and significantly 
increase our costs for healthcare, wages, and other benefits, which could have a material adverse impact on our 
results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.  
 
The Availability of Qualified Personnel Could Adversely Affect Our Operations – Changes in demographics, 
training requirements, and the availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect our ability to meet 
demand for rail service. Unpredictable increases in demand for rail services and a lack of network fluidity may 
exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a 
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.  
 
We Rely on Technology and Technology Improvements in Our Business Operations – We rely on information 
technology in all aspects of our business. If we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if we 
are unable to implement new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry 
and with companies providing other modes of transportation service, which could have a material adverse 
effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Additionally, if we experience significant 
disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems, including computer hardware, 
software, and communications equipment, we could experience a service interruption, safety failure, security 
breach,  or  other  operational  difficulties,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  our  results  of 
operations, financial condition, and liquidity.  
 
We Are Subject to Significant Environmental Laws and Regulations – Our operations are subject to extensive 
federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the 
air; discharges to waters; handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and other materials; and 
hazardous material or petroleum releases. We generate and transport hazardous and non-hazardous waste in 
our operations, and we did so in our former operations. Environmental liability can extend to previously 
owned or operated properties, leased properties, and properties owned by third parties, as well as to properties 
we currently own. Environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent 
landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation. We have been and may be subject to allegations or 
findings that we have violated, or are strictly liable under, these laws or regulations. We could incur significant 
costs as a result of any of the foregoing, and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate 

8 
 

 

and  remediate  known,  unknown,  or  future  environmental  contamination,  which  could  have  a  material 
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.  
 
We May Be Affected by Climate Change and Market or Regulatory Responses to Climate Change – Climate 
change,  including  the  impact  of  global  warming,  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  results  of 
operations, financial condition, and liquidity.  Restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions of 
greenhouse gasses, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs.  Restrictions on 
emissions could also affect our customers that (a) use commodities that we carry to produce energy, (b) use 
significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry, or (c) manufacture or 
produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels, including chemical producers, 
farmers and food producers, and automakers and other manufacturers.  Significant cost increases, government 
regulation, or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy 
or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry, which in turn could 
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.  Government 
incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our customers and 
the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic 
patterns, including, for example, the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers. Finally, 
we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to 
climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change.  Any of these factors, individually 
or in operation with one or more of the other factors, or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could 
reduce  the  amount  of  traffic  we  handle  and  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  results  of  operations, 
financial condition, and liquidity. 
 
Rising or Elevated Fuel Costs and Whether We Are Able to Mitigate These Costs with Fuel Surcharges Could 
Materially and Adversely Affect Our Business – Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation 
expenses. Diesel fuel prices are subject to dramatic fluctuations, and significant price increases could have a 
material  adverse  effect  on  our  operating  results.  Although  we  currently  are  able  to  recover  a  significant 
amount of our increased fuel expenses through revenue from fuel surcharges, we cannot be certain that we will 
always  be  able  to mitigate rising or elevated fuel costs through surcharges. Future market conditions or 
legislative or regulatory activities could adversely affect our ability to apply fuel surcharges or adequately 
recover increased fuel costs through fuel surcharges. International, political, and economic circumstances 
affect fuel prices and supplies. Weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity. If a 
fuel  supply  shortage  were  to  arise  higher  fuel  prices  could,  despite  our  fuel  surcharge  programs,  have  a 
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.  
 
We Face Competition from Other Railroads and Other Transportation Providers – We face competition from 
other  railroads,  motor  carriers,  ships,  barges,  and  pipelines.  In  addition  to  price  competition,  we  face 
competition with respect to transit times and quality and reliability of service. While we must build or acquire 
and maintain our rail system, trucks and barges are able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public 
entities. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of 
alternative  modes  of  transportation,  or  legislation  releasing  motor  carriers  from  their  size  or  weight 
limitations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Additionally, any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect the competitive environment 
in which we operate.  
 
We Are Subject to Legislative, Regulatory, and Legal Developments Involving Taxes – Taxes are a significant part 
of our expenses.  We are subject to federal and state income, payroll, property, sales and use, fuel, and other 
types of taxes.  Any or all changes in tax rates, enactment of new tax laws, revisions of tax regulations, and 
claims or litigation with taxing authorities could result in substantially higher taxes and, therefore, could have 
a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.  
 
We Utilize Capital Markets – We rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements, 
including the issuance of long-term debt instruments and commercial paper from time to time, as well as the 
sale of certain of our receivables.  Significant instability of the capital markets or deterioration of our financial 
condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit our access to commercial paper and 

9 
 

 

other financing sources and reduce our credit ratings below investment grade, which would prohibit us from 
utilizing our sale of receivables program and significantly increase the costs associated with issuing both 
commercial paper and long-term debt.  
 
We Are Dependent on Two Key Domestic Suppliers of Locomotives – Due to the capital intensive nature and 
sophistication of locomotive equipment, potential new suppliers face high barriers to entry with respect to this 
industry. Therefore, if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives, we could 
experience a significant cost increase and risk reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our 
operations.  
 
We May Be Affected by Acts of Terrorism, War, or Risk of War – Our rail lines, facilities, and equipment, 
including rail cars carrying hazardous materials, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist 
attacks. Terrorist attacks, or other similar events, any government response thereto, and war or risk of war 
may  adversely  affect  our  results  of  operations,  financial  condition,  and  liquidity.  In  addition,  insurance 
premiums for some or all of our current coverages could increase dramatically, or certain coverages may not 
be available to us in the future.  
 
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments 
 
None. 
 
Item 2. Properties 
 
We employ a variety of assets in the management and operation of our rail business.  Our rail network links 23 
states in the western two-thirds of the U.S.

Harriman Dispatching Center – The Harriman Dispatching Center (HDC), located in Omaha, Nebraska, is 
our primary dispatching facility. It is linked to regional dispatching and locomotive management facilities at 
various  locations  along  our  network.  The  HDC  moves  locomotives  and  trains,  manages  traffic  on  our 
network, and coordinates interchanges with other railroads. Over 700 employees currently work on-site in the 
facility. 
 
Rail Facilities – In addition to our track structure, we operate numerous facilities, including terminals for 
intermodal and other freight; rail yards for train-building, switching, storage-in-transit (the temporary storage 
of customer goods in rail cars prior to shipment) and other activities; offices to administer and manage our 
operations; dispatch centers to direct traffic on our rail network; crew quarters to house train crews along our 
network; and shops and other facilities for fueling, maintenance, and repair of locomotives and repair and 
maintenance of rail cars and other equipment.  The following tables include the major yards and terminals on 
our system:

Capital Expenditures – Our rail network requires significant annual capital investments for maintenance, 
improvement,  and  expansion.  These  investments  maintain  and  enhance  safe  operations,  support  the 
transportation needs of our customers, and improve our operational efficiency. Additionally, we add new 
locomotives and freight cars to our fleet to replace older, less efficient equipment, to support growth and 
customer  demand,  and  to  reduce  our  impact  on  the  environment  through  the  acquisition  of  more  fuel 
efficient and low emission locomotives, including yard engines that use new hybrid technology. 
 
2007 Capital Expenditures – During 2007, we made capital investments totaling $3.1 billion, which included 
cash spending of $2.5 billion (see the capital expenditures table in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financial Condition, Item 
7). We also acquired 259 locomotives and 150 freight cars under long-term operating leases with an aggregate 
net present value of $434 million. We procured an additional 56 locomotives and other equipment through 
capital lease financings valued at $82 million. 
 

12 
 

 

Sunset Corridor Expansion – One of our critical routes is the Sunset Corridor, a 760-mile route running 
between Los Angeles and El Paso, Texas. This heavily traveled corridor carries about 20 percent of our traffic, 
including  a  significant  amount  of  intermodal  traffic.  In  2007,  we  added 33 miles of double track to the 
corridor, which now includes nearly 410 miles of double track (approximately 54% of the route). 
 
SPRB Joint-Line Expansion – An important part of our franchise is our access to the coal-producing SPRB 
through  a  joint  line,  which  we  own  with  BNSF  (the  Joint  Line).    In  addition  to  the  significant  annual 
maintenance required on the Joint Line (due to the volume of trains, the weight of loaded coal cars, and the 
impact of coal dust on rail beds), a capacity expansion project is underway.  During 2007, we completed the 
installation of additional main line track so the entire Joint Line now has triple track. 
 
2008 Capital Expenditures – In 2008, we expect to make capital investments of approximately $3.1 billion 
(which may be revised if revenue, tax, and business conditions require changing, or new laws or regulations 
affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on, these investments). See discussion of our 2008 capital plan 
in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – 2008 Outlook, 
Item 7. 
 
Equipment Encumbrance – Equipment with a carrying value of approximately $2.8 billion at both December 
31, 2007 and 2006 serves as collateral for capital leases and other types of equipment obligations in accordance 
with the secured financing arrangements utilized to acquire such railroad equipment. 
 
As a result of the merger of Missouri Pacific Railroad Company (MPRR) with and into UPRR on January 1, 
1997, and pursuant to the underlying indentures for the MPRR mortgage bonds, UPRR must maintain the 
same value of assets after the merger in order to comply with the security requirements of the mortgage bonds. 
As of the merger date, the value of the MPRR assets that secured the mortgage bonds was approximately $6.0 
billion. In accordance with the terms of the indentures, this collateral value must be maintained during the 
entire term of the mortgage bonds irrespective of the outstanding balance of such bonds. 
 
Certain of our properties are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the protection 
of the environment (see discussion of environmental issues in Business – Governmental and Environmental 
Regulation,  Item  1,  and  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of 
Operations – Critical Accounting Policies – Environmental, Item 7). 
 
Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 
From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and litigation that occur in connection with 
our business. Management routinely assesses our liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters 
based upon the latest available information. Consistent with SEC rules and requirements, we describe below 
material pending legal proceedings (other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business), material 
proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities, other proceedings arising under federal, 
state, or local environmental laws and regulations (including governmental proceedings involving potential 
fines, penalties, or other monetary sanctions in excess of $100,000) and such other pending matters that we 
may determine to be appropriate.  
 
Environmental Matters  
 
As we reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2007, the Railroad 
received notice from the Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) that, during its construction efforts to restore 
service to the Caliente Subdivision after severe flooding in January 2005, the Railroad may have exceeded its 
authority under emergency authorizations and permits issued by the Corps.  Subsequently, the Corps referred 
the  matter  to  the  EPA,  which  has  demanded  that  the  Railroad  repair  claimed  impacts  to  the  adjacent 
waterway, perform compensatory mitigation, and pay a civil penalty in connection with this project and 
related storm water issues.  The Railroad and the EPA have discussed the scope of additional work to be 
performed by the Railroad to address alleged impacts of its construction activities, as well as compensatory 

13 
 

 

mitigation and potential penalties.  To date, we have not reached an agreement with the EPA, and, therefore, 
the ultimate amount of the civil penalty cannot be determined.  However, the penalty component of the 
settlement will exceed $100,000. 
 
As we reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2004, the Illinois 
Attorney General’s office filed an Agreed Order and Complaint and a Complaint for Injunctive and Other 
Relief on October 7, 2004, in the Circuit Court for the Twentieth Judicial Circuit (St. Clair County) against 
The Alton & Southern Railway Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Railroad, as a result of a collision 
and derailment on September 21, 2004. The State of Illinois seeks to enjoin The Alton & Southern Railway 
Company from further violations, as well as a monetary penalty. The Railroad reached a tentative agreement 
with the State of Illinois that will require the payment of a penalty in the amount of $48,000.  The agreement 
should be executed in the first quarter of 2008. 
 
As we reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2005, the EPA considers the Railroad a potentially 
responsible party for the Omaha Lead Site. The Omaha Lead Site consists of approximately 12,800 acres of 
residential property in the eastern part of Omaha, Nebraska, allegedly impacted by air emissions from two 
former lead smelters/refineries. One refinery was operated by ASARCO. The EPA identified the Railroad as a 
potentially responsible party because more than 60 years ago the Railroad owned land that was leased to 
ASARCO. The Railroad disputes both the legal and technical basis of the EPA’s allegations. It has nonetheless 
engaged in extensive negotiations with the EPA. These negotiations reached an apparent impasse. The EPA 
issued a Unilateral Administrative Order with an effective date of December 16, 2005, directing the Railroad to 
implement an interim remedy at the site at an estimated cost of $50 million. Failure to comply with the order 
without just cause could subject the Railroad to penalties of up to $32,500 per day and triple the EPA’s costs in 
performing the work. The Railroad believes it has just cause not to comply with the order, but it offered to 
perform some of the work specified in the order as a compromise. To date, the EPA has rejected all of the 
Railroad’s  offers  to  settle  or  resolve  this  matter.  The  Railroad  will  vigorously  contest  liability  and  the 
imposition of any penalties.  
 
As we reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2005, the Illinois Attorney General’s office filed a 
complaint in the Circuit Court for the Twenty-First Judicial Circuit (St. Clair County) seeking injunctive relief 
and civil penalties against the Railroad relating to a collision between UPRR and Norfolk Southern Railway 
Company (NS) trains near Momence, Illinois, on November 24, 2005. The collision derailed approximately 
five locomotives and 30 railcars. Two of the UPRR locomotives and two of the NS locomotives caught fire, 
and four of the locomotives released approximately 16,000 gallons of diesel fuel. Other cars carrying food 
products derailed and released an unknown amount of product. The State of Illinois seeks a permanent 
injunction against the Railroad ordering UPRR to continue remediation. The State of Illinois seeks to enjoin 
UPRR  from  further  violations  and  payment  of  a  monetary  penalty.    Union  Pacific  reached  a  tentative 
agreement with the State of Illinois that will require payment of $60,000, which includes a penalty payment 
and the amount of the State’s response costs.  The agreement should be executed in the first quarter of 2008. 
 
As we reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2005, the Illinois Attorney General’s office filed a 
complaint in the Circuit Court for the Twentieth Judicial Circuit (St. Clair County) for injunctive and other 
relief on November 28, 2005, against the Railroad, alleging a diesel fuel spill from an above-ground storage 
tank in a rail yard in Dupo, St. Clair County, Illinois. The State of Illinois seeks to enjoin UPRR from further 
violations and a monetary penalty. The amount of the proposed penalty is uncertain.  
 
As we reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2003, the United States Attorney for the Central 
District of California notified the Railroad that the office intended to pursue criminal charges against the 
Railroad  for  alleged  violations  of  federal  environmental  laws,  including  the  federal  Clean  Water  Act,  in 
connection with releases of oil contaminated wastewater from our Taylor Yard in 2001 and 2003. On July 31, 
2006, the United States Attorney filed criminal misdemeanor charges against us for these releases in the United 
States District Court for the Central District of California, and we received the Summons from the Court on 
August 8, 2006. We will vigorously defend the charges.

We received notices from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are or may be liable 
under federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various sites throughout the United States, 
including sites on the Superfund National Priorities List or state superfund lists. We cannot predict the 
ultimate  impact  of  these  proceedings  and  suits because of the number of potentially responsible parties 
involved, the degree of contamination by various wastes, the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to 
many of the sites, and the speculative nature of remediation costs.  
 
Information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth 
in  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  –  Critical 
Accounting Policies – Environmental, Item 7.  
 
Other Matters  
 
As we reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2007, 20 small rail 
shippers (many of whom are represented by the same law firms) filed virtually identical antitrust lawsuits in 
various federal district courts against us and four other Class I railroads in the U.S. The original plaintiff filed 
the first of these claims in the U.S. District Court in New Jersey on May 14, 2007, and the additional plaintiffs 
filed claims in district courts in various states, including Florida, Illinois, Alabama, Pennsylvania, and the 
District of Columbia.  These suits allege that the railroads engaged in price-fixing by establishing common fuel 
surcharges for certain rail traffic.  
 
We received additional complaints during the third and fourth quarters of 2007, increasing the total number 
of complaints to 30.  A few of these suits involve plaintiffs alleging that they are or were indirect purchasers of 
rail transportation and seeking to represent the class of indirect purchasers of rail transportation that paid fuel 
surcharges.  These complaints have added allegations under state antitrust and consumer protection laws.  All 
of these “copycat” lawsuits (whether filed by direct or indirect purchasers of rail transportation) are being filed 
by various groups of plaintiffs’ lawyers seeking to become lead counsel in a nationwide class action against the 
railroads. Each of the plaintiffs requests certification of its complaint as a class-action.  On November 6, 2007, 
the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered that all of the rail fuel surcharge cases be transferred to 
the U.S. District Court in D.C. for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. 
 
Additionally, the Attorney General of a state outside our service area issued a grand jury subpoena to us 
requesting documents pertaining to our fuel surcharge program. We met with representatives of this Attorney 
General’s office, and we plan to have additional meetings in the future in an effort to resolve that office’s 
interest in this matter.  
 
We deny the allegations that our fuel surcharge program violates the antitrust laws or any other laws. We 
believe  that  these  lawsuits  are  without  merit,  and  we  will  vigorously  defend  our  actions.  Therefore,  we 
currently believe that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on any of our results of operations, 
financial condition, and liquidity. 
 
Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders 
 
No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of 2007.

Executive Officers of the Registrant and Principal Executive Officers of Subsidiaries  
 
The Board of Directors typically elects and designates our executive officers on an annual basis at the board 
meeting  held  in  conjunction  with  the  Annual  Meeting  of  Shareholders,  and  they  hold  office  until  their 
successors are elected. Executive officers also may be elected and designated throughout the year, as the Board 
of Directors considers appropriate. There are no family relationships among the officers, nor any arrangement 
or understanding between any officer and any other person pursuant to which the officer was selected. The 
following table sets forth certain information, as of February 15, 2008, relating to the executive officers.

At  January  31,  2008,  there  were  260,700,527  shares  of  outstanding  common  stock  and  35,295  common 
shareholders of record. At that date, the closing price of the common stock on the NYSE was $124.76. We have 
paid dividends to our common shareholders during each of the past 108 years. We declared dividends totaling 
$396 million in 2007 and $323 million in 2006. On November 15, 2007, we increased the quarterly dividend to 
$0.44 per share, payable beginning on January 2, 2008, to shareholders of record on November 29, 2007. We 
are subject to certain restrictions regarding retained earnings with respect to the payment of cash dividends to 
our  shareholders.  The  amount  of  retained  earnings  available  for  dividends  increased  to  $11.5  billion  at 
December 31, 2007, from $7.8 billion at December 31, 2006. See discussion of this restriction in Management’s 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources, 
Item 7. We do not believe the restriction on retained earnings will affect our ability to pay dividends, and we 
currently expect to pay dividends in 2008 comparable to 2007.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and 
applicable notes to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8, and other information in this 
report,  including  Risk  Factors  set  forth  in  Item  1A  and  Critical  Accounting  Policies  and  Cautionary 
Information at the end of this Item 7.  
 
The Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one reportable operating segment. Although 
we analyze revenue by commodity group, we analyze the net financial results of the Railroad as one segment 
due to the integrated nature of our rail network.  
 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

 

2007 Results  

 

(cid:127) 

 
(cid:127) 

Safety – We operated a safer railroad in 2007, improving safety for our employees, customers, and the 
public. The employee injury incident rate per 200,000 man-hours declined to its lowest level. A continued 
focus on derailment prevention in 2007 resulted in a 14% reduction in incidents, with associated costs 
declining  13%.  In  the  area  of  public  safety,  we  closed  482  grade  crossings  to  reduce  our  exposure 
incidents,  and  we  installed  additional  video  cameras  in  our  road  locomotives.  As  a  result  of  this 
installation work, we now have camera-equipped locomotives in the lead position of over 85% of our road 
trains. These video cameras allow us to better analyze grade crossing incidents, thereby increasing safety 
for our employees and the public. The number of grade crossing incidents decreased 9% during the year, 
despite the combination of increasing highway traffic and urban expansion. Also, through extensive 
trespass  reduction  programs,  we  were  able  to  reduce  trespasser  incidents  by  21%.  All  of  these 
improvements are the result of comprehensive efforts to enhance employee training, increase public 
education, make capital investments, and take proactive steps to reduce safety risks. 

Financial Performance – In 2007, we generated record operating income of $3.4 billion despite lower 
volume. Yield increases, network management initiatives, and improved productivity drove the 17% 
increase in operating income. Our operating ratio was 79.3% for the year, a 2.2 point improvement 
compared to 2006. Net income of $1.86 billion also exceeded our previous milestone, translating into 
earnings of $6.91 per diluted share. 

 
(cid:127)  Commodity Revenue – Our commodity revenue grew 4% year-over-year to $15.5 billion, the highest level 
in our history. We achieved record revenue levels in five of our six commodity groups, driven primarily by 
better pricing and fuel surcharges. Since 2004, we have repriced approximately 75% of our business. 
Volume decreased 1% in 2007 due to softening markets for some of our commodities and adverse weather 
conditions. 

 
(cid:127)  Network Operations – In 2007, we significantly improved the fluidity and efficiency of our transportation 
network. Continued focus on increasing velocity, eliminating work events, improving asset utilization, 
and expanding capacity were key drivers of our operational improvement. We reduced average terminal 
dwell time by 8%, improved car utilization by 7%, and increased average train speed by 2% with ongoing 
enhancements to our Unified Plan (an ongoing program that streamlines segments of our transportation 
plan) and implementation of initiatives to make train processing at our terminals more efficient. We 
completed implementation of Customer Inventory Management System, an operational productivity 
initiative that complements the Unified Plan by reducing the number of rail cars in our terminals without 
adding capacity. We also expanded capacity and continued to use industrial engineering techniques to 
further improve network fluidity, ease capacity constraints, and improve asset utilization. Our customer 
satisfaction improved during 2007, an indication that efforts to improve network operations translated 
into better customer service.

(cid:127) 

 
(cid:127) 

Fuel Prices – Crude oil prices increased at a steady rate in 2007, rising from a low of $56.58 per barrel in 
January to close at nearly $96.00 per barrel at the end of December. Our 2007 average fuel price increased 
by 9% and added $242 million of operating expenses compared to 2006. Our fuel surcharge programs are 
designed to help offset the impact of higher fuel prices. In addition, our fuel conservation efforts allowed 
us to improve our consumption rate by 2%. Locomotive simulator training, operating practices, and 
technology all contributed to this improvement, saving approximately 21 million gallons of fuel in 2007. 

Free Cash Flow – Cash generated by operating activities totaled a record $3.3 billion, yielding free cash 
flow of $487 million in 2007. Free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities, less cash 
used in investing activities and dividends paid.  

 
Free cash flow is not considered a financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States (GAAP) by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K. We believe free cash flow is 
important  in  evaluating  our  financial  performance  and  measures  our  ability  to  generate  cash  without 
additional external financings. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute 
for, cash provided by operating activities. The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities 
(GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure):

2008 Outlook 
 
(cid:127) 

Safety – Operating a safe railroad benefits our employees, our customers, our shareholders, and the 
public. We will continue using a multi-faceted approach to safety, utilizing technology, risk assessment, 
quality control, and training for, and engaging with our employees. We plan to implement Total Safety 
Culture (TSC) throughout our operations. TSC, an employee-focused initiative that has helped improve 
safety, is a process designed to establish, maintain, and promote safety among co-workers. With respect to 
public safety, we will continue our efforts to maintain, upgrade, and close crossings, install video cameras 
on locomotives, and educate the public about crossing safety through various internal and industry 
programs, along with other activities.  

 
(cid:127)  Commodity Revenue – Despite uncertainty regarding the U.S. economy, we expect record revenue in 
2008  based  on  current  economic  indicators,  forecasted  demand,  improved  customer  service,  and 
additional opportunities to reprice certain of our business. Yield increases and fuel surcharges will be the 
primary drivers of commodity revenue growth in 2008. We expect that overall volume will fall within a 
range of 1% higher to 1% lower than 2007, with continued softness in some market sectors.   

 
(cid:127)  Transportation Plan – In 2008, we will continue to evaluate traffic flows and network logistic patterns to 
identify  additional  opportunities  to  simplify  operations  and  improve  network  efficiency  and  asset 
utilization.  We  plan  to  maintain  adequate  manpower  and  locomotives,  improve  productivity  using 
industrial engineering techniques, and improve our operating margins.  

 
(cid:127) 

Fuel Prices – Fuel prices should remain volatile, with crude oil prices and conversion and regional spreads 
fluctuating throughout the year. On average, we expect fuel prices to increase 15% to 20% above the 
average price in 2007. To reduce the impact of fuel price on earnings, we will continue to seek recovery 
from our customers through our fuel surcharge programs and expand our fuel conservation efforts.  

21 
 

 

 
(cid:127)  Capital Plan – In 2008, we expect to make capital investments of approximately $3.1 billion (which may 
be revised if revenue, tax, or business conditions require changing, or new laws or regulations affect our 
ability to generate sufficient returns on, these investments). Major investment categories include $1.6 
billion to maintain and improve track infrastructure; $840 million to increase network and terminal 
capacity; $490 million to upgrade our locomotive and freight car fleet, including the acquisition of 175 
high-horsepower  locomotives  and  new  covered  hoppers;  and  $170  million  primarily  to  upgrade 
information technology systems, including the testing of positive train control, and other capital projects. 
We expect to fund our 2008 cash capital investments through cash generated from operations, the sale or 
lease of various operating and non-operating properties, debt issuances, and cash on hand at December 
31, 2007. Our annual capital plan is a critical component of our long-term strategic plan, which we

Financial Expectations – We are cautious about the economic environment; however, we anticipate 
revenue growth and continued network improvement in 2008, which should produce financial results that 
exceed  2007.  We  expect  to  generate  earnings  of  $7.75  to  $8.25  per  diluted  share  and  improve  our 
operating ratio and return on invested capital.

Operating  revenue  includes  commodity  revenue  and  other  revenue.  The  primary  drivers  of  commodity 
revenue  are  volume  (carloads)  and  average  revenue  per  car  (ARC).  ARC  varies  with  changes  in  price, 
commodity mix, and fuel surcharges. Other revenue consists primarily of revenue earned by our subsidiaries, 
revenue from our commuter rail operations, and accessorial revenue, which we earn when customers retain 
equipment owned or controlled by us or when we perform additional services such as switching or storage.  
 
We  recognize  commodity  revenue  on  a  percentage-of-completion  basis  as  freight  moves  from  origin  to 
destination. We allocate revenue between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting 
period and recognize expenses as we incur them. We recognize other revenue as service is performed or 
contractual obligations are met. We provide incentives to our customers for meeting or exceeding specified 
cumulative volumes or shipping to and from specific locations, which we record as a reduction to revenue 
based on the actual or projected future shipments.  
 
Revenue  from  five  of  our  six  commodity  groups  increased  during  2007,  while  revenue  generated  from 
industrial products shipments declined. ARC increased 6% during 2007 driven by core price improvement.  
Lower shipments of industrial and agricultural products drove volume down 1% in 2007, more than offsetting 
an increase in chemical shipments. Our fuel surcharge programs (excluding index-based contract escalators 
that contain some provision for fuel) generated $1.5 billion in commodity revenue in 2007. Fuel surcharge 
revenue is not comparable to prior periods due to implementation of new mileage-based fuel surcharge 
programs for certain traffic. As previously disclosed in our 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the STB issued 
a decision limiting the manner in which U.S. railroads can calculate fuel surcharges on traffic regulated by the 

22 
 

 

STB. Effective April 26, 2007, we implemented new fuel surcharge programs covering this regulated traffic, 
which  represents  approximately  19%  of  our  current  revenue  base.  These  new  programs  use  mileage (as 
opposed to percent of revenue) as the basis for calculating fuel surcharges, and they use the On-Highway 
Diesel Price index – published by the Energy Information Administration – for purposes of determining fuel 
costs. The new programs affect fuel surcharges assessed for certain shipments of agricultural, chemical, and 
industrial products, and, to a lesser extent, coal.  In addition, we reset the effective base fuel price at which our 
new mileage-based fuel surcharge programs take effect, resulting in a higher starting point of $2.30 per gallon 
versus $1.35 per gallon. 
 
All six commodity groups produced double-digit revenue growth in 2006, including over 20% growth of 
revenue from agricultural commodities. Price increases, fuel surcharges, and index-based contract escalators, 
which are formulas in our shipping contracts that correlate price adjustments to certain economic indices, all 
contributed to higher ARC. Our fuel surcharge programs (excluding index-based contract escalators that 
contain some provision for fuel) generated an additional $656 million in commodity revenue compared to 
2005, contributing 5% to commodity revenue growth. Volume increased 3% during the year, led by solid 
growth of intermodal and energy shipments, which were partially offset by lower shipments of industrial 
products  and  chemicals.  Lower  volume  in  2005  due  to  the  January  West  Coast  storm,  SPRB  Joint  Line 
disruptions, Hurricane Rita and the Kansas washouts also contributed to this year-over-year growth.  
 
The following tables summarize the year-over-year changes in commodity revenue, revenue carloads, and 
ARC by commodity type:

Agricultural – Price increases were the primary drivers 
of agricultural commodity revenue in 2007, partially 
offset  by  a  decline  in  volume  levels.    Shipments  of 
whole grains used in feed declined as barge operators 
captured more shipments destined for export from the 
Gulf  Coast  due  to  both  favorable  barge  rates  and 
improved  navigation  conditions  on  the  Mississippi 
River.  Conversely,  wheat  and  food  grain  shipments 
improved  as  a  strong  wheat  crop  generated  record 
shipments to the Gulf Coast for export. Shipments of 
ethanol, a grain product used as an alternative fuel and 
fuel additive, and its co-products (primarily livestock 
feed) also increased substantially.  
 
Price increases, volume growth, and fuel surcharges increased agricultural commodity revenue in 2006 versus 
2005. Whole grains increased as strong gulf exports and higher freight charges for barge traffic shifted feed 
grain shipments to rails. Shipments of ethanol and its co-products (primarily livestock feed) also experienced 
strong growth, reflecting continued demand in this growing industry. Conversely, wheat shipments declined 
due to extremely low crop production levels in 2006 primarily due to drought conditions in wheat producing 
states. Price and fuel surcharge increases improved ARC in 2006. 
 
Automotive  –  Price  increases  drove  the  growth  in 
automotive revenue, partially offset by lower finished 
vehicle  shipments.  A  decline  in  vehicle  production 
levels primarily drove the volume decline. Conversely, 
automotive  parts  shipments  grew  due  to  increased 
volumes from domestic manufacturers, new business 
acquired  in  the  middle  of  2006,  and  our  new 
intermodal 
train  service  between  Mexico  and 
Michigan.   
 
Price  increases,  volume  growth,  and  fuel  surcharges 
increased automotive commodity revenue in 2006 over 
2005.  Shipments  of  finished  vehicles  grew  as  higher 
manufacturer inventories at the end of 2005 translated 
into record volume growth in 2006. Shipments remained relatively strong through the second quarter due to 
the production ramp-up of new models at plants served by us. Automotive parts shipments also grew due to 
conversion of traffic from trucks, new business growth, and production increases at several assembly plants 
served by us. Fuel surcharges and price increases drove the ARC improvement. 
 

24 
 

 

Chemicals – Price increases and volume growth drove the 
increase in revenue in 2007 versus 2006. Strong demand for 
potash  exports  through  Pacific  Northwest  ports  and  a 
robust  planting  season  for  corn  to  supply  ethanol 
producers  increased  demand  for  fertilizer  shipments  in 
2007. New business acquired in June 2007 contributed to 
more shipments of plastics.  Soda ash volume increased as 
export demand grew in the Gulf area and Mexico. Lower 
production at Canadian locations during the year boosted 
shipments of liquid and dry chemicals from U.S. sources. 
 
Price increases, fuel surcharges, and index-based contract 
escalators drove the increase in revenue and ARC in 2006 
versus 2005. Fewer fertilizer shipments largely drove the 
volume decrease. Wet weather conditions in the Midwest 
led to weak demand during the fall planting season. In addition, softer export markets for potash, a fertilizer 
product,  also  led  to  reduced  volumes.  Business  interruptions  in  the  third  quarter  of  2005,  primarily 
attributable to Hurricane Rita, reduced chemicals shipments leading to favorable volume comparisons in 
2006. 
 
Energy  –  Price  increases  during  2007  improved  both 
revenue  and  ARC  over  2006  levels.  Volume  was  flat, 
however, as severe storms in the first quarter and heavy 
rains in May flooded coal pits in the SPRB, which closed 
several rail lines and reduced volume levels.  Shipments 
from the Colorado and Utah mines were down 1% due to 
lower  mine  production,  predominately  in  the  fourth 
quarter of 2007.   
 
Price increases, fuel surcharges, and index-based contract 
escalators  primarily  drove  the  increases  in  revenue  and 
ARC in 2006 over 2005. Volume increases also contributed 
to revenue growth as coal shipments from the SPRB mines 
improved  8%  during  the  year.  These  increases  in  2006 
partially reflect lower volume levels in 2005, as SPRB Joint Line disruptions, network disruptions resulting 
from  Hurricane  Rita,  and  the  October  Kansas  washouts  hampered  coal  shipments  in  2005.  Conversely, 
shipments from the Colorado and Utah mines declined 6% in 2006 due to mine shutdowns during the first 
quarter of 2006, along with the impact of mining production problems and network maintenance throughout 
the third quarter of 2006.

the  housing  construction  market, 

Industrial Products – Volume declines more than offset 
price  increases,  driving  industrial  products  revenue 
lower in 2007 compared to 2006.  Continued softening 
of 
surplus 
inventories, and general market uncertainty resulted in 
lower  lumber  shipments.  Delays  of  rail  expansion 
projects, customer production problems, unfavorable 
weather, and the ongoing impact of a weak residential 
construction market reduced stone shipments during 
the year. 
 
Price increases and fuel surcharges improved revenue 
and ARC in 2006 over 2005. Volume levels declined due 
to  lower  lumber,  paper,  and  newsprint  shipments, 
which were partially offset by higher steel shipments. 
The softening of the housing construction market, lower production levels, and general market uncertainty 
drove the reduction in lumber shipments. Conversely, strong domestic markets throughout most of the year 
drove the increase in construction-related steel material and pipe, particularly those materials used in oil and 
gas  drilling.  Hurricane  Rita  reduced  shipment  volumes  of  industrial  products  in  2005,  which  favorably 
affected volume comparisons with 2006. 
 
Intermodal  –  Price  increases  improved  intermodal 
revenue  in  2007  compared  to  2006.  Volume  was  flat 
versus  2006  as  increased  domestic  traffic  due to new 
service offerings and increased business under some of 
our older, long-term contracts were offset by a decrease 
of premium shipments. International traffic was flat in 
2007  compared  to  2006  due  to  general  softening  of 
imports from Asia.   
 
Record volume growth, fuel surcharges, price increases, 
and  index-based  contract  escalators  combined  to 
improve revenue in 2006 over 2005, in addition to the 
favorable  impact  from  weaker  intermodal  revenue 
during  2005  due  to  the  January  West  Coast  storm. 
Carloadings grew due to strong imports, primarily from Asia, partially offset by decreased domestic traffic. 
ARC improved due to price increases, fuel surcharges, and contract escalators. 
 
Mexico Business – Each of our commodity groups includes revenue from shipments to and from Mexico. 
Revenue from Mexico business increased 5% to $1.44 billion in 2007 compared to 2006. Price increases and 
more shipments of automotive parts and intermodal containers drove revenue growth in 2007. Volume 
declines in cement, some agricultural products, and newsprint shipments partially offset the increases.  
 
Revenue from Mexico business increased 23% to $1.37 billion in 2006 compared to 2005. Price increases, fuel 
surcharges, and increased shipments of finished vehicles, automotive parts, import beer, dry feed ingredients, 
and intermodal drove revenue growth in 2006. Volume declines in coal, newsprint, and sulfur shipments 
partially offset the increases.

Operating expenses increased $214 million in 2007. 
Higher fuel prices, which rose 9% during the period, 
increased operating expenses by $242 million. Wage, 
benefit and materials inflation and higher depreciation 
expense  also  increased  expenses  during  the  year.  
Productivity 
resource 
utilization, and a lower fuel consumption rate helped 
offset these increases. 
 
Operating expenses increased $911 million in 2006. 
Higher fuel prices, which rose 16% during the period, 
accounted for $393 million of the increase. Our fuel 
surcharge programs helped offset these expenses in the 
form of higher revenue. Wages, benefits, and materials 
and supplies inflation; a larger workforce; volume-related expenses; and higher locomotive and freight car 
maintenance and lease expenses accounted for most of the additional increase in 2006. Settlement of all 
remaining insurance claims related to the January 2005 West Coast storm, an improved fuel consumption 
rate, and improved car cycle times (which reduced freight car rental expense) partially offset the cost increases. 
Additional clean-up and restoration costs for the January 2005 West Coast storm favorably affects comparison 
of 2006 operating expenses with those in 2005. 
 
Salaries, Wages, and Employee Benefits – Operational improvements and lower volume levels led to a 1% 
decline  in  our  workforce,  saving  $79  million  in  2007.  A  smaller  workforce  and  less  need  for  new  train 
personnel reduced training costs during the year, which contributed to the improvement.  General wage and 
benefit inflation mostly offset the reductions, reflecting higher salaries and wages and the impact of higher 
healthcare and other benefit costs.  
 
General wage and benefit inflation increased expenses in 2006, reflecting higher salaries and wages and the 
impact of higher healthcare and other benefit costs. A larger workforce, driven by higher volume levels, and 
stock option expense required by new accounting rules also contributed to higher expenses. Conversely, 
reduced protection costs and operational improvements, boosted by network management initiatives and 
investment in capacity, partially offset these increases. Protection costs represent the differential payment 
when  the  wage  earned  for  active  employment  is  lower  than  an  employee’s  protected  rate  of  pay.  An 
individual’s protected rate is imposed by the STB for employees adversely affected by a merger or is established 
by collective bargaining agreements with our labor unions in certain cases. Additionally, we incurred higher 
labor expenses in 2005 for clean-up and restoration of property damaged by the January West Coast storm.  
 
Fuel and Utilities – Fuel and utilities include locomotive fuel, utilities other than telephone, and gasoline and 
other fuels. Higher diesel fuel prices, which averaged $2.24 per gallon (including taxes and transportation 

27 
 

 

costs) in 2007 compared to $2.06 per gallon in 2006, increased expenses by $242 million. A 2% improvement 
of our fuel consumption rate resulting from the use of newer, more fuel-efficient locomotives and our fuel 
conservation programs reduced fuel expense by $43 million, and a 2% decrease of gross ton miles reduced fuel 
expense by an additional $53 million.  
 
Higher diesel fuel prices, which averaged $2.06 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2006 
compared to $1.77 per gallon in 2005, increased expenses by $393 million during 2006. A 3% increase in gross 
ton-miles resulted in $63 million of additional expenses, which was partially offset by a 2% improvement in 
our fuel consumption rate due to the use of newer, more fuel-efficient locomotives and our fuel conservation 
programs.  As  noted  above  (and  described  in  this  Item  7),  we  offset  a  significant  portion  of  increased 
locomotive fuel expenses through revenue from fuel surcharges. Gasoline, utilities, and propane and other fuel 
expenses increased $20 million in 2006 due to higher prices and increased usage.  
 
Equipment and Other Rents – Equipment and other rents includes primarily rental expense we pay for freight 
cars owned by other railroads or private companies; freight car, intermodal, and locomotive leases; other 
specialty equipment leases; and office and other rentals. Fewer shipments of industrial products, combined 
with improved car-cycle times, which reflect operational improvement and better asset utilization, reduced 
our short-term freight car rental expense by $46 million in 2007 compared to 2006.  Lower lease expenses for 
freight cars, intermodal containers, and fleet vehicles and equipment decreased costs by $20 million in 2007.  
Conversely, higher locomotive lease expense resulted in a $33 million increase in costs during the year. 
 
Lease expense increased in 2006 compared to 2005 as we leased more locomotives and freight cars. Growth in 
automotive and intermodal shipments also increased our short-term freight car rental expense. Improved car-
cycle times driven by network management initiatives partially offset this increase. 
 
Depreciation – The majority of depreciation relates to track structure, including rail, ties, and other track 
material.  A  higher  depreciable  asset  base,  reflecting  higher  capital  spending  in  recent  years,  increased 
depreciation expense in 2007 and 2006.  
 
Materials and Supplies – Materials used to maintain our lines, structures, and equipment are the principal 
components of materials and supplies expense. This expense item also includes small tools, office supplies, 
other materials, and the costs of freight services to ship supplies and materials. Increased use of higher cost 
components  to  repair  and  maintain  our  fleet  of  locomotives  (including  a  growing  number  of  units  not 
covered by warranties) added $32 million to materials and supplies expense during 2007.  Conversely, we used 
fewer parts for freight car repairs due to program maintenance scheduling, which lowered costs by $11 million 
and partially offset the increase for 2007.  
 
We used more repair materials at higher component costs to repair and maintain freight cars and locomotives 
in 2006, including a growing number of units not covered by warranties. In addition, we performed more 
maintenance on locomotives that were maintained internally and not subject to maintenance contracts with 
third-party contractors compared to 2005. 
 
Casualty Costs – Personal injury costs, freight and property damage, insurance, and environmental expense are 
the  primary  components  of  casualty  costs.  Casualty  costs  were  lower  in  2007  compared  to  2006  driven 
primarily by a reduction in personal injury expense.  Actuarial studies completed during 2007 resulted in a 
reduction in personal injury expense of approximately $80 million, which was partially offset by an adverse 
development with respect to one claim.   
 
Costs were flat in 2006 compared to 2005 as lower bad debt expenses, lower freight damage expenses, and 
lower expenses for destruction of foreign or leased equipment all offset increased personal injury costs and 
higher settlement expenses. 
 
Purchased Services and Other Costs – Purchased services and other costs include expenses associated with 
outside contractors, state and local taxes, net costs of operating facilities jointly used with other railroads, 

28 
 

 

transportation  and  lodging  for  train  crew  employees,  trucking  and  contracting  costs  for  intermodal 
containers, leased automobile maintenance expenses, telephone and cellular expense, employee travel expense, 
and computer and other general expenses. Higher consulting fees and higher contract expenses (including 
equipment maintenance) increased costs by $58 million. In addition, crew transportation and lodging costs 
increased $17 million in 2007 due to higher gas prices and rate inflation.  Conversely, lower drayage expense of 
$13 million, settlement of insurance claims in 2007 related to Hurricane Rita, and higher equity income 
partially offset these increases.  In addition, the year-over-year comparison was affected by the settlement of 
insurance claims totaling $23 million in 2006 related to the January 2005 West Coast storm and a $9 million 
gain in 2006 from the sale of two Company-owned airplanes.   
 
Volume-related expenses, including crew transportation and lodging costs, increased in 2006 driven by 3% 
growth in carloads. Higher state and local taxes (primarily sales and use taxes related to higher diesel fuel 
prices) also increased expenses in 2006 compared to 2005. Conversely, lower locomotive contract maintenance 
costs  and  lower  expenses  associated  with  jointly-owned  operating  facilities  reduced  expenses  in  2006 
compared to 2005. Settlement of all remaining insurance claims related to the January 2005 West Coast storm 
and the gain from the sale of two airplanes also reduced expenses in 2006. Finally, clean-up and restoration 
costs related to the January West Coast storm increased expenses in 2005.

Other Income – Lower net gains from non-operating asset sales (primarily real estate) drove the reduction in 
other  income  in  2007.  Recognition  of  rental  income  in  2006  from  the  settlement  of  a  rent  dispute  also 
contributed to the year-over-year decrease in other income.  Cash investment returns increased $21 million 
due to larger cash balances and higher interest rates. 
 
Lower net gains from non-operating asset sales (primarily real estate) and higher expenses due to rising 
interest rates associated with our sale of receivables program resulted in a reduction in other income in 2006, 
which was partially offset by higher rental income for the use of our right-of-way (including 2006 settlements 
of rate disputes from prior years) and cash investment returns due to higher interest rates. 
 
Interest Expense – Higher interest expense in 2007 was driven by an increase in the weighted-average debt 
levels  of  $7.3  billion,  compared  to  $7.1  billion  in  2006.    A  lower effective interest rate of 6.6% in 2007, 
compared to 6.7% in 2006, partially offset the effects of the higher debt level. 
 
Lower interest expense in 2006 was due to a decline in the weighted-average debt level from $7.8 billion in 
2005 to $7.1 billion in 2006.  A higher effective interest rate of 6.7% in 2006, compared to 6.5% in 2005, 
partially offset the effects of the declining debt level.  
 
Income Taxes – Income taxes were $235 million higher in 2007, due primarily to higher pre-tax income and 
the effect of new tax legislation in the State of Illinois that changed how we determine the amount of our 
income subject to Illinois tax.  The Illinois legislation increased our deferred tax expense by $27 million in 
2007.  Our effective tax rates were 38.4% and 36.4% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. 
 
Income tax expense was $509 million higher in 2006 than 2005. Higher pre-tax income resulted in additional 
taxes of $414 million and $118 million of the increase resulted from a reduction of deferred tax expense in 
2005.  Final settlements of pre-1995 tax years and Internal Revenue Service Examination Reports for 1995 

29 
 

 

through 2002, among other things, resulted in the $118 million reduction in 2005. Our effective tax rate was 
36.4% and 28.6% in 2006 and 2005, respectively.   
 
OTHER OPERATING/PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL STATISTICS 
 
We report key Railroad performance measures weekly to the Association of American Railroads (AAR), 
including  carloads,  average  daily  inventory  of  rail  cars  on  our  system,  average  train  speed,  and  average 
terminal dwell time. We provide this data on our website at www.up.com/investors/reports/index.shtml.

Average Train Speed – Average train speed is calculated by dividing train miles by hours operated on our main 
lines between terminals. Ongoing network management initiatives and capacity expansion contributed to 2% 
and 1% improvements of average train speed during 2007 and 2006, respectively.  
 
Average Terminal Dwell Time – Average terminal dwell time is the average time that a rail car spends at our 
terminals. Lower average terminal dwell time is favorable. Average terminal dwell improved 8% and 5% in 
2007 and 2006, respectively, as a result of ongoing management initiatives and directed efforts to more timely 
deliver rail cars to our interchange partners and customers.  Average terminal dwell time was also impacted by 
1% lower volume levels in 2007 and a 3% increase in volume levels during 2006. 
 
Gross and Revenue Ton-Miles – Gross ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded or empty 
freight cars by the number of miles hauled. Revenue ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of 
freight by the number of tariff miles. Revenue ton-miles declined 1% in relation to the 1% reduction in 
carloadings in 2007 compared to 2006. Gross ton-miles decreased 2% in 2007 driven by a mix shift in freight 
shipments. In 2006, gross and revenue-ton miles grew 3% in relation to the 3% increase in carloadings as 
volume was balanced between the higher and lower density commodities. 
 
Operating  Ratio  –  Operating  ratio  is  defined  as  our  operating  expenses  as  a  percentage  of  revenue.  Our 
operating ratio improved 2.2 points to 79.3% in 2007 as a result of yield increases, network management 
initiatives, and improved productivity. In 2006, our operating ratio improved 5.3 points to 81.5% as a result of 
solid demand, yield increases, and improved operational efficiency. 
 
Average Full-Time-Equivalent Employees – Lower employee levels in 2007 versus 2006 resulted from fewer train 
and engine personnel due to improved network productivity and 1% lower volume levels, partially offset by 
more employees maintaining our larger locomotive fleet. The larger full-time-equivalent number in 2006, 
included more people to maintain our larger locomotive and freight car fleet, more employees needed for 
increased track repair and maintenance programs, more operations management personnel (including an 
expanded management training program), and more train and engine personnel to meet demand levels.

Customer Satisfaction Index – The customer satisfaction survey asks customers to rate how satisfied they are 
with our performance over the last 12 months on a variety of attributes.  A higher score indicates higher 
customer  satisfaction.  The  improvement  in  survey  results  in  2007  and  2006  generally  reflects  customer 
recognition of our improving service.

ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K. 
We believe this measure is important in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the Corporation’s long-
term  capital  investments,  and  we  currently  use  ROIC  as  a  performance  criteria  in  determining  certain 
elements of equity compensation for our executives. ROIC should be considered in addition to, rather than as 
a substitute for, other information provided in accordance with GAAP. A comparable GAAP measure is 
Return on Average Common Shareholders’ Equity. The tables above provide a reconciliation from return on 
average common shareholders’ equity to ROIC.

Adjusted debt to capital is a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC 
Regulation S-K. We believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the total 
amount of leverage in our capital structure, including off-balance sheet lease obligations, which we generally 
incur in connection with financing the acquisition of locomotives and freight cars and certain facilities. We 
monitor the ratio of adjusted debt to capital as we manage our capital structure to balance cost-effective and 
efficient access to the capital markets with the Corporation’s overall cost of capital. Adjusted debt to capital 
should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, debt to capital. The tables above provide a 
reconciliation from debt to capital to adjusted debt to capital. Our December 31, 2007, debt to capital ratios 
increased  as  a  result  of  a  $902  million  increase  in  debt  from  December  31,  2006,  and  purchases  of  our 
common stock under our share repurchase program, partially offset by an increase in retained earnings due to 
higher earnings in 2007. 
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
As of December 31, 2007, our principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents, the sale of certain 
receivables, an uncommitted line of credit, and our revolving credit facility, as well as the availability of 
commercial  paper  and  other  sources  of  financing  through  the  capital  markets.  We  had  $1.9  billion  of 
committed credit available under our credit facility, with no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2007. 
We did not make any short-term borrowings under this facility during the year. We also had a $75 million 
uncommitted line of credit available, which was not used during the year.  The value of the outstanding 
undivided interest held by investors under the sale of receivables program was $600 million as of December 
31, 2007.  The sale of receivables program is subject to certain requirements, including maintenance of an 
investment grade bond rating. If our bond rating were to deteriorate, it could have an adverse impact on our 
liquidity. Access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financings is dependent on market 
conditions. Deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors 
could negatively impact our ability to utilize commercial paper as a source of liquidity. Liquidity through the 
capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability.  
 
At December 31, 2007, and December 31, 2006, we had working capital deficits of approximately $0.4 billion 
and $1.1 billion, respectively. A working capital deficit is common in our industry and does not indicate a lack 
of liquidity. We maintain adequate resources to meet our daily cash requirements, and we have sufficient 
financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities.

Cash Provided by Operating Activities – We generated higher income in 2007, which was the primary driver of 
the increase of cash provided by operating activities. Pension contributions in 2006 totaling $150 million also 
contributed to the year-over-year increase. These increases were partially offset by cash payments representing 
prior period wage increases in accordance with recent union contract ratifications and higher income tax 
payments.   
 
Higher income in 2006 generated the increased cash provided by operating activities, which was partially offset 
by higher income tax payments, $150 million in voluntary pension contributions, higher material and supply 
inventories, and higher management incentive payments.  
 
Cash Used in Investing Activities – Higher capital investments and work in process balances drove the increase 
in cash used in investing in 2007.  The third quarter of 2006 included insurance settlement proceeds for 
property damages resulting from the 2005 West Coast storm.   
 
An insurance settlement for the January 2005 West Coast storm and lower balances for work in process 
decreased the amount of cash used in investing activities in 2006. Higher capital investments and lower 
proceeds from asset sales partially offset this decrease.  
 
Cash Used in Financing Activities – The increase in cash used in financing activities resulted primarily from the 
use of $1.4 billion to repurchase common shares, payment of higher dividends, and lower net proceeds from 
equity compensation plans ($71 million in 2007 compared to $160 million in 2006).  These increases were 
mostly offset by debt issuances of $1.6 billion in 2007 compared to no issuances in 2006.  The increase in cash 
used in financing activities in 2006 resulted primarily from lower net proceeds from equity compensation 
plans ($160 million in 2006 compared to $262 million in 2005).

In 2008, we expect our total capital investments to be approximately $3.1 billion (which may be revised if 
revenue, tax, or business conditions require changing, or new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate 
sufficient returns on, these investments). Major investment categories include $1.6 billion to maintain and 
improve track infrastructure; $840 million to increase network and terminal capacity; $490 million to upgrade 
our locomotive and freight car fleet, including the acquisition of 175 high-horsepower locomotives and new 
covered hoppers; and $170 million primarily to upgrade information technology systems, including the testing 
of positive train control, and other capital projects. We expect to fund our 2008 cash capital investments 

33 
 

 

through cash generated from operations, the sale or lease of various operating and non-operating properties, 
debt issuances, and cash on hand at December 31, 2007. Our annual capital plan is a critical component of our 
long-term strategic plan, which we designed to enhance the long-term value of the Corporation for our 
shareholders by providing sufficient resources to (i) maintain and improve our existing track infrastructure to 
provide safe and fluid operations, (ii) increase network efficiency by adding or improving facilities and track, 
and (iii) make investments that meet customer demand and take advantage of opportunities for long-term 
growth. 
 
For each of the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 5.1, 
4.4, and 2.9, respectively. The increases in 2007 and 2006 were driven by higher net income. The ratio of 
earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis. Earnings represent income from continuing 
operations,  less  equity  earnings  net  of  distributions,  plus  fixed  charges  and  income  taxes.  Fixed  charges 
represent interest charges, amortization of debt discount, and the estimated amount representing the interest 
portion of rental charges. See Exhibit 12 for the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges.  
 
Financing Activities 
 
Credit Facilities – On December 31, 2007, $1.9 billion of credit was available under our revolving credit 
facility (the facility), which we entered into on April 20, 2007. The facility is designated for general corporate 
purposes and supports the issuance of commercial paper. We did not draw on the facility during 2007. 
Commitment  fees  and  interest  rates  payable  under  the  facility  are  similar  to  fees  and  rates  available  to 
comparably rated, investment-grade borrowers. The facility allows for borrowings at floating rates based on 
London Interbank Offered Rates, plus a spread, depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings. The 
facility requires the maintenance of a debt to net worth coverage ratio. At December 31, 2007, we were in 
compliance with this covenant. The facility does not include any other financial restrictions, credit rating 
triggers (other than rating-dependent pricing), or any other provision that could require us to post collateral. 
The facility, which expires in April 2012, replaced two $1 billion, 5-year facilities with terms ending in March 
2009  and  March  2010.  The  facility  includes  terms  that  are comparable with those of the prior facilities, 
although the minimum net worth requirement of $7.5 billion in prior facilities was removed, and the facility 
includes a change-of-control provision. 
 
In addition to our revolving credit facility, a $75 million uncommitted line of credit was available. The line of 
credit expires in April 2008, and was not used in 2007. We must have equivalent credit available under our 
five-year facility to draw on this $75 million line.  
 
At December 31, 2007, we reclassified as long-term debt approximately $550 million of debt due within one 
year that we intend to refinance. This reclassification reflected our ability and intent to refinance any short-
term borrowings and certain current maturities of long-term debt on a long-term basis. At December 31, 
2006, we did not reclassify any short-term debt as long-term debt as we did not intend to refinance at that 
time. 
 
Dividends  –  On  November  15,  2007,  we  increased  the  quarterly  dividend  to  $0.44  per  share,  payable 
beginning on January 2, 2008, to shareholders of record on November 29, 2007. We expect to fund the 
increase  in  the  quarterly  dividend  through  cash  generated  from  operations,  the  sale  or  lease  of  various 
operating and non-operating properties, and cash on hand at December 31, 2007.  
 
Dividend Restrictions – Our revolving credit facility includes a debt-to-net worth covenant that, under certain 
circumstances, restricts the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders. The amount of retained earnings 
available for dividends was $11.5 billion and $7.8 billion at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, 
respectively. This facility replaced two credit facilities that had minimum net worth covenants that were more 
restrictive with respect to the amount of retained earnings available for dividends at December 31, 2006.   
 
Share Repurchase Program – On January 30, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 
20 million shares of Union Pacific Corporation common stock through the end of 2009. Management’s 

34 
 

 

assessments of market conditions and other pertinent facts guide the timing and volume of all repurchases. 
We expect to fund our common stock repurchases through cash generated from operations, the sale or lease of 
various operating and non-operating properties, debt issuances, and cash on hand at December 31, 2007. 
 
During 2007, we repurchased approximately 13 million shares under this program at an aggregate purchase 
price of approximately $1.5 billion. These shares were recorded in treasury stock at cost, which includes any 
applicable commissions and fees. 
 
Shelf Registration Statement and Significant New Borrowings – Our Board of Directors authorized the 
issuance of up to $3 billion of debt securities pursuant to a new shelf registration statement, which became 
effective on March 6, 2007, replacing the $500 million of authority remaining under our shelf registration filed 
in December 2003. Under the current shelf registration, we may issue, from time to time, any combination of 
debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or 
more offerings.  
 
We have issued the following unsecured, fixed-rate debt securities under our current shelf registration:

$750 million of 5.70% Notes due August 15, 2018 

 
The  net  proceeds  from  these  offerings  are  for  general  corporate  purposes,  including  the  repurchase  of 
common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. These debt securities include change-of-control 
provisions. We have no immediate plans to issue equity securities; however, we will continue to explore 
opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under our shelf 
registration, and, therefore, we may issue additional debt securities at any time. 
 
Operating Lease Activities  
 
During  2007,  the  Railroad,  as  lessee,  entered  into  long-term  operating  lease  arrangements  covering  259 
locomotives and 150 rail cars, with a total equipment cost of approximately $538 million. In total, these new 
lease arrangements will provide for minimum rental payments of approximately $831 million, with a present 
value of approximately $434 million. 
 
The lessors financed the purchase of the locomotives and freight cars, in part, by issuing equipment notes that 
are non-recourse to the Railroad and are secured by assignments of the underlying leases and security interests 
in the equipment. The Corporation and the Railroad do not guaranty payment of the equipment notes. The 
Railroad’s obligations to make operating lease payments under the leases are recourse obligations and are not 
recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. 
 
The Railroad has certain renewal and purchase options with respect to the locomotives and freight cars. If the 
Railroad does not exercise these options, the equipment will be returned to the lessors at the end of the lease 
term.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 
As described in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and as referenced in the tables below, we 
have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition. However, 
based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and 
commercial  commitments,  including  material  sources  of  off-balance  sheet  and  structured  finance 
arrangements, there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event, or uncertainty that is reasonably likely 
to  occur  that  would  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  consolidated  results  of  operations,  financial 
condition, or liquidity. In addition, our commercial obligations, financings, and commitments are customary 
transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations, particularly within the transportation 
industry. 
 
The following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2007:

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
Sale of Receivables – The Railroad transfers most of its accounts receivable to Union Pacific Receivables, Inc. 
(UPRI), a bankruptcy-remote subsidiary, as part of a sale of receivables facility. UPRI sells, without recourse 
on a 364-day revolving basis, an undivided interest in such accounts receivable to investors. The total capacity 
to sell undivided interests to investors under the facility was $600 million at both December 31, 2007 and 
2006. The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the facility was $600 million at 
both December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by 
investors is not included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The value of the undivided interest held by 
investors  was  supported  by  $1,071  million  and  $1,158  million  of  accounts  receivable  held  by  UPRI  at 
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the value of the interest retained 
by  UPRI  was  $471  million  and  $558  million, respectively. This retained interest is included in accounts 
receivable in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The interest sold to investors is sold at carrying value, 
which approximates fair value, and there is no gain or loss recognized from the transaction.  
 
The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors could fluctuate based upon the availability of 
eligible receivables and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks, including default and 
dilution. If default or dilution percentages were to increase one percentage point, the amount of eligible 
receivables would decrease by $6 million. Should our credit rating fall below investment grade, the value of the 
outstanding undivided interest held by investors would be reduced, and, in certain cases, the investors would 
have the right to discontinue the facility.  
 
The Railroad services the sold receivables; however, the Railroad does not recognize any servicing asset or 
liability  as  the  servicing  fees  adequately  compensate  us  for  these  responsibilities.  The  Railroad  collected 
approximately  $16.1  billion  and  $15.5  billion  during  the  years  ended  December  31,  2007  and  2006, 
respectively. UPRI used certain of these proceeds to purchase new receivables under the facility.  
 
The costs of the sale of receivables program are included in other income and were $35 million, $33 million, 
and $23 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The costs include interest, program fees paid to banks, 
commercial paper issuing costs, and fees for unused commitment availability.  
 
The investors have no recourse to the Railroad’s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity 
claims. Creditors of the Railroad do not have recourse to the assets of UPRI. In August 2007, the sale of 
receivables program was renewed for an additional 364-day period without any significant changes in terms.  
 
Guarantees – At December 31, 2007, we were contingently liable for $465 million in guarantees. We have 
recorded a liability of $5 million and $6 million for the fair value of these obligations as of December 31, 2007 
and 2006, respectively. We entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business, and they 
include guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building, equipment financings, and affiliated 
operations. The final guarantee expires in 2022. We are not aware of any existing event of default that would 
require us to satisfy these guarantees. We do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse 
effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.  
 
OTHER MATTERS 
 
Inflation – The cumulative effect of long periods of inflation significantly increases asset replacement costs for 
capital-intensive companies. As a result, assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels, 
depreciation charges (on an inflation-adjusted basis) would be substantially greater than historically reported 
amounts.  
 
Derivative Financial Instruments – We may use derivative financial instruments in limited instances for other 
than trading purposes to assist in managing our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and fuel 
prices. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use derivative financial instruments 
for speculative purposes. Derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a 

37 
 

 

specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception 
and throughout the hedged period. We formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging 
instruments  and  hedged  items  at  inception,  as  well  as  our  risk-management  objectives,  strategies  for 
undertaking the various hedge transactions, and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Changes in the fair 
market value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are charged to 
earnings.  We  may  use  swaps,  collars,  futures,  and/or  forward  contracts  to  mitigate  the  risk  of  adverse 
movements in interest rates and fuel prices; however, the use of these derivative financial instruments may 
limit future benefits from favorable price movements. 
 
Market and Credit Risk – We address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting 
instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item. We manage credit 
risk related to derivative financial instruments, which is minimal, by requiring high credit standards for 
counterparties and periodic settlements. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we were not required to provide 
collateral, nor had we received collateral, relating to our hedging activities. 
 
Determination of Fair Value – We determine the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions 
based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or the present value of expected future cash 
flows. 
 
Sensitivity Analyses – The sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical 
changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition. These hypothetical 
changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results.  
 
At December 31, 2007, we had variable-rate debt representing approximately 3% of our total debt. If variable 
interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2008 than our December 31, 2007 variable rate, which 
was approximately 7%, our interest expense would increase by approximately $3 million. This amount was 
determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balances of our variable-rate 
debt at December 31, 2007.  
 
Market risk for fixed-rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 
one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2007, and amounts to an increase of 
approximately $524 million to the fair value of our debt at December 31, 2007. We estimated the fair values of 
our fixed-rate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and 
current borrowing rates.  
 
Interest  Rate  Fair  Value  Hedges  –  We  manage  our  overall  exposure  to  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  by 
adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given 
period. We generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts 
of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings. We employ derivatives, primarily swaps, as 
one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix. In addition, we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs 
and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding 
callable fixed-rate debt securities.  
 
Swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the 
debt’s fair value attributable to the changes in interest rates. We account for swaps as fair value hedges using 
the  short-cut  method  pursuant  to  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB)  Statement  No.  133, 
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities; therefore, we do not record any ineffectiveness 
within our Consolidated Financial Statements.  
 
Interest Rate Cash Flow Hedges – We report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated 
other comprehensive loss until the hedged item affects earnings. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had  
reductions of $4 million and $5 million, respectively, recorded as an accumulated other comprehensive loss 
that is being amortized on a straight-line basis through September 30, 2014. As of December 31, 2007 and 
2006, we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding. 

38 
 

 

 
Fuel Swaps – Two fuel basis swaps cover a total of 151 million gallons of diesel fuel for the period August 2006 
through July 2008. These commodity basis swaps require us to make payments to, or receive payments from, 
the counterparty based on the difference between certain price indices. Changes in the fair value of these swaps 
are reflected in fuel expense. We reported a derivative asset of approximately $1 million and $2 million at 
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which represents the fair value of the swaps. The swaps increased 
fuel expense for 2007 by $1 million and reduced fuel expense for 2006 by $3 million. The recognition of the 
swaps in fuel expense included monthly net settlements with the counterparty and the change in fair value. 
 
Accounting  Pronouncements  –  In  September  2006,  the  FASB  issued  Statement  No.  157,  Fair  Value 
Measurements (FAS 157). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in 
accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and  expands  disclosures  about  fair  value 
measurements. This statement does not require any new fair value measurements; rather, it applies under 
other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements.  The provisions of FAS 157 
are effective for us beginning in 2008.  We expect this new standard will result in increased disclosures but will 
not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.  
 
In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial 
Liabilities (FAS 159). The fair value option established by FAS 159 permits, but does not require, all entities to 
choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates. An entity would report unrealized 
gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent 
reporting date. FAS 159 is effective for us beginning in 2008. We do not currently intend to elect the fair value 
option for any eligible items and do not expect this standard to have a significant impact on our financial 
position or results of operations.  
 
In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations (FAS 141R). 
FAS 141R will change the accounting for business combinations. Under FAS 141R, an acquiring entity will be 
required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair 
value with limited exceptions. FAS 141R will also change the accounting treatment and disclosures with 
respect to certain specific items in a business combination. FAS 141R applies to us prospectively for business 
combinations occurring on or after January 1, 2009. Accordingly, any business combinations we engage in will 
be recorded and disclosed following existing GAAP until January 1, 2009. We expect FAS 141R will have an 
impact on accounting for business combinations, but the effect will be dependent upon any potential future 
acquisitions.  
 
In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial 
Statements – An Amendment of ARB No. 51 (FAS 160). FAS 160 establishes new accounting and reporting 
standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. FAS 160 is 
effective for us beginning in 2009. We are still assessing the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of FAS 
160 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  
 
In December 2007, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 
07-1,  Collaborative  Arrangements  (EITF  07-1),  which  defines  collaborative  arrangements  and  establishes 
reporting and disclosure requirements for transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement.  
The requirements of this EITF will be applied to collaborative arrangements in existence on or after January 1, 
2009. We are still assessing the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of EITF 07-1 on our consolidated 
financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
Asserted and Unasserted Claims – Various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our 
subsidiaries. We cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated 
results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity; however, to the extent possible, where asserted and 
unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated, we have 
recorded a liability. We do not expect that any known lawsuits, claims, environmental costs, commitments, 
contingent  liabilities,  or  guarantees  will  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  consolidated  results  of 

39 
 

 

operations, financial condition, or liquidity after taking into account liabilities previously recorded for these 
matters. 
 
Indemnities – Our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements, including certain tax 
indemnifications, can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount, depending on the nature 
of the transactions and the agreements. Due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will 
be resolved, we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any 
adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements. We do not have 
any  reason  to  believe  that  we  will  be  required  to  make  any  material  payments  under  these  indemnity 
provisions. 
 
Climate Change – Although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial 
performance in the future (see Risk Factors under Item 1A), we are currently unable to predict the manner or 
severity of such impact. However, we continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of 
our operations on the environment, including investments in new technologies, using training programs to 
reduce fuel consumption, and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency. 
 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of 
these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenue, 
expenses,  assets,  and  liabilities.  We  base  our  estimates  on  historical  experience  and  on  various  other 
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for 
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other 
sources. The following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described 
in note 1 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8. These critical accounting policies affect 
significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates. If these estimates differ 
significantly from actual results, the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements may be material.  
 
Asbestos – We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other 
parties  allege  exposure  to  asbestos.  During  2004,  we  engaged  a  third  party  with  extensive  experience  in 
estimating resolution costs for asbestos-related claims to assist us in assessing our potential liability. During 
2007, we updated our potential liability to include actual claim experience since 2004. As a result of this 
reassessment, we decreased our liability by $20 million in 2007 for both asserted and unasserted asbestos-
related claims through 2034. This liability excludes future defense and processing costs. The liability for 
resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions:  
 
(cid:127)  The number of future claims received would be consistent with historical averages.  
 
(cid:127)  The number of claims filed against us will decline each year.  
 
(cid:127)  The average settlement values for asserted and unasserted claims will be equivalent to historical averages.  
 
(cid:127)  The percentage of claims dismissed in the future will be equivalent to historical averages.

Approximately 13% of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 87% related to 
unasserted claims. These claims are expected to be paid out over the next 27 years. In conjunction with the 
liability update performed in 2007, we also reassessed estimated insurance recoveries. We have recognized an 
asset for estimated insurance recoveries at December 31, 2007 and 2006. We will continue to review actual 
experience and adjust our estimate as warranted.

We believe that our estimates of liability for asbestos-related claims and insurance recoveries are reasonable 
and probable. The amounts recorded for asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries were 
based on currently known facts. However, future events, such as the number of new claims to be filed each 
year,  average  settlement  costs,  and  insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance 
recoveries  to  be  higher  or  lower  than  the  projected  amounts.  Estimates  also  may  vary  in  the  future  if: 
strategies, activities, and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change; federal and state laws governing 
asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimants; and there are 
material changes with respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants.  
 
Environmental – We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. We identified 
339 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for 
violations of environmental requirements. This includes 41 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the 
U.S.  government,  22  of  which  are  currently  on  the  Superfund  National  Priorities  List.  Certain  federal 
legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites; consequently, our ultimate 
environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties, in addition to costs relating to 
our own activities at each site. Our environmental liability activity was as follows:

When we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned, leased, or otherwise used in our 
business, we and our consultants perform environmental assessments on the property. We expense the cost of 
the assessments as incurred. We accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and we can 
reasonably estimate such costs. We do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the 
anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable.  
 
The liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites, as well as ongoing monitoring costs, 
but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties. Cost estimates are based on information available 
for each site, financial viability of other potentially responsible parties, and existing technology, laws, and 
regulations.  The  ultimate  liability  for  remediation  is  difficult  to  determine  because  of  the  number  of 
potentially responsible parties, site-specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible 
parties, the degree of contamination by various wastes, the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to 
many of the sites, and the speculative nature of remediation costs. Estimates of liability may vary over time 
due to changes in federal, state, and local laws governing environmental remediation. Current obligations are 
not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or 
liquidity.  
 
Personal Injury – The cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to 
expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year. We use third-party 
actuaries  to  assist  us  in  measuring  the  expense  and  liability,  including  unasserted  claims.  The  Federal 
Employers’ Liability Act (FELA) governs compensation for work-related accidents. Under FELA, damages are 
assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out-of-court settlements. We offer a comprehensive 
variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work.  
 
Our personal injury liability is discounted to present value using applicable U.S. Treasury rates. Approximately 
89% of the recorded liability related to asserted claims, and approximately 11% related to unasserted claims. 
Estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation. Our personal injury liability activity was as

Depreciation  –  The  railroad  industry  is  capital  intensive.  Properties  are  carried  at  cost.  Provisions  for 
depreciation  are  computed  principally  on  the  straight-line  method  based  on  estimated  service  lives  of 
depreciable property. The lives are calculated using a separate composite annual percentage rate for each 
depreciable property group, based on the results of internal depreciation studies. We are required to submit a 
report on depreciation studies and proposed depreciation rates to the STB for review and approval every three 
years for equipment property and every six years for road property. The cost (net of salvage) of depreciable 
railroad  property  retired  or  replaced  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  is  charged  to  accumulated 
depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized. A gain or loss is recognized in other income for all other 
property  upon  disposition  because  the  gain  or  loss  is  not  part  of  rail  operations.  The  cost  of  internally 
developed software is capitalized and amortized based on estimated service lives of the software.  
 
Significant capital spending in recent years increased the total value of our depreciable assets. Cash capital 
spending totaled $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2007, 
depreciation expense was $1.3 billion. We use various methods to estimate useful lives for each group of 
depreciable property. Due to the capital intensive nature of the business and the large base of depreciable 
assets, variances to those estimates could have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. If 
the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year, annual depreciation expense 
would decrease by approximately $47 million. If the estimated useful lives of all assets to be depreciated were 
decreased by one year, annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately $50 million.  
 
Income Taxes – As required under FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, we account for 
income  taxes  by  recording  taxes  payable  or  refundable  for  the  current  year  and  deferred  tax  assets  and 
liabilities  for  the  expected  future  tax  consequences  of  events  that  have  been  recognized  in  our  financial 
statements or tax returns. These expected future consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as 
currently enacted; the effects of future changes in tax law are not anticipated. Future tax law changes, such as a 
change  in  the  corporate  tax  rate,  could  have  a  material  impact  on  our  financial  condition  or  results  of 
operations. For example, a 1% increase in the federal income tax rate would increase our deferred tax liability 
by approximately $250 million. 
 
When appropriate, we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that 
may not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate, we consider whether it is 
more  likely  than  not  that  all  or  some  portion  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  will  not  be  realized,  based  on 
management’s judgments regarding the best available evidence about future events.  Based on that analysis, 
there was no valuation allowance at December 31, 2007 or 2006. 
 
When we have claimed tax benefits that may be challenged by a tax authority, these uncertain tax benefits are 
accounted for under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation 
of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). We adopted FIN 48 beginning January 1, 2007. Prior to 2007, income tax 
contingencies were accounted for under FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies.   
 
Under FIN 48, we recognize tax benefits only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained 
upon examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that 
is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement. A liability for “unrecognized tax benefits” is 
recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement 

43 
 

 

standards. For additional information on the adoption of FIN 48, see note 4 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.   
 
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits – We use third-party actuaries to assist us in properly measuring 
the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and defined contribution medical and life 
insurance benefits (OPEB) to eligible employees. In order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and 
expenses we must make several assumptions. The critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations 
and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets. For OPEB, the critical 
assumptions are the discount rate and healthcare cost trend rate.  
 
We evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually, and selected assumptions are based on the following 
factors:  
 
(cid:127)  Discount  rate  is  based  on  a  hypothetical  portfolio  of  high  quality  corporate  bonds  (rated  AA  by  a 
recognized rating agency) for which the timing and amount of cash flows matches our plan’s expected 
benefit payments.  

 
(cid:127) 

Expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return, taking into 
consideration current and expected market conditions.  

 
(cid:127)  Healthcare cost trend rate is based on our historical rates of inflation and expected market conditions.  
 
The following tables present the key assumptions used to measure pension and OPEB expense for 2007 and 
the estimated impact on 2007 pension and OPEB expense relative to a change in those assumptions:

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

Union Pacific Corporation, its Directors, and Shareholders:  
 
We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of  financial  position  of  Union  Pacific 
Corporation and Subsidiary Companies (the Corporation) as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related 
consolidated statements of income, changes in common shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the 
three years in the period ended December 31, 2007. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule 
listed in the Table of Contents at Part IV, Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedule 
are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. 
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance  about  whether  the  financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement.  An  audit  includes 
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An 
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as 
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable 
basis for our opinion. 
 
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of Union Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the 
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 
2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in 
our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial 
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. 
 
As discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2006 the Corporation adopted Statement of 
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  158,  Employers’  Accounting  for  Defined  Benefit  Pension  and  Other 
Postretirement Plans. 
 
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States), the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on 
the criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 15, 2008 expressed an unqualified 
opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.

Principles of Consolidation – The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Union Pacific 
Corporation  and  all  of  its  subsidiaries.  Investments  in  affiliated  companies  (20%  to  50%  owned)  are 
accounted  for  using  the  equity  method  of  accounting.  All  significant  intercompany  transactions  are 
eliminated. The Corporation evaluates its less than majority-owned investments for consolidation pursuant to 
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46 (Revised 2003), Consolidation of Variable 
Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (FIN 46(R)). We currently have no 
less than majority-owned investments that require consolidation under FIN 46(R).  
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents – Cash equivalents consist of investments with original maturities of three months 
or less.  
 
Materials and Supplies – Materials and supplies are carried at the lower of average cost or market.  
 
Property  and  Depreciation  –  Properties  are  carried  at  cost.  Provisions  for  depreciation  are  computed 
principally on the straight-line method based on estimated service lives of depreciable property. The cost (net 
of salvage) of depreciable rail property retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to 
accumulated depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized. A gain or loss is recognized in other income for 
all  other  property  upon  disposition  because  the  gain  or  loss  is  not  part  of  rail  operations.  The  cost  of 
purchased and internally developed software is capitalized and amortized based on estimated service lives of 
the software. 
 
Impairment  of  Long-lived  Assets  –  We  review  long-lived  assets,  including  identifiable  intangibles,  for 
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be 
recoverable. If impairment indicators are present and the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less 
than the carrying value of the long-lived assets, the carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value as 
measured by the discounted cash flows.  
 
Revenue Recognition – We recognize commodity revenue on a percentage-of-completion basis as freight 
moves from origin to destination. The allocation of revenue between reporting periods is based on the relative 
transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred. Other revenue is recognized as 
service is performed or contractual obligations are met. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for 
shipping a specified cumulative volume or shipping to/from specific locations, are recorded as a reduction to 
operating revenue based on actual or projected future customer shipments.  
 
Translation of Foreign Currency – Our portion of the assets and liabilities related to foreign investments are 
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are 
translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Unrealized adjustments are reflected 
within common shareholders’ equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.  
 
Financial Instruments – The carrying value of our non-derivative financial instruments approximates fair 
value. The fair value of financial instruments is generally determined by reference to market values as quoted 
by recognized dealers or developed based upon the present value of expected future cash flows.  
 
We periodically use derivative financial instruments, for other than trading purposes, to manage risk related to 
changes in fuel prices and interest rates.  

52 
 

 

 
Stock-Based Compensation – We have several stock-based compensation plans under which employees and 
non-employee directors receive stock options, nonvested retention shares, and nonvested stock units. We refer 
to the nonvested shares and stock units collectively as “retention awards”. We issue treasury shares to cover 
option exercises and stock unit vestings, while new shares are issued when retention shares vest. 
 
We adopted FASB Statement No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment (FAS 123(R)), on January 1, 2006. FAS 123(R) 
requires us to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees 
and directors, including stock options. Compensation expense is based on the calculated fair value of the 
awards as measured at the grant date and is expensed ratably over the service period of the awards (generally 
the vesting period). The fair value of retention awards is the closing stock price on the date of grant, while the 
fair value of stock options is determined by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We elected to use 
the modified prospective transition method as permitted by FAS 123(R) and did not restate financial results 
for prior periods. We did not make an adjustment for the cumulative effect of estimated forfeitures, as the 
impact was not material.  
 
As a result of the adoption of FAS 123(R), we recognized expense for stock options in 2007 and 2006, in 
addition  to  retention  awards,  which  were  expensed  prior  to  2006.  Information  regarding  stock-based 
compensation appears in the table below:

Prior to the adoption of FAS 123(R), we applied the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting 
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. No 
stock-based employee compensation expense related to stock option grants was reflected in net income, as all 
options granted under those plans had a grant price equal to the market value of our common stock on the 
date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense related to retention shares, stock units, and other incentive 
plans was reflected in net income.

The following table details the effect on net income and earnings per share had compensation expense for all

[a]     Stock options for executives granted in 2003 and 2002 included a reload feature. This reload feature allowed executives to exercise their 
options using shares of Union Pacific Corporation common stock that they already owned and obtain a new grant of options in the 
amount of the shares used for exercise plus any shares withheld for tax purposes. The reload feature of these option grants could only be 
exercised if the price of our common stock increased at least 20% from the price at the time of the reload grant. During the year ended 
December 31, 2005, reload option grants represented $19 million of the pro forma expense noted above. There were no reload option 
grants during 2007 and 2006 as stock options exercised after January 1, 2006 are not eligible for the reload feature. 

 
Earnings Per Share – Basic earnings per share are calculated on the weighted-average number of common 
shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share include shares issuable upon exercise of 
outstanding  stock  options  and  stock-based  awards  where  the  conversion  of  such  instruments  would  be 
dilutive.  
 
Use of Estimates – Our Consolidated Financial Statements include estimates and assumptions regarding 
certain assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and the disclosure of certain contingent assets and liabilities. 
Actual future results may differ from such estimates.  
 
Income Taxes – As required under FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, we account for 
income  taxes  by  recording  taxes  payable  or  refundable  for  the  current  year  and  deferred  tax  assets  and 
liabilities  for  the  expected  future  tax  consequences  of  events  that  have  been  recognized  in  our  financial 
statements or tax returns. These expected future tax consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law 
as currently enacted; the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated. Future tax law changes, such 
as a change in the corporate tax rate, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of 
operations. 
 
When appropriate, we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that 
may not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate, we consider whether it is 
more  likely  than  not  that  all  or  some  portion  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  will  not  be  realized,  based  on 
management’s judgments regarding the best available evidence about future events.   
 
When we have claimed tax benefits that may be challenged by a tax authority, these uncertain tax positions are 
accounted for under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation 
of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). We adopted FIN 48 beginning January 1, 2007. Prior to 2007, income tax 
contingencies were accounted for under FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies.   
 
Under FIN 48, we recognize tax benefits only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained 
upon examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that 
is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement. A liability for “unrecognized tax benefits” is 

54 
 

 

recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement 
criteria. For additional information on the adoption of FIN 48, see note 4 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.   
 
Pension  and  Postretirement  Benefits  –  We  incur  certain  employment-related  expenses  associated  with 
pensions and postretirement health benefits. In order to measure the expense associated with these benefits, 
we must make various assumptions including discount rates used to value certain liabilities, expected return 
on plan assets used to fund these expenses, salary increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality 
rates, and expected future healthcare costs. The assumptions used by us are based on our historical experience 
as well as current facts and circumstances. We use third-party actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the 
expense and liability associated with these benefits.  
 
Personal Injury – The cost of injuries to employees and others on our property is charged to expense based on 
estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year. We use third-party actuaries to assist us in 
properly measuring the expense and liability. Our personal injury liability is discounted to present value using 
applicable U.S. Treasury rates. Legal fees and incidental costs are expensed as incurred.  
 
Environmental – When environmental issues have been identified with respect to property currently or 
formerly owned, leased, or otherwise used in the conduct of our business, we and our consultants perform 
environmental assessments on such property. We expense the cost of the assessments as incurred. We accrue 
the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated. We do 
not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or 
readily determinable. Legal fees and incidental costs are expensed as incurred.  
 
Asbestos – We estimate a liability for asserted and unasserted asbestos-related claims based on an assessment 
of the number and value of those claims. We use an external consulting firm to assist us in properly measuring 
the expense and liability. Our liability for asbestos-related claims is not discounted to present value due to the 
uncertainty  surrounding  the  timing  of  future  payments.  Legal  fees  and  incidental  costs  are  expensed  as 
incurred.  
 
2.  Operations and Segmentation 
 
We are a Class I railroad that operates in the United States. We have 32,205 route miles, linking Pacific Coast 
and Gulf Coast ports with the Midwest and eastern United States gateways and providing several corridors to 
key Mexican gateways. We serve the western two-thirds of the country and maintain coordinated schedules 
with other rail carriers for the handling of freight to and from the Atlantic Coast, the Pacific Coast, the 
Southeast, the Southwest, Canada, and Mexico. Export and import traffic is moved through Gulf Coast and 
Pacific Coast ports and across the Mexican and Canadian borders.  
 

55 
 

 

The Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one reportable operating segment. Although 
revenue is analyzed by commodity group, we analyze the net financial results of the Railroad as one segment 
due to the integrated nature of our rail network. The following table provides revenue by commodity group:

3.  Financial Instruments 
 
Strategy and Risk – We may use derivative financial instruments in limited instances for other than trading 
purposes to assist in managing our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and fuel prices. We are not 
a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative 
purposes. Derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of 
effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception and throughout 
the hedged period. We formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and 
hedged items at inception, as well as our risk-management objectives, strategies for undertaking the various 
hedge transactions, and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Changes in the fair market value of derivative 
financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are charged to earnings. We may use swaps, 
collars, futures, and/or forward contracts to mitigate the risk of adverse movements in interest rates and fuel 
prices; however, the use of these derivative financial instruments may limit future benefits from favorable 
price movements. 
 
Market and Credit Risk – We address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting 
instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item. We manage credit 
risk related to derivative financial instruments, which is minimal, by requiring high credit standards for 
counterparties and periodic settlements. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we were not required to provide 
collateral, nor had we received collateral, relating to our hedging activities.  
 
Determination of Fair Value – We determine the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions 
based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or the present value of expected future cash 
flows.  
 
Interest  Rate  Fair  Value  Hedges  –  We  manage  our  overall  exposure  to  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  by 
adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given 
period. We generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts 
of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings. We employ derivatives, primarily swaps, as 
one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix. In addition, we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs 
and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding 
callable fixed-rate debt securities.  
 
Swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the 
debt’s fair value attributable to the changes in interest rates. We account for swaps as fair value hedges using 
the short-cut method pursuant to FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging 
Activities; therefore, we do not record any ineffectiveness within our Consolidated Financial Statements.  

56

Interest Rate Cash Flow Hedges – We report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated 
other comprehensive loss until the hedged item affects earnings. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had 
reductions of $4 million and $5 million, respectively, recorded as an accumulated other comprehensive loss 
that is being amortized on a straight-line basis through September 30, 2014. As of December 31, 2007 and 
2006, we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding.  
 
Fuel Swaps – Two fuel basis swaps cover a total of 151 million gallons of diesel fuel for the period August 2006 
through July 2008. These commodity basis swaps require us to make payments to, or receive payments from, 
the counterparty based on the difference between certain price indices. Changes in the fair value of these swaps 
are reflected in fuel expense. We reported a derivative asset of approximately $1 million and $2 million at 
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which represents the fair value of the swaps. The swaps increased 
fuel expense for 2007 by $1 million and reduced fuel expense for 2006 by $3 million. The recognition of the 
swaps in fuel expense included monthly net settlements with the counterparty and the change in fair value. 
 
Earnings Impact – Our use of derivative financial instruments had the following impact on pre-tax income for 
the years ended December 31:

Fair Value of Debt Instruments – The fair value of our short- and long-term debt was estimated using quoted 
market prices, where available, or current borrowing rates. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the fair value of 
total  debt  exceeded  the  carrying  value  by  approximately  $96  million  and  $273  million,  respectively.  At 
December 31, 2007 and 2006, approximately $164 million and $165 million, respectively, of fixed-rate debt 
securities contained call provisions that allowed us to retire the debt instruments prior to final maturity, with 
the payment of fixed call premiums, or in certain cases, at par. 
 
Sale of Receivables – The Railroad transfers most of its accounts receivable to Union Pacific Receivables, Inc. 
(UPRI), a bankruptcy-remote subsidiary, as part of a sale of receivables facility. UPRI sells, without recourse 
on a 364-day revolving basis, an undivided interest in such accounts receivable to investors. The total capacity 
to sell undivided interests to investors under the facility was $600 million at both December 31, 2007 and 
2006. The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the facility was $600 million at 
both December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by 
investors is not included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The value of the undivided interest held by 
investors  was  supported  by  $1,071  million  and  $1,158  million  of  accounts  receivable  held  by  UPRI  at 
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the value of the interest retained 
by  UPRI  was  $471  million  and  $558  million, respectively. This retained interest is included in accounts 
receivable in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The interest sold to investors is sold at carrying value, 
which approximates fair value, and there is no gain or loss recognized from the transaction.  
 

57 
 

 

The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors could fluctuate based upon the availability of 
eligible receivables and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks, including default and 
dilution. If default or dilution percentages were to increase one percentage point, the amount of eligible 
receivables would decrease by $6 million. Should our credit rating fall below investment grade, the value of the 
outstanding undivided interest held by investors would be reduced, and, in certain cases, the investors would 
have the right to discontinue the facility.  
 
The Railroad services the sold receivables; however, the Railroad does not recognize any servicing asset or 
liability  as  the  servicing  fees  adequately  compensate  us  for  these  responsibilities.  The  Railroad  collected 
approximately  $16.1  billion  and  $15.5  billion  during  the  years  ended  December  31,  2007  and  2006, 
respectively. UPRI used certain of these proceeds to purchase new receivables under the facility.  
 
The costs of the sale of receivables program are included in other income and were $35 million, $33 million, 
and $23 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The costs include interest, program fees paid to banks, 
commercial paper issuing costs, and fees for unused commitment availability.  
 
The investors have no recourse to the Railroad’s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity 
claims. Creditors of the Railroad do not have recourse to the assets of UPRI. In August 2007, the sale of 
receivables program was renewed for an additional 364-day period without any significant changes in terms.

settlements of income tax examinations for pre-1995 tax years, along with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
Examination Reports for tax years 1995 through 2002, among other things, were considered in a re-evaluation 
of our estimated deferred tax assets and liabilities. This resulted in a reduction of deferred tax liabilities and 
income tax expense of $118 million in the third quarter of 2005.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48. We adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. Under FIN 48, tax benefits are 
recognized only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax 
authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 
percent likely to be realized upon settlement. Unrecognized tax benefits are tax benefits claimed in our tax 
returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards. 
 
At adoption, our total liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits were $227 million pre-tax, or $173 million after 
including tax benefits for the deductibility of interest and state taxes. Of this amount, $7 million was recorded 
as a decrease to beginning retained earnings for the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48.  The remaining $166 
million had been previously accrued under either FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, or 
FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The entire $173 million was classified as non-current in 
the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. 
 
A reconciliation of changes in pre-tax unrecognized tax benefits liabilities/(assets) from the beginning to the 
end of the reporting period is as follows:

Included in the $161 million balance at December 31, 2007 and the $227 million balance at adoption were 
$142 million and $182 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would reduce our 
effective  tax  rate.  The  remaining  unrecognized  tax  benefits  related  to  tax  positions  for  which  ultimate 
deductibility is highly certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. 
Recognition of these tax benefits would reduce our effective tax rate only through a reduction of accrued 
interest and penalties.   
 
We recognize interest and penalties as part of income tax expense. Total accrued pre-tax liabilities for interest 
and penalties were $78 million ($47 million after-tax) at December 31, 2007 and $75 million ($45 million 
after-tax) at adoption. 
 
For all federal income tax years prior to 1995, the IRS examinations have been completed and the statute of 
limitations bars any additional assessments by the IRS. We have filed interest refund claims for years 1986 

59 
 

 

through 1994, which may be disputed by the IRS. The IRS has completed its examinations and issued notices 
of deficiency for tax years 1995 through 2004, and we are in different stages of the IRS appeals process for 
these years. The IRS is examining our tax returns for tax years 2005 and 2006. In the third quarter of 2007, we 
believe that we reached an agreement in principle with the IRS to resolve all of the issues, except interest, 
related to tax years 1995 through 1998, including the previously reported dispute over certain donations of 
property.  We  anticipate  signing  a  closing  agreement  in  2008.  Once  formalized,  we  anticipate  that  this 
agreement will result in an immaterial reduction of income tax expense. 
 
Upon resolution of the federal income tax examinations described above, we will report any changes to our 
taxable  income  to  state  and  local  taxing  authorities  in  compliance  with  state  and  local  requirements.  
Additionally, several state taxing authorities are currently examining our state income tax returns for tax years 
2001 through 2005.  
 
In the third quarter of 2007, the State of Illinois enacted new tax legislation that changed how we determine 
the amount of our income subject to Illinois tax.  This legislation caused an increase to our deferred tax 
expense by $27 million in the third quarter. In addition, because the legislation reduced uncertainty about 
determining future income subject to Illinois tax, $41 million pre-tax ($26 million after-tax) of deferred taxes 
are no longer considered part of unrecognized tax benefits.  In January of 2008, Illinois enacted technical 
corrections legislation that made additional changes in how we determine the amount of our income subject 
to Illinois tax.  This technical corrections legislation will result in a reduction of deferred tax expense of 
approximately $14 million in the first quarter of 2008. 
 
We expect that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly during the next 12 months.  
Of the $161 million balance at December 31, 2007, $140 million is classified as current in the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position, primarily due to the anticipated settlement for tax years 1995 through 1998 
described above.  It is also reasonably possible that we may resolve the interest claims for 1986 through 1994 
described above, which would likely result in an immaterial change to unrecognized tax benefits.

At December 31, 2007, we reclassified as long-term debt approximately $550 million of debt due within one 
year that we intend to refinance. This reclassification reflected our ability and intent to refinance any short-
term borrowings and certain current maturities of long-term debt on a long-term basis. At December 31, 
2006, we did not reclassify any short-term debt as long-term debt as we did not intend to refinance at that 
time. 
 
Mortgaged Properties – Equipment with a carrying value of approximately $2.8 billion at both December 31, 
2007 and 2006 serves as collateral for capital leases and other types of equipment obligations in accordance 
with the secured financing arrangements utilized to acquire such railroad equipment.  
 
As a result of the merger of Missouri Pacific Railroad Company (MPRR) with and into UPRR on January 1, 
1997, and pursuant to the underlying indentures for the MPRR mortgage bonds, UPRR must maintain the 
same value of assets after the merger in order to comply with the security requirements of the mortgage bonds. 
As of the merger date, the value of the MPRR assets that secured the mortgage bonds was approximately $6.0 
billion. In accordance with the terms of the indentures, this collateral value must be maintained during the 
entire term of the mortgage bonds irrespective of the outstanding balance of such bonds.  
 
Credit Facilities – On December 31, 2007, $1.9 billion of credit was available under our revolving credit 
facility (the facility), which we entered into on April 20, 2007. The facility is designated for general corporate 
purposes and supports the issuance of commercial paper. We did not draw on the facility during 2007. 
Commitment  fees  and  interest  rates  payable  under  the  facility  are  similar  to  fees  and  rates  available  to 
comparably rated, investment-grade borrowers. The facility allows for borrowings at floating rates based on 
London Interbank Offered Rates, plus a spread, depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings. The 
facility requires the maintenance of a debt to net worth coverage ratio. At December 31, 2007, we were in 
compliance with this covenant. The facility does not include any other financial restrictions, credit rating 
triggers (other than rating-dependent pricing), or any other provision that could require us to post collateral. 
The facility, which expires in April 2012, replaced two $1 billion, 5-year facilities with terms ending in March 
2009  and  March  2010.  The  facility  includes  terms  that  are comparable with those of the prior facilities, 
although the minimum net worth requirement of $7.5 billion in prior facilities was removed, and the facility 
includes a change-of-control provision. 
 
In addition to our revolving credit facility, a $75 million uncommitted line of credit was available. The line of 
credit expires in April 2008, and was not used in 2007. We must have equivalent credit available under our 
five-year facility to draw on this $75 million line.  
 
Dividend Restrictions – Our revolving credit facility includes a debt-to-net worth covenant that, under certain 
circumstances, would restrict the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders. The amount of retained 
earnings available for dividends was $11.5 billion and $7.8 billion at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 
2006, respectively. This facility replaced two credit facilities that had minimum net worth covenants that were 
more restrictive with respect to the amount of retained earnings available for dividends at December 31, 2006.

Shelf Registration Statement and Significant New Borrowings – Our Board of Directors authorized the 
issuance of up to $3 billion of debt securities pursuant to a new shelf registration statement, which became 
effective on March 6, 2007, replacing the $500 million of authority remaining under our shelf registration filed 
in December 2003. Under the current shelf registration, we may issue, from time to time, any combination of 
debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or 
more offerings.  
 
We have issued the following unsecured, fixed-rate debt securities under our current shelf registration:

February 5, 2008 ............................................

 
$750 million of 5.70% Notes due August 15, 2018 

 
The  net  proceeds  from  these  offerings  are  for  general  corporate  purposes,  including  the  repurchase  of 
common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. These debt securities include change-of-control 
provisions. We have no immediate plans to issue equity securities; however, we will continue to explore 
opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under our shelf 
registration, and, therefore, we may issue additional debt securities at any time. 
 
6.  Leases 
 
We lease certain locomotives, freight cars, and other property. The Consolidated Statement of Financial 
Position as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 included $2,062 million, net of $887 million of amortization, and 
$1,982 million, net of $800 million of amortization, respectively, for properties under capital leases. A charge 
to  income  resulting  from  the  amortization  of  assets  recorded  under  capital  leases  is  included  within 
depreciation  expense  in  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income.  Future  minimum  lease  payments  for 
operating and capital leases with initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of 
December 31, 2007 were as follows:

Rent expense for operating leases with terms exceeding one month was $810 million in 2007, $798 million in 
2006,  and  $728  million  in  2005.  When  cash  rental  payments  are  not  made  on  a  straight-line  basis,  we 

62 
 

 

recognize variable rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals and sub-
rentals are not significant.  
 
7.   Retirement Plans 
 
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  
 
Pension Plans – We provide defined benefit retirement income to eligible non-union employees through 
qualified and non-qualified (supplemental) pension plans. Qualified and non-qualified pension benefits are 
based on years of service and the highest compensation during the latest years of employment, with specific 
reductions made for early retirements. 
 
Other Postretirement Benefits (OPEB) – We provide defined contribution medical and life insurance benefits 
for eligible retirees. These benefits are funded as medical claims and life insurance premiums are paid. 
 
Funded Status  
 
We  adopted  FASB  Statement  No.  158,  Employers’  Accounting  for  Defined  Benefit  Pension  and  Other 
Postretirement Plans (FAS 158), at the end of 2006, which required us to separately recognize the overfunded 
or underfunded status of our pension and OPEB plans as an asset or liability. The funded status represents the 
difference between the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and the fair value of the plan assets. The PBO is the 
present value of benefits earned to date by plan participants, including the effect of assumed future salary 
increases. The PBO of the OPEB plan is equal to the accumulated benefit obligation, as the present value of the 
OPEB liabilities is not affected by salary increases. Plan assets are measured at fair value. We use a December 
31 measurement date for plan assets and obligations for all our retirement plans.  
 
Changes in our PBO and plan assets are as follows for the years ended December 31:

Underfunded Accumulated Benefit Obligation – The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) is the present value 
of benefits earned to date, assuming no future salary growth. The underfunded accumulated benefit obligation 
represents the difference between the ABO and the fair value of plan assets. At December 31, 2007, the only 
pension plan that was underfunded was our non-qualified (supplemental) plan, which is not funded by 

64 
 

 

design. The non-qualified (supplemental) plan is funded with cash from operations as benefits are paid to 
plan participants. Each of our qualified plans was fully funded at December 31, 2007. The PBO, ABO, and fair 
value of plan assets for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of the fair value of the 
plan assets were as follows for the years ended December 31:

Expense  
 
Both pension and OPEB expense are determined based upon the annual service cost of benefits (the actuarial 
cost of benefits earned during a period) and the interest cost on those liabilities, less the expected return on 
plan assets. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets 
that recognizes changes in fair value over a five-year period. This practice is intended to reduce year-to-year 
volatility in pension expense, but it can have the effect of delaying the recognition of differences between 
actual returns on assets and expected returns based on long-term rate of return assumptions. Differences in 
actual experience in relation to assumptions are not recognized in net income immediately, but are deferred 
and, if necessary, amortized as pension or OPEB expense.

The  discount  rate  is  based  on  a  hypothetical  portfolio  of  high  quality  corporate  bonds  with  cash  flows 
matching our plans’ expected benefit payments. The expected return on plan assets is based on our asset 
allocation mix and our historical return, taking into account current and expected market conditions. The 
actual return on pension plan assets, net of fees, was approximately 9% in 2007, 14% in 2006, and 7% in 2005. 
Our historical annualized ten-year rate of return on plan assets is approximately 8%.  
 
Assumed  healthcare  cost  trend  rates  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  expense  and  liabilities  reported  for

Our policy with respect to funding the qualified plans is to fund at least the minimum required by the Pension 
Protection  Act  of  2006  and  not  more  than  the  maximum  amount  deductible  for  tax  purposes.  All 
contributions made to the qualified pension plans in 2006 were voluntary and were made with cash generated 
from  operations.  At  December  31,  2007,  our  qualified  pension  plans  were  fully  funded.  No  required 
contributions are expected in 2008.  
 
The OPEB plans are not funded and are not subject to any minimum regulatory funding requirements. Benefit 
payments for each year represent claims paid for medical and life insurance, and we anticipate our 2008 OPEB 
payments will be made from cash generated from operations.

The investment strategy for pension plan assets is to maintain a broadly diversified portfolio designed to 
achieve our target of an average long-term rate of return of 8%. While we believe we can achieve a long-term 
average rate of return of 8%, we cannot be certain that the portfolio will perform to our expectations. Assets 
are strategically allocated among equity, debt, and other instruments in order to achieve a diversification level 
that mitigates wide swings in investment returns. Asset allocation target ranges for equity, debt, and other 
portfolios are evaluated at least every three years with the assistance of an independent external consulting 
firm. Actual asset allocations are monitored monthly, and rebalancing actions are executed at least quarterly, if 
needed.  
 
Plan assets are valued at fair value.  Investments in securities traded on national security exchanges are valued 
at their closing market prices on the valuation date; where no sale was made on the valuation date, the security 
is valued at its bid price. Securities traded in the over-the-counter market are valued at their last sale or bid 
price. Investments in mortgage-backed securities are carried at estimated fair value based on the characteristics 
of the underlying mortgages. Certain short-term investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair 

67 
 

 

value. Venture capital funds, where no quoted market prices are available, are valued at their estimated fair 
values as determined by the investment manager. Investments in limited partnerships are valued at estimated 
fair value based on their proportionate share of the partnerships’ fair value. The partnerships invest primarily 
in readily marketable securities. 
 
The majority of the plan’s assets are invested in equity securities, because equity portfolios have historically 
provided higher returns than debt and other asset classes over extended time horizons, and are expected to do 
so in the future. Correspondingly, equity investments also entail greater risks than other investments. The risk 
of  loss  in  the  plan’s  equity  portfolio  is  mitigated  by  investing  in  a  broad  range  of  equity  types.  Equity 
diversification includes large-capitalization and small-capitalization companies, growth-oriented and value-
oriented investments, and U.S. and non-U.S. securities.  
 
Equity risks are further balanced by investing a significant portion of the plan’s assets in high quality debt 
securities. The average quality rating of the debt portfolio exceeded AA as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. The 
debt portfolio is also broadly diversified and invested primarily in U.S. Treasury, mortgage, and corporate 
securities with an intermediate average maturity. The weighted-average maturity of the debt portfolio was 6.4 
years at both December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  
 
The investment of pension plan assets in our securities is specifically prohibited for both the equity and debt 
portfolios, other than through index fund holdings.  
 
Other Retirement Programs 
 
Thrift Plan – We provide a defined contribution plan (thrift plan) to eligible non-union employees and make 
matching contributions to the thrift plan. We match 50 cents for each dollar contributed by employees up to 
the first six percent of compensation contributed. Our thrift plan contributions were $14 million in 2007, $13 
million in 2006, and $12 million in 2005.  
 
Railroad Retirement System – All Railroad employees are covered by the Railroad Retirement System (the 
System). Contributions made to the System are expensed as incurred and amounted to approximately $616 
million in 2007, $615 million in 2006, and $595 million in 2005.  
 
Collective Bargaining Agreements – Under collective bargaining agreements, we provide certain postretirement 
healthcare and life insurance benefits for eligible union employees. Premiums under the plans are expensed as 
incurred and amounted to $40 million in both 2007 and 2006, and $41 million in 2005.  
 
8.  Stock Options and Other Stock Plans 
 
We have 600,793 options outstanding under the 1993 Stock Option and Retention Stock Plan of Union Pacific 
Corporation (1993 Plan). There are 3,570 restricted shares outstanding under the 1992 Restricted Stock Plan 
for Non-Employee Directors of Union Pacific Corporation. We no longer grant options or awards of retention 
shares and units under these plans.  
 
The UP Shares Stock Option Plan of Union Pacific Corporation (UP Shares Plan) was approved by our Board 
of Directors on April 30, 1998. The UP Shares Plan reserved 12,000,000 shares of our common stock for 
issuance. The UP Shares Plan was a broad-based option program that granted options to purchase 200 shares 
of our common stock at $55.00 per share to eligible active employees on April 30, 1998. All options granted 
were non-qualified options that became exercisable on May 1, 2001, and remain exercisable until April 30, 
2008. If an optionee’s employment terminates for any reason, the option remains exercisable for a period of 
one year after the date of termination, but no option is exercisable after April 30, 2008. No further options 
may be granted under the UP Shares Plan. As of December 31, 2007, there were 432,689 options outstanding 
under the UP Shares Plan.

In April 2000, the shareholders approved the Union Pacific Corporation 2000 Directors Plan (Directors Plan) 
whereby 550,000 shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance to our non-employee directors. 
Under  the  Directors  Plan,  each  non-employee  director,  upon  his  or  her  initial  election  to  the  Board  of 
Directors, receives a grant of 1,000 shares of retention shares or retention stock units. Additionally, each non-
employee director receives annually an option to purchase at fair value a number of shares of our common 
stock, not to exceed 5,000 shares during any calendar year, determined by dividing 60,000 by 1/3 of the fair 
market value of one share of our common stock on the date of such Board of Directors meeting, with the 
resulting quotient rounded up or down to the nearest 50 shares. After December 31, 2007, non-employee 
directors  will  not  receive  these  annual  options.  As  of  December  31,  2007,  7,000  restricted  shares  were 
outstanding under the Directors Plan and 155,500 options were outstanding under the Directors Plan.  
 
The Union Pacific Corporation 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (2001 Plan) was approved by the shareholders in 
April 2001. The 2001 Plan reserved 12,000,000 shares of our common stock for issuance to eligible employees 
of the Corporation and its subsidiaries in the form of non-qualified options, incentive stock options, retention 
shares, stock units, and incentive bonus awards. Non-employee directors were not eligible for awards under 
the 2001 Plan. As of December 31, 2007, 2,963,203 options and 86,250 retention shares and stock units were 
outstanding under the 2001 Plan. We no longer grant any stock options or other stock or unit awards under 
this plan.  
 
The Union Pacific Corporation 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (2004 Plan) was approved by shareholders in April 
2004. The 2004 Plan reserved 21,000,000 shares of our common stock for issuance, plus any shares subject to 
awards made under the 2001 Plan and the 1993 Plan that were outstanding on April 16, 2004, and became 
available for regrant pursuant to the terms of the 2004 Plan. Under the 2004 Plan, non-qualified options, stock 
appreciation rights, retention shares, stock units, and incentive bonus awards may be granted to eligible 
employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. Non-employee directors are not eligible for awards under 
the 2004 Plan. As of December 31, 2007, 3,471,156 options and 1,020,420 retention shares and stock units 
were outstanding under the 2004 Plan.  
 
Pursuant  to  the  above  plans,  19,300,864;  19,544,245;  and  20,695,817  shares  of  our  common  stock  were 
authorized and available for grant at December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.  
 
Stock Options – We estimate the fair value of our stock option awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing 
model. Groups of employees and non-employee directors that have similar historical and expected exercise 
behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The table below shows the annual weighted-average 
assumptions used for valuation purposes:

The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant; the dividend yield is 
calculated as the ratio of dividends paid per share of common stock to the stock price on the date of grant; the 
expected life is based on historical and expected exercise behavior; and volatility is based on the historical 
volatility of our stock price over the expected life of the option.

Stock options are granted at the closing price on the date of grant, have ten-year contractual terms, and vest 
no later than three years from the date of grant. None of the stock options outstanding at December 31, 2007 
are subject to performance or market-based vesting conditions. 
 
At December 31, 2007, there was $26 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested 
stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.3 years. Additional

[a]     Stock options for executives granted in 2003 and 2002 included a reload feature. This reload feature allowed executives to exercise their 
options using shares of Union Pacific Corporation common stock that they already owned and obtain a new grant of options with 
immediate vesting in the amount of the shares used for exercise plus any shares withheld for tax purposes. The reload feature of these 
option grants could only be exercised if the price of our common stock increased at least 20% from the price at the time of the reload 
grant. During the year ended December 31, 2005, reload option grants represented $31 million of the aggregate grant-date fair value of 
stock options vested. There were no reload option grants during 2007 and 2006 as stock options exercised after January 1, 2006 are not 
eligible for the reload feature. 

 
Retention Awards – The fair value of retention awards is based on the closing price of the stock at the grant 
date. Dividend equivalents are paid to participants during the vesting periods.

Retention awards are granted at no cost to the employee or non-employee director and vest over periods 
lasting up to four years. At December 31, 2007, there was $38 million of total unrecognized compensation 
expense related to nonvested retention awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average 
period of 2.1 years. 
 
Performance Retention Awards – In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved performance stock unit 
grants. Other than raising the performance targets, the basic terms of these performance stock units are 
identical  to  those  granted  in  January  2006,  including  annual  return  on  invested  capital  (ROIC)  as  the 
performance measure. Stock units awarded to selected employees under these grants are subject to continued 
employment for 37 months and the attainment of certain levels of ROIC. We will expense the fair value of the 
units that are probable of being earned based on our forecasted ROIC over the 3-year performance period. We 
measure  the  fair  value  of  these  performance  stock  units  based  upon  the  closing  price  of  the  underlying 
common stock as of the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated future dividends. Dividend 
equivalents are paid to participants only after the units are earned. 
 
The assumptions used to calculate the present value of estimated future dividends are as follows:

Common  stock  options  totaling  0.4  million,  1.4  million,  and  1.4  million  for  2007,  2006,  and  2005, 
respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices of 
these options exceeded the average market price of our common stock for the respective periods, and the 
effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.  
 
10.  Commitments and Contingencies 
 
Asserted and Unasserted Claims – Various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our 
subsidiaries. We cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated 
results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity; however, to the extent possible, where asserted and 
unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated, we have 
recorded a liability. We do not expect that any known lawsuits, claims, environmental costs, commitments, 
contingent  liabilities,  or  guarantees  will  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  consolidated  results  of 
operations, financial condition, or liquidity after taking into account liabilities previously recorded for these 
matters. 
 
Personal Injury – The cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to 
expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year. We use third-party 
actuaries to assist us in measuring the expense and liability, including unasserted claims, on a semi-annual 
basis. Compensation for work-related accidents is governed by the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA). 
Under FELA, damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out-of-court settlements.  
 
As a result of improvements in our safety experience, lower estimated ultimate settlement costs, and the 
completion of actuarial studies, we reduced personal injury expense by approximately $80 million in 2007. 
These adjustments were partially offset by adverse development with respect to one claim. Our personal injury 
liability activity was as follows:

Our personal injury liability is discounted to present value using applicable U.S. Treasury rates. Because of the 
uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims, it is reasonably possible that future 
costs to settle these claims may range from approximately $593 million to $641 million. We believe that the 
$593 million liability recorded at December 31, 2007, is the best estimate of the present value of the future 
settlement costs of personal injury claims. 
 
Asbestos – We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other 
parties allege exposure to asbestos. Additionally, we have received claims for asbestos exposure that have not 
been litigated. The claims and lawsuits (collectively referred to as “claims”) allege occupational illness resulting 
from exposure to asbestos-containing products. In most cases, the claimants do not have credible medical 
evidence of physical impairment resulting from the alleged exposures. Additionally, most claims filed against 
us do not specify an amount of alleged damages.  
 
During 2004, we engaged a third party with extensive experience in estimating resolution costs for asbestos-
related claims to assist us in assessing the number and value of these unasserted claims through 2034, based on 
our average claims experience over a multi-year period. During 2007, we updated our potential liability to 
include actual claim experience since 2004. As a result, we decreased our liability by $20 million in 2007 for 
asbestos-related claims. The liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the 
following assumptions:  
 
(cid:127)  The number of future claims received would be consistent with historical averages.  
 
(cid:127)  The number of claims filed against us will decline each year.  
 
(cid:127)  The average settlement values for asserted and unasserted claims will be equivalent to historical averages.  
 
(cid:127)  The percentage of claims dismissed in the future will be equivalent to historical averages.  
 
Our asbestos-related liability activity was as follows:

Our liability for asbestos-related claims is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding 
the timing of future payments. Approximately 13% of the recorded liability related to asserted claims, and 
approximately 87% related to unasserted claims. These claims are expected to be paid out over the next 27 
years. We will continue to review actual experience and adjust our estimate as warranted.  
 
We have insurance coverage for a portion of the costs incurred to resolve asbestos-related claims, and, as a 
result of the 2004 assessment, we increased our receivable for insurance recoveries related to asbestos during 
2004. In conjunction with the liability update performed in 2007, we also reassessed estimated insurance 
recoveries.  We have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at December 31, 2007 and 2006.  
 
We believe that our estimates of liability for asbestos-related claims and insurance recoveries are reasonable 
and probable. The amounts recorded for asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries were 
based on currently known facts. However, future events, such as the number of new claims filed each year, 
average settlement costs, and insurance coverage issues, could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries 
to be higher or lower than the projected amounts. Estimates also may vary in the future if: strategies, activities, 

73 
 

 

and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change; federal and state laws governing asbestos litigation 
increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimants; and there are material changes 
with respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants. 
 
Environmental Costs – We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. We have 
339 projects with which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or 
for violations of environmental requirements. This includes 41 projects that are the subject of actions taken by 
the U.S. government, 22 of which are currently on the Superfund National Priorities List. Certain federal 
legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified projects; consequently, our 
ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties, in addition to costs 
relating to our own activities with each project.  
 
When an environmental issue has been identified with respect to property owned, leased, or otherwise used in 
our business, we and our consultants perform environmental assessments on the property. We expense the 
cost of the assessments as incurred. We accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and 
such costs can be reasonably estimated. We do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of 
the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable. At December 31, 2007, approximately 13% 
of our environmental liability was discounted at 4.15%, while approximately 14% of our environmental 
liability was discounted at 5.34% at December 31, 2006.  
 
Our environmental liability activity was as follows:

The environmental liability includes costs for remediation and restoration of sites, as well as for ongoing 
monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties. Cost estimates are based on 
information available for each project, financial viability of other potentially responsible parties, and existing 
technology, laws, and regulations. We believe that we have adequately accrued for our ultimate share of costs 
at sites subject to joint and several liability. However, the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to 
determine  because  of  the  number  of  potentially  responsible  parties  involved,  site-specific  cost  sharing 
arrangements with other potentially responsible parties, the degree of contamination by various wastes, the 
scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites, and the speculative nature of remediation 
costs. Estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal, state, and local laws governing 
environmental remediation. We do not expect current obligations to have a material adverse effect on our 
results of operations or financial condition.  
 
Guarantees – At December 31, 2007, we were contingently liable for $465 million in guarantees. We have 
recorded a liability of $5 million and $6 million for the fair value of these obligations as of December 31, 2007 
and 2006, respectively. We entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business, and they 
include guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building, equipment financings, and affiliated 
operations. The final guarantee expires in 2022. We are not aware of any existing event of default that would 
require us to satisfy these guarantees. We do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse 
effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.  
 
Indemnities – Our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements, including certain tax 
indemnifications, can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount, depending on the nature 
of the transactions and the agreements. Due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will 

74 
 

 

be resolved, we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any 
adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements. We do not have 
any  reason  to  believe  that  we  will  be  required  to  make  any  material  payments  under  these  indemnity 
provisions.  
 
Income  Taxes  –  As  discussed  in  note  4,  the  IRS  has  completed  its  examinations  and  issued  notices  of 
deficiency for tax years 1995 through 2004, and we are in different stages of the IRS appeals process for these 
years. The IRS is examining our tax returns for tax years 2005 and 2006. In the third quarter of 2007, we 
believe that we reached an agreement in principle with the IRS to resolve all of the issues, except interest, 
related to tax years 1995 through 1998, including the previously reported dispute over certain donations of 
property. We anticipate signing a closing agreement in 2008. At December 31, 2007, we have recorded a 
current liability of $140 million for tax payments in 2008 related to federal and state income tax examinations. 
 We do not expect that the ultimate resolution of these examinations will have a material adverse effect on our 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
11.  Other Income

12.  Share Repurchase Program 
 
On January 30, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 20 million shares of Union 
Pacific Corporation common stock through the end of 2009. Management’s assessments of market conditions 
and other pertinent facts guide the timing and volume of all repurchases. We expect to fund our common 
stock repurchases through cash generated from operations, the sale or lease of various operating and non-
operating properties, debt issuances, and cash on hand at December 31, 2007. 
 
During 2007, we repurchased approximately 13 million shares under this program at an aggregate purchase 
price of approximately $1.5 billion. These shares were recorded in treasury stock at cost, which includes any 
applicable commissions and fees.

14.  Accounting Pronouncements 
 
In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157). FAS 157 defines 
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement does not require any new 
fair value measurements; rather, it applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair 
value measurements.  The provisions of FAS 157 are effective for us beginning in 2008.  We expect this new 
standard will result in increased disclosures but will not have a significant impact on our financial position or 
results of operations.  
 
In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial 
Liabilities (FAS 159). The fair value option established by FAS 159 permits, but does not require, all entities to 
choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates. An entity would report unrealized 
gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent 
reporting date. FAS 159 is effective for us beginning in 2008. We do not currently intend to elect the fair value 
option for any eligible items and do not expect this standard to have a significant impact on our financial 
position or results of operations.  
 
In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations (FAS 141R). 
FAS 141R will change the accounting for business combinations. Under FAS 141R, an acquiring entity will be 
required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair 
value with limited exceptions. FAS 141R will also change the accounting treatment and disclosures with 
respect to certain specific items in a business combination. FAS 141R applies to us prospectively for business 
combinations occurring on or after January 1, 2009. Accordingly, any business combinations we engage in will 
be recorded and disclosed following existing GAAP until January 1, 2009. We expect FAS 141R will have an 
impact on accounting for business combinations, but the effect will be dependent upon any potential future 
acquisitions. 

76 
 

 

 
In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial 
Statements – An Amendment of ARB No. 51 (FAS 160). FAS 160 establishes new accounting and reporting 
standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. FAS 160 is 
effective for us beginning in 2009. We are still assessing the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of FAS 
160 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  
 
In December 2007, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 
07-1,  Collaborative  Arrangements  (EITF  07-1),  which  defines  collaborative  arrangements  and  establishes 
reporting and disclosure requirements for transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement.  
The requirements of this EITF will be applied to collaborative arrangements in existence on or after January 1, 
2009. We are still assessing the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of EITF 07-1 on our consolidated 
financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 
 
None. 
 
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 
As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Corporation carried out an evaluation, under the 
supervision and with the participation of the Corporation’s management, including the Corporation’s Chief 
Executive Officer (CEO) and Executive Vice President – Finance and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the 
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to 
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, 
management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can 
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Based upon that evaluation, the 
CEO and the CFO concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Corporation’s 
disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to 
be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time 
periods specified by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, 
including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
 
Additionally, the CEO and CFO determined that there have been no changes to the Corporation’s internal 
control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the last 
fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation’s 
internal control over financial reporting.  
 
Item 9B. Other Information

MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 
The management of Union Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies (the Corporation) is responsible 
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange 
Act  Rules  13a-15(f)  and  15d-15(f)).  The  Corporation’s  internal  control  system  was  designed to provide 
reasonable assurance to the Corporation’s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and 
fair presentation of published financial statements.  
 
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those 
systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement 
preparation and presentation.  
 
The Corporation’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial 
reporting as of December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee 
of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  (COSO)  in  Internal  Control  –  Integrated 
Framework. Based on our assessment management believes that, as of December 31, 2007, the Corporation’s 
internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.  
 
The  Company’s  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm  has  issued  an  attestation  report  on  the 
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on page 80.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Union Pacific Corporation, its Directors, and Shareholders:  
 
We  have  audited  the  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  of  Union  Pacific  Corporation  and  Subsidiary 
Companies  (the  Corporation)  as  of  December 31,  2007,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control — 
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The 
Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for 
its  assessment  of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying 
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an 
opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether  effective  internal  control  over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit 
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the 
assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe 
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the 
company’s  principal  executive  and  principal  financial  officers,  or  persons  performing  similar  functions,  and 
effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made 
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of  the 
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion 
or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented 
or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over 
financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  
 
In  our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial 
reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended 
December 31, 2007 of the Corporation and our report dated February 15, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on 
those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule and included an explanatory paragraph 
regarding the Corporation’s adoption, in 2006, of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers’ 
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans.
