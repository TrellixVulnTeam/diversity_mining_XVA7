ANNUAL REPORT 2017

TO OUR
SHAREHOLDERS

The year 2017 was a volatile year in the logistics industry. C.H. Robinson adapted to the 
rapidly changing markets with a relentless commitment to serving customers, carriers, and 
suppliers while maintaining our long-term focus of growing market share and investing in 
our business.

Even during periods of rapid change and disruption, we continue to be guided by 
our mission to improve the world’s transportation and supply chains. We accomplish 
this through the combination of our talented team of supply chain professionals, a 
commitment to continuous process improvement, and by leveraging our powerful, global 
technology platform, Navisphere®. We have an unprecedented opportunity to innovate 
and lead as the industry transforms. We are investing in our business to maintain our 
leadership position as a global service provider.

Progress and Our Results
We finished the year 2017 with $14.9 billion in total revenues and $2.4 billion in net 
revenues, both all-time highs for C.H. Robinson. Net income was $505 million, down 1.7 
percent from 2016. 

Our North American Surface Transportation business—home to the most powerful 
truckload network in North America and the largest third party less than truckload 
business—made great headway in its transformation efforts outlined at our 2017 Investor 
Day.  We are creating scaled operations centers and automating processes to allow the 
division’s nearly 7,000 employees to work smarter. In Global Forwarding, in addition to 
maintaining our position as the #1 NVOCC from China to the U.S., the team grew market 
share significantly and opened eight new offices around the world. Our Robinson Fresh® 
business continues to innovate and help its customers execute their increasingly complex 
just in time supply chains. Our Managed Services business has $3.5 billion in freight under 
management. Our Europe Surface Transportation business continued to grow as well.

We have an unprecedented opportunity to 
innovate and lead as the industry transforms.
We are investing in our business to maintain our 
leadership position as a global service provider.

We continued to invest in our 
transformation and expanded our 
market opportunities. In the past
five years, we have deployed over
$1 billion in mergers and acquisitions 
(M&A) to grow our global presence 
and expand our services for our 
customers. In August, we acquired Milgram & Company Ltd, to further bolster our global 
forwarding footprint in Canada. Our commercial results included the growth in our 
diversified customer portfolio to 120,000 customers and over 19 million global shipments. 
We provided more services in more geographies than at any time in our history. We are 
uniquely positioned to win with our broad portfolio of services and global presence. And 
with all of the market volatility and our volume growth, our team was able to deliver on our 
commitments to customers during difficult market circumstances.

Technology has always served a critical role in our ability to execute efficiently and deliver 
value. In 2017, we developed and launched hundreds of new features and enhancements 
to the Navisphere platform. Our talented team of technology developers, engineers, and 
data scientists are innovating and transforming the way we do business. We are in the 
early innings of reaching full potential with the opportunities to optimize the way supply 
chains perform. Today, our platform connects over 200,000 companies and executes over 
45 million digital transactions per month.

We remain highly committed to returning cash to shareholders. In 2017, we returned over 
90 percent of our net income to shareholders through dividends and share purchases. 
This builds on our strong track record of adding shareholder value; over the last five years, 
we have returned over $2.8 billion to shareholders. And in 2017, we were named to the 
S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index—a testament to our practice of increasing our 
dividend payments over time.

Looking Forward: A World of Opportunity
C.H. Robinson has always challenged the status quo by constantly reinventing the services 
we provide customers. Our success is a result of our ability to evolve to help our customers 
and carriers achieve their supply chain goals. 

In North America, we are navigating 
a climate of volatility created 
by regulatory change, along 
with economic opportunity from 
corporate tax reform in the U.S. 
We expect both to be positive for 
our business.  A difficult capacity 
environment presents opportunities 
for us to prove our value. The lower corporate tax rate will increase our earnings and 
cash flows, allowing us to be more globally competitive and expand our services and 
capabilities in 2018 and beyond.

C.H. Robinson has always challenged the status 
quo by constantly reinventing the services we 
provide customers. Our success is a result of 
our ability to evolve to help our customers and 
carriers achieve their supply chain goals. 

With all of the change and disruption the industry is facing, I am confident in our ability to 
grow our business by understanding that we are a service company where the combination 
of our people, process, and technology is key to our success. 

Our people are experienced and dedicated to the supply chain profession. We are 
constantly investing in the development of our team to bring expertise that can drive 
innovation for our customers. Relationships are critical to earn the trust of our customers 
and power the collaboration necessary to execute the change management and process 
improvement initiatives embedded in their strategies. Our culture is a valuable asset. Our 
people are empowered to deliver unique value leveraging their expertise, comprehensive 
processes, and C.H. Robinson’s technology platform. 

We are digitizing and optimizing many processes in our business, creating opportunities 
for efficiency and knowledge acquisition. One of the core currencies of any business
going forward is data; and we are in a unique position to leverage the data from our 
millions of global shipments. Our digitalization strategies are improving the visibility and 
transparency of supply chains, enabling real time collaboration, advanced analytics, and 
predictive guidance.

We have challenged ourselves to hit aggressive financial goals as we invest and transform 
the way we operate. We believe our investments will drive down our cost to execute in 
the future, promote competitiveness, and improve our execution. We will continue our 
disciplined approach to M&A that expands our portfolio of services and capabilities in 
both existing and new geographies. And we will continue to reward our shareholders 
through dividends and share repurchases.

In Closing
The trends of globalization, technological innovation, supply chain complexity, and 
disruption are tailwinds for our opportunity to deliver and create value. We remain 
committed to growth and to continuing to lead the industry we serve. At the core of our 
ability to accomplish this is the C.H. Robinson team. We are committed to delivering 
excellence by going the extra mile; evolving constantly; working as one strong, diverse 
team; and by embracing integrity by doing what we say we will do. We know this gives us 
an edge in the marketplace. 

To our customers, contract carriers and suppliers, and shareholders, thank you for your 
business and trust. And to our over 15,000 employees around the world, thank you 
for your hard work this year. I am proud of our progress in 2017 and am excited by the 
investments we have made to help us grow and thrive, now and into the future.

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Overview

C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (“C.H. Robinson,” “the company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is one of the largest third party 
logistics companies in the world with consolidated total revenues of $14.9 billion in 2017. We are a service company. We 
provide freight transportation services and logistics solutions to companies of all sizes, in a wide variety of industries. During 
2017, we handled approximately 19 million shipments and worked with more than 120,000 customers. We operate through a 
network of offices in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and South America. We have developed global 
transportation and distribution networks to provide transportation and supply chain services worldwide. As a result, we have the 
capability of facilitating most aspects of the supply chain on behalf of our customers. We have three reportable segments: North 
American Surface Transportation (“NAST”), Global Forwarding, and Robinson Fresh, with our remaining operating segments 
reported as All Other and Corporate. For financial information concerning our reportable segments and geographic regions, 
refer to Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements. 

As a third party logistics provider, we enter into contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies, and 
utilize those relationships to efficiently and cost-effectively arrange the transport of our customers’ freight. We utilized 
approximately 73,000 contracted transportation companies, including motor carriers, railroads (primarily intermodal service 
providers), and air and ocean carriers in 2017. Depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements, we 
select and hire the appropriate transportation for each shipment. Our model enables us to be flexible and provide solutions that 
optimize service for our customers. As an integral part of our transportation services, we provide a wide range of value-added 
logistics services, such as freight consolidation, supply chain consulting and analysis, optimization, and reporting. 

In addition to transportation, we provide sourcing services under the trade name Robinson Fresh® (“Robinson Fresh”). Our 
sourcing services consist primarily of the buying, selling, and/or marketing of fresh fruits, vegetables, and other value-added 
perishable items. It was our original business when we were founded in 1905. The foundation for much of our logistics 
expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and temperature controlled commodities. We supply 
fresh produce through a network of independent produce growers and suppliers. Our customers include grocery retailers, 
restaurants, foodservice distributors, and produce wholesalers. In many cases, we also arrange the logistics and transportation 
of the products we sell and provide related supply chain services, such as replenishment, category management, and managed 
procurement services. We have developed proprietary brands of produce and have exclusive licensing agreements to distribute 
fresh and value-added produce under recognized consumer brand names. The produce for these brands is sourced through a 
preferred grower network and packed to order through contract packing agreements. We have instituted quality assurance and 
monitoring procedures with each of these preferred growers.

Our flexible business model has been the main driver of our historical results and has positioned us for continued growth. One 
of our competitive advantages is our network of offices. Our employees are in close proximity to both customers and 
transportation providers, which gives them broad knowledge of their local markets and enables them to respond quickly to 
customers’ and transportation providers’ changing needs. Employees act as a team in their sales efforts, customer service, and 
operations. A significant portion of most employees’ compensation is performance-oriented, based on profitability and their 
contributions to the success of the company. We believe this makes our employees more service-oriented and focused on 
driving growth and maximizing office productivity.

Our network of offices work together to meet our customers’ needs and cross-sell our services. For large, multi-location 
customers, we often coordinate our efforts in global account centers or in one office and rely on multiple offices to deliver 
specific geographic or modal needs. The majority of our global network operates on a single global technology platform called 
Navisphere® that is used to match customer needs with supplier capabilities, to collaborate with other offices, and to utilize 
centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction.

We have grown primarily through internal growth, by increasing market share through the addition of new customers and 
expanding relationships with our current customers, adding new services, expanding our market presence and operations 
globally, and hiring additional employees. We continually look to grow through selective acquisitions. In August 2017, we 
acquired Milgram & Company Ltd. (“Milgram”), a provider of freight forwarding, customs brokerage, and surface 
transportation primarily in Canada. The acquisition strengthens our freight forwarding and customs brokerage offerings in 
Canada. Milgram operates primarily in our Global Forwarding segment. 

3

In September 2016, we completed the acquisition of APC Logistics (“APC”), a privately held company based in Australia, for 
the purpose of expanding our global presence and bringing additional capabilities and expertise to our portfolio. APC provides 
international freight forwarding and customs brokerage services in Australia and New Zealand. APC operates in our Global 
Forwarding segment. 

On January 1, 2015, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Freightquote.com, Inc. (“Freightquote”) for the purpose of 
enhancing our less than truckload (“LTL”) and truckload businesses and expanding our ecommerce capabilities. Freightquote 
operates in our NAST segment. 

Net revenues are a Non-GAAP financial measure calculated as total revenues less the cost of purchased transportation and 
related services and the cost of purchased products sourced for resale. We believe net revenues are a useful measure of our 
ability to source, add value, and sell services and products that are provided by third parties, and we consider net revenues to be 
our primary performance measurement. Accordingly, the discussion of our results of operations focuses on the changes in our 
net revenues. The reconciliation of total revenues to net revenues is presented below (in thousands):

Transportation and Logistics Services

C.H. Robinson provides freight transportation and related logistics and supply chain services. Our services range from 
commitments on a specific shipment to much more comprehensive and integrated relationships. We execute these service 
commitments by hiring and training people, developing proprietary systems and processes, and utilizing a network of 
contracted transportation providers, including, but not limited to, contract motor carriers, railroads, and air and ocean carriers. 
We make a profit on the difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and 
what we pay to the transportation providers to handle or transport the freight. While industry definitions vary, given our 
extensive contracting to create a flexible network of solutions, we are generally referred to in the industry as a third party 
logistics company.

We provide all of the following transportation and logistics services:

•  Truckload: Through our contracts with motor carriers, we have access to dry vans, temperature controlled vans, 

flatbeds, and bulk capacity. We help our customers connect with carriers who are interested in their lanes and 
product types, and we help carriers find shipments to make effective use of their equipment.

•  Less than Truckload: LTL transportation involves the shipment of single or multiple pallets of freight. We focus 

on shipments of a single pallet or larger, although we handle any size shipment. Through our contracts with motor 
carriers and our operating system, we consolidate freight and freight information to provide our customers with a 
single source of information on their freight. In many instances, we will consolidate partial shipments for several 
customers into full truckloads.

• 

Intermodal: Our intermodal transportation service is the shipment of freight in trailers or containers by a 
combination of truck and rail. We have intermodal marketing agreements with container owners and all Class 1 
railroads in North America, and we arrange local pickup and delivery (known as drayage) through local 
contracted motor carriers. In addition, we own approximately 1,500 intermodal containers and lease 
approximately 1,700 containers.

4

•  Ocean: As a non-vessel ocean common carrier (“NVOCC”) or freight forwarder, we consolidate shipments, 
determine routing, select ocean carriers, contract for ocean shipments, and/or provide for local pickup and 
delivery of shipments.

•  Air: As a certified indirect air carrier (“Indirect Air Carrier” or “IAC”) or freight forwarder, we organize air 

shipments and provide door-to-door service.

•  Customs: Our customs brokers are licensed and regulated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to assist 

importers and exporters in meeting federal requirements governing imports and exports. 

•  Other Logistics Services: We provide fee-based managed services, warehousing services, small parcel, and other 

services.

Customers communicate their freight needs, typically on a shipment-by-shipment basis, to the C.H. Robinson team responsible 
for their account. The team ensures that all appropriate information about each shipment is available in our proprietary 
operating system. This information is entered by our employees, by the customer through our web tools, or received 
electronically from the customers’ systems. We utilize the information from our operating system and other available sources to 
select the best available carrier based upon factors such as their service score, equipment availability, freight rates, and other 
relevant factors. 

Once the contracted carrier is selected, we receive the contract carrier’s commitment to provide the transportation. During the 
time when a shipment is executed, we connect frequently with the contract carrier to track the status of the shipment to meet the 
unique needs of our customers. 

For most of our transportation and logistics services, we are a service provider. By accepting the customer’s order, we accept 
certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination. The carrier’s contract is with us, not the 
customer, and we are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges. In the cases where we have agreed (either 
contractually or otherwise) to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit, we pursue reimbursement from the 
contracted carrier for the claims. In our managed services business, we are acting as the shipper’s agent. In those cases, the 
carrier’s contract is typically with the customer, and we collect a fee for our services.

As a result of our logistics capabilities, some of our customers have us handle all, or a substantial portion, of their freight 
transportation requirements. Our employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for 
the customer. In some cases, our services to the customer are priced on a spot market, or transactional, basis. In a number of 
instances, we have contracts with the customer in which we agree to handle an estimated number of shipments, usually to 
specified destinations, such as from the customer’s plant to a distribution center. Our commitments to handle the shipments are 
usually at pre-determined rates. Most of our rate commitments are for one year or less and allow for renegotiation. As is typical 
in the transportation industry, most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments. When we enter into 
prearranged rate agreements for truckload services with our customers, we usually have fuel surcharge agreements, in addition 
to the underlying line-haul portion of the rate.

We purchase the majority of our truckload services from our contract truckload carriers on a spot market, or transactional, 
basis, even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis. In a small number of cases, we may get advance 
commitments from one or more contract carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract. In 
those cases, where we have prearranged rates with contract carriers, there is a calculated fuel surcharge based on a mutually 
agreed-upon formula.

In the course of providing day-to-day transportation services, our employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics 
services as they become more familiar with our customers’ daily operations and the nuances of our customers’ supply chains. 
We offer a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies. We will 
analyze customers’ current transportation rate structures, modes of shipping, and carrier selection. We can identify opportunities 
to consolidate shipments for cost savings. We will suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage 
claims. We can help customers minimize storage through crossdocking and other flow-through operations. Many of these 
services are provided in connection with providing the transportation services and are not typically priced separately. They are 
usually included as a part of the cost of transportation services provided by us, based on the nature of the customer relationship. 
In addition to these transportation services, we may provide additional logistics services, such as contract warehousing, 
consulting, transportation management, and other services, for which we are usually paid separately.

As we have emphasized integrated logistics solutions, our relationships with many customers have broadened, and we have 
become a key provider to them by managing a greater portion of their supply chains. We may serve our customers through 
specially created teams and through several locations. Our transportation services are provided to numerous international 

5

customers through our worldwide network. See Note 9 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 
of this report for disclosure of our total revenues from domestic and foreign customers for the years ended December 31, 2017, 
2016, and 2015 and our long-lived assets as of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 in the United States and in foreign 
locations.

Transportation services accounted for approximately 95 percent of net revenues in 2017, 2016, and 2015. For additional 
information, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of Part II 
of this report. 

Sourcing

Since we were founded in 1905, we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce. Much of our logistics expertise can be 
traced to our significant experience in handling produce and other perishable commodities. Because of its perishable nature, 
produce must be rapidly packaged; carefully transported within tight timetables, usually in temperature controlled equipment; 
and quickly distributed to replenish high-turnover inventories maintained by our customers. In many instances, we consolidate 
individual customer’s produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the 
truckloads, often to multiple destinations.

Our sourcing customer base includes grocery retailers, restaurants, foodservice distributors, and produce wholesalers.

Our sourcing services include inventory forecasting and replenishment, brand management, and category development 
services. We have various national and regional branded produce programs, including both proprietary brands and national 
licensed brands. These programs contain a wide variety of high quality, fresh bulk, and value added fruits and vegetables. These 
brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with many of our retail customers. We have also instituted quality 
assurance and monitoring programs as part of our branded and preferred grower programs.

Sourcing accounted for approximately five percent of our net revenues in 2017, 2016, and 2015. 

Organization

Segment information. We have continued to expand our services and diversify our business and have also made changes to 
align executive oversight to the business. We have three reportable segments: NAST, Global Forwarding, and Robinson Fresh, 
with our remaining operating segments reported as All Other and Corporate. The All Other and Corporate segment includes 
Managed Services, Other Surface Transportation outside of North America, and other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated 
corporate expenses. See additional disclosure in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. 

NAST provides freight transportation services across North America through a network of offices in the United States, Canada, 
and Mexico. The primary services provided by NAST include truckload, LTL, and intermodal.  

Global Forwarding provides global logistics services through an international network of offices in North America, Europe, 
Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and South America; and also contracts with independent agents worldwide. The primary services 
provided by Global Forwarding include ocean freight services, air freight services, and customs brokerage. 

Robinson Fresh provides sourcing under the trade name Robinson Fresh. Our sourcing services primarily include the buying, 
selling, and marketing of fresh fruits, vegetables, and other perishable items. Robinson Fresh sources products from around the 
world. This segment often provides the logistics and transportation of the products they sell, in addition to temperature 
controlled transportation services for its customers. 

6

All Other and Corporate primarily consists of Managed Services and Other Surface Transportation outside of North America. 
Managed Services is primarily comprised of our division, TMC, which offers Managed TMS®. Managed TMS combines a 
global transportation management system (“TMS”), logistics process expertise, and consulting services. Customers can access 
Navisphere technology, logistics experts, and supply chain engineers to manage their day-to-day operations and optimize 
supply chain performance. 

Other Surface Transportation revenues are primarily earned by our Europe Surface Transportation operating segment. Europe 
Surface Transportation provides services similar to NAST across Europe. 

Office Network. To keep us close to our customers and markets, we operate through a network of offices in North America, 
Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and South America.   

Each office is responsible for its own growth and profitability. Our employees are responsible for developing new business, 
negotiating and pricing services, receiving and processing service requests from customers, and negotiating with carriers to 
provide the transportation requested. In addition to routine transportation, employees are often called upon to handle customers’ 
unusual, seasonal, and emergency needs. Shipments to be transported by truck are priced at the local level, and offices 
cooperate with each other to hire contract carriers to provide transportation. Employees often rely on expertise in other offices 
when contracting LTL, intermodal, ocean, and air shipments. Multiple network offices often also work together to service 
larger, global accounts where the expertise and resources of more than one office are required to meet the customer’s needs. 
Their efforts are usually coordinated by one “lead” office on the account.

Network Employees. Employees both sell to and service their customers. Sales opportunities are identified through our internal 
database, referrals from current customers, leads generated by people through knowledge of their local and regional markets, 
and company marketing efforts. Employees are also responsible for recruiting new motor carriers, who are referred to our 
centralized carrier services group to confirm they are properly licensed and insured, have acceptable Federal Motor Carrier 
Safety Administration (“FMCSA”) issued safety ratings, and will enter into a contract for transportation services with           
C.H. Robinson.

Each office is responsible for its hiring and headcount decisions, based on the needs of their office and to balance personnel 
resources with business requirements. Because the quality of our employees is essential to our success, we are highly selective 
in our recruiting and hiring. To support our hiring processes, we have a corporate talent acquisition team that develops a 
pipeline of qualified candidates that managers can draw from. Our applicants typically have college degrees, and some have 
business experience, although not necessarily within the transportation industry.

Our employees go through centralized onboarding that emphasizes development of the skills necessary to become productive 
employees, including technology training on our proprietary systems and our customer service philosophy. Centralized training 
is followed by ongoing, on-the-job training. We expect most new employees to start contributing in a matter of weeks.

Compensation programs are performance-based, and cash incentives are directly tied to productivity and performance. Most 
network management compensation is dependent on the profitability of their particular office. They are paid a performance-
based bonus, which is a portion of the office’s earnings for that calendar year. The percentage they can potentially earn is 
predetermined in an annual bonus contract and is based on their productivity and contributions to the overall success of the 
office. 

All of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards 
because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating long-term ownership and alignment between employees and 
our shareholders. Generally, these awards are eligible to vest over five-year periods and may also include financial 
performance-based requirements for management employees.

Employees benefit both through the growth and profitability of individual offices and by achieving individual goals. They are 
motivated by the opportunity to advance in a variety of career paths, including management, corporate sales, and customer and 
carrier account management. 

Shared Services. Our network offices are supported by our shared and centralized services. Approximately ten percent of our 
employees provide shared services in centralized centers. Approximately 50 percent of these shared services employees are 
information technology personnel who develop and maintain our proprietary operating system software and our wide area 
network.

Employees

As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of 15,074 employees, approximately 13,700 of whom were located in our network 
offices. Our remaining employees centrally serve our network of offices in areas such as finance, information technology, legal, 
marketing, and human resources.

Customer Relationships

We work to establish long-term relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each 
customer by providing them with a full range of logistics services. During 2017, we served over 120,000 customers worldwide, 
ranging from Fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries.

During 2017, our largest customer accounted for approximately two percent of total revenues. In recent years, we have grown 
by adding new customers and by increasing our volumes with, and providing more services to, our existing customers.

We seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on our knowledge of the marketplace 
and the range of logistics services that we can provide. We believe that our account management disciplines and decentralized 
structure enable our employees to better serve our customers by combining a broad knowledge of logistics and market 
conditions with a deep understanding of the specific supply chain issues facing individual customers and certain vertical 
industries. With the guidance of our executive and shared services teams, offices are given significant latitude to pursue 
opportunities and to commit our resources to serve our customers.

Relationships with Transportation Providers

We continually work on establishing contractual relationships with qualified transportation providers that also meet our service 
requirements to provide dependable services, favorable pricing, and contract carrier availability during periods when demand 
for transportation equipment is greater than the supply. Because we own very little transportation equipment and do not employ 
the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers’ freight, these relationships are critical to our success.

In 2017, we worked with approximately 73,000 transportation providers worldwide, of which the vast majority are contracted 
motor carriers. To strengthen and maintain our relationships with motor carriers, our employees regularly communicate with 

9

carriers and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization, reducing their empty miles, and repositioning their 
equipment. To make it easier for contract carriers to work with us, we have a policy of payment upon receipt of proof of 
delivery. For those contract carriers who would like a faster payment, we also offer payment within 48 hours of receipt of proof 
of delivery in exchange for a discount, along with offering in-trip cash advances.

Contracted motor carriers provide access to dry vans, temperature controlled vans, flatbeds, and bulk capacity. These contract 
carriers are of all sizes, including owner-operators of a single truck, small and midsize fleets, private fleets, and the largest 
national trucking companies. Consequently, we are not dependent on any one contract carrier. Our largest truck transportation 
provider was less than two percent of our total cost of transportation in 2017. Motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors 
transported approximately 82 percent of our truckload shipments in 2017. Every United States and Canadian motor carrier with 
which we do business is required to execute a contract that establishes that the carrier is acting as an independent contractor. At 
the time the contract is executed, and thereafter, through subscriptions with a third party service, we confirm that each United 
States motor carrier is properly licensed and insured, has the necessary federally-issued authority to provide transportation 
services, and has the ability to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis. Our motor carrier contracts require 
that the motor carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us for the shipments that they transport under their 
contract with us, and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages. Our standard contracts do not 
include volume commitments, and the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual shipment with a 
carrier.

We also have intermodal marketing agreements with container owners and all Class 1 railroads in North America, giving us 
access to additional trailers and containers. Our contracts with railroads specify the transportation services and payment terms 
by which our intermodal shipments are transported by rail. Intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between us 
and the railroad on a customer-specific basis. We own approximately 1,500 53-foot containers and lease approximately 1,700 
containers. We believe that these containers have helped us better serve our customers, and we will continue to analyze the 
strategy of controlling containers.

In our NVOCC ocean transportation business, we have contracts with most of the major ocean carriers, which support a variety 
of service and rate needs for our customers. We negotiate annual contracts that establish the predetermined rates we agree to 
pay the ocean carriers. The rates are negotiated based on expected volumes from our customers in specific trade lanes. These 
contracts are often amended throughout the year to reflect changes in market conditions for our business, such as additional 
trade lanes.

We operate both as a consolidator and as a transactional IAC in the United States and internationally. We select air carriers and 
provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments. We execute our air freight services through our relationships with air 
carriers, through charter services, block space agreements, capacity space agreements, and transactional spot market 
negotiations. Through charter services, we contract part or all of an airplane to meet customer requirements. Our block space 
agreements and capacity space agreements are contracts for a defined time period. The contracts include fixed allocations for 
predetermined flights at agreed upon rates that are reviewed periodically throughout the year. The transactional negotiations 
afford us the ability to capture excess capacity at prevailing market rates for a specific shipment.

Competition

The transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete against a large number of logistics 
companies, trucking companies, property freight brokers, carriers offering logistics services, NVOCCs, IACs, and freight 
forwarders. We also buy from and sell transportation services to companies that compete with us.

In our sourcing business, we compete with produce brokers, produce growers, produce marketing companies, produce 
wholesalers, and foodservice buying groups. We also buy from and sell produce to companies that compete with us.

We often compete with respect to price, scope of services, or a combination thereof, but believe that our most significant 
competitive advantages are:

• 

• 

People: Smart, dedicated, empowered people act as an extension of our customers’ teams to innovate and execute their 
supply chain strategies;

Process: Proven processes and solutions combine strategy with practical experience for customized action plans that 
succeed in the real world;

•  Technology: Navisphere, our proprietary technology, provides flexibility, global visibility, customized solutions, easy 

integration, broad connectivity, and advanced security;

10

•  Network: Our customers gain local presence, regional expertise, and multiple global logistics options from one of the 

world’s largest providers of logistics services; 

•  Relationships: A large number of unique, strong relationships provide global connections and valuable market 

knowledge;

• 

• 

• 

Portfolio of Services: A wide selection of services and products help provide our customers with consistent capacity 
and service levels;

Scale: Our customers leverage our industry-leading capacity, broad procurement options, and substantial shipment 
volumes for better efficiency, service, and marketplace advantages; and

Stability: Our financial strength, discipline, and consistent track record of success for strategic support of our 
customers’ supply chains.

Seasonality

Historically, our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends with operating income and earnings lower in the first 
quarter than in the other three quarters. We believe this historical pattern has been the result of, or influenced by, numerous 
factors, including national holidays, weather patterns, consumer demand, economic conditions, and other similar and subtle 
forces. Although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of 
operations, we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future. Our 
results did not follow this pattern in 2017 due primarily to changing transportation costs and customer pricing during the 
second half of the year. 

Proprietary Information Technology and Intellectual Property

We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and nondisclosure and non-competition agreements to 
establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology. Additionally, we have numerous registered 
trademarks, trade names, and logos in the United States and international locations. 

Our information systems are essential to efficiently communicate, service our customers and contracted carriers, and manage 
our business. In 2017, we executed approximately 19 million shipments for more than 120,000 customers with more than 
73,000 contract carriers.

Our systems help our employees service customer orders, select the optimal mode of transportation, build and consolidate 
shipments, and identify appropriate carriers, all based on customer-specific service parameters. Our systems provide our 
organization with the necessary business intelligence to allow for near real time scorecards and necessary decision support in 
all areas of our business.

Our operations primarily use Navisphere, a single global platform that allows customers to communicate worldwide with 
parties in their supply chain across languages, currencies, and continents. Navisphere offers sophisticated business analytics to 
help improve supply chain performance and meet increasing customer demands.

The Navisphere Vision web-based product allows our customers to see all of their freight across all modes and services 
globally in a single view. Details of shipment contents, status of shipments based on milestones, disruptions to shipments and 
resulting estimated time of arrival adjustment using Artificial Intelligence are provided for the user to manage their supply 
chain exceptions. Collaboration, intelligent notifications, and performance score carding allow customers to manage their 
supply chain and identify inefficiencies. 

The Navisphere Carrier web-based platform provides contracted carriers additional access to our systems. Contract carriers can 
access available freight, perform online check calls, keep track of receivables, and upload scanned documentation. Many of our 
carriers’ favorite features from Navisphere Carrier are also available through our Navisphere Carrier mobile application 
available for Android and IOS mobile operating systems. 

The Navisphere Driver mobile application provides drivers with load status automation capabilities. Drivers can elect to allow 
the application to complete all stop updates and in-transit calls. Drivers can also capture and upload bill of lading 
documentation to initiate payment processes. The high fidelity track and trace capabilities give our systems and customers 
frequent load status information. 

11

Government Regulation

Our operations may be regulated and licensed by various federal, state, and local transportation agencies in the United States 
and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate. 

We are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the U.S. Department of 
Transportation (“DOT”) to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle. The DOT prescribes qualifications for 
acting in this capacity, including certain surety bonding requirements. We are also subject to regulation by the Federal Maritime 
Commission as an ocean freight forwarder and a NVOCC and we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each. We operate as 
a Department of Homeland Security certified IAC, providing air freight services, subject to commercial standards set forth by 
the International Air Transport Association and federal regulations issued by the Transportation Security Administration. We 
provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the Bureau of U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection. We also have and maintain other licenses as required by law.

Although Congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic 
regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight, some intrastate shipments for which we arrange transportation may be 
subject to additional licensing, registration, or permit requirements. We generally contractually require and/or rely on the carrier 
transporting the shipment to ensure compliance with these types of requirements. We, along with the contracted carriers that we 
rely on in arranging transportation services for our customers, are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and 
environmental regulations. Although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a 
materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past, there can be no assurance that such regulations or 
changes thereto will not adversely impact our operations in the future. Violation of these regulations could also subject us to 
fines, as well as increased claims liability.

We buy and sell fresh produce under licenses issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as required by the Perishable 
Agricultural Commodities Act. Other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and 
drug statutes and regulations. 

We are subject to a variety of other U.S. and foreign laws and regulations including, but not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act and other similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption statutes. 

Risk Management and Insurance

We contractually require all motor carriers we work with to carry at least $750,000 in automobile liability insurance and 
$25,000 in cargo insurance. We also require all motor carriers to maintain workers compensation and other insurance coverage 
as required by law. Most contacted carriers have insurance exceeding these minimum requirements. Railroads, which are 
generally self-insured, provide limited common carrier cargo loss or damage liability protection, generally up to $250,000 per 
shipment.

As a property freight broker, we are not legally liable for loss or damage to our customers’ cargo. In our customer contracts, we 
may agree to assume cargo liability up to a stated maximum. We typically do not assume cargo liability to our customers above 
minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding, ocean transportation, or air freight businesses on 
international or domestic air shipments. With regards to international freight forwarding, ocean transportation, international 
domestic air freight shipments, and shipments transacted by Freightquote, we offer our customers the option to purchase 
shippers’ interest coverage to insure goods in transit. When we agree to store goods for our customers for longer terms, we 
provide limited warehouseman’s coverage to our customers and typically contract for warehousing services from companies 
that provide us the same degree of coverage.

We maintain a broad cargo liability insurance policy to help protect us against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered 
from the responsible contracted carrier. We also carry various liability insurance policies, including automobile and general 
liability, with a $200 million umbrella. Our contingent automobile liability coverage has a retention of $5 million per incident.

As a seller of produce, we may, under certain circumstances, have legal responsibility arising from produce sales. We carry 
product liability coverage under our general liability and umbrella policies to cover tort claims. The deductible on our general 
liability coverage is $250,000 per incident. In addition, in the event of a recall, we may be required to bear the costs of 
repurchasing, transporting, and destroying any allegedly contaminated product, as well as potential consequential damages 
which were generally not insured. We carry product recall insurance coverage of $50 million. This policy has a retention of $5 
million per incident.

our historical experience or our present expectations, including, but not limited to, such factors such as changes in economic 
conditions, including uncertain consumer demand; changes in market demand and pressures on the pricing for our services; 
competition and growth rates within the third party logistics industry; freight levels and increasing costs and availability of 
truck capacity or alternative means of transporting freight; changes in relationships with existing contracted truck, rail, ocean, 
and air carriers; changes in our customer base due to possible consolidation among our customers; our ability to successfully 
integrate the operations of acquired companies with our historic operations; risks associated with litigation, including 
contingent auto liability and insurance coverage; risks associated with operations outside of the U.S.; risks associated with the 
potential impact of changes in government regulations; risks associated with the produce industry, including food safety and 
contamination issues; fuel price increases or decreases, or fuel shortages; cyber-security related risks; the impact of war on the 
economy; changes to our capital structure, and other risks and uncertainties, including those described below. Forward-looking 
statements speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update these statements in light of 
subsequent events or developments.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

The following are important factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause actual results for future periods 
to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations, including those expressed in any forward-looking 
statements made in this 10-K. We may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause actual results to differ from 
those expressed in other forward-looking statements, including those made in oral presentations such as telephone conferences 
and webcasts open to the public.

Economic recessions could have a significant, adverse impact on our business. The transportation industry historically has 
experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession, downturns in business cycles of our customers, 
interest rate fluctuations, and other economic factors beyond our control. Deterioration in the economic environment subjects 
our business to various risks, which may have a material and adverse impact on our operating results and cause us to not reach 
our long-term growth goals:

•  Decrease in volumes: A reduction in overall freight volumes in the marketplace reduces our opportunities for 

growth. A significant portion of our freight is transactional or “spot” market opportunities. The transactional market 
may be more impacted than the freight market by overall economic conditions. In addition, if a downturn in our 
customers’ business cycles causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers, particularly among 
certain national retailers or in the food, beverage, retail, manufacturing, paper, or printing industries, our operating 
results could be adversely affected.

•  Credit risk and working capital: Some of our customers may face economic difficulties and may not be able to pay us, 

and some may go out of business. In addition, some customers may not pay us as quickly as they have in the past, 
causing our working capital needs to increase.

•  Transportation provider failures: A significant number of our transportation providers may go out of business and we 

may be unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our 
customers.

•  Expense management: We may not be able to appropriately adjust our expenses to changing market demands. 

Personnel expenses are our largest expense. In order to maintain high variability in our business model, it is necessary 
to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands. In periods of rapid change, it is more difficult to match our 
staffing levels to our business needs. In addition, we have other expenses that are fixed for a period of time, and we 
may not be able to adequately adjust them in a period of rapid change in market demand.

Higher carrier prices may result in decreased net revenue margin. Carriers can be expected to charge higher prices if 
market conditions warrant, or to cover higher operating expenses. Our net revenues and income from operations may decrease 
if we are unable to increase our pricing to our customers. Increased demand for truckload services and changes in regulations 
may reduce available capacity and increase carrier pricing. In some instances where we have entered into contract freight rates 
with customers, in the event market conditions change and those contracted rates are below market rates, we may be required to 
provide transportation services at a revenue loss. 

Changing fuel costs and interruptions of fuel supplies may have an impact on our net revenue margins. In our truckload 
transportation business, which is the largest source of our net revenues, fluctuating fuel prices may result in decreased net 
revenue margin. While our different pricing arrangements with customers and contracted carriers make it very difficult to 
measure the precise impact, we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a pass-through cost to our truckload business. In times 
of fluctuating fuel prices, our net revenue margin may also fluctuate.

14

Our dependence on third parties to provide equipment and services may impact the delivery and quality of our 
transportation and logistics services. We do not employ the people directly involved in delivering our customers’ freight. We 
depend on independent third parties to provide truck, rail, ocean, and air services and to report certain events to us, including 
delivery information and freight claims. These independent third parties may not fulfill their obligations to us, preventing us 
from meeting our commitments to our customers. This reliance also could cause delays in reporting certain events, including 
recognizing revenue and claims. In addition, if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services 
from third parties to meet our commitments to our customers, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected, 
and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently. Many of these risks are beyond our control, 
including:

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

equipment shortages in the transportation industry, particularly among contracted truckload carriers;

changes in regulations impacting transportation;

disruption in the supply or cost of fuel;

reduction or deterioration in rail service; and 

unanticipated changes in transportation rates.

We are subject to negative impacts of changes in political and governmental conditions. Our operations are subject to the 
influences of significant political, governmental, and similar changes and our ability to respond to them, including:

• 

• 

changes in political conditions and in governmental policies;

changes in and compliance with international and domestic laws and regulations; and

•  wars, civil unrest, acts of terrorism, and other conflicts.

We may be subject to negative impacts of catastrophic events. A disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the 
event of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, heightened security measures, actual or threatened, terrorist attack, 
strike, civil unrest, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in providing services or performing other critical 
functions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information systems 
could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and adversely impact our operating results.

Our international operations subject us to operational and financial risks. We provide services within and between foreign 
countries on an increasing basis. Our business outside of the United States is subject to various risks, including:

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

changes in tariffs, trade restrictions, trade agreements, and taxations;

difficulties in managing or overseeing foreign operations and agents;

limitations on the repatriation of funds because of foreign exchange controls;

different liability standards; and

intellectual property laws of countries that do not protect our rights in our intellectual property, including, but not 
limited to, our proprietary information systems, to the same extent as the laws of the United States.

The occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region and/or decrease 
the profitability of our operations in that region.

As we continue to expand our business internationally, we expose the company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency 
fluctuations and exchange controls, as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles. Foreign currency fluctuations could 
result in currency translation exchange gains or losses or could affect the book value of our assets and liabilities. Furthermore, 
we may experience unanticipated changes to our income tax liabilities resulting from changes in geographical income mix and 
changing international tax legislation. We have limited control over these risks, and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in 
international economic and political conditions, we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects.

15

Our ability to appropriately staff and retain employees is important to our variable cost model. Our continued success 
depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespeople and other logistics professionals. In order 
to maintain high variability in our business model, it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands. In 
periods of rapid change, it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs. We cannot guarantee that we will 
be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel. Because of our comprehensive employee 
training program, our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors. Continued success depends in large 
part on our ability to develop successful employees into managers.

We face substantial industry competition. Competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broad-based. We 
compete against traditional and non-traditional logistics companies, including transportation providers that own equipment, 
third party freight brokers, technology matching services, internet freight brokers, carriers offering logistics services, and on-
demand transportation service providers. We also compete against carriers’ internal sales forces. In addition, customers can 
bring in-house some of the services we provide to them. We often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our 
competitors. Increased competition could reduce our market opportunity and create downward pressure on freight rates, and 
continued rate pressure may adversely affect our net revenue and income from operations. In some instances where we have 
entered into contract freight rates with customers, in the event market conditions change and those contracted rates are below 
market rates, we may be required to provide transportation services at a revenue loss.

We rely on technology to operate our business. We have internally developed the majority of our operating systems. Our 
continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers and 
users. We rely on our technology staff and vendors to successfully implement changes to and maintain our operating systems in 
an efficient manner. If we fail to maintain and enhance our operating systems, we may be at a competitive disadvantage and 
lose customers.  

As demonstrated by recent material and high-profile data security breaches, computer malware, viruses, and computer hacking 
and phishing attacks have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in 
the future. Previous attacks on our systems have not had a material financial impact on our operations, but we cannot guarantee 
that future attacks will have little to no impact on our business. Furthermore, given the interconnected nature of the supply 
chain and our significant presence in the industry, we believe that we may be an attractive target for such attacks. 

Though it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack, a significant 
impact on the performance, reliability, security, and availability of our systems and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of 
our users may harm our reputation, impair our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers, and expose us to 
legal claims and government action, each of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of 
operations, and growth prospects. 

Because we manage our business on a decentralized basis, our operations may be materially adversely affected by 
inconsistent management practices. We manage our business on a decentralized basis through a network of offices 
throughout North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and South America, supported by executives and shared and 
centralized services, with local management responsible for day-to-day operations, profitability, personnel decisions, the 
growth of the business, and adherence to applicable local laws. Our decentralized operating strategy can make it difficult for us 
to implement strategic decisions and coordinated procedures throughout our global operations. In addition, some of our offices 
operate with management, sales, and support personnel that may be insufficient to support growth in their respective location 
without significant central oversight and coordination. Our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent 
management practices and materially and adversely affect our overall profitability and expose us to litigation.

Our earnings may be affected by seasonal changes in the transportation industry. Results of operations for our industry 
generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season. Historically, 
operating income and earnings are lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters. We believe this historical pattern 
has been the result of, or influenced by, numerous factors, including national holidays, weather patterns, consumer demand, 
economic conditions, and other similar and subtle forces. Although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had 
a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations, we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it 
will not adversely impact us in the future. Our results did not follow this pattern in 2017 due primarily to changing 
transportation costs and customer pricing in the second half of the year. 

16

We are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations. We use the services of thousands of transportation 
companies in connection with our transportation operations. From time to time, the drivers employed and engaged by the 
carriers we contract with are involved in accidents, which may result in serious personal injuries. The resulting types and/or 
amounts of damages may be excluded by or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the contracted carrier. 
Although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees, owner-operators, or independent 
contractors working for carriers, from time to time, claims may be asserted against us for their actions, or for our actions in 
retaining them. Claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage, or may not be covered by insurance at all. 
In addition, our automobile liability policy has a retention of $5 million per incident. A material increase in the frequency or 
severity of accidents, liability claims or workers’ compensation claims, or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially 
and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase 
insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability. Our involvement in the transportation of certain goods, 
including but not limited to hazardous materials, could also increase our exposure in the event one of our contracted carriers is 
involved in an accident resulting in injuries or contamination.

Our sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce. The supply and price of fresh produce is 
affected by weather and growing conditions (such as drought, insects, and disease) and other conditions over which we have no 
control. Commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile. If we are unable to 
secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers, our operating results could be materially and adversely 
affected, and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently. To assure access to certain 
commodities, we occasionally make monetary advances to growers to finance their operations. Repayment of these advances is 
dependent upon the growers’ ability to grow and harvest marketable crops.

Buying and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability. Agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce 
are subject to various approvals, and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination. 
Product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination, 
often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce. We may face claims for a variety of damages 
arising from the sale of produce, which may include potentially uninsured consequential damages. While we are insured for up 
to $201 million for product liability claims subject to a $250,000 per incident deductible, settlement of class action claims is 
often costly, and we cannot guarantee that our liability coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available. If we have 
to recall produce, we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing, transporting, and destroying any allegedly contaminated 
product, as well as consequential damages. We carry product recall insurance coverage of $50 million. This policy has a 
retention of $5 million per incident. Any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation, particularly of our 
proprietary and/or licensed branded produce programs. Loss due to spoilage (including the need for disposal) is also a routine 
part of the sourcing business.

Our business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations. Our operations may be regulated and 
licensed by various federal, state, and local transportation agencies in the United States and similar governmental agencies in 
foreign countries in which we operate. 

We are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the DOT to arrange for the 
transportation of property by motor vehicle. The DOT prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity, including certain 
surety bonding requirements. We are also subject to regulation by the Federal Maritime Commission as an ocean freight 
forwarder and a NVOCC, and we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each. We operate as a Department of Homeland 
Security certified IAC, providing air freight services, subject to commercial standards set forth by the International Air 
Transport Association and federal regulations issued by the Transportation Security Administration. We provide customs 
brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the Bureau of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. We also 
have and maintain other licenses as required by law.

We source fresh produce under a license issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. We are also subject to various 
regulations and requirements promulgated by other international, domestic, state, and local agencies and port authorities. Our 
failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to entities holding these licenses could materially and adversely 
affect our results of operations or financial condition.

17

Legislative or regulatory changes can affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating 
practices or influencing the demand for, and the cost of providing, transportation services. As part of our logistics services, we 
operate leased warehouse facilities. Our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services, and 
we are subject to various federal, state, and international environmental, work safety, and hazardous materials regulations. We 
may experience an increase in operating costs, such as security costs, as a result of governmental regulations that have been and 
will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities. No assurances can be given that we will be 
able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges, and our operations and 
profitability may suffer as a result. 

Department of Homeland Security regulations applicable to our customers who import goods into the United States and our 
contracted ocean carriers can impact our ability to provide and/or receive services with and from these parties. Enforcement 
measures related to violations of these regulations can slow and/or prevent the delivery of shipments, which may negatively 
impact our operations.

We cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business. Our failure to maintain required permits or 
licenses, or to comply with applicable regulations, could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and 
licenses.

Our contract carriers are subject to increasingly stringent laws protecting the environment, including those relating to 
climate change, which could directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on our business. Future and existing 
environmental regulatory requirements in the U.S. and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating 
expenses, which in turn could increase our purchased transportation costs. If we are unable to pass such costs along to our 
customers, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Even without any new legislation or regulation, increased 
public concern regarding greenhouse gases emitted by transportation carriers could harm the reputations of companies 
operating in the transportation logistics industries and shift consumer demand toward more locally sourced products and away 
from our services. 

We derive a significant portion of our total revenues and net revenues from our largest customers. Our top 100 customers 
comprise approximately 35 percent of our consolidated total revenues and 23 percent of consolidated net revenues. Our largest 
customer comprises approximately two percent of our consolidated total revenues. The sudden loss of many of our major 
clients could materially and adversely affect our operating results.

We may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments. We may acquire or make investments in 
complementary businesses, products, services, or technologies. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable 
acquisitions or investment candidates. Even if we identify suitable candidates, we cannot guarantee that we will make 
acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. The timing and number of acquisitions we pursue may 
also cause volatility in our financial results. In addition, we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for 
future acquisitions or investments. The issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholders.

We may have difficulties integrating acquired companies. For acquisitions, success depends upon efficiently integrating the 
acquired business into our existing operations. These risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple 
acquisitions within a short period of time. We are required to integrate these businesses into our internal control environment, 
which may present challenges that are different than those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult to manage. If 
we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost 
savings, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially and adversely 
affected.

Our growth and profitability may not continue, which may result in a decrease in our stock price. Our long-term growth 
objective is to grow earnings per share by 10 percent. Long-term growth targets represent an over time perspective and do not 
necessarily represent an expected annual growth rate. There can be no assurance that our long-term growth objective will be 
achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management, administrative, and operational systems to respond to any 
future growth. Future changes in and expansion of our business, or changes in economic or political conditions, could adversely 
affect our operating margins. Slower or less profitable growth or losses could adversely affect our stock price.

PROPERTIES

Our corporate headquarters is in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. The total square footage of our four buildings in Eden Prairie is 
357,000. This total includes approximately 221,000 square feet used for our corporate and shared services, our data center of 
approximately 18,000 square feet, and 118,000 square feet used for office operations. 

Most of our offices are leased from third parties under leases with initial terms ranging from three to fifteen years. Our office 
locations range in space from 1,000 to 208,000 square feet. Because we are a global enterprise characterized by substantial 
intersegment cooperation, properties are often used by multiple business segments. The following table lists our office locations

expire. We have entered into a lease for a building to be built in Chicago, Illinois, with a substantial completion date in 2018. 
The lease of approximately 200,000 square feet will replace certain current space in Chicago that we own.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are not subject to any pending or threatened litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of our 
business operations. For some legal proceedings, we have accrued an amount that reflects the aggregate liability deemed 
probable and estimable, but this amount is not material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash 
flows. Because of the preliminary nature of many of these proceedings, the difficulty in ascertaining the applicable facts 
relating to many of these proceedings, the inconsistent treatment of claims made in many of these proceedings, and the 
difficulty of predicting the settlement value of many of these proceedings, we are not able to estimate an amount or range of 
any reasonably possible additional losses. However, based upon our historical experience, the resolution of these proceedings is 
not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND
ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our common stock began trading on The NASDAQ National Market under the symbol “CHRW” on October 15, 1997, and 
currently trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

Quarterly market information can be found in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 12.

On February 22, 2018, the closing sales price per share of our common stock as quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market 
was $90.09 per share. On February 22, 2018, there were approximately 140 holders of record and approximately 79,442 
beneficial owners of our common stock.

We declared quarterly dividends during 2016 aggregating to $1.74 per share and quarterly dividends during 2017 aggregating 
to $1.81 per share. We have declared a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share payable to shareholders of record as of March 2, 
2018, payable on March 30, 2018. Our declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. Any 
determination as to the payment of dividends will depend upon our results of operations, capital requirements and financial 
condition, and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the 
Board of Directors will declare or continue to pay dividends on the shares of common stock in the future.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

Our company. We are a global provider of transportation services and logistics solutions, operating through a network of 
offices in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and South America. As a third party logistics provider, we 
enter into contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies, and utilize those relationships to efficiently 
and cost effectively transport our customers’ freight. We have contractual relationships with approximately 73,000 active 
transportation companies in 2017, including motor carriers, railroads (primarily intermodal service providers), air freight, and 
ocean carriers. Depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements, we select and hire the appropriate 
transportation for each shipment. Our model enables us to be flexible and provide solutions that optimize service for our 
customers.

In addition to transportation and logistics services, we also provide sourcing services. Our sourcing business consists of buying, 
selling, and marketing fresh produce. We purchase fresh produce through our network of produce suppliers and sell it to 
grocery retailers, restaurants, foodservice distributors, and produce wholesalers. In some cases, we also arrange the 
transportation of the produce we sell through our relationships with specialized transportation companies. Transportation 
revenues generated by Robinson Fresh are included in our transportation service line in the first two tables below, but are 
included in Robinson Fresh in the segment revenue table below. 

Our reportable segments are North American Surface Transportation (“NAST”), Global Forwarding, Robinson Fresh, and All 
Other and Corporate. The All Other and Corporate segment includes Managed Services, Other Surface Transportation outside 
of North America, and other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses. We group offices primarily by 
services they provide. For financial information concerning our reportable segments and geographic regions, refer to Note 9 of 
our consolidated financial statements. 

Our business model. We are primarily a service company. We add value and expertise in the procurement and execution of 
transportation and logistics, including sourcing of produce products for our customers. Our total revenues represent the total 
dollar value of services and goods we sell to our customers. Our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased 
transportation and related services, including contracted motor carrier, rail, ocean, air, and other costs, and the purchase price 
and services related to the products we source. Our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source, add value, 
and sell services and products that are provided by third parties, and we consider them to be our primary performance 
measurement. Accordingly, the discussion of our results of operations below focuses on the changes in our net revenues.

We keep our business model as variable as possible to allow us to be flexible and adapt to changing economic and industry 
conditions. We sell transportation services and produce to our customers with varied pricing arrangements. Some prices are 
committed to for a period of time, subject to certain terms and conditions, and some prices are set on a spot market basis. We 
buy most of our truckload transportation capacity and produce on a spot market basis. Because of this, our net revenue per 
transaction tends to increase in times when there is excess supply and decrease in times when demand is strong relative to 
supply. 

In 2017, changing market conditions continued to impact our results. We had volume increases in all of our service lines, and 
experienced pricing and cost increases in nearly all of our service lines, which negatively impacted our margins. Truckload 
margin compression was a challenge to our earnings per share during much of the year. In August 2017, we acquired Milgram 
& Company Ltd. (“Milgram”), a provider of freight forwarding, customs brokerage, and surface transportation primarily in 
Canada. Milgram operates primarily in our Global Forwarding segment. 

In 2016, changing market conditions impacted our results. We had volume increases in nearly all of our service lines, but also 
experienced pricing declines, which impacted our net revenue margins. Truckload margin compression was a challenge to our 
earnings per share during the second half of the year. In September 2016, we completed the acquisition of APC Logistics 
(“APC”), a privately held company based in Australia, for the purpose of expanding our global presence and bringing 
additional capabilities and expertise to our portfolio. APC provides international freight forwarding and customs brokerage 
services in Australia and New Zealand. APC operates in our Global Forwarding segment. 

Fuel prices declined throughout 2015, which contributed to slower growth of our total revenues and an increase in our 
transportation net revenue margins. In 2015, we completed the acquisition of Freightquote.com, Inc. (“Freightquote”), a 
privately held freight broker based in Kansas City, Missouri. Freightquote provides services throughout North America. The 
acquisition enhances and brings synergies to our LTL and truckload businesses, and expands our ecommerce capabilities. 
Freightquote operates in our NAST segment.

We keep our personnel and other operating expenses as variable as possible. Compensation is tied to productivity and 
performance. Each office is responsible for its hiring and headcount decisions, based on the needs of their office and to balance 
personnel resources with business requirements. This helps keep our personnel expense as variable as possible with the 
business.

Our office network. Our office network is a competitive advantage. Building local customer and contract carrier relationships 
has been an important part of our success, and our worldwide network of offices supports our core strategy of serving 
customers locally, nationally, and globally. Our network of offices helps us penetrate local markets, provides face-to-face 
service when needed, and enables us to recruit contract carriers. Our network also gives us knowledge of local market 
conditions, which is important in the transportation industry because it is market driven and very dynamic. 

Our people. Because we are a service company, our continued success is dependent on our ability to continue to hire and retain 
talented, productive people, and to properly align our headcount and personnel expense with our business. Our headcount 
increased by 949 employees during 2017, which includes approximately 325 employees added as a result of the Milgram 
acquisition. Compensation programs are performance-based and cash incentives are directly tied to productivity and 
performance. Most network management compensation is dependent on the profitability of their particular office. We believe 
this makes our employees more service-oriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivity. All of our 
managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we 
believe these awards are an effective tool for creating long-term ownership and alignment between employees and our 
shareholders. 

Our customers. In 2017, we worked with more than 120,000 customers. We work with a wide variety of companies, ranging in 
size from Fortune 100 companies to small family businesses, in many different industries. Our customer base is very diverse 
and unconcentrated. In 2017, our top 100 customers represented approximately 35 percent of our total revenues and 
approximately 23 percent of our net revenues. Our largest customer was approximately two percent of our total revenues.

Our contracted carriers. Our contracted carrier base includes motor carriers, railroads (primarily intermodal service 
providers), air freight, and ocean carriers. In 2017, we worked with approximately 73,000 transportation providers worldwide, 
up from approximately 71,000 in 2016. Motor carriers with fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 82 percent of our 
truckload shipments in 2017. In our transportation business, no single contracted carrier represents more than approximately 
two percent of our contracted carrier capacity.

2017 COMPARED TO 2016

Total revenues and direct costs. Total transportation revenues increased 15.4 percent to $13.5 billion in 2017 from 
$11.7 billion in 2016. This increase in transportation revenues was driven by volume increases in all of our transportation 
services and increased customer pricing in most services. Total purchased transportation and related services increased 17.9 
percent in 2017 to $11.3 billion from $9.5 billion in 2016. This increase was due to increased transportation costs and higher 
volumes in nearly all of our transportation services. Total sourcing revenues decreased 5.1 percent to $1.37 billion in 2017 from 
$1.44 billion in 2016. Purchased products sourced for resale decreased 5.5 percent in 2017 to $1.2 billion from $1.3 billion in 
2016. These decreases were primarily due to lower market pricing and change in service mix. 

Net revenues. Total transportation net revenues increased 4.2 percent in 2017 to $2.25 billion from $2.15 billion in 2016. Our 
transportation net revenue margin decreased to 16.6 percent in 2017 from 18.4 percent in 2016. This decrease in net revenue 
margin was driven by increases in transportation costs, including fuel. Total sourcing net revenues decreased 0.2 percent to 
$122.4 million in 2017 from $122.7 million in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net revenue per case, 
partially offset by a case volume increase across a variety of commodities and services. Sourcing net revenue margin increased 
to 9.0 percent in 2017 from 8.5 percent in 2016. 

Operating expenses. Operating expenses consist of personnel and selling, general, and administrative expenses. Operating 
expenses increased 10.6 percent to $1.6 billion in 2017 from $1.4 billion in 2016. This was due to an increase of 10.8 percent in 
personnel expenses and an increase of 10.2 percent in other selling, general, and administrative expenses. As a percentage of 
net revenues, operating expenses increased to 67.3 percent in 2017 from 63.2 percent in 2016.

Our personnel expenses are driven primarily by headcount and earnings growth. In 2017, personnel expenses increased 10.8 
percent to $1.2 billion from $1.1 billion in 2016. Personnel expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased in 2017 to 49.8 
percent from 46.8 percent in 2016. The increase in personnel expense was due primarily to growth in our average headcount of 
7.4 percent in 2017 compared to 2016 and increases in expenses related to incentive plans that are designed to keep expenses 
variable with changes in net revenues and profitability. 

27

Other selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 10.2 percent to $413.4 million in 2017 from $375.1 million in 
2016. This increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in acquisition amortization, 
warehousing and occupancy expenses, and the provision for bad debt, partially offset by a decrease in travel expenses and 
claims.

Income from operations. Income from operations decreased 7.5 percent to $775.1 million in 2017 from $837.5 million in 
2016. Income from operations as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 32.7 percent in 2017 from 36.8 percent in 2016. 
This decrease was due to our operating expenses growing more than our net revenues and a decline in transportation net 
revenue margin.

Interest and other expense. Interest and other expense was $46.7 million in 2017 compared to $25.6 million in 2016. The 
increase was primarily due to a higher average debt balance and higher interest rates in 2017 compared to 2016. 

Provision for income taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 30.7 percent for 2017 and 36.8 percent for 2016. During the 
fourth quarter of 2017, the provision for income taxes decreased by $19.7 million due to the benefit of deductions under 
Section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code and $12.1 million due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), 
which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The $12.1 million benefit resulting from the Tax Act was primarily the result 
of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the decrease in the corporate Federal income tax rate from 35 
percent to 21 percent and was partially offset by the impact of certain transition taxes and other impacts of the Tax Act.

During the first quarter of 2017, we adopted ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718). The adoption of 
ASU 2016-09 prospectively impacts the recording of income taxes related to share-based payment awards in our consolidated 
financial position and results of operations, as well as the operating and financing cash flows on the consolidated statements of 
cash flows. This adoption resulted in a net tax benefit of $13.7 million during the year.

During the first quarter of 2016, we asserted that we will indefinitely reinvest earnings of foreign subsidiaries to support 
expansion of our international businesses. During 2017, our indefinite reinvestment strategy with respect to unremitted earnings 
of our foreign subsidiaries, provided an approximate $3.7 million benefit to our provision for income taxes. If we repatriated all 
foreign earnings, the estimated effect on income taxes payable would be an increase of approximately $12.1 million as of 
December 31, 2017.

Net income. Net income decreased 1.7 percent to $504.9 million in 2017 from $513.4 million in 2016. Basic net income per 
share decreased 0.3 percent to $3.59 in 2017 from $3.60 in 2016. Diluted net income per share decreased 0.6 percent to $3.57 
in 2017 from $3.59 in 2016. 

SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-2017 COMPARED TO 2016

North American Surface Transportation. NAST revenues increased 11.3 percent to $9.7 billion in 2017 compared to 
$8.7 billion in 2016. This was primarily due to increased volumes and increased pricing to our customers. NAST cost of 
purchased transportation and related services increased 13.7 percent to $8.2 billion in 2017 from $7.2 billion in 2016. This 
increase was primarily due to increased volumes and higher transportation costs. Total NAST net revenues were flat at 
$1.5 billion in 2017. This was driven by a decline in truckload and intermodal net revenues, partially offset by an increase in 
LTL net revenues. NAST net revenue margin decreased primarily due to transportation costs growing faster than customer 
pricing in 2017 compared to 2016.

NAST truckload net revenues decreased 1.8 percent in 2017 to $1.09 billion from $1.11 billion in 2016. NAST truckload 
volumes increased approximately 4.5 percent in 2017 compared to 2016. NAST truckload net revenue margin decreased in 
2017 compared to 2016, due primarily to increased transportation costs.

NAST truckload net revenues accounted for approximately 93 percent of our total North America truckload net revenues in 
2017 and approximately 92 percent in 2016. The majority of the remaining North American truckload net revenues is included 
in Robinson Fresh. Excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel prices, our average North America truckload rate per 
mile charged to our customers increased approximately 4.5 percent in 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the estimated impacts 
of the change in fuel prices, our average North America truckload transportation cost per mile increased approximately 6.5 
percent in 2017 compared to 2016.

NAST LTL net revenues increased 6.2 percent in 2017 to $388.8 million from $366.1 million in 2016. NAST LTL volumes 
increased approximately eight percent in 2017 compared to 2016 and net revenue margin decreased. NAST LTL net revenue 
margin decreased due to increased transportation costs.

28

NAST intermodal net revenues decreased 14.6 percent to $26.7 million in 2017 from $31.3 million in 2016. This was primarily 
due to declines in net revenue margin, partially offset by increased volumes with our lower-margin contractual customers, 
partially offset by a decrease in transactional business.

NAST operating expenses increased 5.5 percent in 2017 to $897.0 million from $849.9 million in 2016. This was due to an 
increase in personnel expenses related to incentive plans that are designed to keep expenses variable with changes in net 
revenues and profitability, and an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses. The operating expenses of NAST 
and all other segments include allocated corporate expenses. 

NAST operating income decreased 6.9 percent to $628.1 million in 2017 from $674.4 million in 2016. This was primarily due 
to increases in operating expenses, while net revenues remained flat.

Global Forwarding. Global Forwarding revenues increased 36.0 percent to $2.1 billion in 2017 from $1.6 billion in 2016. This 
increase was primarily related to increased volumes in all services and increased customer pricing. Global Forwarding costs of 
transportation and related services increased 40.7 percent to $1.7 billion in 2017 from $1.2 billion in 2016. Global Forwarding 
net revenues increased 22.1 percent to $485.3 million in 2017 from $397.5 million in 2016. Global Forwarding net revenue 
margin decreased due to transportation costs increasing at a faster rate than customer pricing. The acquisitions of APC and 
Milgram accounted for approximately eight percentage points of the net revenue growth in Global Forwarding.

Ocean transportation net revenues increased 19.1 percent to $290.8 million in 2017 from $244.2 million in 2016. This was 
primarily due to increases in volumes, including those from acquisitions. Air net revenues increased 24.1 percent to 
$94.5 million in 2017 from $76.1 million in 2016. This was primarily due to increases in volumes partially offset by cost 
increases. Customs net revenues increased 40.5 percent to $70.9 million in 2017 from $50.5 million in 2016. The increase was 
primarily due to increased transaction volumes, including those from acquisitions.

Global Forwarding operating expenses increased 24.3 percent in 2017 to $393.4 million from $316.6 million in 2016. This 
increase was due to increases in both personnel and selling, general, and administrative expenses. The personnel expense 
increase was driven by an average headcount increase of 17.3 percent, primarily due to the additions of APC and Milgram. The 
selling, general, and administrative expense increase was also primarily driven by the additions of APC and Milgram. 

Global Forwarding operating income increased 13.5 percent in 2017 to $91.8 million from $80.9 million in 2016. This was 
primarily due to an increase in net revenues driven by increased volumes and customer pricing, partially offset by increased 
operating expenses.

Robinson Fresh. Robinson Fresh revenues increased 3.1 percent to $2.4 billion in 2017 from $2.3 billion in 2016. Robinson 
Fresh costs of transportation and related services and purchased products sourced for resale increased 3.8 percent to $2.2 billion 
in 2017 from $2.1 billion in 2016. Robinson Fresh net revenues decreased 3.7 percent to $226.1 million in 2017 from 
$234.8 million in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to declines in transportation net revenues. 

Robinson Fresh sourcing net revenues decreased 0.2 percent to $122.4 million in 2017 from $122.7 million in 2016. This 
decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net revenue per case, partially offset by a one percent case volume increase. 
Robinson Fresh net revenues from transportation services decreased 7.5 percent to $103.6 million in 2017 from $112.1 million 
in 2016. This decrease was driven by a decline in truckload net revenues, partially offset by an increase in other transportation 
net revenues. Robinson Fresh transportation net revenue margin decreased in 2017 compared to 2016, due primarily to 
increased costs of transportation. 

Robinson Fresh operating expenses increased 8.6 percent to $172.7 million in 2017 from $159.0 million in 2016. This was due 
to increases in both selling, general and administrative and personnel expenses. The increase in selling, general, and 
administrative expenses was due to higher warehousing and claims expenses in 2017 compared to 2016. In 2017, personnel 
expenses increased primarily due to an increase in salaries and an increase in average headcount of 1.6 percent in 2017 
compared to 2016.

Robinson Fresh operating income decreased 29.5 percent to $53.4 million in 2017 from $75.8 million in 2016. This was 
primarily due to an increase in operating expenses and a decrease in net revenues.

All Other and Corporate. All Other and Corporate includes our Managed Services segment, as well as Other Surface 
Transportation outside of North America and other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses. Managed 
Services provides Transportation Management Services, or Managed TMS®. Other Surface Transportation revenues are 
primarily earned by Europe Surface Transportation. Europe Surface Transportation provides services similar to NAST across 
Europe. 

29

Managed Services net revenues increased 11.5 percent to $72.2 million in 2017 from $64.7 million in 2016. This increase was 
primarily due to volume growth with new and existing customers. Other Surface Transportation net revenues increased 5.9 
percent to $59.5 million in 2017 from $56.1 million in 2016. This increase is primarily the result of volume growth, partially 
offset by margin compression in the surface transportation business in Europe. 

2016 COMPARED TO 2015

Total revenues and direct costs. Total transportation revenues decreased 2.4 percent to $11.7 billion in 2016 from 
$12.0 billion in 2015. This decrease in transportation revenues was driven by lower customer pricing in truckload, partially 
offset by volume increases in nearly all of our transportation services. Total purchased transportation and related services 
decreased 3.0 percent in 2016 to $9.5 billion from $9.8 billion in 2015. This decrease was due to decreased transportation costs, 
partially offset by higher volumes in nearly all of our transportation services. Total sourcing revenues decreased 3.1 percent to 
$1.4 billion in 2016 from $1.5 billion in 2015. Purchased products sourced for resale decreased 3.5 percent in 2016 to 
$1.3 billion from $1.4 billion in 2015. These decreases were primarily due to lower market pricing and change in service mix. 

Net revenues. Total transportation net revenues increased 0.3 percent in 2016 to $2.2 billion from $2.1 billion in 2015. Our 
transportation net revenue margin increased to 18.4 percent in 2016 from 17.9 percent in 2015. This increase in net revenue 
margin was driven by decreases in transportation costs and customer pricing, including fuel. Total sourcing net revenues 
increased 1.4 percent to $122.7 million in 2016 from $121.0 million in 2015. This increase was primarily due to a case volume 
increase across a variety of commodities and services, partially offset by a decrease in net revenue per case. Sourcing net 
revenue margin increased to 8.5 percent in 2016 from 8.1 percent in 2015. 

Operating expenses. Operating expenses consist of personnel and selling, general, and administrative expenses. Operating 
expenses increased 2.1 percent to $1.44 billion in 2016 from $1.41 billion in 2015. This was due to an increase of 1.3 percent in 
personnel expenses and an increase of 4.5 percent in other selling, general, and administrative expenses. As a percentage of net 
revenues, operating expenses increased to 63.2 percent in 2016 from 62.2 percent in 2015.

Our personnel expenses are driven primarily by headcount and earnings growth. In 2016, personnel expenses increased 1.3 
percent to $1.06 billion from $1.05 billion in 2015. Personnel expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased in 2016 to 46.8 
percent from 46.3 percent in 2015. The increase in personnel expense was due primarily to an increase in average headcount 
growth of 6.0 percent in 2016, due in part to the acquisition of APC. The headcount growth was partially offset by decreases in 
personnel expenses related to incentive plans that are designed to keep expenses variable with changes in net revenues and 
profitability.

Other selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 4.5 percent to $375.1 million in 2016 from $358.8 million in 
2015. This increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in warehousing and travel 
expenses, partially offset by decreases in the provision for bad debt and occupancy expenses. 

Income from operations. Income from operations decreased 2.4 percent to $837.5 million in 2016 from $858.3 million in 
2015. Income from operations as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 36.8 percent in 2016 from 37.8 percent in 2015. 
This decrease was due to our operating expenses growing more than our net revenues.

Interest and other expense. Interest and other expense was $25.6 million in 2016 compared to $35.5 million in 2015. During 
the fourth quarter of 2015, we wrote off an indemnification asset of $7.2 million related to the acquisition of Phoenix as the 
indemnification obligations of the sellers expired. The impact of this write off was partially offset within the provision for 
income taxes by related tax liabilities that expired under applicable statute of limitations. 

Provision for income taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 36.8 percent for 2016 and 38.1 percent for 2015. During the 
first quarter of 2016, we asserted that we will indefinitely reinvest earnings of foreign subsidiaries to support expansion of our 
international businesses. During 2016, the assertion decreased deferred income taxes related to undistributed foreign earnings 
and reduced the effective tax rate compared to 2015. In 2016, our indefinite reinvestment strategy with respect to unremitted 
earnings of our foreign subsidiaries provided an approximate $5.1 million benefit to our provision for income taxes. If we 
repatriated all foreign earnings, the estimated effect on income taxes payable would be an increase of approximately 
$16.6 million as of December 31, 2016. Additionally, the effective income tax rate for both periods is greater than the statutory 
federal income tax rate, primarily due to state income taxes, net of federal benefit.

Net income. Net income increased 0.7 percent to $513.4 million in 2016 from $509.7 million in 2015. Basic net income per 
share increased 2.3 percent to $3.60 in 2016 from $3.52 in 2015. Diluted net income per share increased 2.3 percent to $3.59 in 
2016 from $3.51 in 2015.

SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-2016 COMPARED TO 2015

North American Surface Transportation. NAST total revenues decreased 2.6 percent to $8.7 billion in 2016 compared to 
$9.0 billion in 2015. This was primarily due to decreased pricing to our customers, partially offset by increased volumes. NAST 
cost of purchased transportation and related services decreased 2.6 percent to $7.2 billion in 2016 from $7.4 billion in 2015. 
This decrease was primarily due to lower transportation costs. Total NAST net revenues decreased 2.6 percent to $1.5 billion in 
2016 from $1.6 billion in 2015. The decrease was driven by a decline in truckload and intermodal net revenues, partially offset 
by an increase in LTL net revenues.

NAST truckload net revenues decreased 4.7 percent in 2016 to $1.1 billion from $1.2 billion in 2015. NAST truckload volumes 
increased approximately 5.5 percent in 2016 compared to 2015. NAST truckload net revenue margin decreased in 2016 
compared to 2015, due primarily to lower customer pricing.

NAST truckload net revenues accounted for approximately 92 percent of our total North America truckload net revenues in 
2016 and 2015. The majority of the remaining North American truckload net revenues is included in Robinson Fresh. 
Excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel prices, our average North America truckload rate per mile charged to our 
customers decreased approximately 5.0 percent in 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the estimated impacts of the change in 
fuel prices, our average North America truckload transportation cost per mile decreased approximately 4.5 percent in 2016 
compared to 2015.

NAST LTL net revenues increased 5.1 percent in 2016 to $366.1 million from $348.3 million in 2015. NAST LTL volumes 
increased approximately 7.5 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, and net revenue margin increased slightly. 

NAST intermodal net revenues decreased 20.1 percent to $31.3 million in 2016 from $39.2 million in 2015. This was primarily 
due to declines in net revenue margin and volumes. During 2016, intermodal opportunities were negatively impacted by the 
alternative lower-cost truck market.

NAST operating expenses increased 0.4 percent in 2016 to $849.9 million from $846.6 million in 2015. This was primarily due 
to increases in selling, general, and administrative expenses, partially offset by a decrease in personnel expenses related to 
incentive plans that are designed to keep expenses variable with changes in net revenues and profitability. The operating 
expenses of NAST and all other segments include allocated corporate expenses. 

NAST operating income decreased 6.1 percent to $674.4 million in 2016 from $718.3 million in 2015. This was primarily due 
to a decline in total revenues and net revenues caused by lower customer pricing. 

Global Forwarding. Global Forwarding total revenues decreased 4.0 percent to $1.57 billion in 2016 from $1.64 billion in 
2015. This decrease was primarily related to lower customer pricing across ocean and air services, partially offset by increased 
volumes in all services. Global Forwarding costs of transportation and related services decreased 7.6 percent to $1.2 billion in 
2016 from $1.3 billion in 2015. Global Forwarding net revenues increased 8.8 percent to $397.5 million in 2016 from $365.5 
million in 2015. Global Forwarding net revenue margin increased due to transportation costs declining at a faster rate than 
customer pricing. 

Ocean transportation net revenues increased 9.4 percent to $244.2 million in 2016 from $223.3 million in 2015. This was 
primarily due to increases in volumes. Air net revenues increased 3.9 percent to $76.1 million in 2016 from $73.3 million in 
2015. This was primarily due to increases in volumes offset by pricing declines. Customs net revenues increased 14.9 percent 
to $50.5 million in 2016 from $44.0 million in 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased transaction volumes.

Global Forwarding operating expenses increased 9.4 percent in 2016 to $316.6 million from $289.4 million in 2015. This 
increase was primarily due to an increase in claims expense, and the acquisition of APC on September 30, 2016.

Global Forwarding operating income increased 6.4 percent in 2016 to $80.9 million from $76.1 million in 2015. This was 
primarily due to an increase in net revenues driven by higher volumes, partially offset by increased operating expenses.  

Robinson Fresh. Robinson Fresh total revenues decreased 2.1 percent to $2.3 billion in 2016 from $2.4 billion in 2015. 
Robinson Fresh costs of transportation and related services and purchased products sourced for resale decreased 2.4 percent in 
to $2.1 billion in 2016 from $2.2 billion in 2015. Robinson Fresh net revenues decreased 0.2 percent to $234.8 million in 2016 
from $235.3 million in 2015. This decrease was due to declines in transportation net revenues, partially offset by an increase in 
sourcing net revenue. 

Robinson Fresh net revenues from sourcing services increased 1.4 percent to $122.7 million in 2016 from $121.0 million in 
2015. This increase was primarily due to a case volume increase across a variety of commodities and services, partially offset 
by a decrease in net revenue per case. Robinson Fresh net revenues from transportation services decreased 2.0 percent to 

31

$112.1 million in 2016 from $114.4 million in 2015. Robinson Fresh transportation net revenue margin decreased in 2016 
compared to 2015, due primarily to lower customer pricing. 

Robinson Fresh operating expenses increased 3.3 percent to $159.0 million in 2016 from $154.0 million in 2015. This increase 
was primarily due to an increase in warehousing expenses. In 2016, growth in Robinson Fresh headcount was offset by a 
decrease in variable compensation. 

Robinson Fresh operating income decreased 6.9 percent to $75.8 million in 2016 from $81.3 million in 2015. This was 
primarily due to a decrease in transportation services net revenues, and an increase in operating expenses. 

All Other and Corporate. All Other and Corporate includes our Managed Services segment, as well as Other Surface 
Transportation outside of North America and other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses. Managed 
Services provides Transportation Management Services, or Managed TMS. Other Surface Transportation revenues are 
primarily earned by Europe Surface Transportation. Europe Surface Transportation provides services similar to NAST across 
Europe. 

Managed Services net revenues increased 32.7 percent to $64.7 million in 2016 from $48.7 million in 2015. This increase was 
primarily due to volume growth with new and existing customers. Other Surface Transportation net revenues increased 3.9 
percent to $56.1 million in 2016 from $54.0 million in 2015, primarily the result of volume growth in Europe Surface 
Transportation. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We have historically generated substantial cash from operations, which has enabled us to fund our growth while paying cash 
dividends and repurchasing stock. In December 2014, we amended our revolving credit facility to increase the amount 
available from $500 million to $900 million, to extend the expiration date from October 2017 to December 2019, and to revise 
a covenant ratio. In 2013, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement to fund the accelerated share repurchase agreements to 
repurchase $500 million worth of our common stock. The Note Purchase Agreement was amended in February 2015 to 
conform its financial covenants to be consistent with the amended revolving credit facility. In April 2017, we entered into a 
$250 million U.S. Trade Accounts Receivable Securitization facility to reduce the amount outstanding on our revolving credit 
facility. We also expect to use the revolving credit facility, and potentially other indebtedness incurred in the future, to assist us 
in continuing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, possible acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases. Cash and 
cash equivalents totaled $333.9 million and $247.7 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. Cash and cash equivalents held 
outside the United States totaled $275.3 million and $172.2 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. Working capital at 
December 31, 2017, was $523.5 million. Working capital at December 31, 2016, was $162.4 million.

We prioritize our investments to grow the business, as we require some working capital and a relatively small amount of capital 
expenditures to grow. We are continually looking for acquisitions, but those acquisitions must fit our culture and enhance our 
growth opportunities. 

Cash flow from operating activities. We generated $384.0 million, $529.4 million, and $718.3 million of cash flow from 
operations in 2017, 2016, and 2015. The decrease of $145.4 million and in cash flow from operations in 2017 from 2016 is 
primarily the result of increased working capital driven by the impact of increased volumes and a deterioration of our accounts 
receivable aging. The decrease of $188.9 million in cash flow from operations in 2016 from 2015 is primarily the result of 
increases in accounts receivable, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable. The increases in accounts receivable and 
accounts payable are primarily the result of increased volumes. Additionally, accruals for variable compensation were lower in 
2016 compared to 2015.

Cash used for investing activities. We used $107.5 million, $313.0 million, and $54.4 million of cash for investing activities 
in 2017, 2016, and 2015. Our investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures and cash paid for acquisitions. In 
2017, we paid $47.3 million for the acquisition of Milgram. In 2016, we paid $220.2 million for the acquisition of APC. 

We used $57.9 million, $91.4 million, and $44.6 million of cash for capital expenditures in 2017, 2016, and 2015. We spent 
$29.0 million, $25.0 million, and $26.0 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015 primarily for annual investments in information 
technology equipment to support our operating systems, including the purchase and development of software. These 
information technology investments are intended to improve efficiencies and help grow the business. Additionally, in 2016, we 
completed construction of a second data recovery center. The cost of this data recovery center was $20.0 million, $19.3 million 
of which was spent in 2016. 

We anticipate capital expenditures in 2018 to be approximately $60 to $70 million. 

32

Cash used for financing activities. We used $202.1 million, $127.3 million, and $607.7 million of cash flow for financing 
activities in 2017, 2016, and 2015. 

We had net short-term repayments of $25.0 million in 2017 and net short-term borrowings of $290.0 million in 2016. The 
outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility was $715.0 million as of December 31, 2017. 

During 2017, we had long-term borrowings of $250.0 million on the Receivables Securitization Facility. The outstanding 
balance on the Receivables Securitization Facility was $250.0 million as of December 31, 2017. We were in compliance with 
all of the covenants under the Credit Agreement, Note Purchase Agreement, and Receivables Securitization Facility as of 
December 31, 2017.

We used $258.2 million, $245.4 million, and $235.6 million to pay cash dividends in 2017, 2016, and 2015. The increases were 
primarily the result of higher dividend rates, partially offset by fewer outstanding shares.

We used $21.6 million, $36.7 million, and $11.4 million for stock tendered for payment of withholding taxes in 2017, 2016, 
and 2015. 

We also used $185.5 million, $172.9 million, and $229.9 million on share repurchases in 2017, 2016, and 2015, as part of our 
Board approved repurchase program. In August 2013, the Board of Directors increased the number of shares authorized to be 
repurchased by 15,000,000 shares. As of December 31, 2017, there were 1,992,157 shares remaining for future repurchases. 
The number of shares we repurchase, if any, during future periods will vary based on our cash position, potential uses of our 
cash, and market conditions.

Assuming no change in our current business plan, management believes that our available cash, together with expected future 
cash generated from operations, the amount available under our credit facility, and credit available in the market, will be 
sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital, capital expenditures, and cash dividends for at least the next 12 
months. We also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit or other forms of indebtedness on short notice, if needed.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all majority-owned subsidiaries. The preparation of 
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to 
make estimates and assumptions. In certain circumstances, those estimates and assumptions can affect amounts reported in the 
accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes. In preparing our financial statements, we have made our 
best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. 
We do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting 
policies described below. However, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of 
assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. Note 1 of the Notes to 
consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the 
preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The following is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies and 
estimates.

Revenue recognition. Total revenues consist of the total dollar value of goods and services purchased from us by customers. 
Net revenues are total revenues less the direct costs of transportation, products, and handling. We act principally as the service 
provider for these transactions and recognize revenue as these services are rendered or goods are delivered. At that time, our 
obligations to the transactions are completed and collection of receivables is reasonably assured. Most transactions in our 
transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide 
and goods we sell. In these transactions, we are the primary obligor, we have credit risk, we have discretion to select the 
supplier, and we have latitude in pricing decisions.
Additionally, in our sourcing business, we take loss of inventory risk during shipment and have general inventory risk. Certain 
transactions in customs brokerage, managed services, freight forwarding, and sourcing are recorded at the net amount we 
charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not present.

Valuations for accounts receivable. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based upon the aging of our 
receivables, our historical experience of uncollectible accounts, and any specific customer collection issues that we have 
identified. The allowance of $42.4 million as of December 31, 2017, increased compared to the allowance of $39.5 million as 
of December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to growth in the balance and deterioration of the aging of our accounts 
receivable portfolio. We believe that the recorded allowance is sufficient and appropriate based on our customer aging trends, 
the exposures we have identified, and our historical loss experience.

33

Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the net of the fair value of identifiable 
tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on November 30, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the asset might be impaired. We first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that 
the fair value of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying value (“Step Zero Analysis”). If the Step Zero Analysis 
indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying value, an 
additional impairment assessment is performed (“Step 1 Analysis”). Based on our Step Zero Analysis, we determined that the 
more likely than not criteria had not been met, and therefore a Step 1 Analysis was not required. 
 
When we perform a Step 1 Analysis, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting 
unit, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an 
amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We have early adopted 
Accounting Standards Update 2017-04, Intangibles–Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill 
Impairment, which eliminates the need for further testing after the Step 1 Analysis. 
 
In the Step 1 Analysis, the fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and market 
approach. Projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and 
expenses, projected capital expenditures, changes in working capital, and the appropriate discount rate. Use of the market 
approach consists of comparisons to comparable publicly-traded companies that are similar in size and industry. Actual results 
may differ from those used in our valuations when a Step 1 analysis is performed. 
 
Stock-based compensation. We issue stock awards, including stock options, performance shares, and restricted stock units, to 
key employees and outside directors. In general, the awards vest over five years, either based on the company’s earnings 
growth or the passage of time. The fair value of each share-based payment award is established on the date of grant. For grants 
of restricted shares and restricted units, the fair value is established based on the market price on the date of the grant, 
discounted for post-vesting holding restrictions. The discounts on outstanding grants vary from 15 percent to 21 percent and are 
calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Changes in the measured stock price volatility and interest rates are 
the primary reason for changes in the discount. For grants of options, we use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to 
estimate the fair value of the awards. The determination of the fair value is affected by our stock price and a number of 
assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends.

2017, such obligations include ocean and air freight capacity, telecommunications services, and maintenance contracts. 

We have no capital lease obligations. Long-term liabilities consist of noncurrent income taxes payable, long-term notes 
payable, and the obligation under our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. Due to the uncertainty with respect to the 
timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2017, we are unable to make 
reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. Therefore, $38.6 million of 
unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Note 5 to the consolidated 
financial statements for a discussion on income taxes. The obligation under our non-qualified deferred compensation plan has 
also been excluded from the above table as the timing of cash payment is uncertain. As of December 31, 2017, we did not have 
any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We had $333.9 million of cash and cash equivalents on December 31, 2017. Substantially all of the cash equivalents are in 
demand accounts with financial institutions. The primary market risks associated with these investments are liquidity risks. 

We are a party to a credit agreement with various lenders consisting of a $900 million revolving loan facility. Interest accrues 
on the revolving loan at variable rates based on LIBOR or “prime” plus the applicable add-on percentage as defined. At 
December 31, 2017, there was $715 million outstanding on the revolving loan.

We are a party to the Note Purchase Agreement, as amended, with various institutional investors with fixed rates consisting of: 
(i) $175 million of the company’s 3.97 percent Senior Notes, Series A, due August 27, 2023, (ii) $150 million of the company’s 
4.26 percent Senior Notes, Series B, due August 27, 2028, and (iii) $175 million of the company’s 4.60 percent Senior Notes, 
Series C, due August 27, 2033. At December 31, 2017, there was $500 million outstanding on the notes. 

We are a party to a receivables securitization facility with various lenders that provides funding of up to $250 million. Interest 
accrues on the facility at variable rates based on the asset-backed commercial paper rate or the 30-day LIBOR plus the 
applicable add-on percentage as defined therein. At December 31, 2017, there was $250 million outstanding on the 
securitization facility. 

A hypothetical 100-basis-point change in the interest rate would not have a material effect on our earnings. We do not use 
derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates. A rise in interest 
rates could negatively affect the fair value of our investments. Market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange 
rates are not material due to the size of our international operations.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 
C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  C.H.  Robinson  Worldwide,  Inc.  and  subsidiaries  (the 
“Company”) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, 
stockholders’ investment, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes 
and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial 
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and 
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) 
(PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 
and our report dated February 28, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on 
the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are 
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable 
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). 
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those 
risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. Our audits also included assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as 
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 
C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. 

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. and subsidiaries (the 
"Company") as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued 
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company 
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on 
criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) 
(PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the fiscal year ended December 
31, 2017, of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated 
financial statements and financial statement schedule. 

Basis for Opinion  

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its 
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s 
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal 
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are 
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable 
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all 
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk 
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the 
assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit 
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures 
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the 
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. and our subsidiaries (“the company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) are 
a global provider of transportation services and logistics solutions through a network of offices operating in North America, 
Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and South America. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of    
C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. and our majority owned and controlled subsidiaries. Our minority interests in subsidiaries are 
not significant. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

USE OF ESTIMATES. The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted 
in the United States, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting 
period. Estimates have been prepared on the basis of the most current and best information, and our actual results could differ 
materially from those estimates.

REVENUE RECOGNITION. Total revenues consist of the total dollar value of goods and services purchased from us by 
customers. Our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services, including contracted 
motor carrier, rail, ocean, air, and other costs, and the purchase price and services related to the products we source. We act 
principally as the service provider for these transactions and recognize revenue as these services are rendered or goods are 
delivered. At that time, our obligations to the transactions are completed and collection of receivables is reasonably assured. 
Most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for 
the service we provide and goods we sell. In these transactions, we are the primary obligor, we have credit risk, we have 
discretion to select the supplier, and we have latitude in pricing decisions. Additionally, in our sourcing business, we take loss 
of inventory risk during shipment and have general inventory risk. Certain transactions in customs brokerage, managed 
services, freight forwarding, and sourcing are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide 
because many of the factors stated above are not present.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may 
become uncollectible in the future. We continuously monitor payments from our customers and maintain a provision for 
uncollectible accounts based upon our customer aging trends, historical loss experience, and any specific customer collection 
issues that we have identified.

FOREIGN CURRENCY. Most balance sheet accounts of foreign subsidiaries are translated or remeasured at the current 
exchange rate as of the end of the year. Statement of operations items are translated at average exchange rates during the year. 
The resulting translation adjustment is recorded net of tax as a separate component of comprehensive income in our statements 
of operations and comprehensive income in 2015. In 2016, we asserted that we will indefinitely reinvest earnings of foreign 
subsidiaries to support expansion of our international businesses and now the translation adjustment is recorded gross of related 
income tax benefits.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. Cash and cash equivalents consist of bank deposits. 

PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER. Prepaid expenses and other include such items as prepaid rent, software maintenance 
contracts, insurance premiums, other prepaid operating expenses, and inventories, consisting primarily of produce and related 
products held for resale.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT. Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Maintenance and repair expenditures are

GOODWILL. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the net of the fair value of identifiable 
tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the 
reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (November 30 for us) and 
between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a 
reporting unit below its carrying value. See Note 2.

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. Other intangible assets include definite-lived customer lists, non-competition agreements, 
and indefinite-lived trademarks. The definite-lived intangible assets are being amortized using the straight-line method over 
their estimated lives, ranging from 5 to 8 years. Definite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The indefinite-lived trademarks are not 
amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or annually, at a minimum. See Note 2.

OTHER ASSETS. Other assets include such items as purchased and internally developed software, and the investments 
related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan. We amortize software using the straight-line method over 3 years. We

INCOME TAXES. Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax 
bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates.

Annual tax provisions include amounts considered sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examination of prior year 
tax returns; however, the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued.

The financial statement benefits of an uncertain income tax position are recognized when more likely than not, based on the 
technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. Unrecognized tax benefits are, more likely than not, owed to 
a taxing authority, and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated. Uncertain income tax positions are included 
in “Noncurrent income taxes payable” in the consolidated balance sheets.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. Our only component of other comprehensive income is foreign currency translation 
adjustment. It is presented on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income gross of related income tax 
effects for 2017 and 2016, net of related income tax effects for 2015.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. We issue stock awards, including stock options, performance shares, and restricted 
stock units, to key employees and outside directors. In general, the awards vest over five years, either based on the company’s 
earnings growth or the passage of time. The related compensation expense for each award is recognized over the appropriate 
vesting period. The fair value of each share-based payment award is established on the date of grant. For grants of shares and 
restricted stock units, the fair value is established based on the market price on the date of the grant, discounted for post-vesting 
holding restrictions. The discounts on outstanding grants vary from 15 percent to 21 percent and are calculated using the Black-
Scholes option pricing model-protective put method. Changes in measured stock volatility and interest rates are the primary 
reason for changes in the discount.

For grants of options, we use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards. 
The determination of the fair value of share-based awards is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions, including 
expected volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends.

NOTE 2: GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill was allocated to each segment based on their relative fair value at November 30, 2016 due to the reorganization of 
our reporting structure. After that date, we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit 
from the business combination. The change in the carrying amount of goodwill is as follows (in thousands):

Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment on November 30, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the asset might be impaired. We first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than 
not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying value (“Step Zero analysis”). If the Step Zero 
analysis indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying value, 
and additional impairment assessment is performed (“Step One Analysis”). Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. 

No goodwill impairment has been recorded in any period presented.

NOTE 3: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

Accounting guidance on fair value measurements for certain financial assets and liabilities requires that assets and liabilities 
carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:

•  Level 1-Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•  Level 2-Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.

•  Level 3-Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity’s own assumptions or external inputs from inactive 

markets.

A financial asset or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level of input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement. 

We had no Level 3 assets or liabilities as of and during the periods ended December 31, 2017, or December 31, 2016. There 
were no transfers between levels during the period. 

45

NOTE 4: FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS

Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility

On October 29, 2012, we entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility for up to $500 million with a $500 million 
accordion feature (the “Credit Agreement”), with a syndicate of financial institutions led by U.S. Bank. In December 2014, we 
amended the credit facility to increase the amount available from $500 million to $900 million and to extend the expiration date 
from October 2017 to December 2019. This facility allows us to continue to fund working capital, capital expenditures, 
dividends, and share repurchases.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had $715 million and $740 million in borrowings outstanding under the Credit 
Agreement, which is classified as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2017, we had 
borrowing availability of $185 million. The recorded amount of borrowings outstanding approximates fair value because of the 
short maturity period of the debt; therefore, we consider these borrowings to be a Level 2 financial liability. 

Borrowings under the Credit Agreement generally bear interest at a variable rate determined by a pricing schedule or the base 
rate (which is the highest of (a) the administrative agent’s prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 percent, or (c) the sum 
of one-month LIBOR plus a specified margin). As of December 31, 2017, the variable rate equaled LIBOR plus 1.13 percent. 
In addition, there is a commitment fee on the average daily undrawn stated amount under each letter of credit issued under the 
facility. The weighted average interest rate incurred on borrowings during 2017 was approximately 2.2 percent and at 
December 31, 2017, was approximately 2.7 percent. The weighted average interest rate incurred on borrowings during 2016 
was approximately 1.5 percent and at December 31, 2016, was approximately 1.9 percent.

The Credit Agreement contains various restrictions and covenants. Among other requirements, we may not permit our leverage 
ratio, as of the end of each of our fiscal quarters, of (i) Consolidated Funded Indebtedness to (ii) Consolidated Total 
Capitalization to be greater than 0.65 to 1.00. Additionally, as a result of amending the Note Purchase Agreement in February 
2015, the ratio of (i) Consolidated Funded Indebtedness to (ii) EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and 
amortization), as of the end of each of our fiscal quarters, may not exceed 3.00 to 1.00. We were in compliance with the 
financial debt covenants as of December 31, 2017.

The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. If an event of default under the Credit Agreement occurs and 
is continuing, then the administrative agent may declare any outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement to be 
immediately due and payable. In addition, if we become the subject of voluntary or involuntary proceedings under any 
bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar law, then any outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement will automatically become 
immediately due and payable. 

Note Purchase Agreement

On August 23, 2013, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with certain institutional investors (the “Purchasers”) named 
therein (the “Note Purchase Agreement”). Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, the Purchasers purchased, on August 27, 
2013, (i) $175 million aggregate principal amount of the company’s 3.97 percent Senior Notes, Series A, due August 27, 2023 
(the “Series A Notes”), (ii) $150 million aggregate principal amount of the company’s 4.26 percent Senior Notes, Series B, due 
August 27, 2028 (the “Series B Notes”), and (iii) $175 million aggregate principal amount of the company’s 4.60 percent 
Senior Notes, Series C, due August 27, 2033 (the “Series C Notes” and, together with the Series A Notes and the Series B 
Notes, the “Notes”). Interest on the fixed-rate Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We applied the proceeds of the sale of 
the Notes for share repurchases.  

The Note Purchase Agreement contains customary provisions for transactions of this type, including representations and 
warranties regarding the company and its subsidiaries and various covenants, including covenants that require us to maintain 
specified financial ratios. The Note Purchase Agreement includes the following financial covenants: we will not permit our 
leverage ratio, as of the end of each of our fiscal quarters, of (i) Consolidated Funded Indebtedness to (ii) Consolidated Total 
Capitalization to be greater than 0.65 to 1.00; we will not permit the interest coverage ratio, as of the end of each of our fiscal 
quarters and for the twelve-month period ending, of (i) Consolidated EBIT (earnings before income taxes) to (ii) Consolidated 
Interest Expense to be less than 2.00 to 1.00; we will not permit, as of the end of each of our fiscal quarters, Consolidated 
Priority Debt to exceed 15% of Consolidated Total Assets. The Note Purchase Agreement was amended in February 2015 to 
conform its financial covenants to be consistent with the amended Credit Agreement. As a result of amending the Note 
Purchase Agreement in February 2015, the ratio of (i) Consolidated Funded Indebtedness to (ii) EBITDA (earnings before 
interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), as of the end of each of our fiscal quarters, may not exceed 3.00 to 1.00. We 
were in compliance with the financial debt covenants as of December 31, 2017.

46

The Note Purchase Agreement provides for customary events of default, generally with corresponding grace periods, including, 
without limitation, payment defaults with respect to the Notes, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other agreements evidencing 
indebtedness of the company or its subsidiaries, certain judgments against the company or its subsidiaries, and events of 
bankruptcy involving the company or its material subsidiaries. The occurrence of an event of default would permit certain 
Purchasers to declare certain Notes then outstanding to be immediately due and payable. 

Under the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, the Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at 100 percent of the principal 
amount being redeemed together with a “make-whole amount,” and accrued and unpaid interest (as defined in the Note 
Purchase Agreement) with respect to each Note. The obligations of the company under the Note Purchase Agreement and the 
Notes are guaranteed by C.H. Robinson Company, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, and 
by C.H. Robinson Company, Inc., a Minnesota corporation and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. 

The Notes were issued by the company to such initial Purchasers in a private placement in reliance on Section 4(2) of the 
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Notes will not be and have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be 
offered or sold in the United States, absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. 

The fair value of long-term debt was approximately $546.6 million at December 31, 2017, and $528.0 million at December 31, 
2016. We estimate the fair value of our debt primarily using an expected present value technique, which is based on observable 
market inputs using interest rates currently available to companies of similar credit standing for similar terms and remaining 
maturities, and considering our own credit risk. If our long-term debt was recorded at fair value, it would be classified as Level 
2. 

U.S. Trade Accounts Receivable Securitization

On April 26, 2017, we entered into a receivables purchase agreement and related transaction documents with The Bank of 
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., New York Branch and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association to provide a receivables 
securitization facility (the “Receivables Securitization Facility”). The Receivables Securitization Facility is based on the 
securitization of our U.S. trade accounts receivable and provides funding of up to $250 million. The borrowings outstanding 
under the Receivables Securitization Facility were $250 million as of December 31, 2017, and are classified as long-term debt 
on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The borrowings under the Receivables Securitization Facility were used to pay 
down amounts previously outstanding on the Credit Agreement. The interest rate on borrowings under the Receivables 
Securitization Facility is based on the asset-backed commercial paper rate plus a margin or 30 day LIBOR plus a margin for a 
combined rate of 2.0 percent for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Receivables Securitization Facility expires on April 
26, 2019, unless extended by the parties. There is a commitment fee we are required to pay on any unused portion of the 
facility.

The Receivables Securitization Facility contains various customary affirmative and negative covenants, and it also contains 
customary default and termination provisions which provide for acceleration of amounts owed under the Receivables 
Securitization Facility upon the occurrence of certain specified events including, but not limited to, the failure to pay yield, 
fees, and other amounts due, defaults on certain other indebtedness, failure to discharge certain judgments, insolvency events, 
change in control, and exceeding certain financial ratios designed to capture events negatively affecting the overall credit 
quality of the receivables. 

The recorded amount of borrowings outstanding on the Receivables Securitization Facility approximates fair value because it 
can be redeemed on short notice and the interest rate floats, therefore, we consider these borrowings to be a Level 2 financial 
liability. 

As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the Credit Agreement, Note Purchase 
Agreement, and Receivables Securitization Facility.

NOTE 5: INCOME TAXES

C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. and its 80 percent (or more) owned U.S. subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax 
return. We file unitary or separate state returns based on state filing requirements. 

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including but not limited to, 
reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and requiring companies to pay a one-time transition 
tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.

The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 118, which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the 
Tax Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for 
companies to complete the accounting under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740. In accordance with SAB 118, a 
company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is 
complete. To the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete but it is able to 
determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements.

In connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act, we have recorded a discrete net tax benefit of $12.1 million 
in the year ended December 31, 2017. The net benefit consists of a benefit for the revaluation of deferred tax assets and 
liabilities of $22.9 million, a net expense for one-time impacts of the Tax Act of $6.8 million, and an expense for transition 
taxes of $4.0 million. We have not yet completed our accounting for the income tax effects of certain elements of the Tax Act 
but we were able to make reasonable estimates for elements in which our analysis is not complete and have therefore recorded 
provisional adjustments. These items include our revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the expense for transition 
taxes.

During 2017, we recorded a net tax benefit of $19.7 million due to deductions under Section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code.
During the first quarter of 2017, we adopted ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718). The adoption of 
ASU 2016-09 prospectively impacts the recording of income taxes related to share-based payment awards in our consolidated 
financial position and results of operations, as well as the operating and financing cash flows on the consolidated statements of 
cash flows. This adoption resulted in a net tax benefit of $13.7 million during the year.

During the first quarter of 2016, we asserted that we will indefinitely reinvest earnings of foreign subsidiaries to support 
expansion of our international business. In 2017, our indefinite reinvestment strategy, with respect to unremitted earnings of 
our foreign subsidiaries provided an approximate $3.7 million benefit to our provision for income taxes related to current year 
earnings. If we repatriated all foreign earnings, the estimated effect on income taxes payable would be an increase of 
approximately $12.1 million as of December 31, 2017. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to audits of U.S. federal, 
state and local, or non-U.S. income tax returns before 2010.

As of December 31, 2017, we had $38.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties, all of which 
would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. We are not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefit will significantly increase or decrease in the next 12 months.

Income tax expense considers amounts which may be needed to cover exposures for open tax years. We do not expect any 
material impact related to open tax years; however, actual settlements may differ from amounts accrued.

We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes. During the years ended 
December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we recognized approximately $0.7 million $0.9 million, and $1.2 million in interest and 
penalties. We had approximately $6.8 million and $6.6 million for the payment of interest and penalties accrued within 
noncurrent income taxes payable as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. These amounts are not included in the reconciliation 
above.

The Tax Act reduces the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018. Consequently, we have recorded a 
provisional decrease related to deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities of $34.4 million and $57.3 million, respectively. 

We had foreign net operating loss carryforwards with a tax effect of $10.9 million as of December 31, 2017, and $9.0 million as 
of December 31, 2016. The net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates from 2018 to 2025, with certain 
jurisdictions having indefinite carryforward terms. A full valuation allowance has been established for these net operating loss 
carryforwards due to the uncertainty of the use of the tax benefit in future periods.

NOTE 6: CAPITAL STOCK AND STOCK AWARD PLANS

PREFERRED STOCK. Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par 
value $0.10 per share. There are no shares of preferred stock outstanding. The preferred stock may be issued by resolution of 
our Board of Directors at any time without any action of the stockholders. The Board of Directors may issue the preferred stock 
in one or more series and fix the designation and relative powers. These include voting powers, preferences, rights, 
qualifications, limitations, and restrictions of each series. The issuance of any such series may have an adverse effect on the 
rights of holders of common stock and may impede the completion of a merger, tender offer, or other takeover attempt.

COMMON STOCK. Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes 480,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.10 per 
share. Subject to the rights of preferred stock which may from time to time be outstanding, holders of common stock are 
entitled to receive dividends out of funds legally available, when and if declared by the Board of Directors, and to receive their 
share of the net assets of the company legally available for distribution upon liquidation or dissolution.

For each share of common stock held, stockholders are entitled to one vote on each matter to be voted on by the stockholders, 
including the election of directors. Holders of common stock are not entitled to cumulative voting. The stockholders do not 
have preemptive rights. All outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and nonassessable.

STOCK AWARD PLANS. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is 
recognized as expense as it vests. A summary of our total compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of 
operations and comprehensive income for stock-based compensation is as follows (in thousands):

On May 12, 2016, our shareholders approved an amendment to and restatement of our 2013 Equity Incentive Plan, which 
allows us to grant certain stock awards, including stock options at fair market value and restricted shares and restricted stock 
units, to our key employees and outside directors. A maximum of 13,041,803 shares can be granted under this plan. 
Approximately 2,920,099 shares were available for stock awards under this plan as of December 31, 2017. Shares subject to 
awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of shares or that are settled in cash, generally become available again for 
issuance under the plan. 

We have awarded performance-based stock options to certain key employees. These options are subject to certain vesting 
requirements over a five-year period, based on the company’s earnings growth. Any options remaining unvested at the end of 
the five-year vesting period are forfeited to the company. Although participants can exercise options via a stock swap exercise, 
we do not issue reloads (restoration options) on the grants. 

The fair value of these options is established based on the market price on the date of grant, discounted for post-vesting holding 
restrictions, calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Changes in measured stock price volatility and interest 
rates are the primary reasons for changes in the discount. These grants are being expensed based on the terms of the awards. As 
of December 31, 2017, unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options was $58.4 million. The amount of future 
expense to be recognized will be based on the company’s earnings growth and certain other conditions.

The following schedule summarizes stock option activity in the plans. All outstanding unvested options as of December 31, 
2017, relate to performance-based grants from 2013 and 2014 and time-based grants from 2015 through 2017.

Additional potential dilutive stock options totaling 1,357,290 for 2017 have been excluded from our diluted net income per

common stock).

We issued no performance-based options in 2015, 2016, or 2017. We have awarded stock options to certain key employees that 
vest primarily based on their continued employment. The value of these awards is established by the market price on the date of 
the grant and is being expensed over the vesting period of the award. The following table summarizes these unvested stock 
option grants as of December 31, 2017:

We estimated the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We estimate the fair value 
of restricted shares and units using the Black-Scholes option pricing model-protective put method. A description of significant 
assumptions used to estimate the expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected terms is as follows:

Expected Volatility-Expected volatility was determined based on implied volatility of our traded options and historical 
volatility of our stock price.

Risk-Free Interest Rate-The risk-free interest rate was based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon 
issues at the date of grant with a term equal to the expected term.

Expected Term-Expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and was 
determined based on historical experience and anticipated future exercise patterns, giving consideration to the contractual terms 
of unexercised stock-based awards.

The fair value per option was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:

FULL VALUE AWARDS. We have awarded performance-based restricted shares and restricted stock units to certain key 
employees and non-employee directors. These awards are subject to certain vesting requirements over a five-year period, based 
on the company’s earnings growth. The awards also contain restrictions on the awardees’ ability to sell or transfer vested 
awards for a specified period of time. The fair value of these awards is established based on the market price on the date of 
grant, discounted for post-vesting holding restrictions. The discounts on outstanding grants vary from 15 percent to 21 percent 
and are calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model-protective put method. Changes in measured stock price 
volatility and interest rates are the primary reasons for changes in the discount. These grants are being expensed based on the 
terms of the awards.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. Our 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan allows our employees to contribute up 
to $10,000 of their annual cash compensation to purchase company stock. Purchase price is determined using the closing price 
on the last day of the quarter discounted by 15 percent. Shares are vested immediately. The following is a summary of the

NOTE 7: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. We offer a defined contribution plan, which qualifies under section 401(k) of the Internal 
Revenue Code and covers all eligible U.S. employees. We can also elect to make matching contributions to the plan. Annual 
discretionary contributions may also be made to the plan. Defined contribution plan expense, including matching contributions, 
was approximately (in thousands):

NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN. All restricted shares vested but not yet delivered, as well as a 
deferred share award granted to our CEO, are held within this plan.

In addition to minimum lease payments, we are typically responsible under our lease agreements to pay our pro rata share of 
maintenance expenses, common charges, and real estate taxes of the buildings in which we lease space.

LITIGATION. We are not subject to any pending or threatened litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary 
course of our business operations, including 16 contingent auto liability cases as of December 31, 2017. For some legal 
proceedings, we have accrued an amount that reflects the aggregate liability deemed probable and estimable, but this amount is 
not material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Because of the preliminary nature of 
many of these proceedings, the difficulty in ascertaining the applicable facts relating to many of these proceedings, the 
inconsistent treatment of claims made in many of these proceedings, and the difficulty of predicting the settlement value of 
many of these proceedings, we are not able to estimate an amount or range of any reasonably possible additional losses. 
However, based upon our historical experience, the resolution of these proceedings is not expected to have a material effect on 
our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

NOTE 8: ACQUISITIONS

On August 31, 2017, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Milgram & Company Ltd. ("Milgram") for the purpose of 
expanding our global presence and bringing additional capabilities and expertise to our portfolio. Total purchase consideration, 
net of cash acquired, was $47.3 million, which was paid in cash. We used advances under the Credit Agreement to fund part of 
the cash consideration.

There was $28.6 million of goodwill recorded related to the acquisition of Milgram. The Milgram goodwill is a result of 
acquiring and retaining the Milgram existing workforce and expected synergies from integrating its business into ours. 
Purchase accounting is considered preliminary, subject to revision primarily related to certain income tax related balances 
expected to be finalized in 2018. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The results of operations of Milgram have 
been included in our consolidated financial statements since September 1, 2017. Pro forma financial information for prior 
periods is not presented because we believe the acquisition to be not material to our consolidated results. 

On September 30, 2016, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of APC Logistics (“APC”) for the purpose of expanding our 
global presence and bringing additional capabilities and expertise to the company’s portfolio. Total purchase consideration was 
$229.4 million, which was paid in cash. We used advances under the Credit Agreement to fund part of the cash consideration.

NOTE 9: SEGMENT REPORTING

Our reportable segments are based on our method of internal reporting, which generally segregates the segments by service line 
and the primary services they provide to our customers. We identify three reportable segments as follows:  

•  North American Surface Transportation: NAST provides freight transportation services across North America 
through a network of offices in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The primary services provided by NAST 
include truckload, LTL, and intermodal. 

•  Global Forwarding: Global Forwarding provides global logistics services through an international network of offices 

in North America, Asia, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and South America and also contracts with independent 
agents worldwide. The primary services provided by Global Forwarding include ocean freight services, air freight 
services, and customs brokerage.

•  Robinson Fresh: Robinson Fresh provides sourcing services under the trade name of Robinson Fresh. Our sourcing 
services primarily include the buying, selling, and marketing of fresh fruits, vegetables, and other perishable items. 
Robinson Fresh sources products from around the world and has a physical presence in North America, Europe, Asia, 
and South America. This segment often provides the logistics and transportation of the products they sell, in addition 
to temperature controlled transportation services for its customers. 

•  All Other and Corporate: All Other and Corporate includes our Managed Services segment, as well as Other Surface 

Transportation outside of North America and other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses. 
Managed Services provides Transportation Management Services, or Managed TMS®. Other Surface Transportation 
revenues are primarily earned by Europe Surface Transportation. Europe Surface Transportation provides services 
similar to NAST across Europe. 

The internal reporting of segments is defined, based in part, on the reporting and review process used by our chief operating 
decision maker, our Chief Executive Officer. The accounting policies of our reporting segments are the same as those described 
in the summary of significant accounting policies. Segment information for prior years has been retroactively recast to align 
with current year presentation. Segment information as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 is as 
follows (dollars in thousands):

NOTE 10: CHANGES IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS 

Accumulated other comprehensive loss is included in the Stockholders’ investment on our consolidated balance sheets. The 
recorded balance at December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, was $18.5 million and $61.4 million, respectively, and is 
comprised solely of foreign currency translation adjustment.

NOTE 11: RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, 
“Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” and in August 2015 issued ASU 2015-14, which amended the standard as to 
effective date. The new comprehensive revenue recognition standard will supersede all existing revenue recognition guidance 
under U.S. GAAP. The standard’s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or 
services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for 
those goods or services. The standard requires more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand 
the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. We adopted this 
new standard effective January 1, 2018 under the modified retrospective transition method with a cumulative adjustment to 
retained earnings of approximately $10 million.  

The adoption of this standard will change the timing of revenue recognition for most of our transportation business from at 
delivery to over the transit period as our performance obligation is completed. Due to the short transit period of many of our 
performance obligations, we do not expect this change to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, 
or cash flows once implemented. 

The new standard will expand our existing revenue recognition disclosures upon adoption beginning in the first quarter of 
2018. In addition, we have identified certain customer contracts in our sourcing business that will change from a principal to an 
agent relationship under the new standard. This will cause the revenue associated with these contracts to be recognized at the 
net amount we charge our customers but will have no impact on income from operations.  

60

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This update requires a lessee to recognize on the balance 
sheet a liability to make lease payments and a corresponding right-of-use asset. The guidance also requires certain qualitative 
and quantitative disclosures about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. This update is 
effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, which will require us to adopt these provisions in 
the first quarter of 2019 using a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted, although we do not plan to adopt 
early. We have obligations under lease agreements for facilities and equipment, which are classified as operating leases under 
the existing lease standard. While we are still evaluating the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated results of 
operations, financial condition, and cash flows, our financial statements will reflect an increase in both assets and liabilities due 
to the requirement to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets for our facility and 
equipment leases. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements which presents our operating lease commitments as of 
December 31, 2017. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718). This update was issued as 
part of the FASB’s simplification initiative and affects all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. 
The amendments in this update cover such areas as the recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies, the classification of 
those excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, and accounting policy election for forfeitures, the amount an employer 
can withhold to cover income taxes and still qualify for equity classification, and the classification of those taxes paid on the 
statement of cash flows. This update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. During the 
first quarter of 2017, we adopted ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718). The adoption of ASU 
2016-09 prospectively impacts the recording of income taxes related to share-based payment awards in our consolidated 
statement of financial position and results of operations, as well as the operating and financing cash flows on the consolidated 
statements of cash flows. The magnitude of such impacts are dependent on our future grants of stock-based compensation, our 
future stock price in relation to the fair value of awards on grant date, and the exercise behavior of our option holders. We 
prospectively adopted these provisions in the first quarter of 2017. This adoption resulted in a decrease in our provision for 
income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $13.7 million.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and other (Topic 350). This update simplifies the 
accounting for goodwill impairment and removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. Instead, if the carrying amount of a 
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, any impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the 
total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative 
assessment to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. The ASU is effective for annual and any interim 
impairment tests for periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim and annual goodwill 
impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. We early adopted this ASU for our annual impairment test performed on 
November 30, 2017. There was no impact resulting from this adoption on our consolidated financial statements.  

In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification 
Accounting. This update amends the scope of modification accounting for share-based payment arrangements. The ASU 
provides guidance on the types of changes to the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards to which an entity would 
be required to apply modification accounting under Topic 718. We adopted this new standard effective January 1, 2018. The 
amendments in this update will be applied prospectively to awards modified on or after January 1, 2018. The future impact of 
ASU 2017-09 will depend on the nature of future stock award modifications.

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects From Accumulated Other 
Comprehensive Income, which amends existing guidance for reporting comprehensive income to reflect changes resulting from 
the 2017 Tax Act. The amendment provides the option to reclassify stranded tax effects resulting from the 2017 Tax Act and 
within accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) to retained earnings. New disclosures will be required upon adoption, 
including the accounting policy for releasing income tax effects from AOCI, whether reclassification of stranded income tax 
effects is elected, and information about other income tax effect reclassifications. The amendment will become effective for us 
on January 1, 2019, though early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on our 
consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of December 31, 2017, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and 
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)). Based upon that 
evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of 
December 31, 2017 were effective.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term 
is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent 
limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to 
financial statement preparation and presentation.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 
2017 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control-Integrated 
Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of 
December 31, 2017.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, has been audited by Deloitte & 
Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have not been any changes to the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended 
December 31, 2017, to which this report relates, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the 
company’s internal control over financial reporting.
