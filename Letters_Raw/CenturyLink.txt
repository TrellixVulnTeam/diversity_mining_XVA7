CenturyLink had a truly momentous year in 2017. With the 
acquisition of Level 3, we have created one of the world’s 
most compelling network service providers, with even 
more powerful choices for businesses and consumers 
in this world of increasing connectivity. CenturyLink is 
the second-largest U.S.-based communications provider 
to global enterprise customers, with a fiber-rich global 
footprint and a robust portfolio of network solutions and 
managed services.

Our Principal Focus

Our principal operational focus is clear: we want to 
become the world’s best, most trusted and easiest-to-
use fiber-based network services provider. The reach 
and capabilities of our network put CenturyLink at the 
forefront of the digital world. We make our decisions and 
invest our capital with an emphasis on expanding the 
reach and capabilities of our network and improving the 
experience we deliver to our customers. There is power 
in that clarity and focus. In my 26 years as CEO, I cannot 
remember a time when I have been more enthusiastic 
about the potential for CenturyLink, our customers and 
other stakeholders.

60+Countries 

and Counting

We are also clear on our financial objectives. While we 
expect the migration to IP-enabled platforms will continue 
to put pressure on our legacy revenues, we are focused 
on growing free cash flow per share. We believe we 
have the ability to drive that growth, first through synergy 
achievement, and then through ongoing efficiencies and 
profitable revenue growth over the long term. We are 
confident in our financial outlook for 2018, which includes 
growth in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes,

depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and strong free 
cash flow generation. Our dividend remains an important 
part of our value proposition for shareholders, and we are 
comfortable with our dividend payout ratio given the cash 
flow outlook for our business.

New Opportunities for Profitable Growth

We operate one of the world’s most powerful networks, 
and we believe we are well positioned to drive both 
market share gains and operating efficiencies.

» We have approximately 450,000 route miles of

fiber globally and more than 100,000 fiber-enabled,
on-net buildings, including 10,000 buildings in
Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.
The scale, scope and quality of our network allows 
us to compete globally.

» We receive approximately 75 percent of our revenue

from business customers across more than 350
metropolitan areas. We will remain focused on
investing in the products, services and customer
experience platforms necessary to meet the

To Our Shareholders continued

connectivity and managed services needs of the
business market.

» We connect more than five million consumers to

the power of the digital world and believe we have
the ability to grow our base of higher bandwidth
consumer customers.

» We also expect to realize $975 million in annual 
run-rate cash synergies when we complete the
integration of CenturyLink and Level 3. Making 
solid progress toward achieving these synergies 
is one of our top priorities in 2018.

Over the long term, we see an increasingly digital world 
with growing bandwidth demand. Cloud computing, 
video streaming, 5G wireless and the billions of devices 
around the world that need connectivity are among the 
trends driving increased data traffic. In this environment 
of increasing bandwidth demand, our global network is 
an incredibly valuable asset and a distinct competitive 
advantage. CenturyLink can provide an essential link 
to the digital world for both enterprise customers and 
consumers, an important position that we believe holds 
excellent potential for our stakeholders.

Our 2017 Performance

In early 2016, we declared our intention to refocus on our 
core network. We made significant steps toward that end 
in 2017. We completed the sale of our data centers and 
colocation business in May and the acquisition of Level 3 
in November. Obviously, both transactions were top 
priorities for 2017, and we entered 2018 a stronger, more 
focused company.

49,000

Employees, Globally

For full-year 2017, the combined operating performance  
of CenturyLink and Level 3 was mixed. We continued  
to see good demand for high-bandwidth data services, 
and our legacy business performed about as we had 
expected. While the extended time to complete the 
acquisition did impact our sales performance for the year, 
we believe we navigated through the sales and integration 
processes well, and we are confident in our ability to 
execute going forward.

Our Integration Plan

In addition to focusing on customers’ needs and 
improving our overall customer experience, a top priority 
for 2018 is executing our integration plan and achieving 
the expected operating expense and capital cost savings. 
We have a clear plan and are well underway:

» We have a unified view of our go-to-market plan
across all customer segments and have aligned
our sales organization with our five customer-facing
business units: wholesale and indirect, global
accounts and international, North America strategic
enterprise and federal government, small and
medium enterprise and consumer. We have
completed account migrations between sales
teams, and we now have account team assignments
in place for each customer. We’ve also implemented
a sales support center to help sales and sales support
employees learn more about our combined portfolio
of products, services and systems.

» The network backbones of the two companies

were interconnected early in the integration process.

Customer network migrations will occur over the
next several years in a deliberate process that is
focused on minimizing customer disruption.

» We are executing our IT systems integration plan.

We expect to begin consolidation of major customer
portals in the first half of 2018, which will enable
customers to work with a single combined portal.
We also have identified our product roadmap and
selected the best products from each company, and
implementation is underway.

» We have initiated a cultural integration program

across the organization. This program isn’t as tangible
as network integration, but we believe bringing the
teams together into an effective and high-performing
unit is critical to our success. Over 300 leaders have
attended training sessions through this process, and
we are cascading it throughout the organization
during 2018.

During fourth quarter 2017, we reached approximately 
$75 million of our estimated $850 million in annualized 
run-rate operating expense synergies. We expect to fully 
achieve the $125 million in capital expenditure synergies 
in 2018 and to capture most of the remainder of the 
operating expense synergies over the next three years. 
We believe delivery on our integration plan can create 
significant value for shareholders and a more productive 
work environment for our employees.

A More Powerful Choice for Customers

Whether enterprise or consumer, we enable a powerful 
set of network services capabilities for our customers. 
We are focusing our investment on expanding the 
power and reach of those offerings. We know, too, 
that the experience we provide our customers is 
directly related to our long-term success. And while our 
employees work every day to meet our customers’ needs, 
we believe we have an opportunity to further differentiate 
our services by enabling the world’s best network 
services customer experience.

» We have simplified our go-to-market pricing,
billing, products and processes. In mid-2017, 
for example, we introduced a new consumer
broadband service plan called Price For Life. This 
is a single-price plan that does not change for as long
as the customer has the service. This simplified
pricing approach has resonated well with consumers.
In the first six months following its introduction in
mid-2017, more than one million customers signed
up for Price For Life. On the enterprise side, we are
reducing the number of product offerings,
standardizing equipment options and simplifying
pricing plans. Simplification of these offers is the
beginning of an improved customer experience.

» We are automating service ordering, provisioning
and maintenance to make them more dynamic 
and responsive to our customers’ needs. In some 
of our multi-tenant commercial and residential
environments, we have enabled our customers

To Our Shareholders continued

to establish an account, order services, automatically
pay and change broadband access without speaking
to a CenturyLink agent or utilizing a technician. 
It is the experience our customers want, and we
are working to push that experience deeper into 
our markets.

» We have built strong capabilities in software-defined

networking and network functions virtualization,
and we are coupling these services with MPLS,
wave transport and cloud applications to enable
hybrid networking capabilities for our customers. 
We also are investing in services that are high
priorities for our enterprise customers, including 
security, private cloud and our cloud application 
manager platform.

» We are continuing to invest to improve speeds 

for both enterprises and consumers. For enterprises, 
we expect to enable gigabit service in every 
fiber-enabled building on our network. For 
consumers, we are focusing our investments on 
driving higher broadband speeds to as many 
households as feasible.

These are all steps along the path to our goal of becoming 
the world’s best, most-trusted and easiest-to-use 
fiber-based network services provider. We believe we 
can achieve that goal and create significant value for 
customers and shareholders. We will continue to align our 
operational focus and investment toward that end.

4    C e n t u r yL i n k

On a personal note, the 2018 Shareholders’ Meeting will 
mark the end of my 42 years with CenturyLink and 26 
years as CEO. This is, of course, a hard decision for me, 
but I know in my heart that it is the right time for me to 
retire. Through the hard work of thousands of employees 
over the years, we have built a remarkable company. 
We’ve worked together, learned together, made mistakes 
together and grown together. It is one of the great 
blessings of my life to have been part of this experience, 
and I am grateful for all the support and help I have had 
along the way. 

I am also pleased to have someone of Jeff Storey’s 
capabilities and integrity to lead the company upon my 
retirement. I have worked with Jeff for over two years, 
and I am just as confident in his ability to lead CenturyLink 
as I am confident about the prospects of the company he 
is about to lead. He is the right leader for the next chapter 
in this remarkable story. So, while this is a bittersweet 
moment for me, I leave CenturyLink as excited about the 
company’s future as I am proud of its past.

How many votes may I cast?

You may cast one vote for every share of our common stock or Series L preferred stock that you owned on
the record date. Our common stock and Series L preferred stock vote together as a single class on all matters. In
this proxy statement, we refer to these shares as our “Common Shares” and “Preferred Shares,” respectively, and
as our “Voting Shares,” collectively. As of the record date, we had 1,078,907,371 Common Shares and 7,018
Preferred Shares outstanding.

What is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record and as a beneficial owner?

If shares are registered in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services L.L.C., you
are the “shareholder of record” of those shares and you may directly vote these shares, together with any shares
credited to your account if you are a participant in our automatic dividend reinvestment and stock purchase
service.

If your shares are held on your behalf in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are

the “beneficial owner” of shares held in “street name.” We have requested that our proxy materials be made
available to you by your broker, bank or nominee, who is considered the shareholder of record of those shares.

If I am a shareholder of record, how do I vote?

If you are a shareholder of record, you may vote in person at the meeting or by proxy in any of the following

three ways:

•

•

•

call 1-800-652-8683 and follow the instructions provided;

log on to the Internet at www.envisionreports.com/ctl and follow the instructions at that site; or

request a paper copy of our proxy materials and, following receipt thereof, mark, sign and date your
proxy card and return it to Computershare.

Please note that you may not vote by telephone or the Internet after 1:00 a.m. Central Time on May 23,

2018.

If I am a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, how do I vote?

As the beneficial owner, you have the right to instruct your broker, bank or nominee how to vote your shares

by using any voting instruction card supplied by them or by following their instructions for voting by telephone,
the Internet, or in person.

If I am a benefit plan participant, how do I vote?

Please see “Additional Information About the Meeting — Voting by Participants in Our Benefit Plans”

appearing below.

Do I need identification to attend the meeting in person?

Yes. Please bring proper identification, together with the Important Notice Regarding Availability of Proxy
Materials mailed to you, which will serve as your admission ticket. If your shares are held in street name, please
bring acceptable proof of ownership, such as a letter from your broker or an account statement stating or showing
that you beneficially owned Voting Shares on the record date.

Where can I find additional information about the conduct of the meeting, voting requirements, and other
similar matters relating to the meeting?

ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

(Item 1 on Proxy or Voting Instruction Card)

The first proposal for consideration at the meeting is the election of each of the 13 candidates named below

as a director for a one-year term expiring at our 2019 annual meeting of shareholders, or until his or her
successor is duly elected and qualified.

Acting upon the recommendation of its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board has

nominated the 13 below-named directors to stand for re-election to one-year terms at the meeting. Unless
authority is withheld, all votes attributable to Voting Shares represented by each duly executed and delivered
proxy will be cast for the election of each of the 13 below-named nominees. Under our bylaw nominating
procedures, these nominees are the only individuals who may be elected at the meeting. If for any reason any
such nominee should decline or become unable to stand for election as a director, which we do not anticipate, the
persons named as proxies may vote instead for another candidate designated by the Board, without re-soliciting
proxies.

For additional information about our director nomination process and agreements under which we are
obligated to nominate certain directors at the meeting, see “Corporate Governance — Director Nomination

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Governance Guidelines

Our Board has adopted corporate governance guidelines, which it reviews at least annually. For information

on how you can obtain a complete copy of our guidelines, see “— Access to Information” below.

Among other things, our corporate governance guidelines provide as follows:

Director Qualifications

• The Board of Directors will have a majority of independent directors. The Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing with the Board, on an annual basis, the requisite
skills and characteristics of new Board members as well as the composition of the Board as a whole.

• The Board expects directors who change the job or responsibility they held when they were elected to

the Board to volunteer to resign from the Board.

• On the terms and subject to the conditions specified in our bylaws, directors will be elected by a

majority vote of the shareholders and any incumbent director failing to receive a majority of votes cast
must promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board.

• No director may serve on more than two other unaffiliated public company boards, unless this

prohibition is waived by the Board.

• No director may be appointed or nominated to a new term if he or she would be age 75 or older at the

time of the election or appointment.

• Annually, the Board will determine affirmatively which of our directors are independent for purposes

of complying with our corporate governance guidelines and the listing standards of the New York
Stock Exchange, or NYSE. A director will not be independent for these purposes unless the Board
affirmatively determines that the director does not, either directly or indirectly through the director’s
affiliates or associates, have a material commercial, banking, consulting, legal, accounting, charitable,
familial or other relationship with the Company or its affiliates, other than as a director.

Director Responsibilities

• The Board periodically reviews our long-term strategic plans and holds strategic planning sessions.

• Directors are required to hold confidential all non-public information obtained due to their directorship

position absent the express permission of the Board to disclose such information.

• Unless otherwise determined by the Board, when a management director retires or ceases to be an

active employee for any other reason, that director will be considered to have resigned concurrently
from the Board.

Chairman; Lead Director

• The Board elects a Chairman from among its members. The Chairman may be a director who also has

executive responsibilities, including the CEO (an executive chair), or may be one of the Company’s
independent directors (a non-executive chair). The Board believes it is in the best interests of the
Company for the Board to remain flexible with respect to whether to elect an executive chair or a
non-executive chair so that the Board may provide for succession planning and respond effectively to
changes in circumstances.

• The Chairman’s responsibilities include planning for and presiding at meetings of the Board and

overseeing the functioning of the Board.

10

• The non-management directors meet in executive session on multiple occasions throughout the year.

The lead director’s responsibilities include planning for and presiding at each meeting of the
non-management directors.(4)

CEO Evaluation and Management Succession

• The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee conducts an annual review of the CEO’s

performance and provides a report of its findings to the Board.

• The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reports periodically to the Board on succession

planning.

Recoupment of Compensation

•

If the Board or any committee of the Board determines that any bonus, incentive payment, commission,
equity award or other compensation awarded to or received by an executive officer was based on any
financial or operating result that was impacted by the executive officer’s knowing or intentional
fraudulent or illegal conduct, we may recover from the executive officer the compensation the Board or
any committee of the Board considers appropriate under the circumstances.

Stock Ownership Guidelines

• We require our executive officers to beneficially own CenturyLink stock equal in market value to

specified multiples of their annual base salary. All executive officers have three years from the date
they first become subject to a particular ownership level to attain that target.

• We require our outside directors to beneficially own CenturyLink stock equal in market value to five
times their annual cash retainer. Outside directors have five years from their election or appointment
date to attain that target.

•

For any year during which an executive or director does not meet his or her ownership target, the
executive or director is required to hold a specified percentage of the CenturyLink stock that the
executive or director acquires through our equity compensation programs, excluding shares sold to pay
taxes associated with the acquisition thereof.

• The Human Resources and Compensation Committee administers the guidelines, and may modify their

terms and grant hardship exceptions in its discretion.

•

See “Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Our Policies, Processes and Guidelines Related to

Independence and Tenure

Based on the information made available to it, the Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that all

but one of our non-management directors qualifies as an independent director under the standards referred to
above under “— Governance Guidelines.” In making these determinations, the Board, with assistance from
counsel, evaluated responses to a questionnaire completed by each director regarding relationships and possible
conflicts of interest. In its review of director independence, the Board considered all known commercial,
banking, consulting, legal, accounting, charitable, familial or other relationships any director may have with us.

In late 2017, we awarded through competitive bidding a telecommunications service agreement to a

company owned by the brother of Harvey P. Perry, the Company’s Chairman of the Board. In connection with
reviewing this arrangement in early 2018, the Board determined that Mr. Perry did not qualify as an independent
director under the Company’s above-cited standards, and named W. Bruce Hanks, the Company’s Vice
Chairman of the Board, as lead independent director.

Some of our other directors (excluding Mr. Perry) are employed by or affiliated with companies with which

we do business in the ordinary course, either as a service provider, a customer or both. As required under the
NYSE listing standards and our corporate governance guidelines, our Board examined the amounts spent by us
with those companies and by those companies with us. In all cases the amounts spent under these transactions
fell well below the materiality thresholds established in the NYSE listing standards and in our corporate
governance guidelines. Consequently, our Board concluded that the amounts spent under these transactions did
not create a material relationship with us that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment by any
of these other directors.

As illustrated below, most of our directors are independent, and almost half have served on our Board for

three years or less:

Committees of the Board

During 2017, the Board of Directors held 20 meetings.

During 2017, the Board’s Audit Committee held eight meetings. The Audit Committee is currently

composed of four independent directors, all of whom the Board has determined to be audit committee financial
experts, as defined under the federal securities laws. The Audit Committee’s functions are described further
below under “Audit Committee Report.”

The Board’s Human Resources and Compensation Committee (which in most instances is hereinafter
referred to as the “Compensation Committee”) met 11 times during 2017. The Compensation Committee is
currently composed of four independent directors, all of whom qualify as “non-employee directors” under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Compensation Committee is described
further below under “Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Our Policies, Processes and Guidelines Related
to Executive Compensation — Our Compensation Decision-Making Process — Role of Compensation
Committee.”

The Board’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (which in most instances is hereinafter

referred to as the “Nominating Committee”) is currently composed of four independent directors. It met six times
during 2017. The Nominating Committee is responsible for, among other things, (i) recommending to the Board
nominees to serve as directors and officers, (ii) monitoring the composition and size of the Board and its

12

committees, (iii) periodically reassessing our corporate governance guidelines described above, (iv) leading the
Board in its annual review of the Board’s performance, (v) reviewing shareholder proposals and making
recommendations to the Board regarding how to respond, (vi) conducting an intensive annual review of the
performance of our Chief Executive Officer, including interviewing each of our other senior officers, and
(vii) reporting to the Board on succession planning for executive officers and appointing an interim CEO if the
Board does not make such an appointment within 72 hours of the CEO dying or becoming disabled. For
information on the director nomination process, see “— Director Nomination Process” below.

The Board maintains a Risk Evaluation Committee, which met four times during 2017. This Committee is

described further below under the heading “— Risk Oversight.”

The Board has also established a Pricing Committee, which has authority to approve the terms and

conditions under which we offer or sell our securities or borrow money. This committee is comprised of Peter C.
Brown, W. Bruce Hanks and Glen F. Post, III.

Each of the committees listed above is composed solely of independent directors (as defined under the
standards referred to above under “— Governance Guidelines”), except for the Risk Evaluation Committee,
which includes Harvey P. Perry, and the Pricing Committee, which includes Glen F. Post, III.

Information.”

During 2017, all of our directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of all board meetings and all
meetings of board committees on which they served. In addition, each of our directors then in office attended the
2017 annual shareholders’ meeting.

Director Nomination Process

General. Nominations for the election of directors at our annual shareholders’ meetings may be made by the
Board (upon the receipt of recommendations of the Nominating Committee) or by any shareholder of record who
complies with our bylaws, which are summarized below. For the meeting this year, the Board has nominated the
13 nominees listed above under “Election of Directors” to stand for election as directors, and no shareholders
submitted any nominations. For further information on procedures governing the submission of shareholder
proposals, see “— Bylaw Requirements” and “Other Matters — Deadlines for Submitting Shareholder
Nominations and Proposals for the 2019 Annual Meeting.”

Bylaw Requirements. If timely notice is provided, our bylaws permit shareholders to nominate a director or

bring other matters before a shareholders’ meeting. The written notice required to be sent by any shareholder
nominating a director must include various information, including, as to the shareholder giving the notice and the
beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is being made, (i) the name and address of such
shareholder, any such beneficial owner, and any other parties affiliated, associated or acting in concert therewith,
(ii) their beneficial ownership interests in our Voting Shares, including disclosure of arrangements that might
cause such person’s voting, investment or economic interests in our Voting Shares to differ from those of our
other shareholders, (iii) certain additional information concerning such parties required under the federal proxy
rules, (iv) a description of all agreements with respect to the nomination among the nominating shareholder, any
beneficial owner, any person acting in concert with them, each proposed nominee and certain other persons, and
(v) a representation whether any such person intends to solicit proxies or votes in support of their proposed
nominees. With respect to each proposed nominee, the written notice must also, among other things, (i) set forth
biographical and other data required under the federal proxy rules and a description of various compensation or
other arrangements or relationships between each proposed nominee and the nominating shareholder and its
affiliated parties and (ii) furnish both a completed and duly executed questionnaire and a duly executed
agreement designed to disclose various aspects of the proposed nominee’s background, qualifications and certain
specified arrangements with other persons, as well as to receive the proposed nominee’s commitment to abide by
certain specified agreements and undertakings. We may require a proposed nominee to furnish other reasonable
information or certifications. Shareholders interested in bringing before a shareholders’ meeting any matter other
than a director nomination should consult our bylaws for additional procedures governing such requests. We may
disregard any nomination or submission of any other matter that fails to comply with these bylaw procedures.

In addition, our bylaws provide that under certain circumstances a shareholder or group of shareholders may
include director candidates that they have nominated in our annual meeting proxy materials. These proxy access
provisions of our bylaws provide, among other things, that a shareholder or group of up to ten shareholders
seeking to include director candidates in our annual meeting proxy materials must own 3% or more of our
outstanding Common Shares continuously for at least the previous three years. The number of shareholder-
nominated candidates appearing in any of our annual meeting proxy materials cannot exceed 20% of the number
of directors then serving on the Board. If 20% is not a whole number, the maximum number of shareholder-
nominated candidates would be the closest whole number below 20%. Based on the current Board size of 13, two
is the maximum number of proxy access candidates that we would be required to include in our 2019 proxy
materials for the 2019 annual meeting. The nominating shareholder or group of shareholders also must deliver
the information required by our bylaws, and each nominee must meet the qualifications required by our bylaws.

Shareholder requests to nominate directors or to bring any other matter before our 2019 annual

shareholders’ meeting, whether or not they wish to include their candidate or proposal in our proxy materials,
must be received by our Secretary by the deadlines specified in “Other Matters — Deadlines for Submitting
Shareholder Nominations and Proposals for the 2019 Annual Meeting.”

The summaries above of the advance notification and proxy access provisions of our bylaws are qualified in
their entirety by reference to the full text of Section 5 of Article IV of our bylaws. You may obtain a full copy of
our bylaws by reviewing our reports filed with the SEC, by accessing our website at www.centurylink.com, or by
contacting our Secretary in the manner specified below under “Other Matters.”

Agreements to Nominate Certain Directors. In connection with the Level 3 Combination, on October 31,

2016 we entered into a Shareholder Rights Agreement with STT Crossing Ltd. (“STT Crossing”), which was
Level 3’s principal shareholder as of such date. In early 2018, STT Crossing assigned its rights under this
agreement (the “Shareholder Rights Agreement”) to two of its affiliates, Everitt Investments Pte. Ltd and Aranda
Investments Pte. Ltd. (the “STT Affiliates”). Pursuant to the Shareholder Rights Agreement, the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee is currently obligated to nominate the individual designated by the STT
Affiliates for election to the Board, subject to (i) the fiduciary duties of the members of that committee, (ii) any
applicable regulation or listing requirement of the New York Stock Exchange and (iii) any applicable provisions
of any network security agreement between us, STT Crossing and a government agency. Following the execution
of the Shareholder Rights Agreement, STT Crossing designated Steven T. Clontz to be added to our Board upon
consummation of the Level 3 Combination, and in early 2018 the STT Affiliates selected Mr. Clontz as their
designee. The Board is required to recommend that the shareholders vote in favor of the STT Affiliates’ designee
and we are required to use all reasonable efforts to cause the individual to be elected as a member of the Board.
In making its recommendation to the full Board regarding the nominee for election to our Board at the meeting,
the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considered, among other things, Mr. Clontz’s extensive
experience in the telecommunications industry. For additional information about the Shareholder Rights
Agreement, please see the full copy of the agreement that we have filed as an exhibit to our prior SEC reports.

On October 31, 2016, we also agreed pursuant to the terms of our merger agreement with Level 3 to appoint

to our Board three members of the Level 3 Board selected by us from any of the Level 3 directors who are
unaffiliated with STT Crossing. During 2017, we selected Messrs. Chilton, Glenn and Storey to serve on our
Board. Under the merger agreement, we further agreed to cause such appointed directors to be nominated for
election to the Board at the first annual meeting following the closing of the combination on November 1, 2017.

Role of Nominating Committee. The Nominating Committee will consider candidates properly and timely

nominated by shareholders in accordance with our bylaws. Upon receipt of any such nominations, the
Nominating Committee will review the submission for compliance with our bylaws, including determining if the
proposed nominee meets the bylaw qualifications for service as a director. These provisions disqualify any
person who (i) fails to respond satisfactorily to any inquiry for information to enable us to make certifications
required by the Federal Communications Commission under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, (ii) has been
arrested or convicted of certain specified drug offenses or engaged in actions that could lead to such an arrest or
conviction or (iii) fails to furnish any materials or agreements required to be provided by director nominees under
our bylaws, or makes false statements or materially misleading statements or omissions in connection therewith.

From time to time, we have added to our Board directors who previously served as directors of companies

we acquired. For instance, in connection with acquiring Embarq in 2009, Qwest in 2011 and Level 3 in 2017, we
added several new directors to our Board who previously served as directors of those companies, seven of whom
are nominees to be re-elected at the meeting. Under the agreements described above under the heading
“— Agreements to Nominate Certain Directors,” we agreed to nominate Messrs. Chilton, Clontz, Glenn and
Storey to stand for election at the meeting.

Under our corporate governance guidelines, the Nominating Committee assesses director candidates based

on their independence, diversity, character, skills and experience in the context of the needs of the Board.
Although the guidelines permit the Nominating Committee to adopt additional selection guidelines or criteria, it
has chosen not to do so. Instead, the Nominating Committee annually assesses skills and characteristics then
required by the Board based on its membership and needs at the time of the assessment. In evaluating the needs
of the Board, the Nominating Committee considers the qualifications of incumbent directors and consults with
other members of the Board and senior management. In addition, the Nominating Committee seeks candidates
committed to representing the interests of all shareholders and not any particular constituency. The Nominating
Committee believes this flexible approach enables it to respond to changes caused by director vacancies and
industry developments.

15

In connection with assessing the needs of the Board, the Nominating Committee has sought individuals who

possess skill and experience in a diverse range of fields. The Nominating Committee also has sought a mix of
individuals from inside and outside of the communications industry. The table above listing biographical data
about our directors includes a listing of the key qualifications, experiences and skills that the Nominating
Committee and Board reviewed in connection with nominating or re-nominating them for service on the Board.
In light of our current business and operations, we believe the following skills and experience are particularly
important:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

senior leadership experience

industry expertise

financial, accounting or capital markets expertise

public company board experience

business combination experience

engineering, product development or similar technical expertise

brand marketing expertise

government, public policy, regulatory or political expertise

labor or human resources expertise

international business experience

legal expertise.

In connection with determining the current composition of the Board, the Nominating Committee has

assessed the diverse range of skills and experience of our directors outlined above, coupled with the judgment
that each has exhibited and the knowledge of our operations that each has acquired in connection with their
service on the Board. Although it does not have a formal diversity policy, the Nominating Committee believes
that our directors possess a diverse range of backgrounds, perspectives, skills and experiences.

Although we do not have a history of receiving director nominations from shareholders, the Nominating

Committee envisions that it would evaluate any such candidate on the same terms as other proposed nominees,
but would place a substantial premium on retaining incumbent directors who are familiar with our management,
operations, business, industry, strategies and competitive position, and who have previously demonstrated a
proven ability to provide valuable contributions to the Board and CenturyLink.

Compensation Setting Process

The Compensation Committee hires consulting firms to assist it in setting executive and director

compensation. In June 2015, the Committee retained Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC, following a
nationwide search to replace Hay Group, which advised the Committee for the previous six years. For additional
information on the processes used by the Committee to set executive compensation, see “Compensation
Discussion and Analysis — Our Policies, Processes and Guidelines Related to Executive Compensation.”

Board’s Role in Overseeing Risk Management

Our Board oversees our Company’s risk management function, which is a coordinated effort among our
business units, our senior leadership, our risk management personnel and our internal auditors. Our directors
typically discharge their risk oversight responsibilities by having management provide periodic briefing and
educational presentations. In some cases, including major new acquisitions, capital expenditures, product
development or strategic investments, the full Board participates in risk oversight. In most cases involving

16

recurring systemic risk, a Board committee is primarily responsible for risk oversight. For several decades, our
Board has maintained a Risk Evaluation Committee, which is responsible for assisting management to identify,
monitor, and manage recurring risks to our business, properties and employees. The Risk Evaluation Committee
regularly monitors our litigation, enterprise risk assessments, network operations, systems integration initiatives,
insurance coverages and the status of our labor relations, and is also responsible for overseeing our ethics and
compliance program. As part of its risk assessment oversight, the Risk Evaluation Committee receives quarterly
reports on cybersecurity, which typically include reports on recent cyber intrusions, mitigation steps taken in
response to those intrusions and ongoing cybersecurity initiatives. The Board’s other committees are responsible
for overseeing specific risks, particularly the Audit Committee with respect to financial, tax and accounting risks
and the Compensation Committee with respect to compensation risks. For a discussion of the Compensation
Committee’s risk analysis, see “Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Our Policies, Processes and
Guidelines Related to Executive Compensation — Our Compensation Decision-Making Process — Risk
Assessment.” The Board regularly receives reports from each of these committees, and periodically receives
enterprise risk assessment reports from management.

Board’s Role in Setting Strategy

At most of the Board’s quarterly in-person meetings, at least one of the agenda items involves a review of

the strategies to be pursued by the Company as a whole or by one of its lines of business. For most of the past 15
years, the Board has also scheduled a separate off-site multi-day retreat to review industry developments and
long-term strategies. From time to time at these meetings or retreats, we invite outside experts or consultants to
share their views on issues impacting our strategic options. As discussed further under “Compensation
Discussion and Analysis,” our Compensation Committee reviews our strategies annually to ensure that the
performance metrics used in our executive compensation programs appropriately incentivize the pursuit of our
short and long-term strategic goals.

Top Board Leadership Positions and Structure

Since 2009, the Board has annually elected a non-executive Chairman. In May 2017, the Board elected

Harvey P. Perry to this position.

The Board believes that the separation of the Chairman and CEO positions has functioned effectively over

the past several years. Separating these positions has allowed our CEO to have primary responsibility for the
operational leadership and strategic direction of our business, while allowing our Chairman to lead the Board in
its fundamental role of providing guidance to and separate oversight of management. While our bylaws and
corporate governance guidelines do not require our Chairman and CEO positions to be separate, the Board
believes that delegating responsibilities between our Chairman and our CEO has been the appropriate leadership
structure for our Company over the past decade, which have been marked by rapid growth in our operations and
a substantial change in our product offerings and our industry. As noted above under “— Independence and
Tenure,” the Board named W. Bruce Hanks, the Company’s Vice Chairman of the Board, as lead independent
director in early 2018. Prior to then, Mr. Perry performed all duties assigned to the Chairman and lead director.
The responsibilities of the Chairman and the lead director are described above under “— Governance
Guidelines.”

Our Board periodically reviews its leadership structure and may make such changes in the future as it deems

appropriate. The Board believes that its programs for overseeing risk would be effective under a variety of top
leadership structures, and, accordingly, this factor has not materially affected its current choice of leadership
structure.

As explained further on our website, you may contact either our Chairman, lead independent director or any
other director by writing a letter addressed to the Chairman, Lead Independent Director or any other director c/o
Post Office Box 5061, Monroe, Louisiana 71211, or by sending an email to boardinquiries@centurylink.com.

RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR

(Item 2 on Proxy or Voting Instruction Card)

The Audit Committee of the Board has appointed KPMG LLP as our independent auditor for the fiscal year

ending December 31, 2018, and we are submitting that appointment to our shareholders for ratification on an
advisory basis at the meeting. Although shareholder ratification of KPMG’s appointment is not legally required,
we are submitting this matter to the shareholders, as in the past, as a matter of good corporate practice. In
determining whether to reappoint KPMG as our independent auditor, the Audit Committee considered a number
of factors, including, among others, the firm’s qualifications, industry expertise, prior performance, control
procedures, proposed staffing and the reasonableness of its fees on an absolute basis and as compared with fees
paid by comparable companies.

If the shareholders fail to vote on an advisory basis in favor of the appointment, the Audit Committee will

reconsider whether to retain KPMG, and may appoint that firm or another without re-submitting the matter to the
shareholders. Even if the shareholders ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee may, in its discretion, select a
different independent auditor at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the
Company’s best interests.

In connection with the audit of the 2018 financial statements, we entered into an engagement letter with

KPMG which sets forth the terms by which KPMG will provide audit services to us. Any future disputes between
KPMG and us under that letter will be subject to certain specified alternative dispute resolution procedures, none
of which are intended to restrict the remedies that our shareholders might independently pursue against KPMG.

The following table lists the aggregate fees and costs billed to us by KPMG and its affiliates for the 2016

and 2017 services identified below:

accounting standards. Additionally, the amounts billed in 2016 and 2017 include $1,891,000 and $702,000,
respectively, for services rendered in connection with auditing separate carve-out financial statements
related to divestiture-related transactions. Amounts exclude fees paid to KPMG by Level 3 prior to its
acquisition by CenturyLink of $5,278,000 and $3,515,000 in 2016 and 2017, respectively.
Includes the cost of preparing agreed upon procedures reports and providing general accounting consulting
services. Amounts exclude fees paid to KPMG by Level 3 prior to its acquisition by CenturyLink of
$386,000 and $172,000 in 2016 and 2017, respectively.
Includes costs associated with (i) general tax planning, consultation and compliance (which were
approximately $700,000 in 2016 and $900,000 in 2017) and (ii) tax planning and consultation related to
transactions and divestitures (which were approximately $1,400,000 in 2016 and $1,200,000 in 2017).
Amounts exclude fees paid to KPMG by Level 3 prior to its acquisition by CenturyLink of $8,000 and $0 in
2016 and 2017, respectively.

The Audit Committee maintains written procedures that require it to annually review and pre-approve the
scope of all services to be performed by our independent auditor. This review includes an evaluation of whether
the provision of non-audit services by our independent auditor is compatible with maintaining the auditor’s
independence in providing audit and audit-related services. The Committee’s procedures prohibit the
independent auditor from providing any non-audit services unless the service is permitted under applicable law
and is pre-approved by the Audit Committee or its Chairman. The Chairman is authorized to pre-approve projects
if the total anticipated cost of all projects pre-approved by him during any fiscal quarter does not exceed
$250,000. The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Company’s independent auditor to provide up to $75,000
per quarter of miscellaneous permitted tax services that do not constitute discrete and separate projects. The
Chairman and the Chief Financial Officer are required periodically to advise the full Committee of the scope and
cost of services not pre-approved by the full Committee. Although applicable regulations waive these
pre-approval requirements in certain limited circumstances, the Audit Committee did not use these waiver
provisions in either 2016 or 2017.

KPMG has advised us that one or more of its partners will be present at the meeting. We understand that

these representatives will be available to respond to appropriate questions and will have an opportunity to make a
statement if they desire to do so.

Ratification of KPMG’s appointment as our independent auditor for 2018 will require the affirmative vote

of the holders of at least a majority of the votes cast on the proposal at the meeting.

The Board unanimously recommends a vote FOR this proposal.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT

Management is responsible for our internal controls and financial reporting process. Our independent
auditor is responsible for performing an independent audit of our consolidated financial statements and the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and to issue reports thereon. As more fully
described in its charter, the Audit Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in its general oversight of
these processes and for appointing and overseeing the independent auditor, including reviewing their
qualifications, independence and performance.

In this context, the Committee has met and held discussions with management and our internal auditors and

independent auditor for 2017, KPMG LLP. Management represented to the Committee that our consolidated
financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted U.S. accounting principles. The
Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and KPMG the consolidated financial statements, and
management’s report and KPMG’s report and attestation on internal control over financial reporting in
accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Committee also discussed with KPMG
matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees.

19

Among other matters, over the course of the past year, the Committee also:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

reviewed the scope of and overall plans for the annual audit and the internal audit program, including a
review of critical accounting policies, critical accounting estimates, and significant unusual
transactions;

reviewed a report by the independent auditor describing the independent auditor’s internal quality
control procedures;

reviewed the performance of the lead engagement partner of our independent auditor;

reviewed and discussed each quarterly and annual earnings press release before issuance;

received periodic reports from the director of internal audit, and met with other members of the internal
audit staff;

reviewed and approved plans to integrate Level 3’s internal audit operations into our internal audit
operations;

received periodic reports pursuant to our policy for the submission and confidential treatment of
communications from employees and others about accounting, internal controls and auditing matters;

reviewed with management the scope and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;

• met quarterly in separate executive sessions, including private sessions with the Company’s

independent auditors, internal auditors and top executives;

•

•

received a report with regard to any hiring of former employees of KPMG; and

as discussed in greater detail under “Corporate Governance — Risk Oversight,” coordinated with the
Risk Evaluation Committee to oversee the Company’s risk management function, especially with
respect to the financial, tax and accounting risks.

KPMG also provided to the Committee the written disclosures required by the applicable requirements of

the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent auditor’s communications with
audit committees concerning independence. The Committee discussed with KPMG that firm’s independence, and
considered the effects that the provision of non-audit services may have on KPMG’s independence.

Based on and in reliance upon the reviews and discussions referred to above, and subject to the limitations
on the role and responsibilities of the Committee referred to in its charter, the Committee recommended that the
Board of Directors include the audited consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2017.

In addition to the Company’s corporate compliance program and hotline, the Audit Committee has

established procedures for the receipt and evaluation, on a confidential basis, of any complaints or concerns
regarding our accounting, auditing, financial reporting or related matters. To report such matters, please send
written correspondence to Audit Committee Chair, c/o Post Office Box 4364, Monroe, Louisiana 71211.

If you would like additional information on the responsibilities of the Audit Committee, please refer to its

charter, which you can obtain in the manner described above under “Corporate Governance — Access to
Information.”

PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE

CENTURYLINK 2018 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN

(Item 3 on Proxy or Voting Instruction Card)

Our Board believes that our growth depends upon the efforts of our officers, directors, employees,

consultants, and advisors, and that the proposed CenturyLink 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”) will
provide an effective means of attracting, retaining, and motivating qualified key personnel while encouraging
long-term focus on maximizing shareholder value. The 2018 Plan has been adopted by our Board, subject to
approval by our shareholders at the annual meeting.

The principal features of the 2018 Plan are summarized below. However, this summary is qualified in its

entirety by reference to by the full text of the 2018 Plan, as attached to this proxy statement as Appendix A.
Because this is a summary, it may not contain all the information that you may consider to be important.
Therefore, we recommend that you read Appendix A carefully before you decide how to vote on this proposal.

Purpose of the Proposal

We believe that providing officers, directors, employees, consultants and advisors with a proprietary interest

in the growth and performance of our Company is crucial to stimulating individual performance while at the
same time enhancing shareholder value. While we believe that employee equity ownership is a significant
contributing factor in achieving strong corporate performance, we recognize that increasing the number of
available shares under incentive plans may potentially dilute the equity ownership of our current shareholders.

Prior to the Level 3 Combination, we had one active equity plan under which we granted long-term

incentive awards — the Amended and Restated CenturyLink 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2011 Plan”),
which was most recently approved by our shareholders in 2016. In connection with the Level 3 Combination, we
assumed the Legacy Level 3 Communications, Inc. Stock Plan (the “Legacy Level 3 Plan” and, together with the
2011 Plan, our “current equity plans”). As noted in the chart under the heading “— Equity Compensation Plan
Information”, as of December 31, 2017, we had 43,570,576 shares available for grant under our current equity
plans as of December 31, 2017. However, the majority of these shares are reserved for issuance under the Legacy
Level 3 Plan, which, under NYSE rules, cannot be used to make grants to anyone who was employed by
CenturyLink or our then-existing subsidiaries on the day prior to the closing of the Level 3 Combination.

Therefore, we are proposing adoption of the 2018 Plan in order to replace both of our current equity plans

with a single, state-of-the-art equity plan free of the limitations contained in our current equity plans. We believe
that adoption of the 2018 Plan is integral to our continued ability to attract, retain, and motivate key stakeholders
in a manner aligned with the interests of our shareholders.

Assuming that our shareholders approve the 2018 Plan at the annual meeting, we will not make any future

grants under either of our current equity plans. However, if shareholders do not approve the 2018 Plan at the
annual meeting, we will continue to use our current equity plans but, given the limitations on use of those plans
discussed above, we may be required to re-evaluate our compensation structure to ensure that it remains
competitive. Specifically, if the 2018 Plan is not approved, the Company may be required to increase the cash-
based component of employee compensation, which could reduce the alignment of employee and shareholder
interests.

Summary of the 2018 Plan

Administration of the 2018 Plan. The Human Resources and Compensation Committee (or a subcommittee

thereof) will generally administer the 2018 Plan and has the authority to make awards under the 2018 Plan,
including setting the terms of the awards. The Committee also generally has the authority to interpret the 2018
Plan, to establish any rules or regulations relating to the 2018 Plan, and to make any other determination that it

21

believes necessary or advisable for proper administration of the 2018 Plan. Subject to the limitations specified in
the 2018 Plan, the Committee may delegate its authority to our Chief Executive Officer or his designee with
respect to grants to employees or consultants who are not subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934.

Eligibility. Key employees, officers, and directors of CenturyLink and our consultants or advisors are

eligible to receive awards (“Incentives”) under the 2018 Plan. Based on current estimates, we anticipate that
approximately 2,175 officers and 11 non-employee directors would be eligible to receive Incentives under the
2018 Plan. Incentives may be granted in any one or a combination of the following forms: incentive stock options
under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), non-qualified stock options,
stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and Other Stock-Based
Awards (as defined below). Each of these types of Incentives is discussed in more detail in “Types of Incentives”
below.

Shares Issuable under the 2018 Plan. A total of 34,600,000 of our Common Shares are authorized for

issuance under the 2018 Plan. This figure represents approximately 3.2% of the outstanding Common Shares as
of our record date of April 6, 2018. The closing price of a Common Share on the record date, as quoted on the
NYSE, was $17.21.

Limitations on Shares Issuable under the 2018 Plan. Under the 2018 Plan, Incentives relating to no more

than 1,500,000 Common Shares may be granted to a single participant in any fiscal year. A maximum of
34,600,000 Common Shares may be issued upon exercise of options intended to qualify as incentive stock
options under the Code. The maximum value of Incentives that may be granted under the 2018 Plan to each
non-employee director of CenturyLink during a single calendar year is $500,000.

Share Counting. For purposes of determining the maximum number of Common Shares available for

delivery under the 2018 Plan, shares that are not delivered because an Incentive is forfeited, canceled, or expired
will return to the 2018 Plan and be available for reissuance. In addition, any Common Shares subject to an
Incentive originally granted under the 2011 Plan that are not delivered because, following shareholders’ approval
of the 2018 Plan, such Incentive is forfeited, canceled, or expired, will also be available for issuance or delivery
as a new Incentive under the 2018 Plan. However, Common Shares subject to an Incentive will not be recycled if
(a) they are tendered in payment of exercise or base price of a stock option or stock-settled SAR; (b) they were
covered by, but not issued upon settlement of, stock-settled SARs; or (c) they were delivered or withheld by the
Company to satisfy any tax withholding obligation related to stock options or stock-settled SARs. If an Incentive,
by its terms, may only be settled in cash, it will not impact the number of Common Shares available for issuance
under the 2018 Plan.

Adjustments to Shares Issuable under the 2018 Plan. Proportionate adjustments will be made to all of the

share limitations provided in the 2018 Plan, including shares subject to outstanding Incentives, in the event of
any recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, or other comparable
change in our Common Shares, and the terms of any Incentive will be adjusted to the extent appropriate to
provide participants with the same relative rights before and after the occurrence of any such event.

Minimum Vesting Periods. Except for any Incentives that are issued in payment of cash amounts earned

under our short-term incentive program, all Incentives must be granted with a minimum vesting period of at least
one year without providing for incremental vesting during that first year.

Dividends and Dividend Equivalents. The 2018 Plan provides that the Committee may grant dividends or

dividend equivalent rights on certain types of awards (restricted stock, RSUs, and Other Stock-Based Awards). If
the Committee elects to grant such rights, any such rights must vest and pay out or be forfeited in tandem with
underlying Incentives rather than during the vesting period.

22

Amendments to the 2018 Plan. Our Board may amend or discontinue the 2018 Plan at any time. However,

our shareholders must approve any amendment to the 2018 Plan that would:

• materially increase the number of Common Shares that may be issued through the 2018 Plan,

• materially increase the benefits accruing to participants,

• materially expand the classes of persons eligible to participate,

•

expand the types of awards available for grant,

• materially extend the term of the 2018 Plan,

• materially reduce the price at which Common Shares may be offered through the 2018 Plan, or

•

permit the repricing of an option or stock appreciation right.

Duration of the 2018 Plan. No Incentives may be granted under the 2018 Plan after May 23, 2028.

Types of Incentives. Each type of Incentive that may be granted under the 2018 Plan is described below.

Stock Options. A stock option is a right to purchase Common Shares from CenturyLink. The Committee

will determine the number and exercise price of the options, and the time or times that the options become
exercisable, provided that the option exercise price may not be less than the fair market value of a Common
Share on the date of grant, except for an option granted in substitution of an outstanding award in an acquisition.
The term of an option will also be determined by the Committee, but may not exceed ten years. The Committee
may accelerate the exercisability of any stock option at any time. As noted above, the Committee may not,
without the prior approval of our shareholders, decrease the exercise price for any outstanding option after the
date of grant. In addition, an outstanding option may not, as of any date that the option has a per share exercise
price that is greater than the then-current fair market value of a Common Share, be surrendered to us as
consideration for the grant of a new option with a lower exercise price, another Incentive, a cash payment, or
Common Shares, unless approved by our shareholders. Incentive stock options will be subject to certain
additional requirements necessary in order to qualify as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code.

The option exercise price may be paid:

•

•

•

•

•

in cash or by check,

in Common Shares,

through a “cashless” exercise arrangement with a broker approved by CenturyLink,

through a net exercise procedure if approved by the Committee, or

in any other manner authorized by the Committee.

Stock Appreciation Rights. A stock appreciation right, or SAR, is a right to receive, without payment to
CenturyLink, a number of Common Shares determined by dividing the product of the number of shares as to
which the stock appreciation right is exercised and the amount of the appreciation in each share by the fair
market value of a share on the date of exercise of the right. The Committee will determine the base price used to
measure share appreciation (which may not be less than the fair market value of a Common Share on the date of
grant), whether the right may be paid in cash, and the number and term of stock appreciation rights, provided that
the term of a SAR may not exceed ten years. The Committee may accelerate the exercisability of any SAR at any
time. The 2018 Plan restricts decreases in the base price and certain exchanges of SARs on terms similar to the
restrictions described above for options.

Restricted Stock. The Committee may grant Common Shares subject to restrictions on sale, pledge, or other

transfer by the recipient for a certain restricted period. All shares of restricted stock will be subject to such
restrictions as the Committee may provide in an agreement with the participant, including provisions that may

23

obligate the participant to forfeit the shares to us in the event of termination of employment or if specified
performance goals or targets are not met. Subject to restrictions provided in the participant’s incentive agreement
and the 2018 Plan, a participant receiving restricted stock shall have all of the rights of a shareholder as to such
shares, including the right to receive dividends although, as noted above, any such dividends would not be paid
currently but would vest or be forfeited in tandem with the related shares of restricted stock.

Restricted Stock Units. A restricted stock unit, or RSU, represents the right to receive from CenturyLink one
Common Share on a specific future vesting or payment date. All RSUs will be subject to such restrictions as the
Committee may provide in an agreement with the participant, including provisions that may obligate the
participant to forfeit the RSUs in the event of termination of employment or if specified performance goals or
targets are not met. Subject to the restrictions provided in the incentive agreement and the 2018 Plan, a
participant receiving RSUs has no rights of a shareholder until Common Shares are issued to him or her. RSUs
may be granted with dividend equivalent rights. Any such dividend equivalent rights would not be paid currently
but would vest or be forfeited in tandem with the related RSUs.

Other Stock-Based Awards. The 2018 Plan also permits the Committee to grant to participants awards of

Common Shares and other awards that are denominated in, payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to,
or are otherwise based on the value of, or the appreciation in value of, Common Shares (referred to herein as
“Other Stock-Based Awards”). The Committee has discretion to determine the times at which such awards are to
be made, the size of such awards, the form of payment, and all other conditions of such awards, including any
restrictions, deferral periods, or performance requirements.

Termination of Employment. In the event that a participant ceases to be an employee of CenturyLink or its

subsidiaries or to provide services to us for any reason, including death, disability, early retirement, or normal
retirement, any Incentives may be exercised, shall vest, or shall expire at such times as provided in the applicable
incentive agreement or as may be otherwise determined by the Committee.

Change in Control. Upon a change in control of CenturyLink, as defined in the Incentive Plan or the
applicable incentive agreement, the vesting of time-based Incentives will only occur if the participant has a
contemporaneous or subsequent termination of employment. In addition, the payout of any performance-based
Incentives upon a change of control may not exceed the greater of a pro-rata payout based on target performance
or payout of the Incentive based on actual performance. However, within certain time periods and under certain
circumstances, the Committee may:

•

•

require that all outstanding Incentives be exercised by a certain date;

require the surrender to CenturyLink of some or all outstanding Incentives in exchange for a stock or
cash payment for each Incentive equal in value to the per share change of control value, calculated as
described in the 2018 Plan, over the exercise or base price;

• make any equitable adjustment to outstanding Incentives as the Committee deems necessary to reflect

our corporate changes; or

•

provide that an Incentive shall become an Incentive relating to the number and class of shares of stock
or other securities or property (including cash) to which the participant would have been entitled in
connection with the change of control transaction if the participant had been a shareholder.

Transferability of Incentives. No Incentives granted under the 2018 Plan may be transferred, pledged,

assigned, or otherwise encumbered by a participant except: (a) by will; (b) by the laws of descent and
distribution; (c) if permitted by the Committee and so provided in the applicable incentive agreement, pursuant to
a domestic relations order, as defined in the Code; or (d) as to options only, if permitted by the Committee and so
provided in the applicable incentive agreement, to immediate family members or to a partnership, limited
liability company or trust for which the sole owners, members or beneficiaries are the participant or immediate
family members.

24

Tax Withholding. We may withhold from any payments or share issuances under the 2018 Plan, or collect
as a condition of payment, any taxes required by law to be withheld. The participant may, but is not required to,
satisfy his or her withholding tax obligation by electing to deliver currently-owned Common Shares, or to have
us withhold shares from the shares the participant would otherwise receive, in either case having a value equal to
the maximum amount required to be withheld. This election must be made prior to the date on which the amount
of tax to be withheld is determined. The Committee has the right to disapprove of any such election, except for
participants who are subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Purchase of Incentives. The Committee may approve the repurchase by CenturyLink of an unexercised or

unvested Incentive from the holder by mutual agreement, so long as the repurchase would not constitute the
repricing of an option or SAR.

Federal Income Tax Consequences

The federal income tax consequences related to the issuance of the different types of Incentives that may be
awarded under the 2018 Plan are summarized below. Participants who are granted Incentives under the 2018 Plan
should consult their own tax advisors to determine the tax consequences based on their particular circumstances.

Stock Options. A participant who is granted a stock option normally will not realize any income, nor will

we normally receive any deduction for federal income tax purposes, in the year the option is granted.

When a non-qualified stock option granted under the 2018 Plan is exercised, the participant will realize

ordinary income measured by the difference between the aggregate purchase price of the shares acquired and the
aggregate fair market value of the shares acquired on the exercise date and, subject to the limitations of
Section 162(m) (as described below), we will be entitled to a deduction in the year the option is exercised equal
to the amount the participant is required to treat as ordinary income.

Incentive stock options may only be granted to employees. An employee generally will not recognize any
income upon the exercise of any incentive stock option, but the excess of the fair market value of the shares at
the time of exercise over the option price will be an item of tax preference, which may, depending on particular
factors relating to the employee, subject the employee to the alternative minimum tax imposed by Section 55 of
the Code. The alternative minimum tax is imposed in addition to the federal individual income tax, and it is
intended to ensure that individual taxpayers do not completely avoid federal income tax by using preference
items. An employee will recognize capital gain or loss in the amount of the difference between the exercise price
and the sale price on the sale or exchange of shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an incentive stock option,
provided the employee does not dispose of such shares within two years from the date of grant and one year from
the date of exercise of the incentive stock option (the holding periods). An employee disposing of such shares
before the expiration of the holding periods will recognize ordinary income generally equal to the difference
between the option price and the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise. The remaining gain, if
any, will be capital gain. We will not be entitled to a federal income tax deduction in connection with the
exercise of an incentive stock option, except where the employee disposes of the shares received upon exercise
before the expiration of the holding periods.

If the exercise price of a non-qualified option is paid by the surrender of previously-owned shares, the basis

and the holding period of the previously-owned shares carry over to the same number of shares received in
exchange for the previously-owned shares. The compensation income recognized on exercise of these options is
added to the basis of the shares received. If the exercised option is an incentive stock option and the shares
surrendered were acquired through the exercise of an incentive stock option and have not been held for the
holding periods, the optionee will recognize income on such exchange, and the basis of the shares received will
be equal to the fair market value of the shares surrendered. If the applicable holding period has been met on the
date of exercise, there will be no income recognition and the basis and the holding period of the previously
owned shares will carry over to the same number of shares received in exchange, and the remaining shares will
begin a new holding period and have a zero basis.

25

Stock Appreciation Rights. Generally, a participant who is granted a stock appreciation right under the 2018

Plan will not recognize any taxable income at the time of the grant. The participant will recognize ordinary
income upon exercise equal to the amount of cash or the fair market value of the shares received on the day they
are received.

In general, there are no federal income tax deductions allowed to CenturyLink upon the grant of stock

appreciation rights. Upon the exercise of the stock appreciation right, however, we will be entitled to a deduction
equal to the amount of ordinary income that the participant is required to recognize as a result of the exercise,
provided that the deduction is not otherwise disallowed under Section 162(m).

Restricted Stock. Unless the participant makes an election to accelerate recognition of the income to the
date of grant under Section 83(b) of the Code (as described below), the participant will not recognize income,
and we will not be allowed a tax deduction, at the time the restricted stock award is granted. When the
restrictions lapse, the participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the shares as of
that date, and we will be allowed a corresponding federal income tax deduction at that time, subject to any
applicable limitations under Section 162(m). If the participant files an election under Section 83(b) of the Code
within 30 days of the date of grant of restricted stock, the participant will recognize ordinary income as of the
date of the grant equal to the fair market value of the shares as of that date, and we will be allowed a
corresponding federal income tax deduction at that time, subject to any applicable limitations under
Section 162(m). Any future appreciation in the shares will be taxable to the participant at capital gains rates. If
the shares are later forfeited, however, the participant will not be able to recover the tax previously paid pursuant
to a Section 83(b) election.

Restricted Stock Units. A participant will not be deemed to have received taxable income upon the grant of

restricted stock units. The participant will be deemed to have received taxable ordinary income at such time as
shares are distributed with respect to the restricted stock units in an amount equal to the fair market value of the
shares distributed to the participant. Upon the distribution of shares to a participant with respect to restricted
stock units, we will ordinarily be entitled to a deduction for federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to
the taxable ordinary income of the participant, subject to any applicable limitations under Section 162(m). The
basis of the shares received will equal the amount of taxable ordinary income recognized by the participant upon
receipt of such shares.

Other Stock-Based Awards. Generally, a participant who is granted an Other Stock-Based Award under the
2018 Plan will recognize ordinary income at the time the cash or Common Shares associated with the award are
received. If shares are received, the ordinary income will be equal to the excess of the fair market value of the
shares received over any amount paid by the participant in exchange for the shares.

In the year that the participant recognizes ordinary taxable income in respect of such Incentive, we will be

entitled to a deduction for federal income tax purposes equal to the amount of ordinary income that the
participant is required to recognize, provided that the deduction is not otherwise disallowed under
Section 162(m).

Section 162(m). Section 162(m) of the Code limits the amount of compensation paid to certain covered

employees that we may deduct for federal income tax purposes to $1 million per employee per year. As revised
by federal tax reform legislation passed in December 2017, Section 162(m)’s definition of “covered employees”
includes any individual who served as our CEO or CFO at any time during the taxable year plus the three other
most highly-compensated officers (other than the CEO and CFO) for the taxable year. Once an individual
becomes a covered employee for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016, that individual will
remain a covered employee for all future years, including after termination of employment or even death. As a
result, compensation payable to a covered employee under the 2018 Plan that might otherwise be deductible may
not be deductible if all compensation paid to the employee for the taxable year exceeds $1 million.

26

Section 409A of the Code. If any Incentive constitutes non-qualified deferred compensation under

Section 409A, it will be necessary that the Incentive be structured to comply with Section 409A to avoid the
imposition of additional tax, penalties, and interest on the participant.

Tax Consequences of a Change of Control. If, upon a change of control of CenturyLink, the exercisability,

vesting, or payout of an Incentive is accelerated, any excess on the date of the change of control of the fair
market value of the shares or cash issued under accelerated Incentives over the purchase price of such shares, if
any, may be characterized as “parachute payments” (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) if the sum
of such amounts and any other such contingent payments received by the employee exceeds an amount equal to
three times the “base amount” for such employee. The base amount generally is the average of the annual
compensation of the employee for the five years preceding such change in ownership or control. An “excess
parachute payment,” with respect to any employee, is the excess of the parachute payments to such person, in the
aggregate, over and above such person’s base amount. If the amounts received by an employee upon a change of
control are characterized as parachute payments, the employee will be subject to a 20% excise tax on the excess
parachute payment and we will be denied any deduction with respect to such excess parachute payment.

The foregoing discussion summarizes the federal income tax consequences of Incentives that may be

granted under the 2018 Plan based on current provisions of the Code, which are subject to change. This summary
does not cover any foreign, state, or local tax consequences.

Vote Required

Approval of the 2018 Plan requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the votes cast

on the proposal.

The Board recommends that you vote FOR this proposal.

units do not have an exercise price, those awards were excluded from the calculation of the exercise prices
disclosed in this column (b).

(2) The shares available for issuance disclosed in this column relate to our two current equity plans: (i) the 2011

Plan (included under “Equity Compensation Plans approved by shareholders”) and (ii) the Legacy Level 3
Plan, which was approved by Level 3, but not CenturyLink, shareholders (and thus is included under
“Equity Compensation Plans not approved by shareholders”). A description of the Legacy Level 3 Plan
follows this chart. If our shareholders approve the 2018 Plan at the meeting, no additional shares will be
issued in the future from either of the 2011 Plan or the Legacy Level 3 Plan.

27

In connection with the Level 3 Combination, we assumed the Legacy Level 3 Plan. The Legacy Level 3

Plan was approved by Level 3’s shareholders on May 21, 2015 and no new grants may be made under the Legacy
Level 3 Plan after May 21, 2025, although awards made prior to that date may remain outstanding beyond that
date. In accordance with NYSE rules, we will not make grants from the Legacy Level 3 Plan to those employees
and directors who, prior to the Level 3 Combination, were employed by or provided services to CenturyLink or
our then-existing subsidiaries. The Legacy Level 3 Plan is currently administered by our Compensation
Committee, which may delegate some of its authority to officers and employees of the Company, subject to
certain exceptions. As noted in the table above, after adjustment as provided in the merger agreement, a total of
35,005,062 Common Shares remained available for issuance under the Legacy Level 3 Plan at December 31,
2017 (out of an overall total of 48,677,624 shares reserved for issuance). Currently under the Legacy Level 3
Plan, the Committee may make awards of qualified or nonqualified stock options with a maximum term of 10
years, restricted stock, RSUs, SARs, performance awards, and Other Stock-Based Awards. Shares surrendered in
payment of the exercise price of options or SARs or in payment of withholding taxes are not eligible for
reissuance under the Legacy Level 3 Plan. Our Board amended the Legacy Level 3 Plan as of the Closing Date
to, among other things, reflect these merger-adjusted share limitations and conform the administration and
change of control provisions to those of our other outstanding equity incentive plans.

As noted above, if shareholders approve the 2018 Plan as proposed, we will make no future issuances under

either of our two equity incentive plans (the 2011 Plan or the Legacy Level 3 Plan).

28

ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

(Item 4 on Proxy or Voting Instruction Card)

Each year since 2011 we have provided our shareholders the opportunity to vote on a non-binding, advisory

resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in our annual proxy
statements pursuant to the rules of the SEC.

Under our executive compensation programs, our named executive officers are rewarded for achieving
specific annual and long-term goals, as well as increased shareholder value. We believe this structure aligns
executive pay with our financial performance and the creation of sustainable shareholder value. The
Compensation Committee of our Board continually reviews our executive compensation programs to ensure they
achieve the goals of aligning our compensation with both current market practices and your interests as
shareholders. For additional information on our executive compensation, we urge you to read the “Compensation
Discussion and Analysis” and “Executive Compensation” sections of this proxy statement.

At the meeting, we will ask you to vote, in an advisory manner, to approve the overall compensation of our

named executive officers, as described in this proxy statement, including the Compensation Discussion and
Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosures. This proposal,
commonly known as a “say-on-pay” proposal, gives you the opportunity to express your views. This advisory
vote is not intended to address any specific element of compensation, but rather relates to the overall
compensation of our named executive officers and our executive compensation policies and practices as
described in this proxy statement. Accordingly, your vote will not directly affect or otherwise limit any existing
compensation or award arrangement of any of our named executive officers.

While this “say-on-pay” vote is advisory and will not be binding on our Company or the Board, it will

provide valuable information for future use by our Compensation Committee regarding shareholder sentiment
about our executive compensation. We understand that executive compensation is an important matter for our
shareholders. Accordingly, we invite shareholders who wish to communicate with our Board on executive
compensation or any other matters to contact us as provided under “Corporate Governance — Top Leadership
Positions and Structure.”

Approval of this proposal will require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the votes

cast on the proposal at the meeting.

The Board recommends that you vote FOR the overall compensation of our named executive officers as

described in this proxy statement.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS

(Items 5(a) and 5(b) on Proxy or Voting Instruction Card)

We periodically receive suggestions from our shareholders, some as formal shareholder proposals. We give

careful consideration to all suggestions, and assess whether they promote the best long-term interests of
CenturyLink and its shareholders.

We expect Items 5(a) and 5(b) to be presented by shareholders at the meeting. Following SEC rules, we are

reprinting the proposals and supporting statements as they were submitted to us, other than minor formatting
changes. We take no responsibility for them. On request to the Secretary at the address listed under “Other
Matters — Annual Financial Report,” we will provide information about the sponsor’s shareholdings. Adoption
of both of these proposals requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the votes cast on
the proposal at the meeting.

29

The Board recommends that you vote AGAINST Items 5(a) and 5(b) for the reasons we give after

each one below.

Lobbying Proposal (Item (5(a))

The following proposal was submitted by the AFL-CIO Reserve Fund, located at 816 16th Street, NW,

Washington D.C., 20006.

“Whereas, we believe in full disclosure of CenturyLink direct and indirect lobbying activities and

expenditures to assess whether CenturyLink’s lobbying is consistent with its expressed goals and in the best
interests of shareholders.

Resolved, the shareholders of CenturyLink request the preparation of a report, updated annually,

disclosing:

1. Company policy and procedures governing lobbying, both direct and indirect, and grassroots

2.

lobbying communications.
Payments by CenturyLink used for (a) direct or indirect lobbying or (b) grassroots lobbying
communications, in each case including the amount of the payment and the recipient.

3. CenturyLink’s membership in and payments to any tax-exempt organization that writes and

endorses model legislation.

4. Description of management’s decision making process and the Board’s oversight for making

payments described in section 2 above.

For purposes of this proposal, a “grassroots lobbying communication” is a communication directed to
the general public that (a) refers to specific legislation or regulation, (b) reflects a view on the legislation or
regulation and (c) encourages the recipient of the communication to take action with respect to the
legislation or regulation. “Indirect lobbying” is lobbying engaged in by a trade association or other
organization of which CenturyLink is a member.

Both “direct and indirect lobbying” and “grassroots lobbying communications” include efforts at the

local, state and federal levels.

The report shall be presented to the Audit Committee or other relevant oversight committees and

posted on CenturyLink’s website.

Supporting Statement

We encourage transparency and accountability in the use of corporate funds to influence legislation and
regulation. CenturyLink spent over $20 million from 2010 — 2016 on federal lobbying. This figure does not
include lobbying expenditures to influence legislation in states, where CenturyLink also lobbies in 38 states
(“Amid Federal Gridlock, Lobbying Rises in the States,” Center for Public Integrity, February 11, 2016),
but disclosure is uneven or absent. For example, CenturyLink spent $729,286 on lobbying in Minnesota
from 2011 — 2016. CenturyLink’s lobbying over customer privacy has attracted media scrutiny (“Telecom
Lobbying Muscle Kills Privacy Rules,” Associated Press, April 17, 2017).

CenturyLink is a member of USTelecom, which spent $9.38 million on lobbying in 2015 and 2016.

CenturyLink does not comprehensively disclose its memberships in trade associations nor the amounts of its
payments used for lobbying, and CenturyLink does not disclose membership in or contributions to
tax-exempt organizations that write and endorse model legislation, such as its membership in the American
Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). Transparent reporting would reveal whether company assets are
being used for objectives contrary to CenturyLink’s long-term interests.

We are concerned that our company’s lack of trade association and ALEC disclosure presents

reputational risks. For example, CenturyLink’s ALEC membership has drawn press scrutiny (“Telecom
Sleaze: ALEC and Its Communication’s Funders — AT&T, Verizon, CenturyLink, Comcast and Time
Warner Cable,” Huffington Post, May 2, 2015), and over 100 companies have publicly left ALEC, including
3M, Google, Shell, Sprint and T-Mobile.”

The Board recommends that you vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons:

We believe our continued success and long-term profitability are substantially dependent upon our ability to
actively engage in political, legislative and regulatory processes to advocate in favor of laws and policies that are
in the best interests of our company, shareholders and customers. The proponent’s proposal this year is
substantially similar to the proposal it submitted last year, which received less than 30% support of the shares
voted at last year’s annual meeting.

For the reasons discussed further below, we continue to believe that we currently disclose a substantial

amount of information on our lobbying activities and that the preparation and publication of the report
contemplated by this proposal is neither necessary nor an efficient use of our resources.

•

•

Information regarding our participation in the political process is set forth in our semi-annual Political
Contributions Reports (the “Semi-Annual Reports”), which are available for review on our website.
Our Semi-Annual Reports outline the core principles governing our political participation.

In addition to furnishing our Semi-Annual Reports, we file substantial amounts of information about
our lobbying activity under federal, state and local laws. At the federal level, we file quarterly reports
under the Lobbying Disclosure Act disclosing our lobbying expenditures and detailing the entities we
lobbied and the subject matter of our lobbying efforts. This includes quarterly reporting to the Federal
Election Commission regarding our employee political action committee. Any lobbying firms hired by
us file similar reports, and trade associations to which we contribute are separately subject to strict
public disclosure requirements regarding their lobbying activities. We and our in-house and external
lobbyists also file reports disclosing political contributions and related payments. Furthermore, we file
all lobbying reports required by state laws, which in some cases have broader disclosure requirements
than federal law. Shareholders can access this information through websites maintained by the U.S.
House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, the Federal Election Commission, and various state
governmental bodies, or through various commercial websites that aggregate similar data.

• Our policies and procedures governing lobbying and political activities are subject to rigorous internal
controls designed to ensure, among other things, that our applicable disclosures are full and complete.
As noted in our Semi-Annual Reports, our Senior Vice President, Public Policy and Government
Relations, together with senior management, the Board, and various public policy and legal personnel,
oversees and manages our corporate political activities in an effort to attain our public policy objectives
and comply with all applicable laws. We have a policy of not contributing to “Super PACs”.

• We believe we significantly benefit by participating in a number of industry and trade associations,
which provide us with access to valuable industry data and expertise. These groups are independent
organizations that represent the diverse interests of their members, and deal with a wide range of
issues. These organizations frequently make expenditures or take action contrary to our preferences,
often without our knowledge. As such, we do not believe that our membership in these organizations
should be viewed as an endorsement of any particular organization or policy. Disclosure of the
information contemplated by the proposal could be used to unfairly suggest that we support every
position taken by organizations to which we contribute. For these reasons, we do not believe that
additional disclosures regarding our contributions to such organizations would be helpful to
shareholders.

• We expend significant resources in connection with our political and lobbying activities. We believe
the information that we currently furnish in our Semi-Annual Reports and file with state and federal
agencies strikes an appropriate balance between transparency and avoiding excessive burden and cost.
We believe that requiring us to gather and disclose additional information would result in an
unproductive consumption of valuable time and corporate resources by tracking insignificant activities
without materially enhancing existing disclosures.

• We also oppose the proposal because many of its aspects are vague or unworkable, and may create

confusion. We believe the proposal’s definition of lobbying and lobbying expenditures are ambiguous

31

and could, depending on the jurisdiction, include items such as office rent, business travel expenses,
and even employee salaries. As a result, the disclosures required by the proposal could be inconsistent
and confusing, because a particular expenditure might be lobbying-related in one jurisdiction, but not
in another.

• The proposal seeks to impose unnecessary line-item disclosures on lobbying expenditures that are not
required by law and are not standard among other companies, including our competitors. Complying
with the requirements of this proposal could put us at a relative disadvantage to our competitors. Any
new requirements should be addressed by lawmakers and uniformly imposed on all entities.

•

Finally, you should be aware that the proponent’s Supporting Statement cites figures that we cannot
verify and an article that appears to apply to companies other than us.

The Board is confident that the Company’s current lobbying activities are effective and fully aligned with

the shareholders’ long-term interests. For the reasons set forth above, the Board believes that this proposal is
overly burdensome, would result in an unproductive use of our resources, and is not in the best interests of our
shareholders.

Billing Practices Proposal (Item 5(b))

The following proposal was submitted by Thomas P. Swiler, located at 3709 Embudito Drive NE,

Albuquerque, New Mexico 87111.

“Whereas: Customers have a right to know how much the services they buy, including taxes, will cost

them, and according to CenturyLink’s Code of Conduct, “We must truthfully market, promote, advertise
and sell our products. This is consistent with our commitment to act honestly in all business affairs. All
descriptions of our products, services, and prices must be truthful and accurate.”

Resolved: Shareholders request that CenturyLink ensure adherence to this principle by providing
customers an itemized list, including taxes, of charges, credits, expected monthly costs, the value and
duration of limited time promotions, and commitment period associated with any service change within
seven days of their decision to change the service. Shareholders further request that customers shall be given
the option to delay the service change until they have approved the costs by dialing a unique code listed on
the itemized list, or, if an immediate service charge is desired, be able to revert to their previous service
within seven days of receiving the itemized list. This procedure will ensure that customers receive what they
expect, which will improve customer satisfaction and retention, and will ultimately benefit the company and
its shareholders.

Supporting Statement:

You are urged to vote “Yes” for this proposal for the following reasons;

As a CenturyLink customer, I have experienced instances in which the monthly cost, after initial
charges and credits, that appeared on my bill after making a service change was not the monthly cost
promised, and it becomes contingent on me to correct the problem, if it can be fixed at all, wasting my time
and causing me frustration. While this mode of operation may provide short-term benefits to the company
and employees who may receive bonuses by locking customers into a limited term commitment as a price
higher than anticipated, it does so at a long-term expense to the company and shareholders due to the
dwindling customer base that results when dissatisfied customers choose different telecommunications
options. By providing customers with written acknowledgement of agreed upon services and pricing, there
can be no misrepresentation or misunderstanding of the agreed to terms. Customer satisfaction will increase,
and more customers will be retained.”

The Board recommends that you vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons:

Our Board agrees that customer satisfaction and retention are crucial to the Company’s success, and spends

considerable time with management attempting to improve our customers’ experience. As described in greater

32

detail below, our Board believes that the steps proposed by the proponent are unnecessary and unworkable
because:

• Our Board has focused on customer satisfaction for many years and has overseen the implementation

of a wide range of actions designed to improve our customers’ experience; and

• Our recent and continuing changes will advance the goal of improved customer satisfaction more

effectively than the proponent’s proposal.

Actions Taken to Improve Customer Experience. We have long recognized the need for strong customer
relations. In recent years we have worked to reduce the complexity of our product offerings and bills, which we
believe were largely an outgrowth of sweeping changes in the communications and technology industries, among
other factors. With extensive involvement of the Board, we augmented these efforts during the last half of 2017
with a comprehensive review of our policies, procedures and practices relating to consumer sales, service and
billing.

As a result of these efforts, over the past couple of years we have, among other things:

•

•

•

•

•

created a new executive leadership team responsible for our customer advocacy group, which we
believe has significantly enhanced and improved the timely flow of customer information to our most
senior leaders;

enhanced our ability to detect customer issues through improved data analytics capabilities;

simplified our product offerings and bill presentations, including improving our bill estimation and
quoting tools, expanding our use of service confirmation letters and taking other steps designed to
reduce billing fluctuations and uncertainties;

revised our customer call intake and training functions to reduce the risk of conflicting or potentially
confusing messages; and

conditioned payment of a portion of our senior management’s annual compensation upon attaining
targeted improvements in customer care.

In the near term, we plan to further improve our customer processes through, among other things, enhancing

our ability to gather and analyze all forms of customer feedback and continuing to expand and improve our
training programs. Moreover, we plan to continue to canvass our operations in an on-going manner to identify
other potential changes we can make to improve customer satisfaction in an evolving marketplace.

Effect of Our Changes. The Board is confident that our above-described recent actions have simplified our

products and strengthened our processes. The Board further believes that these changes, coupled with the other
changes we plan to implement, will improve the experience of our customers, thereby attaining the goals sought
by the proponent.

We do not believe that the additional changes proposed by the proponent are appropriate or workable.

Unlike our focus on continuous improvements, the proponent has proposed a static mandate, which we believe
could limit our future flexibility to adopt approaches that our management, customer base or regulators
subsequently determine to be more effective in serving our customers’ needs. The proponent also seeks
information which is already made available to customers. Presently, we generally make our prices and charges
available to consumers online, during sales calls, and in correspondence and bills. We also routinely provide
confirmation of service letters to customers after the point of sale.

The proposal seeks to have us make a more specific representation about a customer’s initial or later bills,

but this information is not always available due to future events that are outside our control, or is not always
determinable at or near the time of sale. The proposal would also obligate us to create an expensive and unduly

33

complex new infrastructure that we believe many of our customers might find cumbersome, confusing or
unsatisfactory. We believe the proponent’s proposal would also require us to craft a proliferating number of
software applications and additional steps for the activation of service, thereby hindering our efforts over the past
couple of years to simplify our customer care and billing processes. In addition, the sequencing of installation
events suggested by the proponent could create material inconsistencies with our existing order completion
systems, as well as our legal and regulatory obligations.

Ultimately, we believe our recent, pending and future changes will more effectively advance the goal of

customer satisfaction than the proponent’s proposal.

For the reasons set forth above, the Board believes that the concerns raised by this proposal have been

addressed and that the proposal is unnecessary, unworkable and not in your best interests.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Introduction

Fiscal 2017 was a transformational year in our company’s history. Our combination with Level 3 (the

“Level 3 Combination”) was completed on November 1, 2017 (the “Closing” or “Closing Date”), creating the
second largest domestic communications provider serving global enterprise customers, with enhanced
capabilities to meet the demands of our customers in an increasingly competitive environment. Below are
highlights of the combined company’s profile:

*

Excluding revenue related to our divested colocation business and including estimated intercompany
eliminations and purchase accounting adjustments.

Given the dramatic increase in the Company’s scale and geographic footprint and the significant changes to

corporate strategy resulting from the Level 3 Combination, our Board and its Human Resources and
Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) spent considerable time and effort recalibrating our existing
executive compensation program to support the challenges and opportunities inherent in combining the two
companies. As described in greater detail below, during the one-year period between the merger announcement
in October 2016 and the Closing, the Committee focused on designing an executive compensation program to
retain, incentivize and appropriately reward the Company’s senior leadership team throughout the duration of the
transaction, from the critical period between announcement and Closing and through post-Closing

implementation of the combined company’s strategy. An important component of that process was the
implementation of previously-announced succession plans for the chief executive officer (“CEO”) and chief
financial officer (“CFO”) positions, including the recruitment and incorporation of two former Level 3
executives into the CenturyLink executive management team who will succeed our long-tenured CFO and CEO.

For 2017, our named executive officers were:

• Glen F. Post, III
•
Jeffrey K. Storey
•
Sunit S. Patel
• Aamir Hussain
•
Stacey W. Goff

• R. Stewart Ewing, Jr.

Chief Executive Officer
President and Chief Operating Officer
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer
Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer, General Counsel
and Secretary
Former Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant
Secretary

Because the Closing occurred during the fiscal year, our named executive officer group for 2017 consists of
both legacy CenturyLink executives (Messrs. Post, Hussain, Goff, and Ewing, our “legacy named executives”) as
well as two former Level 3 executives who joined us as CenturyLink executive officers at the Closing (Messrs.
Storey and Patel, our “newly named executives”).

This Compensation Discussion and Analysis (the “CD&A”) is organized into four subsections:

I. Executive Summary

As described further below, the central goals of our executive compensation program are to incentivize our

executives to attain objectives that we believe will create shareholder value, to reward performance that
contributes to the execution of our business strategies, and to attract and retain the right executives for our
business.

2017 Business Highlights. In addition to successfully completing the Level 3 Combination, we achieved

several other significant accomplishments during 2017, including the following:

•

•

Paid dividends of nearly $1.5 billion to shareholders.

Invested in our network to improve transmission speed availability across our broadband service
footprint, resulting in the growth of the percent of addressable units receiving service with transmission
speeds of 100 megabits per second (Mbps) or higher and 1 gigabit per second (Gbps) or higher by 34%
and 24%, respectively. We ended the year with 4.4 million addressable units capable of speeds of 100
Mbps or higher and approximately 1.7 million addressable units capable of 1 Gbps or higher.

• Launched 12 new products and services for enterprise and small business customers (including Level 3

product or service launches), including (i) Cloud Application Manager, (ii) Amazon Chime delivered
by CenturyLink, (iii) Managed Enterprise with Cisco Meraki, (iv) Big Data as a Service with Managed
Cloudera, (v) Business VoIP for Small Businesses, and (vi) CenturyLink Business Wi-Fi; and released
12 major product enhancements to include increased functionality for Managed SD-WAN and
CenturyLink Private Cloud products.

39

• Expanded our post-Level 3 Combination security offerings into new international markets and
enhanced our ability to serve customers by integrating various legacy Level 3 and CenturyLink
products and services.

• Completed the sale of our data center and colocation business for pre-tax cash proceeds of $1.8 billion

and a 10% equity stake in the purchaser consortium’s newly-formed global secure infrastructure
company, Cyxtera Technologies.

2017 Executive Compensation Highlights. Throughout 2017, the Committee took steps to (i) attract and

appropriately compensate newly-hired executives with skills tailored to the combined company, (ii) retain,
reward and adequately incentivize our legacy named executives in connection with their integration efforts
before and after the Closing and (iii) begin development of executive compensation programs suitable for the
combined company. In the course of these actions, we continued to focus on maintaining a strong linkage
between executive pay and our performance and strategic goals and developing executive compensation
packages designed to be competitive with our market for executive talent.

Our recent key executive compensation decisions and highlights are summarized below.

• Our executive compensation program for 2017 continued to emphasize variable “at risk”

compensation, with the majority of each named executive officer’s total target compensation structured
as a combination of short- and long-term performance-driven incentives (which, for our CEO,
represented 90% of his total target compensation).

• As in prior years, the Committee set challenging performance targets under our incentive programs to
ensure that payouts track corporate performance. In fact, we did not fully achieve our pre-established
goals for 2017. Specifically:

• Our short-term incentive bonus payouts for 2017 were 73.0% of targeted amounts for each of our

legacy named executives.

• Nearly 75% of the performance-based restricted shares originally granted to our named executives
in 2015 were forfeited based upon our actual performance over the three-year performance period
ending December 31, 2017.

• Our annual long-term incentive grants to our legacy named executives in February 2017 consisted of a

combination of performance-based restricted stock (60% of the target grant value) and time-vested
restricted stock (40% of the target grant value).

• During its annual review of executive compensation in February 2017, the Committee generally

maintained levels of target total compensation for our legacy named executives substantially similar to
levels awarded in prior years, subject to a few modest exceptions necessary to address below-market
pay packages.

• We recently converted our long standing supplemental life insurance policies, which currently cover
three grandfathered senior executives, to policies with fixed premiums at significantly reduced levels
and the Committee approved the resumption of premium payments beginning with 2016 and 2017.

• We announced a CFO succession plan, which was contingent upon the successful completion of the

Level 3 Combination. To implement the plan, Mr. Ewing, who served as our CFO prior to the Level 3
Combination, agreed to step down from all executive positions effective with the Closing and then
fully retired from all positions with the Company after a short transition period. Mr. Patel, who had
served as CFO for Level 3 prior to the Level 3 Combination, was appointed to succeed Mr. Ewing as
CFO effective upon the Closing.

•

In June 2017, the Company announced a CEO succession plan, which initially envisioned Mr. Post, our
current CEO, stepping down from that role effective January 1, 2019. In March 2018, Mr. Post elected
to accelerate the plan by retiring at the meeting. We anticipate that Mr. Storey, who most recently

40

served as Level 3’s President and CEO and was appointed as our President and Chief Operating Officer
effective upon the completion of the Level 3 Combination, will succeed Mr. Post as CEO at that time.

• Throughout mid-2017, the Committee or its chair approved or reviewed offer letters to Messrs. Storey

and Patel and certain other Level 3 officers selected to join our post-combination senior leadership
team upon the Closing.

• Our newly named executives participated in a discretionary bonus program for the two months of 2017

in which they served as CenturyLink officers, and each earned a payout of 100% of his targeted
amount, pro-rated for the two-month period of service (following which they will participate in our
short-term incentive program).

• Additionally, in anticipation of the Level 3 Combination, the Committee reviewed market

compensation data for each individual expected to serve as an executive officer of the combined
company following the Closing. In June, the Committee approved compensation adjustments for a
select group of legacy executives contingent and effective upon the Closing. These changes were based
on market data that compared executive pay to a new peer group for the combined company. See
further discussion under the heading “— Use of ‘Benchmarking’ Data — Compensation
Benchmarking” in Subsection IV below.

•

In order to attract, retain and incentivize our executives before and after the Level 3 Combination, the
Committee granted a combination of integration and retention awards to our legacy executives. The
details of these actions are discussed under the heading “— Awards Related to Level 3 Combination”
in Subsection III below.

• Effective upon the Closing, Messrs. Storey and Patel officially joined us as executive officers and

received certain special cash and equity awards as provided in their previously-disclosed offer letters,
which are described under the heading “— Awards Related to Level 3 Combination” in Subsection III
below.

• After 34 years of service to the Company, Mr. Ewing agreed to step down from all executive positions
effective with the Closing in order to implement the above-discussed CFO succession plan agreed to by
the Company and Level 3 as a component of the Level 3 Combination. As discussed above, Mr. Patel
succeeded Mr. Ewing as CFO effective upon the Closing, and after a short transition period, Mr. Ewing
fully retired from employment with the Company. The Committee approved additional compensation
from contractually obligated amounts, which are described under the heading “— Compensation Paid
to our Former Executive” in Subsection III below, following their consideration of a range of factors,
including Mr. Ewing’s contributions to the growth of CenturyLink over his long tenure and the critical
role he played in negotiating, financing and implementing the Level 3 Combination.

Assessment of “Say on Pay” Voting Results and Shareholder Outreach

In May 2015, 2016 and 2017, our shareholders cast approximately 95%, 89% and 87% respectively, of their

votes in favor of our “say on pay” proposal. The Committee takes the results of these votes into consideration
when making executive compensation decisions. Although this level of support seems to indicate that our
shareholders are generally satisfied with the scope and structure of our compensation programs, our senior
management continued our shareholder outreach program with our top institutional investors that began in 2014.
Most recently, in May 2017, we contacted our top institutional investors, holding approximately 20% of our
outstanding shares, and offered shareholder outreach calls. We remain committed to providing our shareholders
with an opportunity for open dialogue on compensation matters and other issues relevant to our business, and
expect to continue to engage in outreach efforts in the future.

41

II. Our Compensation Philosophy and Linkage to Pay for Performance
Our Compensation Philosophy

We compensate our senior management through a mix of programs designed to be market-competitive and

fiscally responsible. More specifically, our executive compensation programs are designed to:

•

•

•

•

•

provide an appropriate mix of fixed and variable compensation to attract, retain and motivate key
executives,

ensure that a majority of our executive compensation is performance-based to support creation of
long-term shareholder value without encouraging excessive risk taking,

target compensation at the 50th percentile of market levels, when targeted levels of performance are
achieved, for similarly-situated and comparably-skilled executives at a select group of peer companies
approved by the Committee,

recognize and reward outstanding contributions and results, both on an individual basis and a
company or divisional basis, compared to peer compensation and performance benchmark levels,

promote internal equity by offering comparable pay to executives whom we expect to make roughly
equivalent contributions, while differentiating executives’ compensation arrangements when
appropriate, and

• monitor share dilution.

42

Overview of Pay Elements and Linkage to Compensation Philosophy and Objectives

We believe the following core elements of our compensation program help us to realize our compensation

philosophy and objectives:

Pay Element
Base Salary

Characteristics

Compensation Philosophy and Objectives

Annual fixed cash compensation

Short-Term Incentive Bonus Annual variable cash compensation
based on the achievement of annual
performance measures. For 2017, 85%
of these payments were based on
financial targets, comprised of
operating cash flow and core revenue,
with 15% based on customer
experience improvements. For each
executive, the Committee has an
opportunity to make a positive or
negative adjustment based on the
executive’s performance against
individual objectives

Performance-Based

Restricted Stock (60% of
long-term incentive grant
value)

Time-vested Restricted Stock

(40% of long-term
incentive grant value)

Annual long-term variable equity
awards that cliff vest three years from
the date of grant based on our
performance as measured against
specific pre-established performance
criteria. For grants made in 2017,
vesting of 50% of the award will be
based on our relative three-year total
shareholder return (“TSR”) versus
our custom industry peer group and
vesting of the other 50% will be based
on a three-year revenue target

Annual long-term equity awards that
vest based on years of service

Provides a competitive and stable
component of income to our
executives

Provides competitive short-term
incentive opportunities for our
executives to earn annual cash bonuses
based on performance objectives
that, if attained, can reasonably be
expected to (i) promote our business
and strategic objectives and
(ii) correspond to those paid to
similarly-situated and comparably
skilled executives at peer companies

Fosters a culture of ownership, aligns
the long-term interests of our
executives with our shareholders and
rewards or penalizes executives based
on our long-term relative TSR and
absolute revenue performance

Provides variable compensation that
helps to retain executives and ensures
our executives’ interests are aligned
with those of shareholders to promote
the creation of long-term value

The Committee believes our incentive programs supported our strategic and cultural priorities for 2017 as

described below:

• Our senior officers’ 2017 pay was linked to similar performance objectives for both our short-term

and long-term incentive compensation, as we determined revenue stabilization to be an important goal
requiring successful execution of both our short-term and our long-term strategies.

• We determined that our generation of core revenue has been critical to our goal of stabilizing and

ultimately increasing our consolidated revenues with a view to attain strategic revenue growth
sufficient to offset our continuing legacy revenue losses. Core revenue was a performance measure in
both our short-term incentive bonus and performance-based restricted shares, representing 27% to 29%
of our executive officers’ 2017 target total compensation.

43

• Total shareholder return relative to our peers was one of the performance measures used in our

performance-based restricted shares, representing 18% to 21% of our executive officers’ 2017 target
total compensation. This compensation will ultimately be realized only if we successfully execute our
strategic plans and perform satisfactorily in relation to our industry peers.

• Operating cash flow enables us to, among other things, (i) fund strategic capital investments designed
to expand our business opportunities, (ii) return cash to our shareholders through dividends or periodic
share repurchases, and (iii) meet our debt and pension commitments. Operating cash flow is a
performance measure in our short-term incentive bonus, representing 8% to 9% of our executive
officers’ 2017 target total compensation.

•

Improving customer experience is critical to maintain and grow our revenue base. This performance
measure includes operational goals and metrics that measure how well we are serving our customers as
well as their perceptions of our service. CenturyLink is committed to meeting the needs of all our
customers, improving customer satisfaction and service scores, reducing customer inconveniences and
decreasing repair times. Customer experience is a performance measure in our short-term incentive
bonus, representing 3% of our executive officers’ 2017 target total compensation.

• The individual performance objectives provide “line of sight” to each senior officer’s performance
regarding their specific areas of responsibility. In addition, this aspect of the short-term incentive plan
design reinforces leadership behaviors promoting our Unifying Principles and expectations of our
broader workforce. We believe that successfully executing on clearly-defined individual performance
objectives will help us improve team collaboration, expand our product lines, refine our market
strategies, strengthen our network, execute expansion opportunities, reduce costs and otherwise
improve our operations.

Given the on-going integration of the two companies, the Committee has continued to revise our incentive

programs to align them with the size, market, operations and strategic imperatives of the combined company.

The following chart illustrates the approximate allocation of our CEO and our current other named

executive officers (“NEOs”) total target compensation opportunity for 2017 between elements that are fixed and
variable or performance-based pay that is “at risk”:

90%

Pay at Risk

RSA
28%

STI
18%

CEO

PSA
44%

Base
15%

RSA
26%

NEO

STI
20%

85%

Pay at Risk

PSA
39%

• A fixed annual salary (“base”) represents 10% of our CEO’s total target compensation and 15% of our

other NEOs’ average target total compensation.

• Variable pay is comprised of a short-term incentive (“STI”) bonus, time-vested restricted stock awards
(“RSA”) and performance-based restricted stock awards (“PSA”), which represents 90% of our CEO’s
total target compensation and 85% of our other NEOs’ average target total compensation. This portion
of pay is considered “at risk” since the receipt or value of the award is subject to the attainment of
certain performance goals, vesting requirements and overall stock performance.

44

Significant Stock Ownership. Stock ownership guidelines further align executives and shareholders while

focusing the executives on our long-term success. We established our executive stock ownership guidelines after
review of executive compensation best practices. Under our stock ownership guidelines as of December 31,
2017:

• Mr. Post held over $30.1 million in stock (including restricted shares), which was 24.1 times base
salary and approximately 4.0 times greater than his target ownership level of six times base salary.

• Our other NEOs held an aggregate of over $74.1 million in stock (including restricted shares), which

was, on average, 18.6 times their respective base salaries and nearly 6.2 times greater than their
respective target ownership level of three times base salary.

• Although our Stock Ownership guidelines provide that newly-appointed executives have three

years to meet ownership guidelines, each of Messrs. Storey and Patel already has holdings in
excess of his current target level (three times base salary).

• Even though our CEO and other NEOs already exceeded their stock ownership guidelines, our named

executives personally acquired an additional 121,000 shares of stock after Closing, which demonstrates
their confidence in the potential for the combined company.

Pay-For-Performance Alignment

As illustrated by the data below, we believe our compensation over the past several years has remained in

alignment with our performance.

Short-Term Incentive Performance. The Committee sets target levels of performance based on a variety of

factors, including its assessment of the difficulty of achieving such levels and the potential impact of such
achievement on enhancing shareholder value. The percentages in the table below represent the actual payouts to
our senior officers under our short-term incentive program (our “STI program”) for each of the past three years
as a percentage of the target opportunity set for him or her by the Committee for that performance year.

under a separate discretionary plan.

Long-Term Incentive Performance. For several years, our annual long-term incentive grants (our “LTI

program”) have consisted of shares of restricted stock, vesting of a portion of which is contingent upon the
Company’s performance as measured against certain pre-established criteria. In recent years, we have used two
different performance metrics with these LTI grants, with vesting of one-half of the performance-based award
being tied to a relative metric (our three-year total shareholder return relative to a select peer group), and vesting
of the remaining one-half being tied to an absolute metric (the sum of our annual revenue targets over three-year
performance periods as measured against pre-established targets). Since 2014, the Committee has awarded 60%
of the aggregate grant date value of the executives’ LTI awards in the form of performance-based restricted
stock, up from 50% in prior years.

45

The percentages in the tables below represent the percentage of the target value of the executives’ LTI

awards granted in the form of performance-based restricted stock and time-vested restricted stock, including the
portion based upon relative TSR and absolute revenue performance objectives.

our actual performance as determined at the end of the three-year performance period.

The payout percentages in the tables below represent the percentage of the target number of performance-

forfeited. To further enhance the pay for performance linkage, any dividends granted on these shares are not paid
currently, but rather accumulate during the restricted period and vest or are forfeited in tandem with the related
shares.

Stock Performance. As mentioned throughout this section, our LTI program is designed to align the

interests of the executives with our shareholders and therefore reward and incent superior performance. Since
these awards are grants of restricted stock, the actual value of LTI awards (both time-vested and performance-
based shares of restricted stock) fluctuates with the change in stock price. In making LTI grants, our Committee
typically approves a target LTI value and the actual number of shares in each grant is determined by dividing that
target value by the volume-weighted average closing price of a share of our common stock over the
15-trading-day period ending five trading days prior to the grant date (“VWAP”), rounding to the nearest whole
share. The chart below reflects the VWAP used to calculate each of our 2015, 2016, and 2017 LTI grants, the
closing share price on any vesting dates that have occurred for each grant between the applicable grant date and
the end of fiscal 2017, and the change in value of a share of our common stock from the grant date VWAP to the
last trading day of fiscal 2017.

(1) As noted above, we determine the number of shares in a given grant of restricted stock by dividing the LTI
target value by the applicable VWAP (the volume-weighted average closing price of our shares of common
stock over a 15-trading day period ending five trading days prior to the grant date), and rounding to the
nearest share. This valuation method is different from the equity grant valuation method we are required to
disclose in our Summary Compensation Table under applicable accounting and SEC disclosure rules.

closing price on the last day of trading in 2017 by the grant date VWAP.

Realizable Pay for our CEO. The chart below illustrates the realizable pay for 2015, 2016 and 2017 for our
CEO, most of which was “at risk” variable compensation. We calculate realizable pay for a given year by adding
together the (i) actual salary paid during the year, (ii) STI bonus that was ultimately paid out for performance
during that year, (iii) the value of RSAs and PSAs that vested during the year and (iv) the value of RSAs and
PSAs that are projected to vest based on actual performance through the end of the year, valuing the shares based
on the closing price of our common stock on the last business day of the year.

47

As this chart illustrates, our CEO’s realizable pay has averaged 55% over the last 3 years, specifically 49%,

57% and 58% of his total target compensation for years 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. The realizable pay
for each pay element of pay that impacted our CEO’s realizable pay is discussed further above in this Subsection
under the headings “— Short-Term Incentive Performance,” “— Long-Term Incentive Performance” and “Stock
Performance.”

III. Our Compensation Program Objectives and Components of Pay
Our Compensation Practices

To assist us in achieving our broad compensation goals, we apply the following practices (many of which

are described further elsewhere in this CD&A):

What We Do…

•

Focus on performance-based compensation weighted heavily towards long-term incentive awards

• Benchmark against 50th percentile peer compensation levels

• Maintain robust stock ownership guidelines applicable to our executive officers and outside directors

• Annually review our compensation programs to avoid encouraging excessively risky behavior

• Conduct annual “say-on-pay” votes

•

Periodically seek input from shareholders on our executive compensation program

• Maintain a compensation “clawback” policy

•

Impose compensation forfeiture covenants broader than those mandated by law

• Review the composition of our peer groups at least annually

• Conduct independent and intensive performance reviews of our senior officers

• Cap the number of relative TSR performance-based shares that may vest if our own TSR is negative

• Review realizable pay of our senior officers and total compensation “tally” sheets

• Require shareholders to approve any future severance agreements valued at more than 2.99 times the

What We Don’t Do…

• Enter into employment agreements with our executives

• Maintain a supplemental executive retirement plan

•

•

•

•

Permit our directors or employees to hedge our stock, or our directors or senior officers to pledge our
stock

Pay dividends on unvested restricted stock

Permit the Committee’s compensation consultant to provide other services to CenturyLink

Pay, provide or permit:

(i)

excessive perquisites,

(ii) excise tax “gross-up” payments, or

(iii) single-trigger change of control equity acceleration benefits.

Summary of 2017 Compensation for our Named Executive Officers

Two of the core principles of our compensation philosophy are to offer (i) competitive compensation to our
named executive officers at the 50th percentile of market levels and (ii) an appropriate mix of fixed and variable
compensation.

During 2017, the Committee assessed the adequacy of our executive compensation both before and after the

Closing, using pre- and post-combination benchmarking data, and took the following actions:

• Pre-Combination. In February 2017, in connection with its annual review of total target compensation
of our legacy named executives, the Committee determined that the average total target compensation
was approximately 9% below the 50th percentile of market levels for pre-combination compensation
benchmark data. As a result, the Committee approved certain changes to the compensation, as
described further below, which resulted in average total target compensation that was approximately
6% below the 50th percentile of market levels for pre-combination compensation benchmark data.

• Post-Combination. As disclosed previously, the Committee, in preparation for the Closing, conducted a

supplemental benchmarking assessment of executive pay for each individual who was expected to
continue or join the Company as a senior officer following the Closing. Since the Committee was
considering compensation that would be contingent and effective upon the completion of the Level 3
Combination, the Committee approved a new peer group for use in benchmarking compensation. As
described in greater detail under “— Use of ‘Benchmarking’ Data — Compensation Benchmarking” in
Subsection IV below, the revised peer group is more comparable to the combined company in terms of
size, markets and operations.

• The Committee used that assessment in creating competitive pay packages to induce each of

Messrs. Storey and Patel, our newly named executives, to join our executive management team
upon the Closing.

•

In addition, the Committee determined that average total target compensation for Messrs. Post,
Hussain and Goff, even after the adjustments made during the February 2017 annual review
process, was approximately 40% below the 50th percentile of market levels derived from the new
post-combination compensation benchmark data. Therefore, the Committee decided to make
certain additional changes to the compensation of Messrs. Hussain and Goff, with such changes
contingent and effective upon the Closing. The Committee did not make any changes to Messrs.
Post and Ewing’s on-going compensation arrangements, given their pending retirement.

49

• As a result of these actions and decisions, the average total target compensation, immediately after

the Closing, for Messrs. Post, Patel, Hussain, Goff and Storey was approximately 25% below the
50th percentile of market levels for post-combination compensation benchmark data.

Each element of our 2017 compensation is discussed further below in this Subsection under the headings

“— Salary,” “— Short-Term Incentive Bonuses,” “— Annual Grants of Long-Term Equity Incentive
Compensation” and “— Awards Related to Level 3 Combination.” In each case, more information on how we
determined specific pay levels is located in Subsection IV under the headings “— Our Compensation Decision-
Making Process” and “— Use of ‘Benchmarking’ Data — Compensation Benchmarking.” Compensation paid to
Mr. Ewing, whose employment ended on November 17, 2017, is discussed further below in this Subsection
under the heading “— Compensation Paid to our Former Executive Officer.”

Salary

General. Early each year, the Committee takes a number of steps in connection with setting annual salaries,

including reviewing compensation tally sheets and benchmarking data, reviewing each senior officer’s pay and
performance relative to other senior officers, and considering when the officer last received a pay increase. More
information on how we determined specific pay levels in 2017, see further discussion under the heading “— Our
Compensation Decision-Making Process” and “— Use of ‘Benchmarking’ Data — Compensation
Benchmarking” in Subsection IV below.

Annual Review Process (February 2017). In February 2017, the Committee reviewed pre-combination

compensation benchmarking data for all executive officers and awarded a salary increase of 10% for Mr. Hussain
in recognition of his performance and market position, and left unchanged the salary for our other named
executive officers.

Salary Adjustments Effective upon Closing (November 1, 2017). After its annual review process, the
Committee conducted an additional compensation benchmarking assessment mid-year in anticipation of the
Level 3 Combination. The Committee’s review of this data informed its decisions with respect to initial
compensation arrangements for each of the two newly named executives (as memorialized in each officer’s offer
letter) and also additional base salary increases for certain legacy named executives, all of which were contingent
and effective upon the Closing. Effective upon Closing, Mr. Storey was named President and COO with an
annual salary of $1,500,000 and Mr. Patel became our Executive Vice President and CFO with an annual base
salary of $750,000. In addition, the base salary of each of Messrs. Hussain and Goff was increased to $600,000
effective on the Closing.

Recent Actions. In February 2018, the Committee reviewed the updated compensation benchmarking data
for all executive officers and left unchanged the salary for our named executive officers. See further discussion
under the heading “— Use of ‘Benchmarking’ Data — Compensation Benchmarking” in Subsection IV below.

Short-Term Incentive Bonuses

General. With the assistance of its compensation consultant and management, the Committee approves STI

bonus target percentages each year. Typically, in the first quarter of each year, with the assistance of
management, the Committee approves (i) the performance objectives for prospective bonuses, (ii) the
“threshold,” “target” and “maximum” threshold levels of performance, (iii) the weighting of the performance
objectives, (iv) the amount of bonus payable if the target level of performance is attained and (v) the finally
determined amount of bonus payments attributable to performance for the prior year. During 2017, the
Committee took various actions to ensure that appropriate STI award opportunities were granted to (i) legacy
named executives under CenturyLink programs covering the periods before and after the Level 3 Combination
and (ii) Messrs. Storey and Patel under a legacy Level 3 bonus program for the two months following the Closing
in which they served as members of our 2017 senior leadership team.

(1) Salary reflected in this table represents earned salary during 2017 and includes certain adjustments and

pro-rations described below. Salary reflected for Mr. Hussain is his salary earned during 2017 with a salary
increase, from $500,000 to $550,000, effective on February 26, 2017, and an increase to $600,000 on
November 1, 2017. Salary for Mr. Goff represents salary earned during 2017 with a salary increase from
$541,000 to $600,000 on November 1, 2017. The salary reflected in this table represents earned salary from
November 1 through December 31, 2017 based on an annual salary of $750,000 for Mr. Patel and
$1,500,000 for Mr. Storey. Salary reflected for Mr. Ewing is the portion of his annual salary of $663,138
that he earned through his retirement date of November 17, 2017.

(2) Represents target bonus percentages effective for 2017. For Messrs. Hussain and Goff, the target bonus

percentage represents a blended target percentage, as each received an increase in their target bonus
percentage to 120% on November 1, 2017 from 100% and 110% respectively. For Messrs. Storey and Patel,
the target bonus percentages were set by the Committee effective November 1, 2017.

Performance Objectives and Targets. Each year, the Committee reviews in detail the relevance of our STI

performance objectives for alignment with our business goals and objectives. In March 2017, the Committee
reaffirmed its decision from the prior two years to offer STI bonuses for all senior officers based upon our
attainment of consolidated operating cash flow and consolidated core revenue targets (collectively “financial
performance objectives”). In addition, the Committee added Customer Experience as an additional performance
objective for 2017. See the further discussion under the heading “— Overview of Pay Elements and Linkage to
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives” in Subsection II above and “— 2017 Performance Results” below.

CenturyLink STI Plan. In March 2017, the Committee approved a target level of 6% of operating cash flow

return on average assets for purposes of fixing the maximum amount of potential annual bonuses for 2017
payable to our senior officers in accordance with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”).

In March 2017, the Committee also approved performance objectives, comprised of threshold, target and
maximum financial performance levels for pre-combination operating cash flow and core revenues (weighted
85%) and certain specified operational performance metrics for measuring improvements in customer experience
(weighted 15%). Immediately prior to the Level 3 Combination, the Committee approved similar financial
performance targets for the combined company’s consolidated revenue and consolidated adjusted EBITDA
(earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) for the post-combination portion of 2017
(weighted 85% for such period) and reaffirmed that operational performance metrics for customer experience
would be weighted 15%. The Committee further determined that actual STI bonuses paid to legacy CenturyLink
officers for 2017 would be based on attainment of these pre-combination and post-combination metrics, weighted
in accordance with the proportionate length of each period.

If the threshold performance level with respect to any particular financial or operational performance

objective under our STI program is not attained, the bonus payable to the participating officer with respect to that
portion of his or her targeted bonus opportunity will be calculated to be zero. If threshold performance is met on

51

any particular metric, each participating officer will earn a reduced portion of his or her target bonus amount for
that portion of the award. If the maximum performance level with respect to any particular metric is met or
exceeded, each participating officer will earn 200% of his or her target bonus amount. Measurement of the
attainment of any particular metric will be interpolated if actual performance is between (i) the “threshold” and
the “target” performance levels or (ii) the “target” and the “maximum” performance levels.

In March 2017, the Committee, in collaboration with our CEO, also approved guidelines designed to enable
the Committee, in its discretion, to increase or decrease the bonus of each senior officer by up to 10%, based on
the officer’s individual performance during 2017 with respect to (i) assisting the Company to meet its expense
budget, (ii) exhibiting collaboration and leadership skills, (iii) attaining three to four specific individualized
performance objectives and (iv) the officer’s individual assessment under our management performance rating
system.

Legacy Level 3 Discretionary Bonus Program. Given that the Level 3 Combination occurred very late in

our fiscal year, the Committee agreed to determine bonuses payable to our newly named executives for the
two-month period in which they were employed by CenturyLink using the same discretionary bonus program
previously used by Level 3 for its executives. Under this program, the Committee would assess the performance
of standalone Level 3 over this two-month period, measured against a variety of financial performance
objectives. However, these objectives were not intended as specific targets and the Committee’s determination to
pay a bonus under this program was entirely discretionary.

2017 Performance Results. In February 2018, the Committee reviewed audited results of the Company’s

performance as compared to the financial performance targets established for 2017. As explained below, the
Committee determined that the aggregate earned company performance was 73.0% of the target bonus for legacy
named executives and 100% of the target bonus for our newly named executives.

CenturyLink STI Plan

•

•

For the CenturyLink STI program, overall STI performance for the full year was determined by adding
together performance results from the two separate performance periods: (i) the ten-month
pre-combination period and (ii) the two-month post-combination period. The 2017 bonuses for Messrs.
Post, Hussain, Goff and Ewing are based on the pre- and post-combination targets and performance, as
described both above and below. Pre-combination targets were set in February 2017 and do not include
any financial results for Level 3. Post-combination targets were set immediately prior to the Closing
and include financial results for the combined company.

162(m) Target — Operating Cash Flow Return on Average Assets. We attained a 9.4% operating cash
flow return on average assets, which exceeded the target level established by the Committee in
February 2017 for purposes of fixing the maximum amount of potential annual bonuses for 2017
payable to our senior officers in accordance with Section 162(m) of the Code.

• Core Revenue. We achieved consolidated core revenue results that were below our pre- and post-

combination targets, resulting in earned performance of 76.4% and 51.9% of the pre- and post-
combination targets, respectively.

• Operating Cash Flow. We achieved consolidated operating cash flow results that were below our
pre-combination target, thereby resulting in earned performance of 67.7% of the pre-combination
target.

• Adjusted EBITDA. We achieved consolidated adjusted EBITDA results that were below our post-

combination target, thereby resulting in 46.8% of the post-combination target.

•

Improved Customer Experience. We achieved sustained improvement in provisioning, customer
satisfaction and service levels. Additionally, we completed several initiatives that we believe will drive

52

improved customer experience in future years. As a result of these accomplishments, we awarded 90%
for the customer experience performance objective.

•

Individual Performance Objectives. The Committee reviewed with management the degree to which
each senior officer met certain specific individual performance objectives and benchmarks, as well as
qualitative assessments of each officer’s performance. As noted below under “- Committee
Discretion,” the Committee elected not to make individual performance adjustments with impact to any
of our legacy named executive officers’ 2017 bonus awards.

Upon completion of each fiscal year, our actual operating results may be adjusted up or down, as

appropriate, in accordance with the Committee’s long-standing guidelines that are designed to eliminate the
effects of extraordinary or non-recurring transactions that were not known, anticipated or quantifiable on the date
the performance goals were established. Consistent with these long-standing guidelines, the Committee made
certain adjustments to our actual operating results for 2017, including adjustments to reflect the actual timing of
the sale of our data center and colocation business.

Legacy Level 3 Discretionary Bonus Program

For the two-month discretionary bonus program in which our newly named executives participated, when
assessing our overall short-term incentive performance, the Committee reviewed post-combination targets and
performance for stand-alone Level 3 financial and operational performance objectives.

• Financial Performance Objectives. We achieved consolidated core network services revenue,

consolidated adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow that were 99.5%, 96.9% and 108.8% of our post-
combination targets, respectively.

Calculation of Bonuses under the CenturyLink STI Plan. For 2017, the STI bonus payments were

calculated using the performance objectives, payout scale, and other criteria approved by the Committee in the
first quarter of the year and immediately prior to Closing. After our internal audit personnel have reviewed these
determinations and calculations, they are provided in writing to the Committee for its review and approval.

The 2017 bonuses paid to our named executives were calculated under a three-step process. In step one, the
Committee determined that we had exceeded our Section 162(m) target of operating cash flow return on average
assets and, therefore, each of our legacy named executives qualified for potential annual bonuses up to a fixed
maximum amount defined as a percentage of the executive’s 2017 salary. In step two, the Committee calculated
bonuses by measuring the company’s performance against the financial and operational performance objectives
described above under the heading “— 2017 Performance Results.” In step three, the Committee authorized
actual bonuses for our legacy named executives, which were substantially lower than the maximum potential
bonuses calculated in step one. For 2017 awards, no named executive officer received a discretionary adjustment
for individual performance.

Determination of Bonuses for Newly Named Executives. In making its discretionary determination to

authorize bonus payments for the last two months of 2017 to Messers. Patel and Storey at 100% of their target
bonus opportunity, the Committee took into account Level 3’s financial performance described above under the
heading “— 2017 Performance Results”.

Compensation Table appearing below under the column “Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation.” For
Messrs. Patel and Storey, these bonus amounts are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table appearing
below under the column “Bonus.”

Committee Discretion. As noted above, for the CenturyLink STI Plan, we exceeded our target for our

162(m) objectives which set the maximum 2017 bonuses payable to each of our senior officers. The Committee
maintains the discretion, subject to certain limits, to either increase or decrease the bonus amounts determined on
the basis of actual performance earned for financial and individual targets and objectives. The actual performance
earned on pre- and post-combination targets ranged from 71.5% to 73.7%. For the sake of administrative ease,
the Committee elected to apply minimal discretionary adjustments and payout the 2017 annual incentive bonus
payments at 73% for each of our legacy named executives.

The Committee may authorize the payment of annual bonuses in cash or shares of common stock. Since

2000, the Committee has paid these bonuses entirely in cash, principally to diversify our compensation mix and
to conserve shares in our equity plans.

Recent Actions. Effective January 1, 2018, our newly named executives participate in the CenturyLink STI
program with our legacy named executives. In connection with establishing targets for the 2018 STI program, the
Committee made no changes to the target bonus percentage for any of our named executives. However, the
Committee revised the financial and operational performance objectives used in the 2018 STI program, including
the weighting of the various metrics, in order to better align the program with the business strategies and goals of
the combined company going forward.

Annual Grants of Long-Term Incentive Compensation

General. Our long-term incentive compensation plans authorize the Committee to grant a variety of stock-

based incentive awards to key personnel. We strive to provide equity compensation in forms that create
appropriate incentives to optimize performance at reasonable cost, that minimize enterprise risk, that align the
interests of our officers and shareholders, that foster our long-term financial and strategic objectives and that are
competitive with incentives offered by other companies.

54

For the last ten years, the Committee has elected to grant all of our LTI awards in the form of restricted

stock for a variety of reasons, including:

•

•

•

the Committee’s recognition of the prevalent use of restricted stock by our peers,

the Committee’s desire to minimize the dilution associated with our LTI awards, and

the retentive value of restricted stock under varying market conditions.

Consistent with this practice, in February 2017, the Committee granted 60% of our legacy named

executives’ target LTI in the form of performance-based shares of restricted stock, which is ultimately payable
only if we attain certain specified goals. The remaining 40% of each legacy named executive’s LTI award was
granted in the form of time-vested shares of restricted stock, the value of which is dependent on our performance
over an extended vesting period.

Performance Benchmarks. On an annual basis, the Committee reviews the relevance of our performance

benchmarks for alignment with our long-term strategic plan. In connection with making annual LTI grants to our
legacy named executives in February 2017, the Committee elected to keep the same two performance
benchmarks, relative TSR and absolute revenue, that we used for performance-based restricted shares granted in
the last few years. See further discussion under the heading “— Overview of Pay Elements and Linkage to
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives” in Subsection II above.

An overview of our TSR performance-based restricted shares granted in early 2017 is outlined below.

•

•

•

Performance Benchmark: Our benchmark is our percentile rank versus the below-described
24-company TSR peer group. See further discussion under the heading “— Use of ‘Benchmarking’
Data — Performance Benchmarking” in Subsection IV below.

Performance Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019.

Performance Vesting: The ultimate number of TSR performance-based restricted shares that vest will
be based on our TSR during the above-described performance period relative to the TSR of the TSR
peer group over the same period, as illustrated in the table below.

An overview of our absolute revenue performance-based restricted shares granted in early 2017 is

outlined below.

•

Performance Benchmark: Our benchmark is an absolute revenue target over the below-described three-
year performance period, which is equal to the sum of three annual absolute revenue targets separately
established by the Committee during the first quarter of the years 2017, 2018, and 2019. “Absolute
revenue” is defined each year in a manner designed to correspond to revenue from our core operations,
excluding certain specifically defined non-core revenues, principally those associated with our receipt
of governmental subsidy payments.

•

Performance Period: January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019.

55

•

Performance Vesting: The ultimate number of our absolute revenue performance-based restricted
shares that vest will be based on our achievement of the aggregate three-year absolute revenue target,
as illustrated in the table below; provided, however, none of our absolute revenue performance-based
restricted shares will vest unless we attain a 6% operating cash flow annual return on average assets
during the performance period. Upon completion of each fiscal year within the three-year performance
period, the Committee intends to adjust our actual operating, to the extent necessary, in accordance
with the Committee’s long-standing guidelines that are designed to eliminate the effects of
extraordinary or non-recurring transactions that were not known, anticipated or quantifiable on the date
the performance goals were established.

Compensation and Other Awards.”

2017 Annual LTI Grants. Following its deliberations in February 2017, the Committee formally approved

an increase in target annual LTI compensation for Mr. Hussain to $1,600,000. This increase was primarily the
result of the Committee’s recognition of Mr. Hussain’s overall leadership and performance demonstrated in
2016, but also reflected the Committee’s review of compensation benchmarking. See further discussion under the
heading “— Use of ‘Benchmarking’ Data — Performance Benchmarking” in Subsection IV below. During 2017,
the Committee granted annual LTI awards to our other legacy named executives on terms and in amounts
substantially similar to the awards granted to them in 2016.

56

In February 2017, the Committee granted to each of our legacy named executives the following number of
(i) restricted shares that will vest over a three-year period principally in exchange for continued service (“time-
vested restricted shares”), (ii) performance-based restricted shares that will vest in February 2020 based on our
relative total shareholder return (the “TSR performance-based restricted shares”) and (iii) performance-based
restricted shares that will vest in February 2020 principally based on our attainment of absolute revenue targets
over the above-described three-year performance period (the “absolute revenue performance-based restricted
shares”):

(1) For purposes of these grants, we determined both the number of time-vested and performance-based

restricted shares by dividing the total fair value granted to the executive by the volume-weighted average
closing price of a share of our common stock over the 15-trading-day period ending five trading days prior
to the grant date (“VWAP”), rounding to the nearest whole share. However, as noted previously, for
purposes of reporting these awards in the Summary Compensation Table, our shares of time-vested
restricted stock are valued based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant and our
shares of performance-based restricted stock are valued as of the grant date based on probable outcomes, as
required by applicable accounting and SEC disclosure rules. See footnote 2 to the Summary Compensation
Table for more information.

(2) Represents the number of restricted shares granted in 2017. As discussed further above, the actual number
of shares that vest in the future may be lower or higher, depending on the level of performance achieved.

Recent Actions. At its February 2018 meeting, the Committee granted LTI awards to our senior officers

with a similar mix of 60% performance-based and 40% time-vested restricted stock awards. However, the
performance measure and performance period were changed to an adjusted EBITDA run rate for a two-year
period that will vest over three years. For each of our named executives, other than Mr. Storey, the Committee
elected to grant equity awards at levels based on the compensation benchmarking conducted in the summer of
2017 for the post-transaction combined company. Mr. Storey did not receive an award in February 2018, as his
employment offer letter provides that he is not eligible to receive another LTI grant until February 2019 (at
which time his target LTI value will be no less than $8,375,000). See further discussion under the heading “—
Use of ‘Benchmarking’ Data — Compensation Benchmarking” in Subsection IV below.

In connection with the announcement of Mr. Post’s decision to retire at the meeting, the Committee

authorized (i) the vesting upon retirement of half of Mr. Post’s 2018 time-vested restricted shares, (ii) Mr. Post’s
retention of half of his 2018 performance-based restricted shares subject to their original performance conditions
and (iii) the vesting upon retirement of the equity portion of Mr. Post’s 2017 special integration award at a 100%
payout rate. The Committee also authorized Mr. Post to receive full vesting of all time-vested restricted shares

57

granted to him before 2018 and to retain, subject to their original performance conditions, all performance-based
restricted shares granted to him before 2018.

Awards Related to Level 3 Combination

Special Awards to Legacy Named Executives. Given the recruitment, retention and motivational challenges

inherent in undertaking a transaction as complicated as the Level 3 Combination, in June of 2017, the
Committee, with the assistance of its compensation consultant and management, approved an integration and
retention award program in which our legacy named executives participated. The details of these awards are
outlined below.

Integration Awards. These integration awards were intended to incentivize the performance of certain key
officers through the Closing and the critical integration period following the Closing. Messrs. Post, Hussain and
Goff were selected to participate.

The target value of the integration award to each of these officers was as follows: Mr. Post, $3,000,000;
Mr. Hussain, $600,000 and Mr. Goff, $550,000. The target value of each integration award was split into two
equally-weighted components: 50% in the form of cash and 50% in the form of shares of performance-based
restricted stock.

The cash portion of this award was scheduled to vest on the Closing Date, with the actual payout to the

officer ranging between 80% and 120% of the target value depending upon the Committee’s subjective
determination of the officer’s integration-related performance. Immediately prior to the Closing, the Committee
assessed the integration-related performance of each of Messrs. Post, Hussain, and Goff through the Closing, and
decided to award each a payout on that cash portion at the 100% target value. The cash amounts paid at the
Closing are included in the Summary Compensation under the heading “Bonus” in the following amounts:
Mr. Post, $1,500,000; Mr. Hussain, $300,000 and Mr. Goff, $275,000.

With respect to the equity portion of the award, it will vest on December 15, 2018 subject to the officer’s
continued service to the Company through the vesting date and the actual number of shares vesting will range
between 80% and 120% of the number of shares granted, depending on the Committee’s subjective
determination of the officer’s integration-related performance between the Closing and the vesting date. The
equity portion of this integration award is reported in the Summary Compensation Table under the column
“Stock Awards” and in the Grant of Plan-Based Awards Table.

Retention Awards. These retention awards were intended to assist the Company in retaining certain key
executives whose services the Committee believed would be essential to successfully completing the Level 3
Combination and integrating the operations of the two companies. Messrs. Hussain and Goff were selected to
participate. The retention awards consist of time-vested shares of restricted stock, with a grant date value of
$4,500,000 for both Messrs. Hussain and Goff. The awards will vest one-third per year over a three-year period,
subject to the executive’s continued service with the Company.

Mr. Hussain was selected to participate because he is a highly sought-after leader in the technology and
network services market and the Committee determined that his leadership would be critical to the Company
achieving its integration and synergy goals. Similarly, the Committee determined that Mr. Goff’s assistance was
critical to successfully attaining the regulatory approvals necessary to complete the Level 3 Combination and to
successfully integrating the legal and regulatory affairs of the Company post-Closing. These retention awards are
reported in the Summary Compensation Table under the column “Stock Awards” and also in the Grant of Plan-
Based Awards Table.

CenturyLink Signing Awards to Newly Named Executives. Both of our newly named executives received

certain cash and equity awards as inducements to join our senior leadership team following the Closing.

58

With respect to Mr. Storey, his offer letter entitled him to receive the following special awards:

• A cash signing bonus of $6,600,000, payable in cash in two equal installments, with the first

installment paid to him shortly following the Closing and the second installment to be paid on
November 1, 2018. The first installment ($3,300,000) is reported under the “Bonus” column of the
Summary Compensation Table and we expect that the second installment will be reported in the
Summary Compensation Table of next year’s proxy statement.

• An initial LTI grant valued at $10,469,000 at the Closing. This initial equity grant consisted of 60%

performance-based shares of restricted stock and 40% time-vested shares of restricted stock. Both the
time- and performance-based portions of this grant will vest on February 1, 2019 subject to
Mr. Storey’s continued employment through that date, but the payout on the performance-based shares
will range between 0% to 200% of the targeted amount, depending upon our performance as measured
against an adjusted EBITDA run rate goal. The Committee deferred finalizing the terms and conditions
of the performance-based portion of this award until February 2018, primarily in order to align the
performance metric used in Mr. Storey’s award with the performance metric used in the 2018
performance-based restricted shares awarded at such time in the ordinary course to our executives
(other than Mr. Storey), which are described further above under “— Annual Grants of Long -Term
Incentive Compensation — Recent Actions.” Consequently, Mr. Storey’s performance-based shares are
not reported as compensation in this year’s Summary Compensation Table or the other tables that
accompany it, but will be reported as 2018 compensation in next year’s proxy statement.

In addition, the Committee approved an acceleration of the vesting of Mr. Storey’s outstanding restricted

stock unit (“RSU”) awards that were previously granted by Level 3 and converted to CenturyLink restricted
stock units in the Level 3 Combination effective as of the Closing, except for 50% of the RSUs that had been
granted to him by Level 3 in 2017, which will vest as originally scheduled. Although the vesting of some of his
RSUs were accelerated, each will settle and pay out in shares of common stock in accordance with its original
payment schedule.

With respect to Mr. Patel, his offer letter entitled him to receive the following special awards:

• A cash signing bonus of $1,300,000, which was paid to him shortly after the Closing. This amount is

reported under the “Bonus” column of the Summary Compensation Table.

• Two special LTI grants in the form of shares of restricted stock:

• The first special LTI grant was valued at $1,500,000 and will vest on November 1, 2020,

assuming continuous employment through such date, with a payout range of between 0 to 200%
of the grant’s target value based on the level of achievement of two equally-weighted performance
criteria (attaining an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
(EBITDA) run rate goal, and a subjective evaluation of Mr. Patel’s performance by the
Committee). As with Mr. Storey’s above-described special award, the Committee finalized the
terms and conditions of the performance-based portion of Mr. Patel’s award in February 2018. As
with Mr. Storey’s award, Mr. Patel’s performance-based shares are not reported as compensation
in this year’s Summary Compensation Table or the other tables accompanying it, but will be
reported as 2018 compensation in next year’s proxy statement.

• The second special LTI grant was a time-vested restricted stock grant with a grant date value of

$1,300,000, which will vest on November 1, 2018, provided that Mr. Patel remains employed with
us on that date. This second LTI grant is reported in the Summary Compensation Table under the
column “Stock Awards” and also in the Grant of Plan-Based Awards Table.

In addition, the Committee approved the acceleration of vesting of Mr. Patel’s outstanding RSU awards that
were previously granted by Level 3 and converted to CenturyLink RSUs in the Level 3 Combination effective as
of the Closing, except with respect to the RSUs granted to him by Level 3 in 2017, which will continue to vest on

59

their original terms and conditions. In addition, all RSUs that were granted to him before 2017 were cancelled
and converted to a deferred cash award based on the per-share closing price of our common stock on the date of
Closing, which will be paid to Mr. Patel in cash on the same schedule that the now-cancelled awards would have
otherwise settled and paid out in shares.

Assumption of Level 3 Integration Awards with Continued Service Requirements. Prior to the Closing,

Level 3 also implemented certain retention programs in order to address its own transaction-related incentive and
retention concerns. The majority of these awards were paid out by Level 3 upon Closing. However, at the
Closing, we assumed the remaining portion of those awards for which any portion remained contingent on
continued service. Each of Messrs. Storey and Patel holds such an award. Specifically, provided the executive
continues to provide services to us through November 1, 2018, Mr. Storey is entitled to a cash payments totaling
$2,542,000 and Mr. Patel is entitled to cash payments totaling $1,429,000. Assuming the executive meets his
continued service requirement, this amount will be reported for him in the “Bonus” column of Summary
Compensation Table in our proxy statement for next year.

The number of time- and performance-based shares that were granted to our named executives in connection

with the Level 3 Combination are summarized in the “2017 Acquisition-Related Stock Awards” table below.

(1) For purposes of these grants, we determined both the number of time-vested and performance-based

restricted shares by dividing the total fair value granted to the executive by the volume-weighted average
closing price of our Common Shares over a 15-trading day period ending five trading days prior to the grant
date. In the Summary Compensation Table, however, our 2017 grants of time-vested restricted stock are
valued based on the closing stock price of our Common Shares on the day of grant and our 2017 grants of
performance-based restricted shares are valued as of the grant date based on probable outcomes, in each
case in accordance with mandated SEC disclosure rules. See footnote 2 to the Summary Compensation
Table for more information.

(2) As described under “— CenturyLink Signing Awards to Newly Named Executives”, the terms and

conditions for these awards were set in February 2018. As such, in accordance with FASB ASB Topic 718
and mandated SEC disclosure rules, these awards are not reported in the Summary Compensation Table or
the tables accompanying it.

Compensation Paid to our Former Executive

As noted previously, the CFO succession plan was negotiated in conjunction with the Level 3 Combination

and Mr. Ewing, who served as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer prior to the Level 3
Combination, agreed to step down from all executive positions at the Closing. After a short transition period,
Mr. Ewing fully retired from the Company on November 17, 2017.

60

In addition to the compensation Mr. Ewing earned while an employee and amounts or broad-based benefits

paid or payable to him under our existing programs, the Committee made certain supplemental compensation
awards. Because Mr. Ewing was willing and able to continue serving as our CFO after the Closing if not for the
CFO succession plan, the Committee determined that he qualified for payments under our executive severance
plan (which is described in greater detail under “— Other Benefits — Severance Benefits” below) of which 52
weeks of severance benefits was contractually due to Mr. Ewing ($1,399,158), increased by another 52 weeks at
the Committee’s discretion ($1,399,158), for a total cash severance payable to him of $2,798,316. Given that he
was retirement-eligible at the time of his departure, under the terms of our STI program, Mr. Ewing earned a
pro-rated annual bonus for 2017 based on actual performance. The Committee also approved certain changes to
his outstanding equity awards. Specifically, the Committee accelerated the vesting of his fiscal 2015, 2016 and
2017 shares of time-vested restricted stock (5,369, 15,946 and 24,842 shares, respectively) effective on his
retirement date. With respect to his performance-based restricted stock, Mr. Ewing was permitted to continue to
hold those awards granted to him in fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017 (24,160, 35,879 and 37,265 shares, respectively),
in each case subject to their original performance conditions. The Committee also approved a special
discretionary cash bonus of $1,000,000. In approving the additional severance benefits, accelerated vesting of his
outstanding stock awards and special cash bonus, the Committee considered a range of factors, including (i) the
critical role Mr. Ewing played in negotiating, financing and implementing the Level 3 Combination, (ii) his
contributions to the growth of CenturyLink over the past 34 years and the implementation of the CFO succession
plan and (iii) Mr. Ewing’s agreement to, among other things, waive any claims against us and refrain from
competing against us for a year.

Other Benefits

As a final component of executive compensation, we provide a broad array of benefits designed to be
competitive, in the aggregate, with similar benefits provided by our peers. We summarize these additional
benefits below.

Retirement Plans. We maintain traditional broad-based qualified defined benefit and defined contribution

retirement plans for our employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. With respect to these qualified
plans, we maintain nonqualified plans that permit our officers to receive or defer supplemental amounts in excess
of federally-imposed caps that limit the amount of benefits highly-compensated employees are entitled to receive
under qualified plans. Additional information regarding our retirement plans is provided in the tables and
accompanying discussion included below under the heading “Executive Compensation.”

Change of Control Arrangements. We have agreed to provide cash and other severance benefits to each of
our executive officers who is terminated under certain specified circumstances following a change of control of
CenturyLink. If triggered, benefits under these change of control agreements include payment of (i) a lump sum
cash severance payment equal to a multiple of the officer’s annual cash compensation, (ii) the officer’s annual
bonus, based on actual performance and the portion of the year served, (iii) certain welfare benefits are continued
for a limited period, and (iv) the value or benefit of any long-term equity incentive compensation, if and to the
extent that the exercisability, vesting or payment thereof is accelerated or otherwise enhanced upon a change of
control pursuant to the terms of any applicable long-term equity incentive compensation plan or agreement.

Under these agreements, change of control benefits are payable to our executive officers if within a certain

specified period following a change in control (referred to as the “protected period”) the officer is terminated
without cause or resigns with “good reason,” which is defined to include a diminution of responsibilities, an
assignment of inappropriate duties, and a transfer of the officer exceeding 50 miles.

61

The table below shows (i) the length of the “protected period” afforded to officers following a change of

control and (ii) the multiple of salary and bonus payment and years of welfare benefits to which officers will be
entitled if change of control benefits become payable under our agreements and related policies:

For more information on change of control arrangements applicable to our executives, including our

rationale for providing these benefits, see “Executive Compensation — Potential Termination Payments —
Payments Made Upon a Change of Control.” For information on change of control severance benefits payable to
our junior officers and managers, see “— Severance Benefits” in the next subsection below.

Severance Benefits. Our executive severance plan provides cash severance payments equal to two years of
total targeted cash compensation (defined as salary plus the targeted amount of annual incentive bonus) for our
CEO or one year of total targeted cash compensation for any other senior officer in the event that the senior
officer is involuntarily terminated by us without cause in the absence of a change of control.

Payments to senior officers terminated in connection with a change of control are separately governed by

the change of control arrangements discussed immediately above under the heading “— Change of Control
Arrangements.”

Under our executive severance plan, subject to certain conditions and exclusions, more junior officers or

managers receive certain specified cash payments and other benefits if they are either (i) involuntarily terminated
without cause in the absence of a change of control or (ii) involuntarily terminated without cause or resign with
good reason in connection with a change of control. Our full-time non-union employees not covered by our
executive severance plan may, subject to certain conditions, be entitled to certain specified cash severance
payments in connection with certain qualifying terminations.

Under a policy that we adopted in 2012, we are required to seek shareholder approval of any future senior

executive severance agreements providing for cash payments, perquisites and accelerated health or welfare
benefits with a value greater than 2.99 times the sum of the executive’s base salary plus target bonus.

Level 3 Key Executive Severance Plan. CenturyLink assumed various benefit plans as part of the

Combination, including the Level 3 Key Executive Severance Plan (the “KESP”). The KESP will remain in
effect through the two-year anniversary of the Closing and certain employees who joined us in connection with
the Level 3 Combination will continue to participate in it during that two-year period. Following the two-year
period, severance rights and benefits for current participants of KESP will be governed by CenturyLink’s
executive severance plan and change of control arrangements discussed above.

Messrs. Storey and Patel are currently participants in the KESP, which provides for the severance benefits
described below upon a qualifying termination. In consideration for the severance benefits under the KESP, the
executive officers are required to execute a release of claims and are subject to restrictive covenants concerning
noncompetition and non-solicitation of employees, customers and business partners, in each case for 24 months
following the applicable date of termination with respect to Messrs. Storey and Patel.

Upon a qualifying termination, a KESP participant would be entitled to receive certain payments and

benefits, including (i) a lump sum cash severance payment equal to a two times the sum of the participant’s base
salary and most recent target annual bonus, (ii) a pro-rated annual bonus for the year of termination, (iii) a lump

62

sum cash payment equal the total of certain welfare benefit premium payments that the company would have
been obliged to cover over a 24-month period, and (iv) reimbursement of up to $10,000 for the cost of
outplacement services.

As provided in his offer letter, if, as anticipated, Mr. Storey assumes the position of CEO prior to the

expiration of the KESP on the second anniversary of the Closing, then he will cease as a participant of the KESP
effective with his appointment as CEO and his severance rights and benefits will be governed by the CenturyLink
executive severance plan and change of control arrangements discussed above.

Life Insurance Benefits. We sponsor a long-standing supplemental life insurance premium reimbursement
plan that has been closed to new participants for nearly a decade. Under this plan, three of our current or former
senior officers hold supplemental life insurance policies for which we are obligated to pay the premiums. We paid
no premiums to fund these benefits from 2012 to 2016, and therefore no premium reimbursement amounts were
reported in the Summary Compensation Table for any of those years. Over the past several years, we began to assist
our officers in converting older life insurance policies into newer, lower-cost policies. Most recently, in December
2016, we converted the last of these policies and were able to fix the cost of future annual premiums, resulting in
reductions ranging from 33% to 91% from premiums paid in 2011. In 2017, the Committee approved the
resumption of premium payments on behalf of our four grandfathered senior executives, and the Company paid
premium for years 2016 and 2017. As such, the amount reflected in the Summary Compensation Table represents
twice the annual premium cost that is due in future years. In consultation with the Committee, we plan to continue
to evaluate other options to control the cost of providing these benefits to the three grandfathered plan participants.

Perquisites. Officers are entitled to be reimbursed for the cost of an annual physical examination, plus

related travel expenses.

Our aircraft usage policy permits the CEO to use our aircraft for personal travel without reimbursing us, and

permits each other executive officer to use our aircraft for up to $10,000 per year in personal travel without
reimbursing us. Under the terms of our offer letter with Mr. Storey, however, he is not subject to this limitation
on aircraft usage during his interim service as President and COO. In all such cases, personal travel is permitted
only if aircraft is available and not needed for superseding business purposes. Periodically, the Committee
reviews the cost associated with the personal use of aircraft by senior management, and determines whether or
not to alter our aircraft usage policy. In connection with electing to retain this policy, the Committee has
determined that the policy (i) provides valuable and cost-effective benefits to our executives that reside or
frequently travel into our corporate headquarters that is located in a small city with limited commercial airline
service, (ii) enables our executives to travel in a manner that we believe is more expeditious than commercial
airline service, and (iii) is being implemented responsibly by the executives.

For purposes of valuing and reporting the use of our aircraft, we determine the incremental cost of aircraft

usage on an hourly basis, calculated in accordance with applicable guidelines of the SEC. The incremental cost of
this usage, which may be substantially different than the cost as determined under alternative calculation
methodologies, is reported in the Summary Compensation Table appearing below.

From time to time, we have scheduled one of our annual regular board meetings and related committee

meetings over a multi-day period. These meetings are often held in an area where we conduct operations, and in
such cases include site visits that enable our directors and senior officers to meet with local personnel. The
spouses of our directors and executive officers are invited to attend these retreats, and we typically schedule
recreational activities for those who are able and willing to participate.

For more information on the items under this heading, see the Summary Compensation Table appearing

below.

Other Employee Benefits. We maintain certain broad-based employee welfare benefit plans in which the

executive officers are generally permitted to participate on terms that are either substantially similar to those

63

provided to all other participants or which provide our executives with enhanced benefits upon their death or
disability. We also maintain a supplemental disability plan designed to ensure disability payments to our officers
in the event payments are unavailable from our disability insurer.

IV. Our Policies, Processes and Guidelines Related to Executive Compensation
Our Compensation Decision-Making Process

As described further below, the Committee, subject to the Board’s oversight, establishes, evaluates and

monitors our executive compensation programs. The compensation decision-making process includes input from
the Committee’s independent consultant, our CEO and other members of management, and involves a careful
balancing of a wide range of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:

Structure and Elements of Pay Programs

Compensation Decision-Making Considerations

The competitive compensation practices of peer companies

Role of Human Resources and Compensation Committee. Subject to the Board’s oversight, the Committee

establishes, evaluates and monitors our executive compensation programs and oversees our human resources
strategies. Specifically, the Committee approves:

•

•

•

•

the compensation payable to each executive officer, as well as any other senior officer;

for our STI and performance-based LTI programs, (i) the performance objectives, (ii) the “threshold,”
“target” and “maximum” threshold levels of performance, (iii) the weighting of the performance
objectives, (iv) the amount of bonus payable or shares to vest if the target level of performance is
attained and (v) the finally determined amount of cash bonus payments or fully-vested shares;

the peer group for compensation benchmarking and the peer group for performance benchmarking; and

a delegation of authority to the CEO for LTI grants to our non-senior officers.

Among other things, the Committee also establishes, implements, administers and monitors our director

cash and equity compensation programs. For more information, see “Director Compensation.”

Role of Compensation Consultants. The Committee engages the services of a compensation consultant to

assist in the design and review of executive compensation programs, to determine whether the Committee’s
philosophy and practices are reasonable and compatible with prevailing practices, and to provide guidance on
specific compensation levels based on industry trends and practices.

The Committee has used Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC (“Meridian”) as its compensation

consultant since August 2015. During 2017, representatives of Meridian actively participated in the design and
development of our executive compensation programs, assisted in the development of special non-recurring
compensation grants and attended all of the Committee’s meetings. Meridian provides no other services to the
Company, and, to our knowledge, has no prior relationship with any of our named executive officers. As required
by SEC rules and NYSE listing standards, the Committee has assessed the independence of Meridian and
concluded that its work has not raised any conflicts of interest.

Role of CEO and Management. Although the Compensation Committee is responsible for all executive

compensation decisions, each year it solicits and receives the CEO’s recommendations, particularly with respect
to senior officers’ salaries and performance in the key areas outlined above in “— Our Compensation Decision-
Making Process.”

Senior Officers. The CEO and the executive management team, in consultation with the compensation
consultant, recommend to the Committee business goals to be used in establishing incentive compensation
performance targets and awards for our senior officers. In addition, our Executive Vice President, Human
Resources, works closely with the Committee and its compensation consultant to ensure that the Committee is
provided with appropriate information to discharge its responsibilities.

Non-Senior Officers. The Committee oversees our processes and receives an annual report from the CEO on

the compensation programs for our non-senior officers. The CEO, in consultation with the executive
management team, is responsible for approval of:

•

•

the total cash compensation paid to our non-senior officers; and

all LTI awards to the non-senior officers, acting under authority delegated to him by the Committee in
accordance with our shareholder-approved equity plans.

Timing of Long-Term Incentive Awards. The Committee typically makes annual LTI grants to executives

during the first quarter after we publicly release our earnings. However, the Committee may defer grants for a
variety of reasons, including to request additional information or conduct further reviews of management’s
performance. In addition, the Committee may grant special awards at different times during the year, when and
as merited by the circumstances. LTI grants to newly-hired executive officers are typically made at the next
regularly-scheduled Committee meeting following their hire date.

65

Tally Sheets. Each year, we compile lists of compensation data relating to each of our executives. These

“tally sheets” include annual compensation data for each executive, including his or her salary, STI award, LTI
award, and realizable pay. These tally sheets also contain performance highlights on results and behaviors for
each of our executives. The Committee uses these tally sheets to (i) review the total annual compensation of the
executive officers and (ii) ensure that the Committee has a comprehensive understanding of all elements of our
compensation programs.

Risk Assessment. As part of its duties, the Committee assesses risks arising out of our employee

compensation policies and practices. Based on its most recent assessment, the Committee does not believe that
the risks arising from our compensation policies and practices are reasonably likely to materially adversely affect
us. In reaching this determination, we have taken into account the risk exposures of our operations and the
following design elements of our compensation programs and policies:

•

•

•

•

•

our balance of annual and long-term compensation elements at the executive and management levels,

our use in most years of a diverse mix of performance metrics that create incentives for management to
attain goals well aligned with the shareholders’ interests,

the multi-year vesting of LTI awards, which promotes focus on our long-term performance and
mitigates the risk of undue focus on our short-term results,

“clawback” policies and award caps that provide safeguards against inappropriate behavior, and

bonus arrangements that generally permit either the Committee (for compensation payable to senior
officers) or senior management (for compensation payable to other key employees) to exercise
“negative discretion” to reduce the amount of certain incentive awards.

We believe these features, as well as the stock ownership requirements for our executive officers, result in a
compensation program that aligns our executives’ interests with those of our shareholders and does not promote
excessive risk-taking on the part of our executives or other employees.

Use of “Benchmarking” Data

General. Each year, with assistance from its consultant, the Committee reviews “peer groups” of other

companies comparable to CenturyLink for purposes of assessing our comparative compensation and
performance. We typically perform this analysis in the second half of each year in order to ensure the data
remains well-suited for its intended purposes and uses during the upcoming year. However, during 2017, the
Committee conducted supplemental analyses in connection with preparing for the changes in the size and
character of the Company resulting from the Level 3 Combination.

Compensation Benchmarking. The Committee, based on input from its compensation consultant, reviewed

peer group and survey data in support of pay decisions for our senior officers in order to benchmark
compensation levels for our executives against peer executives at companies that are comparable to ours based
on revenue size, market cap, industry and business model.

For our named executive officers, our compensation consultant compiled the compensation data publicly
disclosed by the companies included within the peer groups identified below. During 2017, when making our
overall compensation pay decisions, our pre-combination compensation benchmarking was distinct from our
post-combination compensation benchmarking.

In preparation for 2017 pay decisions, the Committee reviewed the continued suitability of the 2016 peer

group and elected to remove Cablevision Systems Corporation and Time Warner Cable and approved the
resulting revised peer group labeled below as the “Pre-Combination Peer Group for 2017 Compensation
Benchmarking.” The Committee and its consultant used this pre-combination peer group for purposes of

66

assessing the reasonableness of our compensation prior to the Level 3 Combination. In selecting the companies
included in this peer group, the Committee focused principally on telecommunications, cable and other
communications companies that were generally comparable to us, prior to the Combination, in terms of size,
markets and operations.

In anticipation of the Combination, the Committee reviewed the pre-combination peer group and in May
2017 elected to add AT&T, HP Inc., and Verizon while at the same time removing Level 3, Windstream and
Xerox, which resulted in the revised peer group labeled below as the “Post-Combination Peer Group for 2017
Compensation Benchmarking.” In selecting the 16 peer companies included in this revised group, the Committee
focused principally on telecommunications, cable and other communications companies that are generally
comparable to us, following the Combination, in terms of size, markets and operations. The Committee analyzed
post-combination peer group data when making compensation pay decisions that became effective upon the
Closing.

In order to provide the Committee with additional information in support of their compensation decisions, a
secondary “High Tech” peer group was developed. It includes companies across all aspects of high tech in such
areas as IT services, Software, Hardware, Consulting, Distributors and Semiconductors. This group serves as a
supplement to the revised peer group and provides an additional perspective on pay levels and practices for the
technology industry sector.

In addition to the pre- and post-combination compensation peer groups described above, the Committee’s

compensation consultant utilized, to a lesser degree, survey data containing compensation information for
companies in the telecommunications industry and general industry that are generally similar in size to us for
executive positions where needed.

For additional information about how we set pay levels, see “— Our Compensation Decision-Making

Process.”

Performance Benchmarking. With the aid of its compensation consultant, the Committee annually reviews
the broad industry peer group that it introduced in 2013 for purposes of benchmarking our relative performance
based upon our historical three-year TSR. This peer group is focused principally on telecommunications, cable
and other communications companies that are generally comparable to us in terms of size, markets and
operations. The peer group is substantially similar to the peer group of 2016 with the exception that Cablevision
Systems Corporation was acquired by Altice in May 2016 and was therefore removed from the TSR peer group.
In addition, JDS Uniphase Corporation changed its name to Viavi Solutions after spinning off a portion of its
operations. Our 2017 peer groups for compensation benchmarking were somewhat constrained by the number of
companies and revenue and market cap size. In contrast, the peer group for performance benchmarking is
comprised of a broader universe of companies we believe investors are considering when they decide whether to
invest in us or our industry.

Forfeiture of Prior Compensation

For approximately 20 years, all recipients of our LTI grants have been required to contractually agree to

forfeit certain of their awards (and to return to us any cash, securities or other assets received by them upon the
sale of Common Shares they acquired through certain prior equity awards) if at any time during their
employment with us or within 18 months after termination of employment they engage in activity contrary or
harmful to our interests. The Committee is authorized to waive these forfeiture provisions if it determines in its
sole discretion that such action is in our best interests. Our STI plan contains substantially similar forfeiture
provisions.

Our Corporate Governance Guidelines authorize the Board to recover, or “clawback,” compensation from

an executive officer if the Board determines that any bonus, incentive payment, equity award or other
compensation received by the executive was based on any financial or operating result that was impacted by the
executive’s knowing or intentional fraudulent or illegal conduct. Certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of

68

2002 would require our CEO and CFO to reimburse us for incentive compensation paid or trading profits earned
following the release of financial statements that are subsequently restated due to material noncompliance with
SEC reporting requirements caused by misconduct. In addition, provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 will, upon the completion of related rulemaking, require all of our
current or former executive officers to make similar reimbursement payments in connection with certain financial
statement restatements, irrespective of whether such executives were involved with the mistake that caused the
restatement.

Stock Ownership Guidelines

Under our current stock ownership guidelines, our executive officers are required to beneficially own

CenturyLink stock in market value equal to a multiple of their annual salary, as outlined in the table below, and
each outside director must beneficially own CenturyLink stock equal in market value to five times the annual
cash retainer payable to outside directors. Each executive officer and outside director has three and five years,
respectively, to attain these targets.

Executive Officer
CEO . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
All Other Executive Officers . . . . .

(1) Based on annual salary as of December 31, 2017
(2) Based on average annual salary for all other executive officers as of December 31, 2017

For any year during which an executive or outside director does not meet his or her ownership target, the

executive or director is required to hold 65% of the CenturyLink stock that he or she acquires through our equity
compensation programs, excluding shares sold to pay related taxes.

As of December 31, 2017, all of our executive officers and all of our outside directors were in compliance

with, and in most cases significantly exceeded, our stock ownership guidelines. For additional information on our
stock ownership guidelines, see “Governance Guidelines.”

Use of Employment Agreements

We have a long-standing practice of not providing employment agreements to our officers, and none of our
executives has an employment agreement. However, we do from time to time enter into initial employment offer
letters with prospective new employees, including executive officers. In connection with the Level 3
Combination, we entered into an offer letter with each of our newly named executives, Messrs. Storey and Patel.

Tax Gross-ups

We do not provide tax gross-up benefits in any of our executive compensation programs. However, our

broad-based relocation policy provides for a tax gross-up to any employee who qualifies for relocation expense
reimbursement. We do not intend to provide tax gross-up benefits in any new executive compensation programs.

Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policies

Under our insider trading policy, our employees and directors may not:

•

•

purchase or sell short-term options with respect to CenturyLink shares,

engage in “short sales” of CenturyLink shares, or

69

•

engage in hedging transactions involving CenturyLink shares which allow employees to fix the value
of their CenturyLink shareholdings without all the risks of ownership or cause them to no longer have
the same interests or objectives as our other shareholders.

In addition, under our insider trading policy, our senior officers and directors are prohibited from holding

our securities in a margin account or otherwise pledging our securities as collateral.

To our knowledge, all of our senior officers and directors are currently in compliance with our anti-hedging

and anti-pledging policies.

Deductibility of Executive Compensation

Section 162(m) of the Code limits the amount of compensation paid to certain covered officers that we may

deduct for federal income tax purposes to $1 million per covered officer per year.

Historically, compensation that qualified as “performance-based compensation” within the meaning of

Section 162(m) was not subject to the $1 million limitation. In recent years, largely due to the availability of this
performance-based exemption, the deductibility of various payments and benefits has been one factor among
many considered by the Committee in determining executive compensation. As in previous years, our 2017
executive compensation program was designed to allow us to grant certain awards (including our STI and
performance-based LTI awards) that were intended to qualify as performance-based for purposes of
Section 162(m) and thus be fully deductible.

However, the federal tax reform legislation passed in December 2017 included significant changes to

Section 162(m). Among these changes were an expansion of the scope of covered officers subject to the
Section 162(m) deduction limitation and the elimination of the performance-based compensation exemption. For
taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, compensation paid to a covered officer in excess of $1 million
will not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain performance-based
arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. Among other things, this means that all compensation paid to
each covered officer in 2018 and beyond will be subject to the $1 million deduction limitation, regardless of
whether it is structured as performance-based compensation, unless the transition relief applies.

Section 162(m) is highly technical and complex. Because of ambiguities as to the application and

interpretation of Section 162(m), including the uncertain scope of the transition relief for “grandfathered”
performance-based compensation, we can give no assurance that compensation intended to satisfy the
requirements for performance-based exemption from the Section 162(m) deduction limit will, in fact, satisfy the
exemption. Further, the Committee reserves the right to modify compensation that was initially intended to be
exempt from Section 162(m) if it determines that such modifications are consistent with the company’s business
needs.

(1) The amounts shown in this column reflect:

•

•

•

•

the cash portion of integration awards granted to Messrs. Post, Hussain and Goff on June 1, 2017 in
connection with the Level 3 Combination, which was paid to each at the Closing;

the cash signing bonus paid to Messrs. Patel and Storey, our newly named executives, under their offer
letters (all of which was paid to Mr. Patel at the Closing and one-half of which was paid to Mr. Storey
at the Closing, with the other half, not included in the table above, to be paid to him on November 1,
2018, subject to his continued employment);

the short-term incentive bonus payments made to each of our newly named executives for the
two-month period ending December 31, 2017 under the legacy Level 3 Discretionary Bonus Plan; and

a special discretionary cash bonus made to Mr. Ewing in late 2017 under the separation agreement
described in Note 10 below.

71

For additional information about these cash awards, see “Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Our
Compensation Program Objectives and Components of Pay – Short Term Incentive Bonuses” and
“– Awards Related to Level 3 Combination.”

(2) The amounts shown in this column reflect:

•

•

•

•

the fair value of annual grants of restricted stock awards made to our legacy named executives under
our long-term incentive compensation program;

the fair value of special retention or integration awards of restricted stock made to Messrs. Post,
Hussain and Goff on June 1, 2017 in connection with the Level 3 Combination;

the fair value of the time-vested portion of signing date grants of restricted stock made to our newly
named executives at the Closing in accordance with their offer letters; and

the incremental fair value of certain RSUs held by each of Messrs. Patel and Storey, all of which were
originally granted by Level 3 and converted to CenturyLink RSUs in the Level 3 Combination, for
which vesting was accelerated at the Closing as provided in their offer letters to induce the executives
to join our senior leadership team.

For additional information about the equity grants made during 2017 and the acceleration of the RSUs held
by our newly named executives, see “Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Our Compensation Program
Objectives and Components of Pay – Annual Grants of Long-Term Incentive Compensation” and
“– Awards Related to Level 3 Combination.”

The fair value of the awards presented in the table above has been determined in accordance with FASB
ASC Topic 718. For purposes of this table, in accordance with SEC disclosure rules we determined the fair
value of shares of:

•

•

•

•

time-vested restricted stock – including the time-vested portion of annual grants, integration awards
(for which the degree of vesting depends on a subjective performance evaluation), retention awards,
and the time-vested portion of signing awards – based on the closing trading price of our Common
Shares on the day of grant;

relative performance-based restricted stock (as defined below) as of the grant date based on probable
outcomes using Monte Carlo simulations;

absolute performance-based restricted stock (as defined below) based on probable outcomes (subject to
future adjustments based upon changes in the closing trading price of our Common Shares at the end of
each reporting period); and

for the modified RSUs held by the newly-named executives, the incremental fair value of the modified
award (fair value of the modified award minus the fair value of the original award, each as of the
modification date).

The aggregate value of the restricted stock awards granted to these named executives in 2017, based on the
grant date closing trading price of our Common Shares and assuming maximum payout of his performance-
based restricted shares, would be as follows: Mr. Post, $14,977,994, Mr. Patel, $1,202,679, Mr. Hussain,
$6,462,460, Mr. Goff, $7,138,620, Mr. Storey, $3,874,093, and Mr. Ewing, $2,451,507. See Note 10 titled
“Share-based Compensation” of the notes to our audited financial statements included in Appendix B for an
explanation of material assumptions that we used to calculate the fair value of these stock awards.

(3) The amounts shown in this column reflect cash payments made under our short-term incentive program for
actual performance in the respective years. For additional information, see “– Incentive Compensation and
Other Awards – 2017 Awards.”

(4) Reflects the net change during each of the years reflected in the present value of the named executives’

accumulated benefits under the defined benefit plans discussed below under the heading “– Pension
Benefits.” The net change was negative for Mr. Goff in 2015 and is reported as no change in accordance
with applicable SEC rules.

72

(5) The amounts shown in this column are comprised of (i) reimbursements for the cost of an annual physical

examination, (ii) personal use of our aircraft, (iii) contributions or other allocations to our defined
contribution plans, (iv) the resumption of payments of life insurance premiums under a legacy
reimbursement plan, and (v) cash severance payments and other post-employment benefits in each case for
and on behalf of the named executives as follows:

In accordance with applicable SEC and accounting rules, we have not reflected the accrual or payment of
dividends relating to unvested restricted stock as compensation in the Summary Compensation Table. In
addition, the amounts shown in the Summary Compensation Table do not reflect any benefits associated
with the named officers or their family members participating in recreational activities scheduled during
board retreats. For additional information, see “Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Our Compensation
Program Objectives and Components of Pay – Other Benefits –Perquisites.”

(6) Effective at the Closing, Mr. Patel was appointed as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial

Officer. The amounts reflected in the Summary Compensation Table above include only compensation paid
to Mr. Patel by us between November 1 and December 31, 2017, including the signing date cash and equity
awards referenced in Notes 1 and 2 above.

(7) Effective at the Closing, Mr. Patel was granted (i) 77,742 shares of performance-based restricted stock and

(ii) 67,377 shares of time-vested restricted stock. For the reasons discussed under “Compensation
Discussion and Analysis,” the Company’s Compensation Committee established the metric applicable to
Mr. Patel’s performance-based restricted shares in February 2018. Pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 718, the
grant of Mr. Patel’s award of those performance-based restricted shares is deemed to have occurred in 2018
and, accordingly, the fair value of this grant will be reported as 2018 compensation in our 2019 proxy
statement. As such, the chart above reflects only the fair value of the above-described time-vested restricted
shares.

(8) Effective at the Closing, Mr. Storey was appointed as our President and Chief Operating Officer. The

amounts reflected in the Summary Compensation Table include only compensation paid to Mr. Storey by us
between November 1 and December 31, 2017, including the signing date cash and equity awards referenced
in Notes 1 and 2 above.

(9) Effective at the Closing, Mr. Storey was granted (i) 325,554 shares of performance-based restricted stock

and (ii) 217,036 shares of time-vested restricted stock. For the reasons discussed under “Compensation
Discussion and Analysis,” the Company’s Compensation Committee established the metric applicable to
Mr. Storey’s performance-based restricted shares in early 2018. Pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 718, the
grant of Mr. Storey’s award of those performance-based restricted shares is deemed to have occurred in
2018 and, accordingly, the fair value of this grant will be reported as 2018 compensation in our 2019 proxy

73

statement. As such, the Summary Compensation Table above reflects only the fair value of the above-
described time-vested restricted shares.

(10) Mr. Ewing agreed to step down as our Chief Financial Officer at the Closing, and following a short

transition period he fully retired on November 17, 2017. Portions of his 2017 compensation are attributable
to payments made under a separation agreement we entered into with him in connection with his retirement.
For additional information about Mr. Ewing’s separation compensation, see “Compensation Discussion and
Analysis – Our Compensation Program Objectives and Components of Pay – Compensation Paid to Our
Former Executive.”

Long-Term Incentive Compensation,” and “ — Awards Related to Level 3 Combination.”

(3) These columns provide information on the potential payouts under the annual bonus program for 2017 for
our legacy named executives (the CenturyLink STI Plan). The actual amounts paid for 2017 performance
are reported in the “Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation” column of the Summary Compensation
Table. Failure to meet the “threshold” level of performance would result in no payout to the executive.

(4) Represents the relative and absolute performance awards granted to each of our legacy named officers on

February 21, 2017 (as part of our annual LTI program), as described in greater detail below.

(5) Represents the time-vested awards granted to each of our legacy named officers on February 21, 2017 (as
part of our annual LTI program), to certain legacy named officers on June 1, 2017 (under our integration
and retention award programs), and to our newly named officers on November 1, 2017 (as signing awards
under their offer letters), as described in greater detail below.

(6) Calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 in the manner described in Note 1 to the Summary

Compensation Table above.

Short-Term Incentive Compensation. Our legacy named executives participated in the CenturyLink short-

term incentive program for 2017, but our newly named executives, who were employed with us for only two
months of 2017, earned discretionary bonuses under the Legacy Level 3 Discretionary Bonus Program. For more
information regarding these programs, including the specific performance metrics applicable to the CenturyLink
STI program, see “Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Our Compensation Program Objectives and
Components of Pay — Short-Term Incentive Bonuses.”

Annual Grants of Long-Term Incentive Compensation. We make annual grants of long-term incentive

awards to our executive officers. For the past several years, these awards have been 40% time-vested and 60%

75

performance-based. In February 2017, each of our legacy named executives was granted both time- and
performance-based shares of restricted stock under this program. The time-vested shares will vest one-third per
year over the first three anniversaries of the date of grant and the performance-based shares will vest in February
2020, depending upon our attainment of two separate performance metrics as measured over a three-year
performance period (our total shareholder return, the “relative” metric, and our attainment of absolute revenue
targets, the “absolute” metric). For more information, see “Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Our
Compensation Program Objectives and Components of Pay — Annual Grants of Long-Term Incentive
Compensation.”

Awards Related to Level 3 Combination. We granted a combination of integration and retention awards to

certain legacy named executives, in order to retain and incentivize them through the closing of the Level 3
Combination and the critical post-Closing integration period. In addition, we granted certain cash and equity
awards to our newly named executives in order to incentivize them to join our senior leadership team following
the Level 3 Combination. For more information on these programs, see “Compensation Discussion and
Analysis — Our Compensation Program Objectives and Components of Pay — Awards Related to Level 3
Combination.

Acceleration of Vesting of Equity Awards. All of the shares of the time-vested restricted stock and

performance-based restricted stock awarded in 2017 also vest upon the death or disability of the named officer,
and some or all of these shares may under certain circumstances vest or remain subject to future vesting upon the
retirement of the named officer at his or her early or normal retirement age. In addition, upon certain terminations
of employment following a change of control of the Company, the shares of the 2017 time-vested restricted stock
will vest and the shares of the 2017 performance-based restricted stock will remain subject to future vesting, all
as described in greater detail below under “ — Potential Termination Payments.” The vesting terms for our
outstanding restricted stock granted in earlier years are described in our prior proxy statements.

Dividends and Voting Rights. All dividends related to shares of the above-described time-vested and

performance-based restricted stock will be paid to the holder only upon the vesting of such shares. Unless and
until forfeited, these shares may be voted by the named executive officers.

Forfeiture. All of these above-described restricted shares are subject to forfeiture if the officer competes

with us or engages in certain other activities harmful to us, all as specified further in the forms of incentive
agreements that we have filed with the SEC. For more information, see “ — Potential Termination Payments.”

Outstanding Awards. The following table summarizes information about all outstanding unvested equity

awards held by our named executives at December 31, 2017.

(1) All information presented in this table is as of December 31, 2017, and does not reflect vesting of

outstanding equity awards or issuance of additional awards since such date.

(2) Represents performance-based restricted shares granted on February 23, 2015, February 23, 2016 and

February 21, 2017 to our legacy named officers. The table above assumes, as of December 31, 2017, that we
would perform at “target” levels, such that all performance-based shares granted to each named executive
would vest fully. For additional information on the vesting and other terms of our most recent grant of
performance-based restricted shares, see “ — Incentive Compensation and other Awards” and “ — Terms of
2017 Restricted Stock Awards.”

(3) As explained in greater detail under “Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Annual Grants of Long-

Term Incentive Compensation — Recent Events,” all of these shares will vest upon Mr. Post’s retirement at
the meeting.

(4) Represents restricted stock units, originally granted to our newly named executives by Level 3, which were

converted to time-vested CenturyLink restricted stock units as a result of the Level 3 Combination. These
grants vested or will vest on March 1 of 2018, 2019 and 2020, subject to the executive’s continued
employment through the applicable vesting date.

(5) As described in greater detail elsewhere herein, Mr. Patel received two special equity grants at Closing, one

of which was time-vested and the other performance-based. The table above reflects only the time-vested
portion of Mr. Patel’s signing equity grants, which will vest on November 1, 2018 subject to his continued
employment through that date. As described further elsewhere herein, because the performance metrics for
the performance-based award were not established until early 2018, under applicable accounting rules the
grant date of that award (77,742 shares, with a market value of $1,296,737 on December 31, 2017) did not
occur until 2018 and thus will first be reported in these tables in our 2019 proxy statement.

77

(6) These shares of time-vested restricted stock vested on February 23, 2018, subject to the executive’s

continued employment through that date.

(7) These shares of time-vested restricted stock vested or will vest in two equal installments on February 23 of

2018 and 2019, subject to the executive’s continued employment through the applicable vesting date.

(8) These shares of time-vested restricted stock vested or will vest in three equal installments on February 21 of
2018, 2019, and 2020, subject to the executive’s continued employment through the applicable vesting date.

(9) Represents shares of restricted stock granted under an integration award program to certain legacy named

executives. These awards will vest on December 15, 2018, subject to the executive’s continued employment
through that date, with the actual payout ranging between 80-120% of the number of shares granted based
on the Committee’s subjective evaluation of the executive’s individual performance between the Closing
and the vesting date.

(10) Represents shares of restricted stock granted under a retention award program to certain legacy named
executives. These awards will vest one-third per year on June 1 of 2018, 2019, and 2020, subject to the
executive’s continued employment through the applicable vesting date.

(11) As described in greater detail elsewhere herein, Mr. Storey received two special equity grants at Closing,

one of which was time-vested and the other performance-based. The table above reflects only the time-
vested portion of Mr. Storey’s signing equity grant, which will vest on February 1, 2019 subject to his
continued employment through that date. As described further elsewhere herein, because the performance
metrics for the performance-based award were not established until early 2018, under applicable accounting
rules the grant date of that award (325,554 shares, with a market value of $5,430,241 on December 31,
2017) did not occur until 2018 and thus will first be reported in these tables in our 2019 proxy statement.
(12) In early 2018, we determined that, with respect to the 2015 grants, for which the three-year performance

period ended on December 31, 2017, (i) none of the TSR performance-based restricted stock would vest and
all such shares would be forfeited and (ii) 76.2% of the absolute revenue performance-based restricted
would vest and the remaining shares would be forfeited.

(13) Upon Mr. Ewing’s retirement, he was permitted to retain his outstanding performance-based awards, which
remain subject to their original performance conditions. For more information on Mr. Ewing’s termination-
related compensation, see “Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Our Compensation Program
Objectives and Components of Pay — Compensation Paid to Our Former Executive” and “Potential
Termination Payments — Amounts Paid to Former Executive.”

Vesting of Equity Awards During 2017. The following table provides details regarding the shares of

restricted stock or restricted stock units held by our named executives that vested during 2017. Although there
were some stock options outstanding during part of 2017, all such options held by our named executives expired,
unexercised, on February 21, 2017.

(1) For each of our legacy named executives, this represents the vesting of (i) time-vested restricted shares

granted in 2014, 2015 and 2016, and (ii) certain performance-based restricted shares granted in 2015, the
vesting conditions of which are described in “Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Our Compensation
Philosophy and Linkage to Pay for Performance — Overview of Pay Elements and Linkage to
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives — Actual Payouts of Performance-Based Restricted Stock.” For
information regarding the awards vesting for each of Messrs. Patel and Storey, see notes 3 and 4,
respectively.

(2) Based on the closing trading price of the Common Shares on the applicable vesting date.
(3) As provided in Mr. Patel’s offer letter, we accelerated the vesting of his outstanding restricted stock units

(previously granted by Level 3 and converted to CenturyLink RSUs in the Level 3 Combination)
immediately following the Closing, except for the RSUs that Level 3 had granted to him in 2017, which will
vest as originally scheduled (as described further in note 4 of the Outstanding Equity Awards table). In
addition, all RSUs that had been granted to him before 2017 were cancelled and converted to a deferred cash
award based on the per-share closing price of our common stock on the date of Closing, which will be paid
to Mr. Patel in cash on the same schedule that the now-cancelled awards would have otherwise settled and
paid out in shares. Therefore, the value reported as “Value Realized on Vesting” for Mr. Patel in this table
was not actually realized by him during 2017 but instead has been deferred for payment in future years. See
below under “Deferred Compensation” for details regarding the payout schedule of this deferred cash
award.

(4) As provided in Mr. Storey’s offer letter, we accelerated the vesting of his outstanding restricted stock units

(previously granted by Level 3 and converted to CenturyLink RSUs in the Level 3 Combination)
immediately following the Closing, except for 50% of the RSUs that Level 3 had granted to him in 2017,
which will vest as originally scheduled (as described further in note 4 of the Outstanding Equity Awards
table). Although the vesting of these 875,432 RSUs was accelerated, each will settle and pay out in shares in
accordance with its original payment schedule. Therefore, the number of shares reported as “Number of
Shares Acquired on Vesting” for Mr. Storey in this table was not issued to him during 2017 but instead will
be issued to him in future years. See below under “Deferred Compensation” for details regarding the payout
schedule of these awards.

Pension Benefits

Amount of Benefits. The following table and discussion summarize pension benefits payable to the named

officers under (i) the CenturyLink Component of the CenturyLink Combined Pension Plan, qualified under Internal
Revenue Code Section 401(a), which permits eligible participants (including officers) who have completed at least
five years of service to receive a pension benefit upon attaining early or normal retirement age, and (ii) our
nonqualified supplemental defined benefit plan, which is designed to pay supplemental retirement benefits to certain
officers in amounts equal to the benefits such officers would otherwise forego due to federal limitations on
compensation and benefits under qualified plans. We refer to these particular defined benefit plans below as our
“Qualified Plan” and our “Supplemental Plan,” respectively, and as our “Pension Plans,” collectively.

(1) Each of Messrs. Patel, Hussain and Storey are ineligible to participate in these plans since they joined us

after both of our Pension Plans were closed to new participants.

(2) These figures represent accumulated benefits as of December 31, 2017 based on several assumptions,
including the assumption that the executive remains employed by us and begins receiving retirement
benefits at the normal retirement age of 65, with such accumulated benefits being discounted from the
normal retirement age to December 31, 2017 using discount rates ranging between 3.57% and 3.70%. No
adjustments have been made to reflect reductions required under any qualified domestic relations orders.
See Note 9 titled “Employee Benefits” of the notes to our audited financial statements included in
Appendix B for additional information.

(3) As described elsewhere herein in greater detail, Mr. Post plans to retire at the meeting. Mr. Post will be

(4)

eligible to commence receiving pension benefits in June 2018.
In accordance with our previously-announced CFO succession plan, Mr. Ewing agreed to step down from
all executive positions effective upon the Closing and fully retired from all positions with the Company on
November 17, 2017. For a more complete description of payments made to Mr. Ewing in connection with
his retirement, see “ — Potential Termination Payments — Amounts Paid to Former Executive.”

(5) As part of a qualified domestic relations order, Mr. Ewing’s former wife is receiving payments under the

Supplemental Plan, which commenced on August 1, 2015, in the amount of approximately $800 per month.
The amount shown in the table represents payments made to her during 2017 ($9,619). The present value of
the annuity of Mr. Ewing’s former wife is included in the Present Value of Accumulated Benefit column.

Pension Plans. With limited exceptions specified in the Pension Plans, we “froze” our Qualified Plan and

Supplemental Plan as of December 31, 2010, which means that no additional monthly pension benefits have
accrued under such plans since that date (although service after that date continues to count towards vesting and
benefit eligibility and a limited transitional benefit for eligible participants continued to accrue through 2015).

Prior to this freezing of benefit accruals, the aggregate amount of these named officers’ total monthly

pension benefit under the Qualified Plan and Supplemental Plan was equal to the participant’s years of service
since 1999 (up to a maximum of 30 years) multiplied by the sum of (i) 0.5% of his final average pay plus (ii)
0.5% of his final average pay in excess of his Social Security covered compensation, where “final average pay”
was defined as the participant’s average monthly compensation during the 60 consecutive month period within
his last ten years of employment in which he received his highest compensation. Effective December 31, 2010,
the Qualified Plan and Supplemental Plan were amended to cease all future benefit accruals under the above
formula (except where a collective bargaining agreement provides otherwise). In lieu of additional accruals under
the above-described formula, each affected participant’s accrued benefit as of December 31, 2010 were increased
4% per year, compounded annually through the earlier of December 31, 2015 or the termination of the
participant’s employment.

Under both Pension Plans, “average monthly compensation” is determined based on the participant’s salary

plus annual cash incentive bonus. Although the retirement benefits described above are provided through
separate plans, we have in the past transferred benefits from the Supplemental Plan to the Qualified Plan, and
reserve the right to make further similar transfers to the extent allowed under applicable law. The value of
benefits transferred to the Qualified Plan, which directly offset the value of benefits in the Supplemental Plan,
will be payable to the recipients in the form of enhanced annuities or supplemental benefits and are reflected in
the table above under the “Present Value of Accumulated Benefits” column.

The normal form of benefit payment under both of our Pension Plans is (i) in the case of unmarried

participants, a monthly annuity payable for the life of the participant, and (ii) in the case of married participants,
an actuarially equivalent monthly annuity payable for the lifetime of the participant and a survivor annuity
payable for the lifetime of the spouse upon the participant’s death. Participants may elect optional forms of
annuity benefits under each Pension Plan and, in the case of the Qualified Plan, an annuity that guarantees ten
years of benefits, all of which are actuarially equivalent in value to the normal form of benefit. The enhanced
annuities described in the prior paragraph may be paid in the form of a lump sum, at the participant’s election.

80

The normal retirement age is 65 under both of the Pension Plans. Participants may receive benefits under

both of these plans upon “early retirement,” which is defined as attaining age 55 with five years of service. Under
both of these plans, the benefit payable upon early termination is calculated under formulas that pay between
60% to 100% of the base plan benefit and 48% to 92% of the excess plan benefit, in each case with the lowest
percentage applying to early retirement at age 55 and proportionately higher percentages applying to early
retirement after age 55. For additional information on early retirement benefits, please see the applicable early
retirement provisions of the Pension Plans, copies of which are filed with the SEC.

Deferred Compensation

The following table and discussion provides information on (i) our Supplemental Dollars & Sense Plan,

under which certain of our legacy named officers have deferred a portion of their salary in excess of the amounts
that may be deferred under federal law governing qualified 401(k) plans, and (ii) the deferred compensation
arrangements we have with each of our newly named executives as a result of accelerating the vesting of certain
equity awards in connection with the Level 3 Combination, which are described in more detail above under “-
Vesting of Equity Awards During 2017” and in the text following the table below.

(1) For 2017, Messrs. Patel, Storey, and Hussain were either ineligible to participate or chose not to participate

in our Supplemental Dollars & Sense Plan.

(2) For each legacy named officer, the amounts in this column reflect contributions under the Supplemental

Dollars & Sense Plan by the officer of salary paid in 2017 and reported as 2017 salary compensation in the
Summary Compensation Table. For Mr. Patel, this figure represents the value of the deferred cash award he
received upon the acceleration and cash out of certain Level 3 RSUs that were converted to CenturyLink
RSUs as result of the Level 3 Combination (the “Deferred Cash Award”). For Mr. Storey, this figure
represents the value of RSUs, as of the Closing, that were converted to CenturyLink RSUs and accelerated
immediately following the Level 3 Combination but which will continue to pay out in Common Shares
according to their original payout schedule (the “Deferred RSUs”).

(3) For participants in the Supplemental Dollars & Sense Plan, this column includes our partial match of the

officer’s contribution under the terms of that plan, all of which were included as 2017 compensation in the
column of the Summary Compensation Table labeled “All Other Compensation.”

(4) For participants in the Supplemental Dollars & Sense Plan, this column represents aggregate earnings in

2017 including interest, dividends and distributions earned with respect to deferred compensation invested
by the officers in the manner described in the text below. For Mr. Storey, this figure represents the change in
value of his Deferred RSUs between the Closing and the end of 2017.

Supplemental Dollars & Sense Plan. Under this plan, certain of our senior officers may defer up to 50% of
their salary in excess of the federal limit on annual contributions to a qualified 401(k) plan. For every dollar that

81

an eligible participant contributes to this plan up to 6% of his or her excess salary, we add an amount equal to the
total matching percentage then in effect for matching contributions made by us under our qualified 401(k) plan
(which for 2017 equaled the sum of all of the initial 1% contributed and half of the next 5% contributed). All
amounts contributed under this supplemental plan by the participants or us are allocated among deemed
investments which follow the performance of the same broad array of funds offered under our qualified 401(k)
plan. This is reflected in the market value of each participant’s account. Participants may change their deemed
investments in these funds at any time. We reserve the right to transfer benefits from the Supplemental Dollars &
Sense Plan to our qualified 401(k) or retirement plans to the extent allowed under Treasury regulations and other
guidance. The value of benefits transferred to our qualified plans directly offsets the value of benefits in the
Supplemental Dollars & Sense Plan. Participants in the Supplemental Dollars & Sense Plan normally receive
payment of their account balances in a lump sum once they cease working full-time for us, subject to any
deferrals mandated by federal law.

Deferred Cash Award for Mr. Patel. As provided in Mr. Patel’s offer letter, we accelerated the vesting of his

outstanding restricted stock units (previously granted by Level 3 and converted to CenturyLink RSUs in the
Level 3 Combination) immediately following the Closing, except for the RSUs that Level 3 had granted to him in
2017, which will vest as originally scheduled (as described further in note 4 of the Outstanding Equity Awards
table). In addition, all RSUs that had been granted to him before 2017 were cancelled and converted to a deferred
cash award based on the per-share closing price of our common stock on the date of Closing ($6,915,750), which
will be paid to Mr. Patel in cash on the same schedule that the now-cancelled awards would have otherwise
settled and paid out in shares. In accordance with that schedule, Mr. Patel received or will receive the following
approximate amounts on the following dates: $2,894,949 on February 1, 2018; $936,625 on April 1, 2018;
$1,171,031 on July 1, 2018; $936,661 on February 1, 2019; $664,323 on July 1, 2019; and $312,161 on July 1,
2020.

Deferred RSUs for Mr. Storey. As provided in Mr. Storey’s offer letter, we accelerated the vesting of his

outstanding restricted stock units (previously granted by Level 3 and converted to CenturyLink RSUs in the
Level 3 Combination) immediately following the Closing, except for 50% of the RSUs that Level 3 had granted
to him in 2017, which will vest as originally scheduled (as described further in note 4 of the Outstanding Equity
Awards table). Although the vesting of these 875,432 RSUs was accelerated, each will settle and pay out in
shares in accordance with its original payment schedule. In accordance with that schedule, the following vested
and deferred RSUs held by Mr. Storey settled or will settle in Common Shares on the following dates: 215,450
RSUs on February 1, 2018; 54,462 RSUs on March 1, 2018; 117,229 RSUs on April 1, 2018; 139,919 RSUs on
July 1, 2018; 117,229 RSUs on February 1, 2019; 54,462 RSUs on March 1, 2019; 83,146 RSUs on July 1, 2019;
54,460 RSUs on March 1, 2020; and 39,075 RSUs on July 1, 2020.

Potential Termination Payments

The materials below discuss payments and benefits that our officers are eligible to receive if they (i) resign
or retire, (ii) are terminated by us, with or without cause, (iii) die or become disabled or (iv) become entitled to
termination benefits following a change of control of CenturyLink. The amounts actually paid to Mr. Ewing in
connection with the termination of his employment with us in late 2017 are detailed below under “- Amounts
Paid to Former Executive.”

Notwithstanding the information appearing below, you should be aware that our officers have agreed to
forfeit their equity compensation awards (and profits derived therefrom) if they compete with us or engage in
other activity harmful to our interests while employed with us or within 18 months after termination. Certain
other compensation might also be recoverable by us under certain circumstances after termination of
employment. See “Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Our Policies, Processes and Guidelines Related to
Executive Compensation — Forfeiture of Prior Compensation” for more information.

82

Payments Made Upon All Terminations. Regardless of the manner in which our employees’ employment

terminates prior to a change of control, they are entitled to receive amounts earned during their term of
employment (subject to the potential forfeitures discussed above). With respect to each such terminated
employee, such amounts include his or her:

•

•

•
•

•

•

salary and earned but unused vacation pay through the date of termination, payable immediately
following termination in cash
annual incentive bonus, but only if such employee served for the entire bonus period or through the
date such bonus is payable (unless this service requirement is waived or more favorable treatment is
applicable in the case of retirement, death or disability)
restricted stock that has vested
benefits accrued and vested under our qualified and supplemental defined benefit pension plans, with
payouts generally occurring at early or normal retirement age
vested account balance held in our qualified and supplemental defined contribution plans, which the
employee is generally free to receive at the time of termination
rights to continued health care benefits to the extent required by law.

Payments Made Upon Voluntary or Involuntary Terminations. In addition to benefits described under the
heading immediately above, employees involuntarily terminated by us without cause prior to a change of control
are also entitled, subject to certain conditions, to:

•
•

•

exercise all vested options within 190 days of the termination date
accelerated vesting of all, or a portion of, unvested time-vested restricted stock if approved by our
Compensation Committee
a cash severance payment in the amount described under “Compensation Discussion and Analysis —
Our Compensation Program Objectives and Components of Pay — Other Benefits — Severance
Benefits” plus the receipt of any short-term incentive bonus payable under their applicable bonus plan
and outplacement assistance benefits.

None of the benefits listed immediately above are payable if the employee resigns or is terminated for cause,
except that resigning employees are entitled to exercise their vested options within 190 days and employees
terminated for cause could request the Compensation Committee to accelerate their unvested time-vested
restricted stock (which is unlikely to be granted).

Payments Made Upon Retirement. Employees who retire in conformity with our retirement plans and

policies are entitled, subject to certain conditions, to:

•

•

exercise all of their options, all of which accelerate upon retirement, within three years of their
retirement date;
payment of their annual incentive bonus or a pro rata portion thereof, depending on their retirement
date;
post-retirement life, health and welfare benefits; and
all of the benefits described under the heading “ — Payments Made Upon All Terminations.”

•
•
In addition, the Committee has discretion to accelerate the vesting of all, or a portion of, unvested time-
vested restricted stock and/or to permit an employee who retires from the Company to retain all or a portion
of his or her unvested performance-based restricted stock for the remainder of the applicable performance
period.
Payments Made Upon Death or Disability. Upon death or disability, officers (or their estates) are generally

entitled to (without duplication of benefits):

•

payments under our disability or life insurance plans, as applicable;

83

•

•

•

•

•

exercise all of their options, all of which accelerate upon death or disability, within two years;

keep all of their time-vested restricted stock, whether vested or unvested;

payment of their annual incentive bonus or a pro rata portion thereof, depending on their date of death
or disability;

continued rights to receive (i) life, health and welfare benefits at early or normal retirement age, in the
event of disabilities of employees with ten years of prior service, or (ii) health and welfare benefits
payable to surviving eligible dependents, in the event of death of employees meeting certain age and
service requirements; and

all of the benefits described under the heading “ — Payments Made Upon All Terminations,” except
that (i) upon death benefits under our retirement plans are generally available only to surviving spouses
and (ii) benefits payable to mentally disabled employees under our nonqualified defined benefit
retirement plans may be paid prior to retirement age.

Payments Made Upon a Change of Control. We have entered into agreements that entitle each of our
executive officers who are terminated without cause or resign under certain specified circumstances within
certain specified periods following any change in control of CenturyLink to (i) receive a lump sum cash
severance payment equal to a multiple of such officer’s annual cash compensation (defined as salary plus the
average annual incentive bonus over the past three years), (ii) receive such officer’s currently pending bonus or
pro rata portion thereof, depending on the date of termination, and (iii) continue to receive, subject to certain
exceptions, certain welfare benefits for certain specified periods. See “Compensation Discussion and Analysis —
Our Compensation Program Objectives and Components of Pay — Other Benefits — Change of Control
Arrangements” for a description of the benefits under our change of control agreements.

Under CenturyLink’s above-referenced agreements, a “change in control” of CenturyLink would be deemed
to occur upon (i) any person (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) becoming the beneficial owner
of 30% or more of the outstanding Common Shares, (ii) a majority of our directors being replaced,
(iii) consummation of certain mergers, substantial asset sales or similar business combinations, or (iv) approval
by the shareholders of a liquidation or dissolution of CenturyLink.

The above-referenced agreements provide the benefits described above if we terminate the officer’s
employment without cause or the officer resigns with “good reason,” which we describe further under the
heading “Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Our Compensation Program Objectives and Components of
Pay — Other Benefits — Change of Control Arrangements.” We have filed copies or forms of these agreements
with the SEC.

Participants in our supplemental defined benefit plan whose service is terminated within two years of the
change in control of CenturyLink will receive a cash payment equal to the present value of their plan benefits
(after providing age and service credits of up to three years if the participant is terminated by us without cause or
resigns with “good reason”), determined in accordance with actuarial assumptions specified in the plan. Certain
account balances under our qualified retirement plans will also fully vest upon a change of control of
CenturyLink.

Under the terms of our equity incentive plans, incentives granted under those plans will not vest, accelerate,

become exercisable or be deemed fully paid unless otherwise provided in a separate agreement, plan or
instrument. None of our equity award agreements since 2011 have provided for any such accelerated recognition
of benefits solely upon a change of control. Instead, our current award agreements provide that any holder of
incentives who is terminated by us or our successor without cause or resigns with good reason following a
change of control will be entitled to receive full vesting of his or her time-vested restricted shares and continued
rights under his or her performance-based restricted shares (on the same terms as if he or she had not been
terminated).

84

We believe the above-described change of control benefits enhance shareholder value because:

•

•

prior to a takeover, these protections help us to recruit and retain talented officers and to help maintain
the productivity of our workforce by alleviating concerns over economic security, and

during or after a takeover, these protections (i) help our personnel, when evaluating a possible business
combination, to focus on the best interests of CenturyLink and its shareholders, and (ii) reduce the risk
that personnel will accept job offers from competitors during takeover discussions.

Estimated Potential Termination Payments. The table below provides estimates of the value of payments

and benefits that would become payable if our current named executives were terminated in the manner
described below, in each case based on various assumptions, the most significant of which are described in the
table’s notes.

(1) All data in the table reflects our estimates of the value of payments and benefits assuming the named officer

was terminated on December 31, 2017. The closing price of the Common Shares on such date was $16.68.

85

The table reflects only estimates of amounts earned or payable through or at such date based on various
assumptions. Actual amounts can be determined only at the time of termination. If a named officer
voluntarily resigns or is terminated with cause, he will not be entitled to any special or accelerated benefits,
but will be entitled to receive various payments or benefits that vested before the termination date. The table
reflects potential payments based upon a physical disability; additional benefits may be payable in the event
of a mental disability.

(2) As further described above, upon termination of employment, the named officers may become entitled to

receive certain special, accelerated or enhanced benefits, including, subject to certain exceptions, the right to
receive payment of their annual cash incentive bonus, an acceleration under certain circumstances of the
vesting of their outstanding equity awards, current or enhanced pension and welfare benefits, or cash
severance payments. The table excludes (i) payments or benefits made under broad-based plans or
arrangements generally available to all salaried full-time employees and (ii) benefits, awards or amounts
that the officer was entitled to receive prior to termination of employment.

(3) The amounts listed in this column reflect payments to which the named officer would be entitled to under
our executive severance plan if involuntarily terminated by us without cause prior to a change of control.
The amounts listed in this column would not be payable if the officer voluntarily resigns or is terminated for
cause.

(4) Shortly after his retirement effective at the meeting, Mr. Post will be eligible to receive normal retirement

benefits under CenturyLink’s defined benefit pension plans described above under the heading “— Pension
Benefits.” The amounts reflected under the “Retirement” column do not reflect the amount of lifetime
annuity payments payable upon retirement. Assuming early or full retirement as of December 31, 2017,
Mr. Post would have been entitled to monthly annuity payments of approximately $31,728 over his lifetime.
For further information, see (i) the notes below and (ii) “— Pension Benefits — Other” above.

(5) The information in this column assumes each named officer became entitled at December 31, 2017 to the
benefits under CenturyLink’s agreements in existence on such date described above under “— Payments
Made Upon a Change of Control” upon an involuntary termination without cause or resignation with good
reason. All amounts are based on several assumptions.

(6) The information in this row (i) reflects the benefit to the named officer arising out of the accelerated vesting

of some or all of his restricted stock caused by the termination of employment based upon the intrinsic
method of valuation, (ii) assumes that the Compensation Committee would not approve the acceleration of
the restricted stock of any legacy named officer in the event of an involuntary termination, and (iii) assumes
that the Compensation Committee would approve, in the event of the retirement of Mr. Post, the
acceleration of all of his restricted stock outstanding for at least one year and half of his other outstanding
restricted stock. Assuming the Compensation Committee approved the acceleration of all of the named
officers’ restricted stock in connection with an involuntary termination of employment at December 31,
2017, the amounts reflected in the table under the column “Involuntary Termination Without Cause” would
have been higher by the following amounts: $14,083,141 for Mr. Post, $0 for Mr. Patel, $6,011,672 for
Mr. Hussain, $5,258,820 for Mr. Goff and $0 for Mr. Storey.

(7) The information in this row reflects only the incremental benefits that accrue upon an event of termination,
and excludes benefits that were vested on December 31, 2017. For information on the present value of the
named officers’ accumulated benefits under our defined benefit pension plans, see “— Pension Benefits,”
and for information on the aggregate balances of the named officers’ non-qualified deferred compensation,
see “— Deferred Compensation.” As indicated above, the named officer would also be entitled to receive a
distribution of his or her 401(k) benefits and various other broad-based benefits.

(8) The information in this row excludes, in the case of disability or death, payments made by insurance

companies.

Amounts Paid to Former Executive. In accordance with the CFO succession plan discussed further

elsewhere herein, R. Stewart Ewing, Jr., who had served as our CFO prior to the Level 3 Combination, agreed to
step down from all executive positions effective with the Closing and then fully retired from all positions with

86

the Company effective November 17, 2017. Under the terms of our short-term incentive bonus program,
Mr. Ewing earned a prorated annual incentive bonus of $470,517 for 2017 based on actual performance, as
reported in the Summary Compensation Table above under the heading “Non-Equity Incentive Plan
Compensation.”

In addition to other amounts paid or payable to him upon his retirement under certain broad-based plans, our

Pension Plans (see “— Pension Benefits” above) and our Supplemental Dollars & Sense Plan (see “— Deferred
Compensation” above), the Compensation Committee determined that, because Mr. Ewing was willing and able
to continue serving as our CFO after the Closing if not for the CFO succession plan, he qualified for payments
under our executive severance plan. Under that plan, Mr. Ewing received (i) a cash severance payment equal to
104 weeks of severance benefits ($2,798,316), half of which was contractually due to him and half of which was
awarded at the direction of the Committee and (ii) the continuation of health and welfare benefits for one year
(valued at $15,800), both of which are reported above in the Summary Compensation Table under the heading
“All Other Benefits.”

In addition to these payments, the Committee exercised its discretion to (i) accelerate vesting of all 46,157

of Mr. Ewing’s time-vested restricted shares (valued at $683,124, based on the per share closing price of our
Common Shares on his date of retirement, and included above in the “Stock Vested During 2017” table) and
(ii) permit him to continue to hold all 97,304 of his performance-based restricted stock, subject to their original
performance conditions as disclosed above in the “Outstanding Equity Awards” table. The Committee also
approved a special discretionary cash bonus of $1,000,000, which is reported in the “Bonus” column of the
Summary Compensation Table.

For information on factors considered by the Committee in connection with authorizing Mr. Ewing’s

retirement compensation, see “Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Our Compensation Program
Objectives and Components of Pay — Compensation Paid to our Retired Executive.”

Pay Ratio Disclosure

As mandated by federal law and related SEC rules, we are required to disclose a ratio of the pay of our CEO

to that of our median employee. For 2017, the total compensation of our CEO, Mr. Post, as reported in the
Summary Compensation Table was $14,715,560, while the annual total compensation for our median employee
was $69,252. As a result, the ratio of CEO pay to median employee pay was approximately 212 to 1.

Because the SEC rules provide companies with some flexibility in choosing how to calculate this ratio, the

following Q&As describe how we calculated our 2017 pay ratio:

• How did we identify the median employee? We reviewed the annual total target compensation (the sum

of base salary, target short-term incentive and target long-term incentive awards) as of December 31,
2017 for approximately 39,000 active employees employed on that date, excluding our CEO and, as
described below, former Level 3 employees.

• Did we exclude any employees from the calculation? Yes. As permitted by SEC rules, in determining
the median employee, we excluded approximately 12,000 employees who joined us on November 1,
2017 as a result of the Level 3 Combination.

• How did we calculate total compensation of the median employee for the purpose of calculating the

ratio? We calculated the median employee’s pay using the same pay elements and calculation
methodology as used in determining the CEO’s pay for purposes of disclosure in the Summary
Compensation Table.

• Do other public companies calculate their CEO pay ratio data the same way we do? Not necessarily.
The SEC rules permit companies to choose between different methodologies for calculating the ratio.
As a result, our ratio should not be used as a basis for comparison with other companies.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

Overview

The Board believes that each director who is not employed by us (whom we refer to as outside directors or

non-management directors) should be compensated through a mix of cash and equity-based compensation, which
most recently has been granted in the form of restricted stock. The Compensation Committee, consisting entirely
of independent directors, has primary responsibility for periodically reviewing and considering any revisions to
director compensation. The Committee’s compensation consultant typically assists the Committee in connection
with its review of director compensation, including conducting benchmarking to help assess the appropriateness
and competitiveness of our director compensation programs. The Board reviews the Compensation Committee’s
recommendations and determines the amount of director compensation.

The table and the discussion below summarize how we compensated our outside directors in 2017.

(1) For purposes of determining the number of restricted shares to grant on May 25, 2017 to each outside

director then in office, the Compensation Committee valued each of these stock awards to equal $145,000,
based upon the volume-weighted average closing price of our Common Shares over a 15-day trading period
ending prior to the grant date. For purposes of determining the prorated number of restricted shares to grant
on November 1, 2017 to each new outside director added to the Board on such date, the Compensation
Committee valued each of these stock awards to equal $81,500, based upon the volume-weighted average
closing price of our Common Shares over a 15-day trading period ending prior to the grant date. For
purposes of reporting the fair value of these awards in the table above, however, we valued each grant based
upon the closing stock price of our Common Shares on the grant date in accordance with FASB ASC Topic
718. These awards vest on May 25, 2018 (subject to accelerated vesting or forfeiture in certain limited
circumstances). See “— Cash and Stock Payments.”

(2) As of December 31, 2017, Messrs. Chilton, Clontz and Glenn held 4,224 unvested shares of restricted stock

and each of our other outside directors then in office held 5,882 unvested shares of restricted stock, which
constituted the only unvested equity-based awards held by our outside directors as of such date (excluding
equity awards granted to Michael J. Roberts prior to his commencement of service on our board following
the Qwest merger). For further information on our directors’ stock ownership, see “Ownership of Our
Securities — Executive Officers and Directors,” and for information on certain deferred fee arrangements
pertaining to Mr. Roberts, see “— Other Benefits.”

(3)

Includes reimbursements for the cost of annual physical examinations and related travel of $3,338 for
Mr. Hanks and $5,526 for Mr. Perry. Except as otherwise noted in the prior sentence, the table above does
not reflect (i) reimbursements for travel expenses or (ii) any benefits associated with the directors or their
family members participating in recreational activities scheduled during board retreats (as described further
under the heading “Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Our Compensation Program Objectives and
Components of Pay — Other Benefits — Perquisites”).

(4) Messrs. Chilton, Clontz and Glenn became outside directors of the Company on November 1, 2017. The

amounts in the table above reflect only compensation paid to them over the past two months of 2017,
including the prorated stock grant summarized above in Note 1.

(5) Gregory J. McCray resigned from the Board effective February 23, 2017. William A. Owens retired from

the Board effective May 24, 2017.

Cash and Stock Payments

Each outside director is paid an annual fee of $65,000 plus $2,000 for attending each regular board meeting,

special board meeting (including each day of the Board’s annual planning session), committee meeting and
separate director education program.

During 2017, Harvey P. Perry, in his capacity as the non-executive Chairman of the Board, received
supplemental board fees of $200,000 payable in cash. The Chairman’s duties are set forth in our corporate
governance guidelines. See “Corporate Governance.”

During 2017, W. Bruce Hanks, in his capacity as non-executive Vice Chairman of the Board, received

supplemental board fees of $100,000 cash. Under our Bylaws, the Vice Chairman is charged with the
responsibility of assisting the Chairman and performing such other duties as may be assigned to him by the
Board or the Bylaws.

We also pay annual supplemental board fees to the chairs of each of the following committees as follows:

(i) the chair of the Audit Committee receives $25,000, (ii) the chair of the Compensation Committee receives
$18,750, (iii) the chair of the Nominating Committee receives $15,000 and (iv) the chair of the Risk Evaluation
Committee receives $12,500.

In mid-2017, Mr. Perry, Mr. Hanks, Martha H. Bejar and Michael J. Roberts were appointed to a special

committee to investigate allegations of improper sales and billing practices and related matters, and were
compensated at the rate of $2,000 for attending each in-person meeting of the special committee and $1,000 for
attending each telephonic meeting. Shortly thereafter, Ms. Bejar and Mr. Roberts and, following the Level 3
Combination, Mr. Kevin P. Chilton were appointed to a special litigation committee to address allegations of
impropriety contained in various shareholder derivative demands, and were compensated at the same rates for
attending in-person or telephonic meetings of the special litigation committee.

During 2017, the Compensation Committee authorized each outside director to receive an annual or prorated

allotment of shares of time-vested restricted stock in the amounts and on the terms and conditions specified in
Note 1 of the table appearing above under “ — Overview”). The Compensation Committee currently expects to
grant a comparable annual award in May 2018 to each outside director serving on the day after our 2018 annual
meeting.

Other Benefits

Each outside director is entitled to be reimbursed (i) for expenses incurred in attending board and committee

meetings, (ii) for expenses incurred in attending director education programs and (iii) up to $5,000 per year for
the cost of an annual physical examination, plus related travel expenses.

In connection with our 2011 merger with Qwest, we assumed the Qwest Deferred Compensation Plan for
Non-Employee Directors. Under this plan, Qwest outside directors could elect to defer all or a portion of their
cash directors’ fees, which were then converted to a number of “phantom units” based the value of a share of
Qwest stock, with credit for dividends paid to stockholders “reinvested” in additional phantom units. Certain plan
balances were distributed to participants at the close of the merger, but plan balances attributable to amounts
deferred on or after January 1, 2005 by Qwest directors who joined our Board following the merger were
converted, based on the merger exchange ratio, to phantom units based on the value of one of our Common
Shares. Other than the crediting and “reinvestment” of dividends for outstanding phantom units, CenturyLink
does not make any contributions to, and no additional elective deferrals are permitted under, this plan. Subject to
the terms of the plan, each participant’s account will be distributed as a lump sum in cash as soon as practicable
following the end of his or her service as a director. As of December 31, 2017, Michael J. Roberts was the only
remaining participant in this plan, with a balance of 6,194 phantom units with an aggregate value of
approximately $103,316 as of such date.

We supply company-owned tablets to our outside directors for use in reviewing materials posted to a

dedicated portal that permits management to communicate with the Board.

Directors may use our aircraft in connection with company-related business. However, we generally do not

permit either our directors or their family members to use our aircraft for personal trips (except when such use
can be accommodated at no incremental cost to us or on terms generally available to all of our employees in
connection with a medical emergency).

Our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers so that they will be free from undue concern

about personal liability in connection with their service to CenturyLink. We have signed agreements with each of
those individuals contractually obligating us to provide these indemnification rights. We also provide our
directors with customary directors and officers liability insurance.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

During the last fiscal year, our Compensation Committee included (i) William A. Owens (through May 24,

2017) and T. Michael Glenn (beginning November 1, 2017) and (ii) Laurie A. Siegel, Virginia Boulet and
Michael J. Roberts (for the entire year). No member of the Compensation Committee served as an officer or
employee of the Company or any of our subsidiaries prior to or while serving on the Compensation Committee.

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

Recent Transactions

During 2017, we paid H. Parnell Perry, Jr., who serves as Manager —Technology Management, total gross

compensation of approximately $131,954, consisting of approximately $115,287 in salary, $12,632 in annual
incentive bonuses and $4,035 in matching contributions to his qualified 401(k) plan account. Mr. Perry is the son
of Harvey P. Perry, our Chairman of the Board, and has been an employee of ours since 1987.

During 2017, we paid Matthew J. Post, who serves as Director Big Data Technology Implementation, total

gross compensation of approximately $129,659, consisting of approximately $110,832 in salary, $15,109 in
annual incentive bonuses and $3,718 in matching contributions to his qualified 401(k) plan account. Mr. Post is
the son of Glen Post, our Chief Executive Officer, and has been an employee of ours since 2014.

We are one of the largest employers in Monroe, Louisiana and in several of our other markets, and, as such,

employ personnel related by birth or marriage throughout our organization. Several of our executive officers or
directors have family members employed by us, although, none of them (other than H. Parnell Perry, Jr. and
Matthew J. Post) earned 2017 compensation in excess of the $120,000 threshold that would require detailed
disclosures under the federal proxy rules.

Review Procedures

Early each year, our management distributes to the Audit Committee a written report listing our payments to

vendors, including a list of transactions with our directors, officers or employees. This annual report permits the
independent directors to assess and discuss our related party transactions. Although we have no formal written
pre-approval procedure governing related party transactions, our CEO typically seeks approval of the Board
before engaging in any new related party transaction involving significant sums or risks.

SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our executive officers and directors, among others, to file
certain beneficial ownership reports with the SEC. To our knowledge, based solely on our review of copies of
reports received by us and written representations by certain reporting persons, we believe that all such reports
were timely filed during fiscal year 2017.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING

Quorum

Our bylaws provide that the presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of a majority of the outstanding

Voting Shares constitutes a quorum to organize the meeting.

92

Vote Required to Elect Directors

Our bylaws provide that each of the 13 director nominees will be elected if the number of votes cast in favor
of the director exceeds the number of votes withheld with respect to the director. You may vote “for” all director
nominees or withhold your vote for any one or more of the director nominees. If any of the nine directors fails to
receive a majority of the votes cast at the meeting, our bylaws will require such director to tender his or her
resignation to the Board for its consideration.

Vote Required to Adopt Other Proposals at the Meeting

With respect to all matters to be submitted to a vote at the meeting, the matter will be approved if the votes
cast in favor of such matter exceed the votes cast against such matter. Although Item 3 technically requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast to approve the Incentive Plan, the treatment of
abstentions (discussed below) results in a voting standard that we believe is functionally the same as the standard
for the other matters.

Effect of Abstentions

Shares as to which the proxy holders have been instructed to abstain from voting with respect to any
particular matter will be treated under the Company’s bylaws as not being cast for purposes of such vote.
Because all matters expected to be brought before the meeting for a vote must be approved by the holders of a
majority of the votes cast, abstentions will not affect the outcome of any such vote. Shareholders abstaining from
voting, however, will be counted as present for purposes of constituting a quorum to organize the meeting.

Effect of Non-Voting

If you properly execute and return a proxy or voting instruction card, your shares will be voted as you

specify. If you are a shareholder of record and make no specifications on your validly submitted proxy card, your
shares will be voted against the shareholder proposals and in favor of all other matters. If you are a beneficial
owner of shares and do not give voting instructions to your broker, bank or nominee, they will be entitled to vote
your shares only to the extent specified below.

Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, brokers who hold shares in street name for customers

may vote in their discretion on matters considered to be “routine” when they have not received voting
instructions from beneficial owners. Under these rules, brokers who do not receive such instructions will be
entitled to vote in their discretion at the meeting with respect to the ratification of the appointment of the
independent auditor, but will not be entitled to vote in their discretion with respect to any of the other matters
submitted to a vote. If brokers who do not receive voting instructions do not, or cannot, exercise discretionary
voting power (a “broker non-vote”) with respect to any matter to be considered at the meeting, shares that are not
voted will be treated as present for purposes of constituting a quorum to organize the meeting but not cast with
respect to considering such matter. Because all matters to be considered at the meeting must be approved by the
holders of a majority of the votes cast, broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of any such vote.

Revocations

Shareholders of record may revoke their proxy or change their votes at any time before their proxy is voted
at the meeting by giving a written revocation notice to our secretary, by timely delivering a proxy bearing a later
date or by voting in person at the meeting. Beneficial shareholders may revoke or change their voting instructions
by contacting the broker, bank or nominee that holds their shares.

Voting by Participants in Our Benefit Plans

If you beneficially own any of our Common Shares by virtue of participating in any retirement plan of

CenturyLink, then you will receive a separate voting instruction card that will enable you to direct the voting of

93

these shares. This voting instruction card entitles you, on a confidential basis, to instruct the trustees how to vote
the shares allocated to your plan account. The plans require you to act as a “named fiduciary,” which requires
you to exercise your voting rights prudently and in the interests of all plan participants. Plan participants who
wish to vote should complete and return the voting instruction card in accordance with its instructions. If you
elect not to vote the shares allocated to your accounts, your shares will be voted in the same proportion as voted
shares regarding each of the items submitted to a vote at the meeting. Plan participants that wish to revoke their
voting instructions must contact the trustee and follow its procedures.

If you beneficially own any of our Common Shares by virtue of previously participating in an employee

stock purchase plan formerly maintained by us or a company that we have acquired, we have made arrangements
for our proxy materials to be made available to you by the record owner of those shares. Consequently, you will
be afforded the opportunity to vote those shares in the same manner as any other shares held in street name. See
“General Information About the Annual Meeting.”

Cost of Proxy Solicitation

We will pay all expenses of soliciting proxies for the meeting. Proxies may be solicited personally, by mail,
by telephone or by facsimile by our directors, officers and employees, who will not be additionally compensated
therefor. We will also request persons holding Voting Shares in their names for others, such as brokers, banks
and other nominees, to forward materials to their principals and request authority for the execution of proxies,
and we will reimburse them for their expenses incurred in connection therewith. We have retained Innisfree
M&A Incorporated, New York, New York, to assist in the solicitation of proxies, for which we will pay Innisfree
fees anticipated to be $22,500 and will reimburse Innisfree for certain of its out-of-pocket expenses.

Other Matters Considered at the Meeting

Management has not timely received any notice that a shareholder desires to present any matter for action at

the meeting in accordance with our bylaws (which are described below in “Other Matters –Deadlines for
Submitting Shareholder Nominations and Proposals for the 2019 Annual Meeting – Other Proposals and
Nominations”) other than the shareholder proposals described in this proxy statement, and is otherwise unaware
of any matter to be considered by shareholders at the meeting other than those matters specified in the
accompanying notice of the meeting. Our proxy and voting instruction cards, however, will confer discretionary
voting authority with respect to any other matter that may properly come before the meeting. It is the intention of
the persons named therein to vote in accordance with their best judgment on any such matter.

Conduct of the Meeting

The Chairman has broad responsibility and legal authority to conduct the meeting in an orderly and timely
manner. This authority includes establishing rules for shareholders who wish to address the meeting. Copies of
these rules will be available at the meeting. The Chairman may also exercise broad discretion in recognizing
shareholders who wish to speak and in determining the extent of discussion on each item of business. In light of
the need to conduct all necessary business and to conclude the meeting within a reasonable period of time, we
cannot assure that every shareholder who wishes to speak on an item of business will be able to do so.

You will not be permitted to bring audio visual equipment, ampliphones or posters into the meeting. We

reserve the right, to be exercised in our sole discretion, to admit guests, such as local politicians or the press, into
the meeting.

Postponement or Adjournment of the Meeting

The Chairman may postpone or adjourn the meeting. Your proxy will still be valid and may be voted at the

postponed or adjourned meeting. You will still be able to change or revoke your proxy until it is voted.

94

CENTURYLINK

2018 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN

APPENDIX A
to Proxy Statement

1. Purpose. The purpose of the CenturyLink 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) is to increase
shareholder value and to advance the interests of CenturyLink, Inc. (“CenturyLink”) and its subsidiaries
(collectively, the “Company”) by furnishing stock-based economic incentives (the “Incentives”) designed to
attract, retain, reward, and motivate the Company’s key employees, officers, directors, consultants, and advisors
and to strengthen the mutuality of interests between such persons and CenturyLink’s shareholders. Incentives
consist of opportunities to purchase or receive shares of common stock, $1.00 par value per share, of
CenturyLink (the “Common Stock”) or cash valued in relation to Common Stock, on terms determined under this
Plan. As used in this Plan, the term “subsidiary” means any corporation, limited liability company, or other entity
of which CenturyLink owns (directly or indirectly) within the meaning of Section 424(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), 50% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock,
membership interests, or other equity interests issued thereby.

2. Administration.

2.1 Composition. This Plan shall generally be administered by the compensation committee of the

Board of Directors of CenturyLink (the “Board”) or by a subcommittee thereof (such administrator, as used in
this Plan, the “Committee”). The Committee shall consist of not fewer than two members of the Board, each of
whom shall qualify as a “non-employee director” under Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the “1934 Act”) or any successor rule.

2.2 Authority. The Committee shall have plenary authority to award Incentives under this Plan and to
enter into agreements with or provide notices to participants as to the terms of the Incentives (collectively, the
“Incentive Agreements”). The Committee shall have the general authority to interpret this Plan, to establish any
rules or regulations relating to this Plan that it determines to be appropriate, and to make any other determination
that it believes necessary or advisable for the proper administration of this Plan. Committee decisions regarding
matters relating to this Plan shall be final, conclusive, and binding on the Company, participants, and all other
interested persons. The Committee may delegate its authority hereunder to the extent provided in Section 3.2.

3. Eligible Participants.

3.1 Eligibility. Key employees, officers, and directors of the Company and persons providing services

as consultants or advisors to the Company shall become eligible to receive Incentives under the Plan when
designated by the Committee.

3.2 Delegation of Authority to Chief Executive Officer. With respect to participants not subject to

Section 16 of the 1934 Act, the Committee may delegate to the chief executive officer of CenturyLink its
authority to designate participants, to determine the size and type of Incentives to be received by those
participants, to determine any performance objectives for these participants, and to approve or authorize the form
of Incentive Agreement governing such Incentives. Following any grants of Incentives pursuant to such
delegated authority, the chief executive officer of CenturyLink or any officer designated by him may exercise
any powers of the Committee under this Plan to accelerate vesting or exercise periods, to terminate restricted
periods, to waive compliance with specified provisions, or to otherwise make determinations contemplated
hereunder with respect to those participants; provided, however, that (a) the chief executive officer may only
grant options at a per share exercise price equal to or greater than the Fair Market Value (as defined in
Section 12.10) of a share of Common Stock on the later of the date the officer approves such grant or the date the
participant commences employment and (b) the Committee retains sole authority to make any of the
determinations set forth in Section 5.4, 12.10 or Section 11 of this Plan.

A-1

4. Types of Incentives. Incentives may be granted under this Plan to eligible participants in the forms of

(a) incentive stock options, (b) non-qualified stock options, (c) stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), (d) restricted
stock, (e) restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and (f) Other Stock-Based Awards (as defined in Section 10).

5. Shares Subject to the Plan.

5.1 Number of Shares. Subject to the counting provisions of Section 5.2 and adjustment as provided in

Section 5.4, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be delivered to participants and their
permitted transferees under this Plan shall be 34,600,000.

5.2 Share Counting. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.4:

(a) The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued upon exercise of stock

options intended to qualify as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code shall be 34,600,000.

(b) Any shares of Common Stock subject to an Incentive granted under this Plan that is

subsequently canceled, forfeited, or expires prior to exercise or realization, whether in full or in part, shall be
available again for issuance or delivery under the Plan. Any shares of Common Stock subject to an Incentive
granted under the Amended and Restated CenturyLink, Inc. 2011 Equity Incentive Plan that, after the date this
Plan is first approved by shareholders, is cancelled, forfeited, or expires prior to exercise or realization, whether
in full or in part, shall be available for issuance or delivery under this Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, shares
subject to an Incentive shall not be available again for issuance or delivery under this Plan if such shares were
(a) tendered in payment of the exercise or base price of a stock option or stock-settled SAR; (b) covered by, but
not issued upon settlement of, stock-settled SARs; or (c) delivered or withheld by the Company to satisfy any tax
withholding obligation related to a stock option or stock-settled SAR.

(c) If an Incentive, by its terms, may be settled only in cash, then the grant, vesting, payout,

settlement, or forfeiture of such Incentive shall have no impact on the number of shares available for grant under
the Plan.

5.3 Participant Limits. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.4, the following additional

limitations are imposed under the Plan:

(a) The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be covered by Incentives granted

under the Plan to any one individual during any calendar year shall be 1,500,000.

(b) The maximum value of Incentives that may be granted under the Plan to each non-employee
director of CenturyLink during any single calendar year shall be $500,000, with any shares granted under such
Incentives valued at Fair Market Value on the date of grant.

5.4 Adjustment.

(a) In the event of any recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, combination of
shares or other comparable change in the Common Stock, all limitations on numbers of shares of Common Stock
provided in this Section 5 and the number of shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding Incentives shall be
equitably adjusted in proportion to the change in outstanding shares of Common Stock. In addition, in the event
of any such change in the Common Stock, the Committee shall make any other adjustment that it determines to
be equitable, including adjustments to the exercise price of any option or the Base Price (defined in Section 7.5)
of any SAR and any per share performance objectives of any Incentive in order to provide participants with the
same relative rights before and after such adjustment.

(b) If the Company merges, consolidates, sells substantially all of its assets, or dissolves, and such
transaction is not a Change of Control as defined in Section 11 (each of the foregoing, a “Fundamental Change”),

A-2

then thereafter, upon any exercise or payout of an Incentive granted prior to the Fundamental Change, the
participant shall be entitled to receive (i) in lieu of shares of Common Stock previously issuable thereunder, the
number and class of shares of stock or securities to which the participant would have been entitled pursuant to
the terms of the Fundamental Change if, immediately prior to such Fundamental Change, the participant had
been the holder of record of the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Incentive or (ii) in lieu of
payments based on the Common Stock previously payable thereunder, payments based on any formula that the
Committee determines to be equitable in order to provide participants with substantially equivalent rights before
and after the Fundamental Change. In the event any such Fundamental Change causes a change in the
outstanding Common Stock, the aggregate number of shares available under the Plan may be appropriately
adjusted by the Committee in its sole discretion, whose determination shall be conclusive.

5.5 Type of Common Stock. Common Stock issued under the Plan may be authorized and unissued

shares or issued shares held as treasury shares.

5.6 Minimum Vesting Requirements. Except for any Incentives that are issued in payment of cash

amounts earned under the Company’s short-term incentive program, all Incentives must be granted with a
minimum vesting period of at least one year without providing for incremental vesting during such one-year
period.

5.7 Dividends and Dividend Equivalent Rights. Incentives granted under this Plan in the form of stock

options and SARs may not be granted with dividend or dividend equivalent rights. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Plan and the applicable Incentive Agreement, as well as any procedures established by the
Committee, the Committee may determine to pay dividends or dividend equivalents, as applicable, on Incentives
granted under this Plan in the form of restricted stock, RSUs, or Other Stock Based Awards. In the event that the
Committee grants dividend equivalent rights, the Company shall establish an account for the participant and
reflect in that account any securities, cash, or other property comprising any dividend or property distribution
with respect to each share of Common Stock underlying each Incentive. For any Incentives granted under this
Plan with dividend or dividend equivalent rights, such dividends or dividend equivalent rights shall vest and pay
out or be forfeited in tandem with underlying Incentives rather than during the vesting period.

6. Stock Options. A stock option is a right to purchase shares of Common Stock from CenturyLink. Stock

options granted under the Plan may be incentive stock options (as such term is defined in Section 422 of the
Code) or non-qualified stock options. Any option that is designated as a non-qualified stock option shall not be
treated as an incentive stock option. Each stock option granted by the Committee under this Plan shall be subject
to the following terms and conditions:

6.1 Price. The exercise price per share shall be determined by the Committee, subject to adjustment

under Section 5.4; provided that in no event shall the exercise price be less than the Fair Market Value (as
defined in Section 12.10) of a share of Common Stock as of the date of grant, except in the case of a stock option
granted in assumption of or substitution for an outstanding award of a company acquired by the Company or with
which the Company combines. In the event that an option grant is approved by the Committee, but is to take
effect on a later date, such as when employment or service commences, such later date shall be the date of grant.

6.2 Number. The number of shares of Common Stock subject to the option shall be determined by the

Committee, subject to Section 5, including, but not limited to, any adjustment as provided in Section 5.4.

6.3 Duration and Time for Exercise. The term of each stock option shall be determined by the

Committee, but shall not exceed a maximum term of ten years. Subject to Section 5.6, each stock option shall
become exercisable at such time or times during its term as determined by the Committee and provided for in the
Incentive Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may accelerate the exercisability of any
stock option at any time.

6.4 Manner of Exercise. A stock option may be exercised, in whole or in part, by giving written notice
to the Company, specifying the number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased. The exercise notice shall be

A-3

accompanied by the full purchase price for such shares. The option price shall be payable in United States dollars
and may be paid (a) in cash; (b) by check; (c) by delivery to the Company of currently-owned shares of Common
Stock (including through any attestation of ownership that effectively transfers title), which shares shall be
valued for this purpose at the Fair Market Value on the business day immediately preceding the date such option
is exercised; (d) by delivery of irrevocable written instructions to a broker approved by the Company (with a
copy to the Company) to immediately sell a portion of the shares issuable under the option and to deliver
promptly to the Company the amount of sale proceeds (or loan proceeds if the broker lends funds to the
participant for delivery to the Company) to pay the exercise price; (e) if approved by the Committee, through a
net exercise procedure whereby the optionee surrenders the option in exchange for that number of shares of
Common Stock with an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the difference between the aggregate exercise price
of the options being surrendered and the aggregate Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock subject to
the option; (f) in such other manner as may be authorized from time to time by the Committee; or (g) through any
combination of the foregoing methods.

6.5 Limitations on Repricing. Except for adjustments pursuant to Section 5.4 or actions permitted to be

taken by the Committee under Section 11 in the event of a Change of Control, unless approved by the
shareholders of the Company, (a) the exercise price for any outstanding option granted under this Plan may not
be decreased after the date of grant; and (b) an outstanding option that has been granted under this Plan may not,
as of any date that such option has a per share exercise price that is greater than the then-current Fair Market
Value of a share of Common Stock, be surrendered to the Company as consideration for the grant of a new
option or SAR with a lower exercise price, shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units, an Other Stock-Based
Award, a cash payment, or Common Stock.

6.6 Incentive Stock Options. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the following
additional provisions shall apply to the grant of stock options that are intended to qualify as incentive stock
options (as such term is defined in Section 422 of the Code):

(a) Any incentive stock option agreement authorized under the Plan shall contain such other

provisions as the Committee shall deem advisable, but shall in all events be consistent with and contain or be
deemed to contain all provisions required in order to qualify the options as incentive stock options.

(b) All incentive stock options must be granted within ten years from the date on which this Plan

is adopted by the Board.

(c) No incentive stock options shall be granted to any non-employee or to any participant who, at

the time such option is granted, would own (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code) stock possessing
more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of CenturyLink.

(d) The aggregate Fair Market Value (determined with respect to each incentive stock option as of

the time such incentive stock option is granted) of the Common Stock with respect to which incentive stock
options are exercisable for the first time by a participant during any calendar year (under the Plan or any other
plan of CenturyLink or any of its subsidiaries) shall not exceed $100,000. To the extent that such limitation is
exceeded, the excess options shall be treated as non-qualified stock options for federal income tax purposes.

7. Stock Appreciation Rights.

7.1 Grant of Stock Appreciation Rights. A stock appreciation right, or SAR, is a right to receive,

without payment to the Company, a number of shares of Common Stock, cash, or any combination thereof, the
number or amount of which is determined pursuant to the formula set forth in Section 7.5. Each SAR granted by
the Committee under the Plan shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and the applicable
Incentive Agreement.

7.2 Number. Each SAR granted to any participant shall relate to such number of shares of Common

Stock as shall be determined by the Committee, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.4.

A-4

7.3 Duration and Time for Exercise. The term of each SAR shall be determined by the Committee, but

shall not exceed a maximum term of ten years. Subject to Section 5.6, each SAR shall become exercisable at
such time or times during its term as shall be determined by the Committee and provided for in the Incentive
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may accelerate the exercisability of any SAR at any
time in its discretion.

7.4 Exercise. A SAR may be exercised, in whole or in part, by giving written notice to the Company,

specifying the number of SARs that the holder wishes to exercise. The date that the Company receives such
written notice shall be referred to herein as the “Exercise Date.” The Company shall, within 30 days of an
Exercise Date, deliver to the exercising holder certificates for the shares of Common Stock to which the holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 7.5 or cash or both, as provided in the Incentive Agreement.

7.5 Payment.

(a) The number of shares of Common Stock which shall be issuable upon the exercise of a SAR

payable in Common Stock shall be determined by dividing:

(i) the number of shares of Common Stock as to which the SAR is exercised, multiplied by the

amount of the appreciation in each such share (for this purpose, the “appreciation” shall be the amount
by which the Fair Market Value (as defined in Section 12.10) of a share of Common Stock subject to
the SAR on the trading day prior to the Exercise Date exceeds the “Base Price,” which is an amount,
not less than the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant, which shall be
determined by the Committee at the time of grant, subject to adjustment under Section 5.4); by

(ii) the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Exercise Date.

(b) No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon the exercise of a SAR; instead, the

holder of a SAR shall be entitled to purchase the portion necessary to make a whole share at its Fair Market
Value on the Exercise Date.

(c) If so provided in the Incentive Agreement, a SAR may be exercised for cash equal to the Fair

Market Value of the shares of Common Stock that would be issuable under Section 7.5(a), if the exercise had
been for Common Stock.

7.6 Limitations on Repricing. Except for adjustments pursuant to Section 5.4 or actions permitted to be

taken by the Committee under Section 11 in the event of a Change of Control, unless approved by the
shareholders of the Company, (a) the Base Price for any outstanding SAR granted under this Plan may not be
decreased after the date of grant; and (b) an outstanding SAR that has been granted under this Plan may not, as of
any date that such SAR has a Base Price that is greater than the then-current Fair Market Value of a share of
Common Stock, be surrendered to the Company as consideration for the grant of a new option or SAR with a
lower exercise price, shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units, an Other Stock-Based Award, a cash
payment, or Common Stock.

8. Restricted Stock.

8.1 Grant of Restricted Stock. The Committee may award shares of restricted stock to such eligible
participants as determined pursuant to the terms of Section 3. An award of restricted stock shall be subject to
such restrictions on transfer and forfeitability provisions and such other terms and conditions, including the
attainment of specified performance goals, as the Committee may determine, subject to the provisions of the
Plan.

8.2 The Restricted Period. Subject to Section 5.6, at the time an award of restricted stock is made, the

Committee shall establish a period of time during which the transfer of the shares of restricted stock shall be
restricted and after which the shares of restricted stock shall be vested (the “Restricted Period”). Each award of
restricted stock may have a different Restricted Period.

A-5

8.3 Escrow. The participant receiving restricted stock shall enter into an Incentive Agreement with the
Company setting forth the conditions of the grant. Any certificates representing shares of restricted stock shall be
registered in the name of the participant and deposited with the Company, together with a stock power endorsed
in blank by the participant. Each such certificate shall bear a legend in substantially the following form:

The transferability of this certificate and the shares of Common Stock represented by it are subject to
the terms and conditions (including conditions of forfeiture) contained in the CenturyLink 2018 Equity
Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), and an agreement entered into between the registered owner and
CenturyLink, Inc. (the “Company”) thereunder. Copies of the Plan and the agreement are on file at the
principal office of the Company.

Alternatively, in the discretion of the Company, ownership of the shares of restricted stock and the

appropriate restrictions shall be reflected in the records of the Company’s transfer agent and no physical
certificates shall be issued.

8.4 Forfeiture. In the event of the forfeiture of any shares of restricted stock under the terms provided

in the Incentive Agreement (including any additional shares of restricted stock that may result from the
reinvestment of cash and stock dividends, if so provided in the Incentive Agreement), such forfeited shares shall
be surrendered, any certificates shall be cancelled, and any related accrued but unpaid cash dividends will be
forfeited. The participants shall have the same rights and privileges, and be subject to the same forfeiture
provisions, with respect to any additional shares received pursuant to Section 5.4 due to a recapitalization or
other change in capitalization.

8.5 Expiration of Restricted Period. Upon the expiration or termination of the Restricted Period and the
satisfaction of any other conditions prescribed by the Committee, the restrictions applicable to the restricted stock
shall lapse, and the Company shall cause to be delivered to the participant or the participant’s estate, as the case
may be, the number of shares of restricted stock with respect to which the restrictions have lapsed, free of all
such restrictions and legends, except any that may be imposed by law. The Company, in its discretion, may elect
to deliver such shares through issuance of a stock certificate or by book entry.

8.6 Rights as a Shareholder. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan (including, but not limited
to, Section 5.7) and the applicable Incentive Agreement, each participant receiving restricted stock shall have all
the rights of a shareholder with respect to shares of stock during the Restricted Period, including without
limitation, the right to vote any shares of Common Stock.

9. Restricted Stock Units.

9.1 Grant of Restricted Stock Units. A restricted stock unit, or RSU, represents the right to receive from

the Company on the respective scheduled vesting or payment date for such RSU, one share of Common Stock.
An award of RSUs may be subject to the attainment of specified performance goals or targets, forfeitability
provisions and such other terms and conditions as the Committee may determine, subject to the provisions of the
Plan

9.2 Vesting Period. Subject to Section 5.6, at the time an award of RSUs is made, the Committee shall
establish a period of time during which the restricted stock units shall vest (the “Vesting Period”). Each award of
RSUs may have a different Vesting Period.

9.3 Rights as a Shareholder. Subject to the restrictions imposed under the terms and conditions of this

Plan and subject to any other restrictions that may be imposed in the Incentive Agreement, each participant
receiving restricted stock units shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to such restricted stock units
until such time as shares of Common Stock are issued to the participant.

10. Other Stock-Based Awards. The Committee may grant to eligible participants “Other Stock-Based

Awards,” which shall consist of awards (other than options, SARs, restricted stock, or RSUs, described in

A-6

Sections 6 through 9 hereof) paid out in shares of Common Stock or the value of which is based in whole or in
part on the value of shares of Common Stock. Other Stock-Based Awards may be awards of shares of Common
Stock, awards of phantom stock, or may be denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to,
or otherwise based on or related to, shares of, or appreciation in the value of, Common Stock (including, without
limitation, securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock), as deemed by
the Committee consistent with the purposes of this Plan. Subject to Section 5.6, the Committee shall determine
the terms and conditions of any Other Stock-Based Award (including which rights of a shareholder, if any, the
recipient shall have with respect to Common Stock associated with any such award) and may provide that such
award is payable in whole or in part in cash. An Other Stock-Based Award may be subject to the attainment of
such specified performance goals or targets as the Committee may determine, subject to the provisions of this
Plan.

11. Change of Control.

(a) A Change of Control shall mean:

(i) the acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of 30% or more of the outstanding shares
of the Common Stock or 30% or more of the combined voting power of CenturyLink’s then
outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; provided, however, that for
purposes of this subsection (i), the following acquisitions shall not constitute a Change of Control:

(A) any acquisition (other than a Business Combination (as defined below) which constitutes

a Change of Control under Section 11(a)(iii) hereof) of Common Stock directly from the
Company,

(B) any acquisition of Common Stock by the Company,

(C) any acquisition of Common Stock by any employee benefit plan (or related trust)

sponsored or maintained by the Company or any corporation controlled by the Company, or

(D) any acquisition of Common Stock by any corporation pursuant to a Business

Combination that does not constitute a Change of Control under Section 11(a)(iii) hereof; or

(ii) individuals who, as of May 23, 2018, constituted the Board of Directors of CenturyLink (the

“Incumbent Board”) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board of Directors;
provided, however, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to such date whose election, or
nomination for election by CenturyLink’s shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds
of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered a member of the Incumbent
Board, unless such individual’s initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened
election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened
solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a person other than the Incumbent Board; or

(iii) consummation of a reorganization, share exchange, merger or consolidation (including any
such transaction involving any direct or indirect subsidiary of CenturyLink) or sale or other disposition
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (a “Business Combination”); provided, however,
that in no such case shall any such transaction constitute a Change of Control if immediately following
such Business Combination:

(A) the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners of CenturyLink’s outstanding

Common Stock and CenturyLink’s voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors immediately prior to such Business Combination have direct or indirect beneficial
ownership, respectively, of more than 50% of the then outstanding shares of common stock, and
more than 50% of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities entitled to
vote generally in the election of directors of the surviving or successor corporation, or, if
applicable, the ultimate parent company thereof (the “Post-Transaction Corporation”), and

A-7

(B) except to the extent that such ownership existed prior to the Business Combination, no

person (excluding the Post-Transaction Corporation and any employee benefit plan or related trust
of either CenturyLink, the Post-Transaction Corporation or any subsidiary of either corporation)
beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the then outstanding shares of common
stock of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination or 20% or more of the
combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation, and

(C) at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the Post-Transaction
Corporation were members of the Incumbent Board at the time of the execution of the initial
agreement, or of the action of the Board of Directors, providing for such Business Combination;
or

(iv) approval by the shareholders of CenturyLink of a complete liquidation or dissolution of

CenturyLink.

For purposes of this Section 11, the term “person” shall mean a natural person or entity, and shall also

mean the group or syndicate created when two or more persons act as a syndicate or other group (including a
partnership or limited partnership) for the purpose of acquiring, holding, or disposing of a security, except that
“person” shall not include an underwriter temporarily holding a security pursuant to an offering of the security.

(b) No Incentive Agreement shall provide for (1) the acceleration of the vesting of time-based
Incentives upon the occurrence of a Change of Control without a contemporaneous or subsequent termination of
the participant’s employment or service relationship or (2) the payout of any performance-based Incentives upon
a Change of Control in an amount exceeds the greater of (i) the payout of a pro-rata portion of such Incentive,
based on the portion of the performance period that has elapsed and assuming target performance and (ii) payout
of such Incentive based on actual performance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no later than 30 days after a
Change of Control of the type described in subsections (a)(i) or (a)(ii) of this Section 11 and no later than 30 days
after the approval by the Board of a Change of Control of the type described in subsections (a)(iii) or (a)(iv) of
this Section 11, the Committee, acting in its sole discretion without the consent or approval of any participant
(and notwithstanding any removal or attempted removal of some or all of the members thereof as directors or
Committee members), may act to effect one or more of the alternatives listed below, which may vary among
individual participants and which may vary among Incentives held by any individual participant; provided,
however, that no such action may be taken if it would result in the imposition of a penalty on the participant
under Section 409A of the Code as a result thereof:

(i) require that all outstanding options, SARs or Other Stock-Based Awards be exercised on or
before a specified date (before or after such Change of Control) fixed by the Committee, after which
specified date all unexercised options, SARs and Other Stock-Based Awards and all rights of
participants thereunder would terminate,

(ii) make such equitable adjustments to Incentives then outstanding as the Committee deems

appropriate to reflect such Change of Control and provide participants with substantially equivalent
rights before and after such Change of Control (provided, however, that the Committee may determine
in its sole discretion that no adjustment is necessary),

(iii) provide for mandatory conversion or exchange of some or all of the outstanding options,

SARs, restricted stock units or Other Stock-Based Awards held by some or all participants as of a date,
before or after such Change of Control, specified by the Committee, in which event such Incentives
would be deemed automatically cancelled and the Company would pay, or cause to be paid, to each
such participant an amount of cash per share equal to the excess, if any, of the Change of Control Value
of the shares subject to such option, SAR, restricted stock unit or Other Stock-Based Award, as defined
and calculated below, over the per share exercise price or Base Price of such Incentive or, in lieu of
such cash payment, the issuance of Common Stock or securities of an acquiring entity having a Fair
Market Value equal to such excess, or

A-8

(iv) provide that thereafter, upon any exercise or payment of an Incentive that entitles the holder
to receive Common Stock, the holder shall be entitled to purchase or receive under such Incentive, in
lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock then covered by such Incentive, the number and class of
shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) to which the holder would have been
entitled pursuant to the terms of the agreement providing for the reorganization, share exchange,
merger, consolidation or asset sale, if, immediately prior to such Change of Control, the holder had
been the record owner of the number of shares of Common Stock then covered by such Incentive.

(c) For the purposes of conversions or exchanges under paragraph (iii) of Section 11(c), the
“Change of Control Value” shall equal the amount determined by whichever of the following items is applicable:

(i) the per share price to be paid to holders of Common Stock in any such merger, consolidation or

other reorganization,

(ii) the price per share offered to holders of Common Stock in any tender offer or exchange offer

whereby a Change of Control takes place, or

(iii) in all other events, the fair market value of a share of Common Stock, as determined by the

Committee as of the time determined by the Committee to be immediately prior to the effective time of
the conversion or exchange.

(d) In the event that the consideration offered to shareholders of CenturyLink in any transaction

described in this Section 11 consists of anything other than cash, the Committee shall determine the fair cash
equivalent of the portion of the consideration offered that is other than cash.

12. General.

12.1 Duration. No Incentives may be granted under the Plan after May 23, 2028; provided, however,

that subject to Section 12.8, the Plan shall remain in effect after such date with respect to Incentives granted prior
to that date, until all such Incentives have either been satisfied by the issuance of shares of Common Stock or
otherwise been terminated under the terms of the Plan and all restrictions imposed on shares of Common Stock in
connection with their issuance under the Plan have lapsed.

12.2 Transferability.

(a) No Incentives granted hereunder may be transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise

encumbered by a participant except:

(i) by will;

(ii) by the laws of descent and distribution;

(iii) if permitted by the Committee and so provided in the Incentive Agreement or an amendment

thereto, pursuant to a domestic relations order, as defined in the Code; or

(iv) as to options only, if permitted by the Committee and so provided in the Incentive Agreement

or an amendment thereto, (i) to Immediate Family Members (as defined in Section 12.2(b)); (ii) to a
partnership in which the participant and/or Immediate Family Members, or entities in which the
participant and/or Immediate Family Members are the sole owners, members, or beneficiaries, as
appropriate, are the sole partners; (iii) to a limited liability company in which the participant and/or
Immediate Family Members, or entities in which the participant and/or Immediate Family Members are
the sole owners, members, or beneficiaries, as appropriate, are the sole members; or (iv) to a trust for
the sole benefit of the participant and/or Immediate Family Members.

(b) “Immediate Family Members” shall be defined as the spouse and natural or adopted children
or grandchildren of the participant and their spouses. To the extent that an incentive stock option is permitted to

A-9

be transferred during the lifetime of the participant, it shall be treated thereafter as a nonqualified stock option.
Any attempted assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation, or other disposition of Incentives, or levy of
attachment or similar process upon Incentives not specifically permitted herein, shall be null and void and
without effect.

12.3 Effect of Termination of Employment or Death. In the event that a participant ceases to be an

employee of the Company or to provide services to the Company for any reason, including death, disability, early
retirement or normal retirement, any Incentives may be exercised, shall vest or shall expire at such times as may
be determined by the Committee or as provided in the Incentive Agreement.

12.4 Additional Conditions. Anything in this Plan to the contrary notwithstanding: (a) the Company
may, if it shall determine it necessary or desirable for any reason, at the time of award of any Incentive or the
issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any Incentive, require the recipient of the Incentive, as a
condition to the receipt thereof or to the receipt of shares of Common Stock issued pursuant thereto, to deliver to
the Company a written representation of present intention to acquire the Incentive or the shares of Common
Stock issued pursuant thereto for his own account for investment and not for distribution; and (b) if at any time
the Company further determines, in its sole discretion, that the listing, registration or qualification (or any
updating of any such document) of any Incentive or the shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant thereto is
necessary on any securities exchange or under any federal or state securities or blue sky law, or that the consent
or approval of any governmental regulatory body is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection
with the award of any Incentive, the issuance of shares of Common Stock pursuant thereto, or the removal of any
restrictions imposed on such shares, such Incentive shall not be awarded or such shares of Common Stock shall
not be issued or such restrictions shall not be removed, as the case may be, in whole or in part, unless such
listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions
not acceptable to the Company.

12.5 Withholding.

(a) The Company shall have the right to withhold from any payments made or stock issued under
the Plan or to collect as a condition of payment, issuance or vesting, any taxes required by law to be withheld (up
to the maximum permissible withholding rate). At any time that a participant is required to pay to the Company
an amount required to be withheld under applicable income tax laws in connection with an Incentive (each such
date, a “Tax Date”), the participant may, subject to Section 12.5(b) below, satisfy this obligation in whole or in
part by electing (the “Election”) to deliver currently owned shares of Common Stock or to have the Company
withhold shares of Common Stock, in each case having a value equal to the maximum statutory amount required
to be withheld under federal, state and local law. The value of the shares to be delivered or withheld shall be
based on the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the Tax Date.

(b) Each Election must be made prior to the Tax Date. For participants who are not subject to

Section 16 of the 1934 Act, the Committee may disapprove of any Election, may suspend or terminate the right
to make Elections, or may provide with respect to any Incentive that the right to make Elections shall not apply
to such Incentive. If a participant makes an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with respect to shares of
restricted stock, an Election to have shares withheld to satisfy withholding taxes is not permitted to be made.

12.6 No Continued Employment. No participant under the Plan shall have any right, solely based on his
or her participation in the Plan, to continue to serve as an employee, officer, director, consultant, or advisor of the
Company for any period of time or to any right to continue his or her present or any other rate of compensation.

12.7 Deferral Permitted. Payment of an Incentive may be deferred at the option of the participant if

permitted in the Incentive Agreement. Any deferral arrangements shall comply with Section 409A of the Code.

A-10

12.8 Amendments to or Termination of the Plan. The Board may amend or discontinue this Plan at any

time; provided, however, that no such amendment may:

(a) amend Section 6.5 or Section 7.6 to permit repricing of options or SARs without the approval

of shareholders;

(b) materially impair, without the consent of the recipient, an Incentive previously granted, except

that the Company retains all of its rights under Section 11; or

(c) materially revise the Plan without the approval of the shareholders. A material revision of the
Plan includes (i) except for adjustments permitted herein, a material increase to the maximum number of shares
of Common Stock that may be issued through the Plan, (ii) a material increase to the benefits accruing to
participants under the Plan, (iii) a material expansion of the classes of persons eligible to participate in the Plan,
(iv) an expansion of the types of awards available for grant under the Plan, (v) a material extension of the term of
the Plan and (vi) a material change that reduces the price at which shares of Common Stock may be offered
through the Plan.

12.9 Repurchase. Upon approval of the Committee, the Company may repurchase all or a portion of a

previously granted Incentive from a participant by mutual agreement by payment to the participant of cash or
Common Stock or a combination thereof with a value equal to the value of the Incentive determined in good faith
by the Committee; provided, however, that in no event will this section be construed to grant the Committee the
power to take any action in violation of Section 6.5, 7.6, or 12.13.

12.10 Definition of Fair Market Value. Whenever “Fair Market Value” of Common Stock shall be

determined for purposes of this Plan, except as provided below in connection with a cashless exercise through a
broker, it shall be determined as follows: (a) if the Common Stock is listed on an established stock exchange or
any automated quotation system that provides sale quotations, the closing sale price for a share of the Common
Stock on such exchange or quotation system on the date as of which fair market value is to be determined, (b) if
the Common Stock is not listed on any exchange or quotation system, but bid and asked prices are quoted and
published, the mean between the quoted bid and asked prices on the date as of which fair market value is to be
determined, and if bid and asked prices are not available on such day, on the next preceding day on which such
prices were available; and (c) if the Common Stock is not regularly quoted, the fair market value of a share of
Common Stock on the date as of which fair market value is to be determined, as established by the Committee in
good faith. In the context of a cashless exercise through a broker, the “Fair Market Value” shall be the price at
which the Common Stock subject to the stock option is actually sold in the market to pay the option exercise
price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if so determined by the Committee, “Fair Market Value” may be
determined as an average selling price during a period specified by the Committee that is within 30 days before
or 30 days after the date of grant, provided that the commitment to grant the stock right based on such valuation
method must be irrevocable before the beginning of the specified period, and such valuation method must be
used consistently for grants of stock rights under the same and substantially similar programs during any
particular calendar year.

12.11 Liability.

(a) Neither CenturyLink, its affiliates or any of their respective directors or officers shall be liable
to any participant relating to the participant’s failure to (i) realize any anticipated benefit under an Incentive due
to the failure to satisfy any applicable conditions to vesting, payment or settlement, or (ii) realize any anticipated
tax benefit or consequence due to changes in applicable law, the particular circumstances of the participant, or
any other reason.

(b) No member of the Committee (or officer of the Company exercising delegated authority of the
Committee under Section 3 thereof) will be liable for any action or determination made in good faith with respect
to this Plan or any Incentive.

A-11

12.12 Interpretation.

(a) Unless the context otherwise requires, (i) all references to Sections are to Sections of this Plan,

(ii) the term “including” means including without limitation, (iii) all references to any particular Incentive
Agreement shall be deemed to include any amendments thereto or restatements thereof, and (iv) all references to
any particular statute shall be deemed to include any amendment, restatement or re-enactment thereof or any
statute or regulation substituted therefore.

(b) The titles and subtitles used in this Plan or any Incentive Agreement are used for convenience

only and are not to be considered in construing or interpreting this Plan or the Incentive Agreement.

(c) All pronouns contained in this Plan or any Incentive Agreement, and any variations thereof,
shall be deemed to refer to the masculine, feminine or neutral, singular or plural, as the identities of the parties
may require.

(d) Whenever any provision of this Plan authorizes the Committee to take action or make

determinations with respect to outstanding Incentives that have been granted or awarded by the chief executive
officer of CenturyLink under Section 3.2 hereof, each such reference to “Committee” shall be deemed to include
a reference to any officer of the Company that has delegated administrative authority under Section 3.2 of this
Plan (subject to the limitations of such section).

12.13 Compliance with Section 409A. It is the intent of the Company that this Plan comply with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code with respect to any Incentives that constitute non-qualified deferred
compensation under Section 409A, and the Company intends to operate the Plan in compliance with
Section 409A and the Department of Treasury’s guidance or regulations promulgated thereunder. If the
Committee grants any Incentives or takes any other action that would, either immediately or upon vesting or
payment of the Incentive, inadvertently result in the imposition of a penalty on a participant under Section 409A
of the Code, then the Company, in its discretion, may, to the maximum extent permitted by law, unilaterally
rescind ab initio, sever, amend or otherwise modify the grant or action (or any provision of the Incentive) in such
manner necessary for the penalty to be inapplicable or reduced.

12.14 Data Privacy. As a condition of receipt of any Incentive, each participant explicitly and

unambiguously consents to the collection, use, and transfer, in electronic or other form, of personal data as
described in this Section by and among, as applicable, the Company and its affiliates for the exclusive purpose of
implementing, administering, and managing the Plan and Incentives and such participant’s participation in the
Plan. In furtherance of such implementation, administration, and management, the Company and its affiliates
may hold certain personal information about a participant, including, but not limited to, the participant’s name,
home address, telephone number, date of birth, social security or insurance number or other identification
number, salary, nationality, job title(s), information regarding any securities of the Company or any of its
affiliates, and details of all Incentives (the “Data”). In addition to transferring the Data amongst themselves as
necessary for the purpose of implementation, administration, and management of the Plan and Incentives and the
participant’s participation in the Plan, the Company and its affiliates may each transfer the Data to any third
parties assisting the Company in the implementation, administration, and management of the Plan and Incentives
and such participant’s participation in the Plan. Recipients of the Data may be located in the participant’s country
or elsewhere, and the participant’s country and any given recipient’s country may have different data privacy
laws and protections. By accepting an Incentive, each participant authorizes such recipients to receive, possess,
use, retain, and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of assisting the Company in the
implementation, administration, and management of the Plan and Incentives and such participant’s participation
in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a broker or other third party with
whom the Company or the participant may elect to deposit any shares of Common Stock. The Data related to a
participant will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer, and manage the Plan and
Incentives and the participant’s participation in the Plan. A participant may, at any time, view the Data held by

A-12

the Company with respect to such Participant, request additional information about the storage and processing of
the Data with respect to such participant, recommend any necessary corrections to the Data with respect to the
participant, or refuse or withdraw the consents herein in writing, in any case without cost, by contacting his or
her local human resources representative. However, if a participant refuses or withdraws the consents described
herein, the Company may cancel the participant’s eligibility to participate in the Plan, and in the Committee’s
discretion, the participant may forfeit any outstanding Incentive. For more information on the consequences of
refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, participants may contact their local human resources representative.

12.15 Participants Outside of the United States. The Committee may modify the terms of any Incentive

under the Plan made to or held by a participant who is then a resident, or is primarily employed or providing
services, outside of the United States in any manner deemed by the Committee to be necessary or appropriate in
order that such Incentive shall conform to laws, regulations, and customs of the country in which the Participant
is then a resident or primarily employed or providing services, or so that the value and other benefits of the
Incentive to such participant, as affected by non-United States tax laws and other restrictions applicable as a
result of the participant’s residence, employment, or providing services abroad, shall be comparable to the value
of such Incentive to a Participant who is a resident, or is primarily employed or providing services, in the United
States. An Incentive may be modified under this Section 12.15 in a manner that is inconsistent with the express
terms of the Plan, so long as such modifications will not contravene any applicable law or regulation or result in
actual liability under Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act for the participant whose Incentive is modified. Additionally,
the Committee may adopt such procedures and sub-plans as are necessary or appropriate to permit participation
in the Plan by Eligible Persons who are non-United States nationals or are primarily employed or providing
services outside the United States.

Operations” in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for a
discussion of unusual items affecting the results for each of the years presented.

(2) The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation in December 2017 resulted in a re-measurement of

our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal corporate tax rate of 21%. The re-measurement
resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $1.1 billion.

(3) During 2017 and 2016, we incurred Level 3 acquisition-related expenses of $271 million and $52 million,

(4)

respectively. For additional information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations—Acquisition of Level 3” and Note 2—Acquisition of Level 3 to our
consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2017.
In 2017, we adopted ASU 2017-07, “Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net
Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost” by retrospectively applying the requirements of the ASU to our
previously issued consolidated financial statements. The adoption of ASU 2017-07 increased operating
income and increased total other expense, net by $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and
reduced operating income and decreased total other expense, net by $26 million, $53 million and
$158 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

(5) During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized an incremental $186 million, $201 million and $215 million,

respectively, of revenue associated with the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) Connect
America Fund Phase 2 support program, as compared to revenues received under the interstate USF
program.

(6) During 2016, we recognized $189 million of severance expenses and other one-time termination benefits

associated with our workforce reductions.

B-4

(7) During 2014, we recognized a $60 million tax benefit associated with a deduction for the tax basis for

worthless stock in a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary and a $63 million pension settlement charge.

(8) During 2013, we recorded a non-cash, non-tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge of $1.092 billion for

goodwill attributed to one of our previous operating segments and a litigation settlement charge of
$235 million.

$1.071 billion in net property, plant and equipment and $1.141 billion of goodwill to assets held for sale
which is included in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 3—Sale of Colocation
Business and Data Centers to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, for additional information.
In 2015, we adopted both ASU 2015-03 “Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs” and ASU
2015-17 “Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes” by retrospectively applying the requirements of
the ASUs to our previously issued consolidated financial statements. The adoption of both ASU 2015-03
and ASU 2015-17 reduced total assets by $1.044 billion and $1.316 billion in each year for the two years
ended December 31, 2014, respectively, and ASU 2015-03 reduced total long-term debt by $168 million
and $157 million in each year for the two years ended December 31, 2014, respectively.

(3) Total long-term debt includes current maturities of long-term debt and capital lease obligations of

$305 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 associated with assets held for sale. For additional
information on our total long-term debt, see Note 5—Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to our
consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2017. For total contractual obligations, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

(1) Access lines are lines reaching from the customers’ premises to a connection with the public network and

broadband subscribers are customers that purchase broadband connection service through their existing
telephone lines, stand-alone telephone lines, or fiber-optic cables. Our methodology for counting our access
lines and broadband subscribers includes only those lines that we use to provide services to external
customers and excludes lines used solely by us and our affiliates. It also excludes unbundled loops and
includes stand-alone broadband subscribers. We count lines when we install the service.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Certain statements in our Annual Report constitute forward-looking statements. See “Special Note

Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Related Matters” in Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2017 for factors relating to these statements and “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for a discussion of certain risk factors
applicable to our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or prospects.

OVERVIEW

We are an international facilities-based communications company engaged primarily in providing an

integrated array of services to our residential and business customers. Our communications services include local
and long-distance voice, virtual private network (“VPN”) data network, private line (including business data
services), Ethernet, information technology, wavelength, broadband, colocation and data center services,
managed services, professional and other services provided in connection with selling equipment, network
security and various other ancillary services. We strive to maintain our customer relationships by, among other
things, bundling our service offerings to provide our customers with a complete offering of integrated
communications services.

With approximately 450,000 route miles of fiber optic cable globally, we believe we are among the largest
providers of communications services to global enterprise customers. Our terrestrial and subsea fiber optic long-
haul network throughout North America, Europe and Latin America connects to metropolitan fiber networks that
we operate. We operate in over 60 countries, with the substantial majority of our revenues being derived in the
United States.

Based on our approximately 10.3 million total access lines at December 31, 2017, we believe we are the

third largest wireline telecommunications company in the United States.

Acquisition of Level 3

On November 1, 2017, CenturyLink, Inc. (“CenturyLink”) acquired Level 3 Communications, Inc.

(“Level 3”) through successive merger transactions, including a merger of Level 3 with and into a merger
subsidiary, which survived such merger as our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary under the name of Level 3
Parent, LLC. We entered into this transaction, among other things, to realize certain strategic benefits, including
enhanced financial and operational scale, market diversification and leveraged combined networks.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $97 million of integration-related expenses

associated with our activities related to the Level 3 acquisition. During 2017, we also recognized $174 million in
merger-related transaction costs, including investment banker and legal fees in connection with consummating
the transaction.

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CenturyLink and its majority owned

subsidiaries, including Level 3 beginning on November 1, 2017. Due to the significant size of the acquisition,
direct comparison of our results of operations for the periods ending on or after December 31, 2017 to prior
periods are less meaningful than usual.

As a result of the acquisition, Level 3’s assets and liabilities have been revalued and recorded at their

preliminary estimated fair value. The assignment of estimated fair value requires a significant amount of
judgment. The use of fair value measures affects the comparability of our post-acquisition financial information
and may make it more difficult to predict earnings in future periods. We expect to complete our final fair value

B-7

determinations prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition. Our final fair value determinations may be
significantly different than those preliminary values reflected in our consolidated financial statements at
December 31, 2017.

In the discussion that follows, we refer to the business that we operated prior to the Level 3 acquisition as

“Legacy CenturyLink”, and we refer to the incremental business activities that we now operate as a result of the
Level 3 acquisition as “Legacy Level 3.”

For additional information about our acquisition of Level 3, see (i) Note 2—Acquisition of Level 3 to our

consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2017, (ii) our current report on Form 8-K/A filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
“SEC”) on January 16, 2018, (iii) our current report on Form 8-K filed by us with the SEC on November 1, 2017
and (iv) the definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus filed by us with the SEC on February 13, 2017.

Sale of Data Centers and Colocation Business

On May 1, 2017, we sold our data centers and colocation business to a consortium led by BC Partners, Inc.
and Medina Capital (“the Purchaser”) in exchange for pre-tax cash proceeds of $1.8 billion and a minority stake
in the limited partnership that owns the consortium’s newly-formed global secure infrastructure company,
Cyxtera Technologies. As part of the transaction, the Purchaser acquired 57 of our data centers and assumed our
capital lease obligations, which amounted to $294 million on May 1, 2017, related to the divested properties.

Our colocation business generated revenues (excluding revenue from affiliates) of $210 million from

January 1, 2017 through May 1, 2017, and $622 million and $626 million for the years ended December 31, 2016
and 2015, respectively (a small portion of which has been retained by us).

This transaction did not meet the accounting requirements for a sale-leaseback transaction as described in
ASC 840-40, Leases - Sale-Leaseback Transaction. Under the failed-sale-leaseback accounting model, we are
deemed under GAAP to still own certain real estate assets sold to Cyxtera. The failed-sale-leaseback accounting
treatment decreased net income by $103 million on our consolidated results of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2017.

After factoring in the costs to sell the data centers and colocation business, excluding the impacts from the

failed-sale-leaseback accounting treatment, the sale resulted in a $20 million gain as a result of the aggregate
value of the consideration we received exceeding the carrying value of the assets sold and liabilities assumed.
Based on the fair market values of the failed-sale-leaseback assets, the failed-sale-leaseback accounting treatment
resulted in a loss of $102 million as a result of the requirement to treat a certain amount of the pre-tax cash
proceeds from the sale of the assets as though it were the result of a financing obligation. The combined net loss
of $82 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. The sale also resulted in a significant capital loss
carryforward, which was entirely offset by a valuation allowance due to our determination that we are not likely
to be able to utilize this carryforward prior to its expiration.

For all of 2018, we will be required by GAAP to record similar non-cash adjustments to our net income.

Upon the January 1, 2019 implementation of the new accounting standard for Leases (ASU 2016-02), which was
issued by the FASB in early 2016, this particular accounting treatment will no longer be applicable for this
transaction, and the above-described real estate assets and corresponding financing obligation will be
derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet.

See Note 3—Sale of Data Centers and Colocation Business to our consolidated financial statements in

Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for additional information on
the sale.

New Organizational Structure

In January 2017, we implemented a new organization structure designed to further strengthen our ability to
attain our operational, strategic and financial goals. Prior to this reorganization, we operated and reported as two
segments, business and consumer. As a result of this reorganization, we changed the name of the predecessor
business segment to “enterprise” segment. Additionally, we also reassigned our information technology,
managed hosting, cloud hosting and hosting area network services from our business segment to a new
non-reportable operating segment. We reported two segments, enterprise and consumer, from January 2017
through October 2017.

In connection with our acquisition of Level 3 (discussed further in Note 2—Acquisition of Level 3 to our

consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2017), effective November 1, 2017, we implemented a new organization structure and began managing our
operations in two segments: business and consumer. Our consumer segment remains substantially unchanged
under this reorganization, and our newly reorganized business segment includes the legacy CenturyLink
enterprise segment operations and the legacy Level 3 operations. In addition, we reassigned our information
technology, managed hosting, cloud hosting and hosting area network operations back into the business segment
from the former non-reportable operating segment. At December 31, 2017, we had the following two segments:

(1) The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation in December 2017 resulted in a re-measurement of

our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal corporate tax rate of 21%. The re-measurement
resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $1.1 billion.

(2) During 2017 and 2016, we incurred Level 3 acquisition-related expenses of $271 million and $52 million,
respectively. For additional information, see “Acquisition of Level 3” above and Note 2—Acquisition of
Level 3 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2017.
In 2017, we adopted ASU 2017-07, “Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net
Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost” by retrospectively applying the requirements of the ASU to our
previously issued consolidated financial statements. The adoption of ASU 2017-07 increased operating
income and increased total other expense, net by $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and
reduced operating income and decreased total other expense, net by $26 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015.

(4) During 2016, we recognized $189 million of severance expenses and other one-time termination benefits

associated with our workforce reductions.

(1) Access lines are lines reaching from the customers’ premises to a connection with the public network and

broadband subscribers are customers that purchase broadband connection service through their existing
telephone lines, stand-alone telephone lines, or fiber-optic cables. Our methodology for counting our access
lines and broadband subscribers includes only those lines that we use to provide services to external
customers and excludes lines used solely by us and our affiliates. It also excludes unbundled loops and
includes stand-alone broadband subscribers. We count lines when we install the service.

During the last decade, we have experienced revenue declines primarily due to declines in access lines,

private line customers, switched access rates and minutes of use. To mitigate these revenue declines, we remain
focused on efforts to, among other things:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

promote long-term relationships with our customers through bundling of integrated services;

increase the capacity, speed and usage of our networks;

provide a wide array of diverse services, including enhanced or additional services that may become
available in the future due to, among other things, advances in technology or improvements in our
infrastructure;

provide our premium services to a higher percentage of our customers;

pursue acquisitions of additional assets if available at attractive prices;

increase prices on our products and services if and when practicable; and

market our products and services to new customers.

Operating Revenues

We categorize our products, services and revenues among the following five categories:

•

IP and data services, which include primarily VPN data networks, Ethernet, IP, video (including our
facilities-based video services and Vyvx broadcast services) and other ancillary services;

B-10

•

•

•

•

Transport and infrastructure, which include broadband, private line (including business data services),
data center facilities and services, including cloud, hosting and application management solutions,
wavelength, equipment sales and professional services, network security services and other ancillary
services;

Voice and collaboration, which includes primarily local and long-distance voice, including wholesale
voice, and other ancillary service;

IT and managed services, which include information technology services and managed services, which
may be purchased in conjunction with our other network services; and

Regulatory revenues, which consist of Universal Service Fund (“USF”) and Connect America Fund
(“CAF”) support payments and other operating revenues. We receive federal support payments from
both federal and state USF programs and from the federal CAF program. The USF and CAF support
payments are government subsidies designed to reimburse us for various costs related to certain
telecommunications services. We generate other operating revenues from the leasing and subleasing of
space in our office buildings, warehouses and other properties and from rental income associated with
the failed-sale-leaseback. Because we centrally manage the activities that generate these regulatory
revenues, these revenues are not included in our segment revenues.

For more information, see “Products and Services” in Item I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the

year ended December 31, 2017.

Our total operating revenues increased by $186 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as

compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the inclusion of $1.39 billion in post-acquisition Legacy
Level 3 operating revenues in our 2017 consolidated operating revenues. Total operating revenues for Legacy
CenturyLink decreased by $1.204 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2016 and by $430 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2015. The decline in total operating revenues for both periods reflects the continuing loss of access
lines, loss of long-distance revenues primarily due to the displacement of traditional wireline telephone services
by other competitive products and services, including data and wireless communication services, and reductions
in the volume of our private line (including business data services) services. Our total operating revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2017 were also impacted by the May 1, 2017 sale of our data centers and colocation
business, which resulted in a reduction of colocation revenues of $396 million for the year ended December 31,
2017 as compared to the prior year period.

Further analysis of our segment operating revenues and trends impacting our performance are provided

below in “Segment Results.”

Operating Expenses

Our current definitions of operating expenses are as follows:

•

•

Cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) are expenses incurred in
providing products and services to our customers. These expenses include: employee-related expenses
directly attributable to operating and maintaining our network (such as salaries, wages, benefits and
professional fees); facilities expenses (which include third-party telecommunications expenses we
incur for using other carriers’ networks to provide services to our customers); rents and utilities
expenses; equipment sales expenses (such as data integration and modem expenses); payments to
universal service funds (which are federal and state funds that are established to promote the
availability of telecommunications services to all consumers at reasonable and affordable rates, among
other things, and to which we are often required to contribute); certain litigation expenses associated
with our operations; and other expenses directly related to our operations; and

Selling, general and administrative expenses are corporate overhead and other operating expenses.
These expenses include: employee-related expenses (such as salaries, wages, internal commissions,
benefits and professional fees) directly attributable to selling products or services and employee-related

B-12

expenses for administrative functions; marketing and advertising; property and other operating taxes
and fees; external commissions; litigation expenses associated with general matters; bad debt expense;
and other selling, general and administrative expenses.

These expense classifications may not be comparable to those of other companies.

Cost of Services and Products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)

Cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) increased by $429 million, or
6%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in
costs of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was attributable to the inclusion of
$690 million in post-acquisition Legacy Level 3 costs (net of intercompany eliminations) in our consolidated
costs of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Costs of services and products
(exclusive of depreciation and amortization) for Legacy CenturyLink decreased by $261 million, or 3%, for the
year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in cost of
services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was primarily due to reductions in salaries and
wages and employee benefits from lower headcount and healthcare costs, lower real estate and power expenses
from the sale of the data centers and colocation business, and reduced customer premises equipment costs due to
a decrease in sales of customer premises equipment and USF rates, which were partially offset by increases in
facility costs. Cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) decreased by $4 million,
or less than 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The
decrease in cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was primarily due to
reductions in salaries and wages from lower headcount, professional fees, payment processing fees and customer
premises equipment costs, which were substantially offset by increases in content costs for Prism TV (resulting
from higher content volume and rates), network expense and USF rates.

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $61 million, or 2%, for the year ended

December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in selling, general and

B-13

administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the inclusion of $253 million in post-acquisition Legacy
Level 3 expenses (net of intercompany eliminations) in our consolidated selling, general and administrative
expenses. Legacy CenturyLink’s selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $192 million, or 6%,
primarily due to reductions in salaries and wages and employee benefits from lower headcount and healthcare
costs, external commissions and bad debt expenses. These decreases were substantially offset by losses
recognized from the sale of our data centers and colocation business and the related failed-sale-leaseback as
further described in Note 3—Sale of Data Centers and Colocation Business to our consolidated financial
statements in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and increases in
transaction and integration costs associated with the Level 3 acquisition. Selling, general and administrative
expenses increased by $93 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2015. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases
in severance expenses associated with workforce reductions, higher payments of employee health care claims,
bad debt and other expenses (including fees related to the Level 3 acquisition), which were partially offset by
reductions in professional fees and property and other taxes.

Annual depreciation expense is impacted by several factors, including changes in our depreciable cost basis,

changes in our estimates of the remaining economic life of certain network assets, the addition of new plant
(including from the acquisition of Level 3) and the sale of our data centers and colocation business. Depreciation
expense increased by $19 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2016 and decreased by $145 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to
the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2017
was primarily attributable to the inclusion of $143 million in post-acquisition Legacy Level 3 depreciation
expense in our consolidated depreciation expense. Legacy CenturyLink’s depreciation expense was lower for
both periods due to full depreciation and retirement of certain plant placed in service prior to 2017 and 2016.
Additionally, we ceased depreciating property, plant and equipment assets of our colocation business when we
entered into the agreement to sell that business in late 2016. Absent the sale, we estimate that we would have
recorded additional depreciation expense of $54 million from January 1, 2017 through May 1, 2017 related to the
conveyed property. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense attributable to
new plant placed in service since January 1, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As a result of not meeting sale-
leaseback accounting requirements, we are deemed under GAAP to still own certain real estate assets sold to
Cyxtera; therefore, we are required to reflect a portion of the real estate assets on our consolidated balance sheet
and depreciate these assets over their useful lives. As further described in Note 3—Sale of Data Centers and

B-14

Colocation Business, of the $91 million increase in depreciation expense on these real estate assets, $44 million
is not expected to recur in future periods.

Amortization expense increased by $1 million, or less than 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as

compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 and decreased by $128 million, or 9%, for the year ended
December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in amortization expense for
the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the inclusion of $139 million in post-acquisition
Legacy Level 3 amortization expense in our consolidated amortization expense. Legacy CenturyLink’s
amortization expense was lower for both periods primarily due to the use of accelerated amortization for a
portion of our customer relationship assets and our entry into an agreement to sell our data centers and colocation
business. The effect of using an accelerated amortization method results in an incremental decline in expense
each period as the intangible assets amortize. We ceased amortizing the intangible assets of our colocation
business when we entered into the agreement to sell that business. Absent the sale, we estimate that we would
have recorded additional amortization expense of $13 million from January 1, 2017 through May 1, 2017, related
to the conveyed intangible assets. In addition, amortization of capitalized software was lower in both periods due
to software becoming fully amortized faster than new software was acquired or developed.

Interest Expense

Interest expense increased by $163 million, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to

the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to (i) the issuance of
$7.945 billion of term loans in 2017 for the purpose of providing funding for the Level 3 acquisition, (ii) the
assumption of Level 3’s debt upon the consummation of the acquisition of Level 3, which accounted for
$80 million in post-acquisition interest expense and (iii) the recognition of imputed interest expense resulting
from the failed-sale-leaseback as further described in Note 3—Sale of Data Centers and Colocation Business.
Interest expense increased by $6 million, or less than 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to
the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in interest expense was substantially due to a reduction in the

B-15

amount of net premium amortization recorded at acquisition due to the early retirement of several issuances of
debt during the period, which has the effect of increasing interest expense, and an increase in interest expense on
unsecured notes related to the issuance of $1.0 billion of new debt in April, 2016 in advance of a debt maturity in
June, 2016.

Other Income, Net

Other income, net reflects certain items not directly related to our core operations, including our share of

income from partnerships we do not control, interest income, gains and losses from non-operating asset
dispositions, foreign currency gains and losses and components of net periodic pension and postretirement
benefit costs. Other income (expense), net increased by $7 million, or 140%, for the year ended December 31,
2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase in other income, net was primarily due to
a reduction in the loss on early retirement of debt, an increase in interest income from the $6 billion Term Loan B
funds held in escrow and income generated from our services agreements with Cyxtera, which was substantially
offset by a lower expected return on assets in 2017 for our pension and post-retirement plans. The expected
return on assets for our pension and post-retirement plans was lower in 2017 as compared to 2016, which resulted
in us recording pension and post-retirement expense in 2017 as compared to recording pension and post-
retirement income in 2016. Other income, net decreased by $44 million, or 90%, for the year ended
December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease in other income, net was
primarily due to losses on early retirement of debt, which was partially offset by the impact of nonrecurring
funding from a state economic development program.

Income Tax (Benefits) Expense

The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation in December 2017 resulted in a re-measurement of
our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal corporate tax rate of 21%. The re-measurement resulted
in a tax benefit of approximately $1.1 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, which was the predominant
factor contributing to our recognition of an $849 million income tax benefit for 2017, versus income tax expense
of $394 million in the prior year. Income tax expense decreased by $44 million for the year ended December 31,
2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and
2015, our effective income tax rate was (157.2)%, 38.6% and 33.3%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the
year ended December 31, 2017 reflects the benefit from the re-measurement of deferred taxes as noted above, a
$27 million tax expense related to the sale of our data centers and colocation business and a $32 million tax
impact of non-deductible transaction costs related to the Level 3 acquisition. The effective tax rate for the year
ended December 31, 2016 reflects a tax impact of $18 million from an intercompany dividend payment from one
of our foreign subsidiaries to its domestic parent company that was made as part of our corporate restructuring in
preparation for the sale of our colocation business. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015
reflects a tax benefit of approximately $34 million related to affiliate debt rationalization, research and
development tax credits of $28 million for 2011 through 2015, and a $16 million tax decrease due to changes in
state taxes caused by apportionment changes, state tax rate changes and the changes in the expected utilization of
net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”). See Note 13—Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements
in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and “Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates—Income Taxes” below for additional information.

Products and Services

In connection with our acquisition of Level 3 on November 1, 2017, we revised the way we categorize our
products and services and now report our related revenues under the following categories: IP and data services,
transport and infrastructure, voice and collaboration, IT and managed services and regulatory revenues. From
time to time, we change the categorization of our products and services, and we may make similar changes in the
future.

We offer our customers the ability to bundle together several products and services. We believe our

customers value the convenience and price discounts associated with receiving multiple services through a single
company.

Business Segment

The operations of our business segment have been impacted by several significant trends, including those

described below:

Our mix of total business segment revenues continues to migrate from traditional wireline voice services to

newer, lower cost more technologically advanced products and services as our small, medium and enterprise
business, wholesale and government customers increasingly demand integrated data, broadband, hosting and
voice services. Our Ethernet-based services in the wholesale market face competition from cable companies and
competitive fiber-based telecommunications providers. We anticipate continued pricing pressure for our
colocation services as our competitors continue to expand their enterprise colocation operations. In recent years,
our competitors, as well as several large, diversified technology companies, have made substantial investments in
cloud computing. This expansion in competitive cloud computing offerings has led to increased pricing pressure,
a migration towards lower-priced cloud-based services and enhanced competition for contracts, and we expect
these trends to continue. Customers’ demand for new technology has also increased the number of competitors
offering services similar to ours. Price compression from each of these above-mentioned competitive pressures
has negatively impacted the operating margins of certain business product and service offerings, and we expect
this trend to continue. Our traditional wireline products and services revenues have been, and we expect they will
continue to be, adversely affected by access line losses and price compression. In particular, our access, local
services and long-distance revenues have been, and we expect will continue to be, adversely affected by
customer migration to more technologically advanced services, a substantial increase in the use of non-voice
communications, industry consolidation and price compression caused by regulation and rate reductions. For
example, many of our business segment customers are substituting cable, wireless and Voice over Internet
Protocol (“VoIP”) services for traditional voice telecommunications services, resulting in continued access
revenue loss. Demand for our private line services (including business data services) continues to decline due to
our customers’ optimization of their networks, industry consolidation and technological migration to higher-
speed services. Although our traditional wireline services generally face fewer direct competitors than certain of
our newer, lower cost more advanced products and services, customer migration and, to a lesser degree, price
compression from competitive pressures have negatively impacted our traditional wireline revenues and the
operating margins of these services. We expect this trend to continue. We expect both equipment sales and
professional services revenue and the related costs will fluctuate from year to year as this offering tends to be
more sensitive than others to changes in the economy and in spending trends of our federal, state and local
government customers, many of whom have experienced substantial budget cuts over the past several years, with
the possibility of additional future budget cuts.

Our operating costs also impact the operating margins of all of our above-mentioned services, but to a lesser

extent than price compression and customer disconnects. These operating costs include employee costs, sales
commissions, software costs on selected services, installation costs and third-party facility costs. We believe
increases in operating costs have generally had a greater impact on the operating margins of some of our newer,
more technologically advanced services as compared to our traditional wireline services, principally because
those newer services rely more heavily upon the above-listed support functions. Operating costs, such as
installation costs and third-party facility costs, have also negatively impacted the operating margins of our
traditional wireline products and services, but to a lesser extent than customer loss, customer migration and price
compression.

We continue to evaluate our segment operating structure and focus. This involves balancing our workforce

in response to our workload requirements, productivity improvements and changes in industry, competitive,
technological and regulatory conditions, while achieving operational efficiencies and improving our processes
through automation. However, our ongoing efforts to increase revenue will continue to require that we incur
higher costs in some areas. We also expect our business segment to benefit indirectly from enhanced efficiencies
in our company-wide network operations.

Segment Revenues

Business segment revenues increased by $516 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as

compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the inclusion of $1.39 billion in post-acquisition Legacy
Level 3 business segment revenues in our consolidated business segment revenues. Business segment revenues

B-19

for Legacy CenturyLink decreased by $874 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the
year ended December 31, 2016 and by $273 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the
year ended December 31, 2015. The decline in business segment revenues for both periods is attributable to a
reduction in access lines and lower volumes of long-distance and access services resulting from the competitive
and technological factors noted above and to reductions in the volume of private line (including business data
services) services. Our business segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were also impacted by
the May 1, 2017 sale of our data centers and colocation business, which resulted in a reduction of colocation
revenues of $396 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year period.

Segment Expenses

Business segment expenses increased by $456 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as

compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the inclusion of $749 million in post-
acquisition Legacy Level 3 business segment expenses in our consolidated business segment expenses. Business
segment expenses for Legacy CenturyLink decreased by $293 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as
compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to decreases in salaries and wages and employee
benefits from lower headcount, real estate and power costs due to the sale of the data centers and colocation
business, marketing and advertising expenses and network expense. These decreases were partially offset by an
increase in facility costs. Business segment expenses for Legacy CenturyLink decreased by $4 million, or less
than 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease
in our business segment expenses was primarily due to decreases in salaries and wages, professional fees and
payment processing fees, which were substantially offset by increases in facility costs, network expense and real
estate and power costs.

Segment Income

Business segment income increased by $60 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as

compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the inclusion of $641 million in post-acquisition
Legacy Level 3 business segment net income and decreased by $269 million, or 6%, for the year ended
December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease of $581 million in Legacy
CenturyLink business segment income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to the loss of customers,
lower service volumes and the loss of income generated by our colocation business. The decrease in business
segment income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due predominantly to the loss of customers and
lower service volumes.

Consumer Segment

The operations of our consumer segment have been impacted by several significant trends, including those

described below:

In order to remain competitive and attract additional residential broadband subscribers, we believe it is

important to continually increase our broadband network’s scope and connection speeds. As a result, we continue
to invest in our broadband network, which allows for the delivery of higher-speed broadband services to a greater
number of customers. We compete in a maturing broadband market in which most consumers already have
broadband services and growth rates in new subscribers have slowed or declined. Moreover, as described further
in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, certain of our
competitors continue to provide broadband services at higher average transmission speeds than ours or through
advanced wireless data service offerings, both of which we believe have impacted the competitiveness of certain
of our broadband offerings. The offering of our facilities-based video services in our markets has required us to
incur substantial start-up expenses in advance of marketing and selling the service. Also, our associated content
costs continue to increase and the video business has become more competitive as more options become
available to customers to access video services through new technologies. The demand for new technology has

B-20

increased the number of competitors offering services similar to ours. Price compression and new technology
from our competitors have negatively impacted the operating margins of our newer, more technologically
advanced products and services and we expect this trend to continue. Our voice revenues have been, and we
expect they will continue to be, adversely affected by access line losses and lower long-distance voice service
volumes. Intense competition and product substitution continue to drive our access line losses. For example,
many consumers are substituting cable and wireless voice services and electronic mail, texting and social
networking non-voice services for traditional voice telecommunications services. We expect that these factors
will continue to negatively impact our business. As a result of the expected loss of higher margin services
associated with access lines, we continue to offer our customers service bundling and other product promotions
to help mitigate this trend, as described below. Customer migration and price compression from competitive
pressures have not only negatively impacted our traditional wireline services revenues, but they have also
negatively impacted the operating margins of these services and we expect this trend to continue.

Operating costs also impact the operating margins of these services. These operating costs include employee

costs, marketing and advertising expenses, sales commissions, TV content costs and installation costs. We
believe increases in operating costs have generally had a greater impact on our operating margins of our newer,
more technologically advanced products and services as compared to our traditional wireline services, principally
because our newer, more technologically advanced products and services rely more heavily upon the above-listed
operating expenses. Operating costs, such as installation costs and facility costs, have also negatively impacted
the operating margins of our traditional wireline products and services, but to a lesser extent than customer
migration and price compression. Operating costs also tend to impact our traditional wireline products and
services margins to a lesser extent than our newer, more technologically advanced products and services as noted
above.

Service bundling and product promotions. We offer our customers the ability to bundle multiple products
and services. These customers can bundle broadband services with other services such as local voice, video and
long-distance. While we believe our bundled service offerings can help retain customers, they also tend to lower
our profit margins in the consumer segment due to the related discounts; and

Operating efficiencies. We continue to evaluate our segment operating structure and focus. This involves
balancing our workforce in response to our workload requirements, productivity improvements and changes in
industry, competitive, technological and regulatory conditions. We also expect our consumer segment to benefit
indirectly from enhanced efficiencies in our company-wide network operations.

Segment Revenues

Consumer segment revenues decreased by $358 million, or 6%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as

compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in our consumer segment revenues was primarily
due to lower local and long-distance voice service volumes associated with access line losses resulting from the
competitive and technological factors noted above and a decrease in the number of Prism TV customers.
Consumer segment revenues decreased by $132 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as
compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decline in consumer segment services revenues was
primarily due to declines in local and long-distance services volumes associated with access line losses resulting
from the competitive and technological factors as further described above. These declines were partially offset by
an increase in the number of Prism TV customers and various pricing initiatives for broadband, Prism TV and
other products and services, which were partially offset by a decline in broadband customers.

Segment Expenses

Consumer segment expenses decreased by $147 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as

compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in our consumer segment expenses was primarily
due to decreases in salaries and wages and employee benefits from lower headcount, external commissions and
USF surcharges from rate decreases, which were partially offset by increases in marketing and advertising
expenses. Consumer segment expenses increased by $60 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2016
as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase in our consumer segment expenses was
primarily due to increases in costs related to Prism TV (resulting from higher volume and rates), professional
fees, sales commissions, bad debt expense and network costs, which were partially offset by reductions in
salaries and wages from lower headcount and payment processing fees.

Segment Income

Consumer segment income decreased by $211 million, or 6%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as
compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 and by $192 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31,

B-22

2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decline in our consumer segment income for both
periods was primarily due to loss of customers and increases in the costs associated with Prism TV.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are

generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses. We have identified certain policies and estimates as critical to our business operations
and the understanding of our past or present results of operations related to (i) business combinations,
(ii) goodwill, customer relationships and other intangible assets; (iii) property, plant and equipment; (iv) pension
and post-retirement benefits; (v) loss contingencies and litigation reserves; (vi) Connect America Fund; and
(vii) income taxes. These policies and estimates are considered critical because they had a material impact, or
they have the potential to have a material impact, on our consolidated financial statements and because they
require us to make significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. We believe that the estimates, judgments and
assumptions made when accounting for the items described below were reasonable, based on information
available at the time they were made. However, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from
those estimates.

Business Combination

We have accounted for our acquisition of Level 3 on November 1, 2017, under the acquisition method of

accounting, whereby the tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are
recognized at their preliminary estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The portion of the purchase price in
excess of the preliminary estimated fair value of the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets
acquired represents goodwill. The preliminary estimates of fair value and resulting assignment of the purchase
price related to our acquisition of Level 3 involved significant estimates and judgments by our management. In
arriving at the preliminary fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we considered the following
generally accepted valuation approaches: the cost approach, income approach and market approach. Our
preliminary estimates also included assumptions about projected growth rates, cost of capital, effective tax rates,
tax amortization periods, technology life cycles, the regulatory and legal environment and industry and economic
trends. For additional information about our acquisition of Level 3, see Note 2—Acquisition of Level 3 to our
consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2017.

Goodwill, Customer Relationships and Other Intangible Assets

We amortize customer relationships primarily over an estimated life of 7 to 15 years, using either the

sum-of-the-years-digits or the straight-line methods, depending on the customer retention patterns for the type of
customer at the companies we acquire. We amortize capitalized software using the straight-line method over
estimated lives ranging up to 7 years, except for approximately $237 million of our capitalized software costs,
which represents costs to develop an integrated billing and customer care system which is amortized using the
straight-line method over a 20 year period. We annually review the estimated lives and methods used to amortize
our other intangible assets, primarily capitalized software. The amount of future amortization expense may differ
materially from current amounts, depending on the results of our annual reviews.

Our goodwill was derived from numerous acquisitions where the purchase price exceeded the fair value of

the net assets acquired.

We are required to reassign goodwill to reporting units each time we reorganize our internal reporting

structure which causes a change in the composition of our reporting units. We assign goodwill to the reporting
units using a relative fair value approach. We utilize the trailing twelve months earnings before interest, taxes,

B-23

depreciation and amortization as our allocation methodology as we believe that it represents a reasonable proxy
for the fair value of the operations being reorganized. The use of other fair value assignment methods could
result in materially different results. For additional information on our segments, see Note 14—Segment
Information to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2017.

We are required to assess goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently, if an event occurs
or circumstances change that would indicate an impairment may have occurred. We are required to write-down
the value of goodwill in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of
goodwill. Our reporting units are not discrete legal entities with discrete financial statements. Our assets and
liabilities are employed in and relate to the operations of our reporting units. Therefore, the equity carrying value
and future cash flows must be estimated each time a goodwill impairment analysis is performed on a reporting
unit. As a result, our assets, liabilities and cash flows are assigned to reporting units using reasonable and
consistent allocation methodologies. Certain estimates, judgments and assumptions are required to perform these
assignments. We believe these estimates, judgments and assumptions to be reasonable, but changes in any of
these can significantly affect each reporting unit’s equity carrying value and future cash flows utilized for our
goodwill impairment test. Our annual assessment date for testing goodwill impairment is October 31.

As of October 31, 2017, we assessed goodwill for impairment for our three reporting units, which we

determined to be enterprise (excluding wholesale), consumer and wholesale and determined that the estimated
fair value of our wholesale reporting unit was substantially in excess of our carrying value of equity and the
estimated fair value of our enterprise and consumer reporting units exceeded our carrying value of equity by
approximately 9.0% and 4.0%, respectively.

For additional information on our goodwill balances by segment, see Note 4—Goodwill, Customer

Relationships and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

We may be required to assess our goodwill for impairment before our next required assessment date of
October 31, 2018 under certain circumstances, including any failure to meet our forecasted future operating
results or any significant increases in our weighted average cost of capital. In addition, we cannot assure that
adverse conditions will not trigger future goodwill impairment assessments or impairment charges. A number of
factors, many of which we cannot control, could affect our financial condition, operating results and business
prospects and could cause our actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed in our
goodwill impairment assessment. These factors include, but are not limited to, (i) further weakening in the
overall economy; (ii) a significant decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization as a result of an
adverse change to our overall business operations; (iii) changes in the discount rate we use in our testing;
(iv) successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets; (v) adverse changes as a result of
regulatory or legislative actions; (vi) a significant adverse change in our legal affairs or in the overall business
climate; and (vii) recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of one or more of our
subsidiaries that are a component of our segments. For additional information, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. We will continue to monitor certain
events that impact our operations to determine if an interim assessment of goodwill impairment should be
performed prior to the next required assessment date of October 31, 2018.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment acquired in connection with our acquisitions was recorded based on its

estimated fair value as of its acquisition date, plus the estimated value of any associated legally or contractually
required asset retirement obligation. Purchased and constructed property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost,
plus the estimated value of any associated legally or contractually required asset retirement obligation. Renewals

B-24

and betterments of plant and equipment are capitalized while repairs, as well as renewals of minor items, are
charged to operating expense. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided on the straight-line
method using class or overall group rates. The group method provides for the recognition of the remaining net
investment, less anticipated net salvage value, over the remaining useful life of the assets. This method requires
the periodic revision of depreciation rates.

Normal retirements of property, plant and equipment are charged against accumulated depreciation, with no

gain or loss recognized. We depreciate such property on the straight-line method over estimated service lives
ranging from 3 to 45 years.

We perform annual internal reviews to evaluate the reasonableness of the depreciable lives for our property,

plant and equipment. Our reviews utilize models that take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear,
replacement history, assumptions about technology evolution and, in certain instances, actuarially determined
probabilities to estimate the remaining life of our asset base.

Due to rapid changes in technology and the competitive environment, determining the estimated economic
life of telecommunications plant and equipment requires a significant amount of judgment. We regularly review
data on utilization of equipment, asset retirements and salvage values to determine adjustments to our
depreciation rates. The effect of a hypothetical one year increase or decrease in the estimated remaining useful
lives of our property, plant and equipment would have decreased depreciation expense by approximately
$420 million annually or increased depreciation expense by approximately $550 million annually, respectively.

Pension and Post-retirement Benefits

We sponsor a noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan (referred to as our qualified pension
plan) for a substantial portion of our employees. In addition to this tax-qualified pension plan, we also maintain
several non-qualified pension plans for certain eligible highly compensated employees. We also maintain post-
retirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for certain eligible retirees. On
November 1, 2017, we assumed Level 3’s pension and post-retirement plans, and certain obligations associated
with these plans. Due to the insignificant impact of these plans on our consolidated financial statements, we have
excluded them from the following pension and post-retirement benefits disclosures for 2017.

In 2017, approximately 58% of the qualified pension plan’s January 1, 2017 net actuarial loss balance of
$3.134 billion was subject to amortization as a component of net periodic expense over the average remaining
service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits, which ranges from 9 to 10 years for the
plan. The other 42% of the qualified pension plan’s beginning net actuarial loss balance was treated as
indefinitely deferred during 2017. The entire beginning net actuarial loss of $137 million for the post-retirement
benefit plans was treated as indefinitely deferred during 2017.

In 2016, approximately 53% of the qualified pension plan’s January 1, 2016 net actuarial loss balance of
$2.843 billion was subject to amortization as a component of net periodic expense over the average remaining
service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits, which ranges from 9 to 10 years for the
plan. The other 47% of the qualified pension plan’s beginning net actuarial loss balance was treated as
indefinitely deferred during 2016. The entire beginning net actuarial loss of $147 million for the post-retirement
benefit plans was treated as indefinitely deferred during 2016.

In 2015, approximately 45% of the qualified pension plan’s January 1, 2015 net actuarial loss balance of
$2.740 billion was subject to amortization as a component of net periodic expense over the average remaining
service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits, which ranges from 8 to 9 years for the
plan. The other 55% of the qualified pension plan’s beginning net actuarial loss balance was treated as
indefinitely deferred during 2015. The entire beginning net actuarial loss of $277 million for the post-retirement
benefit plans was treated as indefinitely deferred during 2015.

B-25

In computing our pension and post-retirement health care and life insurance benefit obligations, our most
significant assumptions are the discount rate and mortality rates. In computing our periodic pension and post-
retirement benefit expense, our most significant assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return
on plan assets.

The discount rate for each plan is the rate at which we believe we could effectively settle the plan’s benefit

obligations as of the end of the year. We selected each plan’s discount rate based on a cash flow matching
analysis using hypothetical yield curves from U.S. corporate bonds rated high quality and projections of the
future benefit payments that constitute the projected benefit obligation for the plans. This process establishes the
uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments as is
generated by discounting each year’s benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year. The spot rates used
in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 60th to 90th percentile of U.S. high
quality bonds.

In 2016, we changed the method we use to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic

benefit expense for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. This change resulted in a decrease in the
service and interest components in 2017 and 2016. Beginning in 2016, we utilized a full yield curve approach in
connection with estimating these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the
determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows, as opposed to the single weighted-
average discount rate derived from the yield curve that we have used in the past. We believe this change more
precisely measures service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows
to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. This change did not affect the measurement of our total benefit
obligations but lowered our annual net periodic benefit cost by $122 million and $149 million in 2017 and 2016,
respectively, when compared to the pre-2016 methodology. This change was treated as a change in accounting
estimate and, accordingly, we did not adjust the amounts recorded in 2015.

Mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on historical demographic

studies by the Society of Actuaries (“SOA”). The SOA publishes new mortality rates (mortality tables and
projection scales) on a regular basis which reflect updates to projected life expectancies in North America.
Historically, we have adopted the new projection tables immediately after publication. In 2017, we adopted the
revised morality tables and projection scale released by the SOA, which decreased the projected benefit
obligation of our benefit plans by $113 million. In 2016, we adopted the revised mortality table and projection
scale released by the SOA, which decreased the projected benefit obligation of our benefit plans by $268 million.
The 2015 revised mortality table and projection scale decreased the 2015 projected benefit obligation of our
benefit plans by $379 million. The change in the projected benefit obligation of our benefit plans was recognized
as part of the net actuarial loss and is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a portion of which is
subject to amortization over the remaining estimated life of plan participants, which was approximately 9 to 10
years as of December 31, 2017.

The expected rate of return on plan assets is the long-term rate of return we expect to earn on the plans’

assets in the future, net of administrative expenses paid from plan assets. The rate of return is determined by the
strategic allocation of plan assets and the long-term risk and return forecast for each asset class. The forecasts for
each asset class are generated primarily from an analysis of the long-term expectations of various third party
investment management organizations to which we then add a factor of 50 basis points to reflect the benefit we
expect to result from our active management of the assets. The expected rate of return on plan assets is reviewed
annually and revised, as necessary, to reflect changes in the financial markets and our investment strategy.

To compute the expected return on pension and post-retirement benefit plan assets, we apply an expected
rate of return to the fair value of the pension plan assets and to the fair value of the post-retirement benefit plan
assets adjusted for contribution timing and for projected benefit payments to be made from the plan assets.
Annual market volatility for these assets (higher or lower than expected return) is reflected in the net actuarial
losses.

B-26

Changes in any of the above factors could significantly impact operating expenses in the consolidated

statements of operations and other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive
income as well as the value of the liability and accumulated other comprehensive loss of stockholders’ equity on
our consolidated balance sheets. The expected return on plan assets is reflected as a reduction to our pension and
post-retirement benefit expense. If our assumed expected rates of return for 2017 were 100 basis points lower,
our qualified pension and post-retirement benefit expenses for 2017 would have increased by $103 million. If our
assumed discount rates for 2017 were 100 basis points lower, our qualified pension and post-retirement benefit
expenses for 2017 would have increased by $63 million and our projected benefit obligation for 2017 would have
increased by approximately $1.780 billion.

Loss Contingencies and Litigation Reserves

We are involved in several material legal proceedings, as described in more detail in Note 16—

Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. We periodically assess potential losses in relation to these and
other pending or threatened tax and legal matters. For matters not related to income taxes, if a loss is considered
probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we recognize an expense for the estimated loss. To the
extent these estimates are more or less than the actual liability resulting from the resolution of these matters, our
earnings will be increased or decreased accordingly. If the differences are material, our consolidated financial
statements could be materially impacted.

For matters related to income taxes, if we determine in our judgment that the impact of an uncertain tax

position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority, then we recognize in
our financial statements a benefit for the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained. No portion of
an uncertain tax position will be recognized if we determine in our judgment that the position has less than a 50%
likelihood of being sustained. Though the validity of any tax position is a matter of tax law, the body of statutory,
regulatory and interpretive guidance on the application of the law is complex and often ambiguous. Because of
this, whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain.

Connect America Fund

In 2015, we accepted CAF funding from the FCC of approximately $500 million per year for six years to

fund the deployment of voice and broadband capable infrastructure for approximately 1.2 million rural
households and businesses (living units) in 33 states under the CAF Phase 2 high-cost support program. This
program provides a monthly high-cost subsidy similar to the support provided by the FCC’s previous cost
reimbursement programs. Although we believe that there is no specific authoritative U.S. GAAP guidance for the
treatment of government assistance, we identified three acceptable methods to account for these funds:
(1) recognize revenue when entitled to receive cash, (2) defer cash received until the living units are enabled to
receive the service at the FCC specified level, or (3) record the cash received as contra capital. After assessing
these alternatives, we have determined that we will recognize CAF Phase 2 funds each month as revenue when
we are entitled to receive the cash less a deferred amount. The amount of revenue deferred in 2017 was
approximately $94 million. We believe our recognition methodology is consistent with other companies in our
industry in the United States, but may not necessarily be consistent with companies outside the United States that
receive similar government funding, and we cannot provide assurances to this effect.

In computing the amount of revenue to recognize, we assume that we will not be able to economically
enable 100% of the required living units in every state with voice and broadband capabilities under the CAF
Phase 2 program. We defer recognition of the funds related to potential living units that we estimate we will not
enable until we can with reasonable assurance determine that we can fully meet the enablement targets. As
disclosed elsewhere herein, in some limited instances, a portion of the funds must be returned if enablement
targets are not attained. Based on estimated enablement, a hypothetical 1% decrease in our estimate of living
units we will not enable with voice and broadband capabilities under the CAF Phase 2 program would have

B-27

increased our revenue by $7 million in 2017, and a 1% increase would have decreased our revenue by
$29 million in 2017.

For additional information about the CAF Phase 2 support program, see “Business—Regulations” in Item 1

of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Income Taxes

Our provision for income taxes includes amounts for tax consequences deferred to future periods. We record

deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflecting future tax consequences attributable to tax credit
carryforwards, differences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and the tax
bases of those assets and liabilities and tax net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs. Deferred taxes are
computed using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the year in which the differences are expected to affect
taxable income. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in
earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.

The measurement of deferred taxes often involves the exercise of considerable judgment related to the

realization of tax basis. Our deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our assessment that tax positions taken in
filed tax returns and the resulting tax basis are more likely than not to be sustained if they are audited by taxing
authorities. Assessing tax rates that we expect to apply and determining the years when the temporary differences
are expected to affect taxable income requires judgment about the future apportionment of our income among the
states in which we operate. Any changes in our practices or judgments involved in the measurement of deferred
tax assets and liabilities could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations.

In connection with recording deferred income tax assets and liabilities, we establish valuation allowances
when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to amounts that we believe are more likely than not to be
realized. We evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine whether adjustments to our valuation
allowance are appropriate in light of changes in facts or circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions
with taxing authorities and developments in case law. In making this evaluation, we rely on our recent history of
pre-tax earnings. We also rely on our forecasts of future earnings and the nature and timing of future deductions
and benefits represented by the deferred tax assets, all which involve the exercise of significant judgment. At
December 31, 2017, we established a valuation allowance of $1.341 billion primarily related to foreign and state
NOLs that we acquired from Level 3, as it is more likely than not that these NOLs will expire unused. If forecasts
of future earnings and the nature and estimated timing of future deductions and benefits change in the future, we
may determine that a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets is appropriate, which could materially
impact our financial condition or results of operations. See Note 13—Income Taxes to our consolidated financial
statements in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for additional
information.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Overview of Sources and Uses of Cash

We are a holding company that is dependent on the capital resources of our subsidiaries to satisfy our parent
company liquidity requirements. Several of our significant operating subsidiaries have borrowed funds either on
a standalone basis or as part of a separate restricted group with certain of its subsidiaries or affiliates. The terms
of the instruments governing the indebtedness of these borrowers or borrowing groups may restrict our ability to
access their accumulated cash. In addition, our ability to access the liquidity of these and other subsidiaries may
be limited by tax and legal considerations and other factors.

At December 31, 2017, we held cash and cash equivalents of $551 million and we had $1.595 billion of

borrowing capacity available under the then existing terms of our revolving credit facility. We had approximately

B-28

$186 million of cash and cash equivalents outside the United States at December 31, 2017. We currently believe
we have the ability to repatriate cash and cash equivalents into the United States without paying or accruing U.S.
taxes, other than the possible payment of the Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax discussed elsewhere herein
and other limited exceptions. We do not currently intend to repatriate to the United States any of our foreign cash
and cash equivalents from operating entities outside of Latin America. We have no material restrictions on our
ability to repatriate to the United States foreign cash and cash equivalents.

Our acquisition of Level 3 on November 1, 2017, resulted in significant changes in our consolidated

financial position, our debt structure and our future cash requirements.

Our executive officers and our Board of Directors periodically review our sources and potential uses of cash

in connection with our annual budgeting process. Generally speaking, our principal funding source is cash from
operating activities, and our principal cash requirements include operating expenses, capital expenditures,
income taxes, debt repayments, dividends, periodic stock repurchases, periodic pension contributions and other
benefits payments. As discussed further below, the amount of cash we paid in 2017 for income taxes and retiree
healthcare benefits increased substantially compared to prior periods. We currently expect our cash income tax
payments will be lower in 2018 due to the utilization of the NOLs acquired in the Level 3 acquisition, and we
expect that our cash paid for retiree healthcare benefits will remain flat.

Based on our current capital allocation objectives, during 2018 we project expending approximately

$3.8 billion to $3.9 billion (excluding integration capital) of cash for capital investment in property, plant and
equipment and approximately $2.3 billion of cash for dividends on our common stock (based on the assumptions
described below under “Dividends”). At December 31, 2017, we have debt maturities of $188 million, scheduled
debt principal payments of $157 million and capital lease and other fixed payments of $98 million, each due
during 2018. Each of the expenditures is described further below.

We will continue to monitor our future sources and uses of cash, and anticipate that we will make

adjustments to our capital allocation strategies when, as and if determined by our Board of Directors. We
typically use our revolving credit facility as a source of liquidity for operating activities and our other cash
requirements.

For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Affecting Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in

Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Capital Expenditures

We incur capital expenditures on an ongoing basis in order to enhance and modernize our networks,

compete effectively in our markets, expand and improve our service offerings. We evaluate capital expenditure
projects based on a variety of factors, including expected strategic impacts (such as forecasted impact on revenue
growth, productivity, expenses, service levels and customer retention) and our expected return on investment.
The amount of capital investment is influenced by, among other things, demand for our services and products,
cash flow generated by operating activities, cash required for other purposes and regulatory considerations (such
as our CAF Phase 2 infrastructure buildout requirements). Based on current circumstances, we estimate that our
total capital expenditures for 2018 will be approximately $3.8 billion to $3.9 billion, inclusive of CAF Phase 2
related capital expenditures, but excludes integration capital.

Our capital expenditures continue to be focused on keeping the network operating efficiently and supporting
new service developments. For more information on our capital spending, see “Historical Information—Investing
Activities” below and Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Debt and Other Financing Arrangements

Subject to market conditions, we expect to continue to issue debt securities from time to time in the future to
refinance a substantial portion of our maturing debt, including issuing Qwest Corporation and Level 3 Financing,

B-29

Inc. debt securities to refinance their maturing debt to the extent feasible. The availability, interest rate and other
terms of any new borrowings will depend on the ratings assigned by credit rating agencies, among other factors.

Following the closing of our acquisition of Level 3, the rating agencies took action on the ratings of the debt

in the table below. Generally, the agencies downgraded ratings of the CenturyLink, Inc. debt from previous
levels as they indicated they intended to at the time of the announcement of the transaction. Additionally,
Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. placed such ratings on negative outlook while Fitch
Ratings placed them on stable outlook. As for the Level 3 debt, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. upgraded the
unsecured debt and affirmed the rating of the secured debt, with all ratings placed on negative outlook. Standard
and Poor’s affirmed all previous Level 3 ratings with negative outlook, and Fitch Ratings affirmed all previous
Level 3 ratings with stable outlook.

As of the date of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, the credit ratings

for the senior unsecured debt of CenturyLink, Inc., Qwest Corporation, Level 3 Parent, LLC and Level 3
Financing, Inc. were as follows:

Our credit ratings are reviewed and adjusted from time to time by the rating agencies. Any future

downgrades of the senior unsecured or secured debt ratings of us or our subsidiaries could impact our access to

Resources” in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Net Operating Loss Carryforwards

As of December 31, 2017, CenturyLink had approximately $9.1 billion of net operating loss carryforwards.
(“NOLs”), which for U.S. federal income tax purposes can be used to offset future taxable income. These NOLs
are primarily related to federal NOLs we acquired through the Level 3 acquisition on November 1, 2017, and are
subject to prior limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“Code”) and related U.S. Treasury
Department regulations. Additionally, these NOLs are subject to a current Section 382 limitation as a result of
our acquisition of Level 3. Prior to this acquisition, the amounts of our cash flows dedicated to or required for the
payment of federal taxes increased substantially in 2017. As a result of the completion of this acquisition we
expect to significantly reduce our federal cash taxes for the next several years. Additionally, we are seeking a
significant refund of federal income taxes related to 2017 that we hope to receive in the first quarter of 2018. The
amounts of our near-term future tax payments will depend upon many factors, including our future earnings and
tax circumstances and results of any corporate tax reform. Based on current laws and our current estimates of
2018 earnings, exclusive of the pending refund request noted previously, we estimate our cash income tax
liability related to 2018 will be approximately $100 million.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to use these NOL carryforwards fully. See “Risk Factors—Risks
Relating to Our Recently-Completed Acquisition of Level 3—We cannot assure you, whether, when or in what

B-30

amounts we will be able to use Level 3’s net operating loss carryforwards” in Item 1A of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Dividends

We currently expect to continue our current practice of paying quarterly cash dividends in respect of our

common stock subject to our Board of Directors’ discretion to modify or terminate this practice at any time and
for any reason without prior notice. Our current quarterly common stock dividend rate is $0.54 per share, as
approved by our Board of Directors, which we believe is a dividend rate per share which enables us to balance
our multiple objectives of managing our business, paying our fixed commitments and returning a substantial
portion of our cash to our shareholders. We paid an average of almost $294 million of dividends during each of
the first three quarters of 2017. Based on our issuance of shares in connection with the Level 3 acquisition on
November 1, 2017, we paid $572 million of dividends in the fourth quarter. Assuming continued payment during
2018 at this rate of $0.54 per share, our average total dividend paid each quarter would be approximately
$575 million to $580 million based on our current number of outstanding shares (assuming no increases or
decreases in the number of shares, except in connection with the vesting of currently outstanding equity awards).
See Risk Factors—Risks Affecting Our Business” in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2017.

Revolving Facilities and Other Debt Instruments

To substantially fund our recent acquisition of Level 3, on June 19, 2017, one of our affiliates entered into a

credit agreement (the “2017 CenturyLink Credit Agreement”) providing for $9.945 billion in senior secured
credit facilities, consisting of a new $2 billion revolving credit facility (which replaced our 2012 credit facility
upon consummation of the Level 3 acquisition) and $7.945 billion of term loan facilities, of which approximately
$6.0 billion were funded into escrow on such date, and $1.945 billion of which were funded upon the closing of
the acquisition on November 1, 2017. On November 1, 2017, CenturyLink, Inc. also, among other things,
(i) assumed all rights and obligations under the 2017 CenturyLink Credit Agreement, (ii) borrowed $400 million
under the new $2.0 billion revolving credit facility and (iii) received $6.0 billion of Term Loan B loan proceeds
from escrow. On January 29, 2018, the 2017 CenturyLink Credit Agreement was amended to increase the
borrowing capacity of the new revolving credit facility from $2.0 billion to $2.168 billion, and to increase the
borrowing capacity under one of the term loan tranches by $132 million. For additional information, see
(i) Note 5—Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, (ii) our current report on Form 8-K filed
with the SEC on June 20, 2017 and (iii) our current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 1, 2017.

On November 1, 2017, we also amended our uncommitted revolving letter of credit facility to secure the

facility and to permit us to draw up to $225 million of letters of credit thereunder. At December 31, 2017, we had
$104 million of letters of credit outstanding under this facility.

For information on the terms and conditions of other debt instruments of ours and our subsidiaries,
including financial and operating covenants, see Note 5—Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to our
consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2017.

Includes current maturities and capital lease obligations, but excludes unamortized discounts, net,
unamortized debt issuance costs and data centers benefit obligation.

(2) Actual principal and interest paid in all years may differ due to future refinancing of outstanding debt or

issuance of new debt. Interest on our floating rate debt was calculated for all years using the rates effective
at December 31, 2017. See Note 16—Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial
statements in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for
additional information regarding the future commitments for capital leases related to our colocation
operations.

(3) Future minimum payments of principal, interest and executory costs less future imputed lease income on

certain of the real estate assets associated with the data centers obligation. See Note 3—Sale of Data Centers
and Colocation Business to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

(4) We have various long-term, non-cancelable purchase commitments for advertising and promotion services,

including advertising and marketing at sports arenas and other venues and events. We also have purchase
commitments with third-party vendors for operating, installation and maintenance services for facilities. In
addition, we have service-related commitments with various vendors for data processing, technical and
software support services. Future payments under certain service contracts will vary depending on our actual
usage. In the table above, we estimated payments for these service contracts based on estimates of the level
of services we expect to receive.

(5) Reflects only the portion of total obligation that is contractual in nature. See Note 6 below.
(6) Represents the amount of tax and interest we would pay for our unrecognized tax benefits. The $96 million

is composed of unrecognized tax benefits of $40 million and related estimated interest of $56 million, which
would result in future cash payments if our tax positions were not upheld. See Note 13—Income Taxes to
our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2017 for additional information. The timing of any payments for our unrecognized tax
benefits cannot be predicted with certainty; therefore, such amount is reflected in the “2023 and thereafter”
column in the above table.

(7) The table is limited solely to contractual payment obligations and does not include:

•

•

contingent liabilities;

our open purchase orders as of December 31, 2017. These purchase orders are generally issued at fair
value, and are generally cancelable without penalty;

B-32

•

•

•

•

•

•

other long-term liabilities, such as accruals for legal matters and other taxes that are not contractual
obligations by nature. We cannot determine with any degree of reliability the years in which these
liabilities might ultimately settle;

cash funding requirements for qualified pension benefits payable to certain eligible current and future
retirees. Benefits paid by our qualified pension plan are paid through a trust. Cash funding
requirements for this trust are not included in this table as we are not able to reliably estimate required
contributions to this trust. Our funding projections are discussed further below;

certain post-retirement benefits payable to certain eligible current and future retirees. Not all of our
post-retirement benefit obligation amount is a contractual obligation and only the portion that we
believe is a contractual obligation is reported in the table. See additional information on our benefits
plans in Note 9—Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017;

contract termination fees. These fees are non-recurring payments, the timing and payment of which, if
any, is uncertain. In the ordinary course of business and to optimize our cost structure, we enter into
contracts with terms greater than one year to use the network facilities of other carriers and to purchase
other goods and services. Our contracts to use other carriers’ network facilities generally have no
minimum volume requirements and pricing is based upon volumes and usage. Assuming we terminate
these contracts in 2018, the contract termination fees would be $360 million. Under the same
assumption, we estimate that our termination fees for these contracts to purchase goods and services
would be $89 million. In the normal course of business, we do not believe payment of these fees is
likely;

service level commitments to our customers, the violation of which typically results in service credits
rather than cash payments; and

potential indemnification obligations to counterparties in certain agreements entered into in the normal
course of business. The nature and terms of these arrangements vary.

For information on debt that we expect to assume or incur in connection with consummating the Level 3

acquisition, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2017, and Note 5—Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Pension and Post-retirement Benefit Obligations

We are subject to material obligations under our existing defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement
benefit plans. At December 31, 2017, the accounting unfunded status of our qualified and non-qualified defined
benefit pension plans and qualified post-retirement benefit plans was $2.062 billion and $3.352 billion,
respectively. See Note 9—Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for additional information about our pension and
post-retirement benefit arrangements.

Benefits paid by our qualified pension plan are paid through a trust that holds all of the plan’s assets. Based

on current laws and circumstances, we do not expect any contributions to be required for our qualified pension
plan during 2018. The amount of required contributions to our qualified pension plan in 2019 and beyond will
depend on a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control, including earnings on plan investments,
prevailing interest rates, demographic experience, changes in plan benefits and changes in funding laws and
regulations. We occasionally make voluntary contributions in addition to required contributions. We made a
voluntary contribution of $100 million to the trust for our qualified pension plan during 2017. Based on current
circumstances, we currently anticipate making a voluntary contribution of $100 million to the trust for our
qualified pension plan in 2018.

B-33

Substantially all of our post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits plans are unfunded. Several
trusts hold assets that have been used to help cover the health care costs of certain retirees. As of December 31,
2017, assets in the post-retirement trusts had been substantially depleted and had a fair value of $23 million (a
portion of which was comprised of investments with restricted liquidity), which has significantly limited our
ability to continue paying benefits from the trusts; however, we plan to continue paying certain benefits through
the trusts. Benefits not paid from the trusts are expected to be paid directly by us with available cash. As
described further in Note 9—Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, aggregate benefits paid by us under these plans (net
of participant contributions and direct subsidy receipts) were $237 million, $129 million and $116 million for the
years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, while the amounts paid from the trust were
$31 million, $145 million and $163 million, respectively. For additional information on our expected future
benefits payments for our post-retirement benefit plans, please see Note 9—Employee Benefits to our
consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2017.

For 2017, our annual long-term rates of return were 6.5% and 5.0% for the pension plan trust assets and

post-retirement plans’ trust assets, respectively, based on the assets held. For 2018, our annual long-term rates of
return are 6.5% and 4.0% for the pension plan trust assets and post-retirement plans’ trust assets, respectively,
based on the assets currently held. However, actual returns could be substantially different.

Connect America Fund

As a result of accepting CAF Phase 2 support payments, we must meet certain specified infrastructure
buildout requirements in 33 states over the next several years. In order to meet these specified infrastructure
buildout requirements, we may be obligated to make substantial capital expenditures. See “Capital Expenditures”
above.

Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and see “Risk Factors—Risks
Affecting Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2017.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $730 million for the year ended December 31, 2017

as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to a negative variance in net income adjusted

B-34

for non-cash items and from negative variances in the changes in accounts payable, other current assets and
liabilities, net and other noncurrent assets and liabilities, net, which were partially offset with a positive variance
in the change in accounts receivable. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $545 million for the
year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a significant
negative variance in net income adjusted for non-cash items (attributable to higher cash taxes paid and lower
profitability), which was partially offset by a positive variance in the change in accounts payable. For additional
information about our operating results, see “Results of Operations” above.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities increased by $5.877 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 as

compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to cash paid for the acquisition of Level 3 on
November 1, 2017, which was partially offset with the cash proceeds from the May 2017 sale of our data centers
and colocation business. Net cash used in investing activities increased by $141 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 substantially due to an increase in
payments for property, plant and equipment.

Financing Activities

Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities changed by $6.876 billion for the year ended

December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to net proceeds from
issuance of new debt, which was slightly offset by an increase in dividend payments related to the issuance of
common shares, both of which were in connection with the acquisition of Level 3. Net cash used in financing
activities decreased by $783 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2015 primarily due to a reduction of common stock repurchases.

On November 1, 2017, CenturyLink, Inc. entered into a $1.575 billion senior secured term loan in exchange
for net proceeds, after deducting debt issuance costs of $28 million, and a $370 million senior secured term loan
in exchange for net proceeds, after deducting an immaterial amount of debt issuance costs.

On November 1, 2017, CenturyLink, Inc. repaid the outstanding principal amount of $319 million under its

2012 term loan.

On August 1, 2017, subsidiaries of Embarq Corporation paid at maturity the $72 million principal amount

and accrued and unpaid interest due under their 8.77% Notes.

On June 19, 2017, CenturyLink Escrow, LLC entered into a $6 billion term loan, net of an original issue

discount of 0.5%.

On June 15, 2017, CenturyLink, Inc. paid at maturity the $350 million principal and accrued and unpaid

interest due under its 5.15% Notes.

On May 9, 2017, Qwest Corporation redeemed $125 million aggregate principal amount of the remaining

$288 million of its 7.5% Notes due 2051, which resulted in an immaterial loss.

On May 4, 2017, Qwest Corporation redeemed all $500 million of its 6.5% Notes due 2017, which resulted

in an immaterial loss.

On April 27, 2017, Qwest Corporation issued $575 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% Notes due
2057 and, on May 5, 2017, issued an additional $85 million aggregate principal amount of such notes pursuant to
an over-allotment option in exchange for net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and other
expenses, of $638 million. All of the 6.75% Notes are unsecured obligations and may be redeemed by Qwest
Corporation, in whole or in part, on or after June 15, 2022, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.

B-35

On April 3, 2017, CenturyLink, Inc. paid at maturity the $500 million principal and accrued and unpaid

interest due under its 6.00% Notes.

See Note 5—Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of our

Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, for additional information on our
outstanding debt securities.

Other Matters

Recent Tax Changes

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was signed into law. The Act significantly
changes U.S. tax law. The Act reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to 21% for
all corporations, effective January 1, 2018, and makes certain changes to U.S. taxation of income earned by
foreign subsidiaries, capital expenditures and various other items.

As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, we provisionally

re-measured our net deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2017 and recognized a tax benefit of approximately
$1.1 billion in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.

The Act imposed a one-time repatriation tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Although we have

not determined a reasonable estimate of the impact of the one-time repatriation tax, we do not expect this
one-time tax to materially impact us, but we cannot provide any assurance that upon completion of the analysis
the amount will not be material.

Because of our net operating loss carryforwards, we do not expect to experience a further material

immediate reduction in the amount of cash income taxes paid by us. However, we anticipate that the provisions
of the Act may reduce our cash income taxes in future years.

Changes from our current provisional estimates described above will be reflected in our future statements of

operations and could be material. For a more detailed description of the Act and its impact on us, please see
Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Other

We have cash management arrangements with certain of our principal subsidiaries, in which substantial

portions of the subsidiaries’ cash is regularly advanced to us. Although we periodically repay these advances to
fund the subsidiaries’ cash requirements throughout the year, at any given point in time we may owe a substantial
sum to our subsidiaries under these advances, which, in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, are eliminated in consolidation and therefore not recognized on our consolidated balance sheets.

We also are involved in various legal proceedings that could substantially impact our financial position. See

Note 16—Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for the current status of such legal proceedings.

MARKET RISK

As of December 31, 2017, we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our variable rate
long-term debt obligations and fluctuations in certain foreign currencies. We seek to maintain a favorable mix of
fixed and variable rate debt in an effort to limit interest costs and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in
rates.

B-36

Management periodically reviews our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and periodically implements

strategies to manage the exposure. From time to time, we have used derivative instruments to (i) lock-in or swap
our exposure to changing variable interest rates for fixed interest rates or (ii) to swap obligations to pay fixed
interest rates for variable interest rates. As of December 31, 2017, we had no such instruments outstanding. We
have established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of
derivative instrument activities. As of December 31, 2017, we did not hold or issue derivative financial
instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

As further discussed in Note 5—Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities, on June 19, 2017, and on

November 1, 2017, we borrowed substantial sums under a credit agreement dated June 19, 2017 with various
lending institutions to provide a substantial amount of the funding for the Level 3 acquisition. As further noted in
Note 5—Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities, loans under the term loan facilities and new revolving credit
facility under the June 19, 2017 credit agreement bear interest at floating rates. A hypothetical increase in 100
basis points in LIBOR relative to this debt would decrease our annual pre-tax earnings by $131 million.

By operating internationally, we are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the foreign currencies used by our

international subsidiaries, including the British Pound, the Euro, the Brazilian Real, the Canadian Dollar, the
Japanese Yen, the Hong Kong Dollar and the Singapore Dollar, in each case as of December 31, 2017. Although
the percentages of our consolidated revenues and costs that are denominated in these currencies are immaterial,
our consolidated results of operations could be adversely impacted by volatility in exchange rates or an increase
in the number of foreign currency transactions, which substantially increased upon the consummation of our
acquisition of Level 3 discussed elsewhere herein. We use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to this
foreign currency risk, measuring the change in financial position arising from a hypothetical 10% change in the
exchange rates of these currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant. The
aggregate potential change in the fair value of financial assets resulting from a hypothetical 10% change in these
exchange rates was $178 million at December 31, 2017.

Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of exposures to

market risks. Actual values may differ materially from those disclosed by us from time to time if market
conditions vary from the assumptions used in the analyses performed. These analyses only incorporate the risk
exposures that existed at December 31, 2017.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

As of the date of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, we have no

special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off-balance sheet financing, liquidity, or market or credit
risk support and we do not engage in leasing, hedging or other similar activities that expose us to any significant
liabilities that are not (i) reflected on the face of the consolidated financial statements, (ii) disclosed in Note 16—
Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, or in the Future Contractual Obligations table included above,
or (iii) discussed under the heading “Market Risk” above.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The stockholders and board of directors
CenturyLink, Inc.:

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CenturyLink, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
Company) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive
income, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31,
2017, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three
year period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board

(United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017,
based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 28, 2018 expressed an
unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our

responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a
public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we

plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are
free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The stockholders and board of directors
CenturyLink, Inc.:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited CenturyLink Inc.’s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017,
based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board

(United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and
stockholders’ equity for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2017, and the related
notes, and our report dated February 28, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements.

The Company acquired Level 3 Communications, Inc., which was renamed Level 3 Parent, LLC during

2017, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, Level 3 Parent, LLC’s internal control over financial reporting
representing 15% of total assets (excluding goodwill and intangibles which are included within the scope of the
assessment) and 8% of total revenues included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also
excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Level 3 Parent, LLC.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial

reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a
public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we

plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting

B-39

includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect

misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

CENTURYLINK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

References in the Notes to “CenturyLink,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to CenturyLink, Inc. and its

consolidated subsidiaries, unless the content otherwise requires and except in Note 5, where such references
refer solely to CenturyLink, Inc. References in the Notes to “Level 3” refer to Level 3 Communications, Inc.
prior to our acquisition thereof and to its successor-in-interest Level 3 Parent, LLC after such acquisition, unless
the context otherwise requires.

(1) Background and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

General

We are an international facilities-based communications company engaged primarily in providing an

integrated array of services to our residential and business customers. Our communications services include local
and long-distance voice, virtual private network (“VPN”) data network, private line (including business data
services), Ethernet, information technology, wavelength, broadband, colocation and data center services,
managed services, professional and other services provided in connection with selling equipment, network
security and various other ancillary services.

On November 1, 2017, we acquired Level 3 Communications, Inc. (“Level 3”) in a cash and stock

transaction. See Note 2—Acquisition of Level 3 for additional information. On May 1, 2017, we sold our data
centers and colocation business to a consortium led by BC Partners, Inc. and Medina Capital for a combination of
cash and equity. See Note 3—Sale of Data Centers and Colocation Business for additional information.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our

subsidiaries. These subsidiaries include Level 3 on and after November 1, 2017. Intercompany amounts and
transactions with our consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated. In connection with our acquisition of
Level 3, we acquired its deconsolidated Venezuela subsidiary and due to exchange restrictions and other
conditions we have assigned no value to the assets acquired. Additionally, we have excluded this subsidiary from
our consolidated financial statements.

To simplify the overall presentation of our consolidated financial statements, we report immaterial amounts

attributable to noncontrolling interests in certain of our subsidiaries as follows: (i) income attributable to
noncontrolling interests in other income (expense), net, (ii) equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in
additional paid-in capital and (iii) cash flows attributable to noncontrolling interests in other, net financing
activities.

We reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation, including the

categorization of our revenues and our segment reporting for 2016 and 2015. See Note 14—Segment Information
for additional information. These changes had no impact on total operating revenues, total operating expenses or
net income for any period.

Changes in Estimates

In 2016, we changed the method we use to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic

benefit expense for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. This change resulted in a decrease in the
service and interest components in 2017 and 2016. Beginning in 2016, we utilized a full yield curve approach in
connection with estimating these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the
determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows, as opposed to the single weighted-

B-46

average discount rate derived from the yield curve that we have used in the past. We believe this change more
precisely measures service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows
to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. This change did not affect the measurement of our total benefit
obligations but lowered our annual net periodic benefit cost by $122 million and $149 million in 2017 and 2016,
respectively. This change was treated as a change in accounting estimate and accordingly, we did not adjust the
amounts recorded in 2015. The reduction in expense described above, net of tax, increased net income by
$75 million and $91 million, or $0.12 and $0.17 per basic and diluted common share, for the years ended
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting

principles. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We
believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions we make when accounting for specific items and matters,
including, but not limited to, investments, long-term contracts, customer retention patterns, allowance for
doubtful accounts, depreciation, amortization, asset valuations, internal labor capitalization rates, recoverability
of assets (including deferred tax assets), impairment assessments, pension, post-retirement and other post-
employment benefits, taxes, certain liabilities and other provisions and contingencies, are reasonable, based on
information available at the time they are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can materially
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and components of stockholders’ equity as of the dates of the
consolidated balance sheets, as well as the reported amounts of revenues, expenses and components of cash flows
during the periods presented in our other consolidated financial statements. We also make estimates in our
assessments of potential losses in relation to threatened or pending tax and legal matters. See Note 13—Income
Taxes and Note 16—Commitments and Contingencies for additional information.

For matters not related to income taxes, if a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably

estimated, we recognize an expense for the estimated loss. If we have the potential to recover a portion of the
estimated loss from a third party, we make a separate assessment of recoverability and reduce the estimated loss
if recovery is also deemed probable.

For matters related to income taxes, if we determine that the impact of an uncertain tax position is more
likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority, then we recognize a benefit for the
largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained. No portion of an uncertain tax position will be
recognized if the position has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Interest is recognized on the amount
of unrecognized benefit from uncertain tax positions.

For all of these and other matters, actual results could differ materially from our estimates.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue for services when the related services are provided. Recognition of certain payments
received in advance of services being provided is deferred until the service is provided. These advance payments
include activation and installation charges, which we recognize as revenue over the expected customer
relationship period, which ranges from three years to over seven years depending on the service. We also defer
costs for customer activations and installations. The deferral of customer activation and installation costs is
limited to the amount of revenue deferred on advance payments. Costs in excess of advance payments are
recorded as expense in the period such costs are incurred. Expected customer relationship periods are estimated
using historical experience. In most cases, termination fees or other fees on existing contracts that are negotiated
in conjunction with new contracts are deferred and recognized over the new contract term.

B-47

We offer bundle discounts to our customers who receive certain groupings of services. These bundle

discounts are recognized concurrently with the associated revenue and are allocated to the various services in the
bundled offering based on the estimated selling price of services included in each bundled combination.

Customer arrangements that include both equipment and services are evaluated to determine whether the

elements are separable. If the elements are deemed separable and separate earnings processes exist, the revenue
associated with the customer arrangement is allocated to each element based on the relative estimated selling
price of the separate elements. We have estimated the selling prices of each element by reference to vendor-
specific objective evidence of selling prices when the elements are sold separately. The revenue associated with
each element is then recognized as earned. For example, if we receive an advance payment when we sell
equipment and continuing service together, we immediately recognize as revenue the amount allocated to the
equipment as long as all the conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied. The portion of the advance
payment allocated to the service based upon its relative selling price is recognized ratably over the longer of the
contractual period or the expected customer relationship period.

We periodically transfer optical capacity assets on our network to other telecommunications service carriers.

These transactions are structured as indefeasible rights of use, commonly referred to as IRUs, which are the
exclusive right to use a specified amount of capacity or fiber for a specified term, typically 20 years. We account
for the cash consideration received on transfers of optical capacity assets and on all of the other elements
deliverable under an IRU, as revenue ratably over the term of the agreement. We do not recognize revenue on
any contemporaneous exchanges of our optical capacity assets for other optical capacity assets.

In connection with offering products and services provided by third-party vendors, we review the

relationship between us, the vendor and the end customer to assess whether revenue should be reported on a
gross or net basis. In assessing whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis, we consider whether
we act as a principal in the transaction, take title to the products, have risk and rewards of ownership or act as an
agent or broker.

We have service level commitments pursuant to contracts with certain of our customers. To the extent that

such service levels are not achieved or are otherwise disputed due to performance or service issues or other
service interruptions or conditions, we will estimate the amount of credits to be issued and record a reduction to
revenues, with a corresponding increase in the credit reserve.

USF Surcharges, Gross Receipts Taxes and Other Surcharges

In determining whether to include in our revenues and expenses the taxes and surcharges collected from

customers and remitted to government authorities, including USF surcharges, sales, use, value added and some
excise taxes, we assess, among other things, whether we are the primary obligor or principal taxpayer for the
taxes assessed in each jurisdiction where we do business. In jurisdictions where we determine that we are the
principal taxpayer, we record the surcharges on a gross basis and include them in our revenues and costs of
services and products. In jurisdictions where we determine that we are merely a collection agent for the
government authority, we record the taxes on a net basis and do not include them in our revenues and costs of
services and products.

Advertising Costs

Costs related to advertising are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative

expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. Our advertising expense was $218 million, $216 million
and $210 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

B-48

Legal Costs

In the normal course of our business, we incur costs to hire and retain external legal counsel to advise us on

regulatory, litigation and other matters. We expense these costs as the related services are received.

Income Taxes

We file a consolidated federal income tax return with our eligible subsidiaries. The provision for income

taxes consists of an amount for taxes currently payable, an amount for tax consequences deferred to future
periods and adjustments to our liabilities for uncertain tax positions. We record deferred income tax assets and
liabilities reflecting future tax consequences attributable to tax net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”), tax
credit carryforwards and differences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and
the tax bases of those assets and liabilities. Deferred taxes are computed using enacted tax rates expected to apply
in the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. The effect on deferred income tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment
date.

We establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts that
we believe are more likely than not to be recovered. Each quarter we evaluate the need to retain all or a portion of
the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. See Note 13—Income Taxes for additional information.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and are

not subject to significant risk from fluctuations in interest rates. As a result, the value at which cash and cash
equivalents are reported in our consolidated financial statements approximates their fair value. In evaluating
investments for classification as cash equivalents, we require that individual securities have original maturities of
ninety days or less and that individual investment funds have dollar-weighted average maturities of ninety days
or less. To preserve capital and maintain liquidity, we invest with financial institutions we deem to be of sound
financial condition and in high quality and relatively risk-free investment products. Our cash investment policy
limits the concentration of investments with specific financial institutions or among certain products and includes
criteria related to credit worthiness of any particular financial institution.

Book overdrafts occur when checks have been issued but have not been presented to our controlled

disbursement bank accounts for payment. Disbursement bank accounts allow us to delay funding of issued
checks until the checks are presented for payment. Until the issued checks are presented for payment, the book
overdrafts are included in accounts payable on our consolidated balance sheet. This activity is included in the
operating activities section in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We record accounts receivable acquired in connection with our acquisitions based on their estimated fair

value as of the applicable acquisition date. Accounts receivable are recognized based upon the amount due from
customers for the services provided or at cost for purchased and other receivables less an allowance for doubtful
accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in
our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled
accounts and other currently available evidence. We generally consider our accounts past due if they are
outstanding over 30 days. Our collection process varies by the customer segment, amount of the receivable, and
our evaluation of the customer’s credit risk. Our past due accounts are written off against our allowance for
doubtful accounts when collection is considered to be not probable. Any recoveries of accounts previously
written off are generally recognized as a reduction in bad debt expense in the period received. The carrying value
of accounts receivable net of the allowance for doubtful accounts approximates fair value.

B-49

Property, Plant and Equipment

We record property, plant and equipment acquired in connection with our acquisitions based on its

estimated fair value as of its acquisition date plus the estimated value of any associated legally or contractually
required retirement obligations. We record purchased and constructed property, plant and equipment at cost, plus
the estimated value of any associated legally or contractually required retirement obligations. The majority of our
property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line group method, but certain of our assets are
depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Under the straight-line group method,
assets dedicated to providing telecommunications services (which comprise the majority of our property, plant
and equipment) that have similar physical characteristics, use and expected useful lives are pooled for purposes
of depreciation and tracking. The equal life group procedure is used to establish each pool’s average remaining
useful life. Generally, under the straight-line group method, when an asset is sold or retired in the course of
normal business activities, the cost is deducted from property, plant and equipment and charged to accumulated
depreciation without recognition of a gain or loss. A gain or loss is recognized in our consolidated statements of
operations only if a disposal is unusual. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful
lives of the assets or the expected lease term. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
Interest is capitalized during the construction phase of network and other internal-use capital projects. Employee-
related costs for construction of network and other internal use assets are also capitalized during the construction
phase. Property, plant and equipment supplies used internally are carried at average cost, except for significant
individual items for which cost is based on specific identification.

We perform annual internal reviews to evaluate the reasonableness of the depreciable lives for our property,

plant and equipment. Our reviews utilize models that take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear,
replacement history, assumptions about technology evolution and, in certain instances, actuarially determined
probabilities to estimate the remaining useful life of our asset base. Our remaining useful life assessments
anticipate the loss in service value of assets that may precede the physical retirement. Assets shared among many
customers may lose service value as those customers leave the network. However, the asset is not retired until all
customers no longer utilize the asset and we determine there is no alternative use for the asset.

We have asset retirement obligations associated with the legally or contractually required removal of a

limited group of property, plant and equipment assets from leased properties and the disposal of certain
hazardous materials present in our owned properties. When an asset retirement obligation is identified, usually in
association with the acquisition of the asset, we record the fair value of the obligation as a liability. The fair value
of the obligation is also capitalized as property, plant and equipment and then amortized over the estimated
remaining useful life of the associated asset. Where the removal obligation is not legally binding, the net cost to
remove assets is expensed in the period in which the costs are actually incurred.

We review long-lived tangible assets for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the

carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable. For assessment purposes, long-lived assets are grouped
with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the
cash flows of other assets and liabilities, absent a material change in operations. An impairment loss is
recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.
Recoverability of the asset group to be held and used is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset
group to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If the
asset group’s carrying value is not recoverable, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the
carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. We determine fair values by using a combination of
comparable market values and discounted cash flows, as appropriate.

Goodwill, Customer Relationships and Other Intangible Assets

Intangible assets arising from business combinations, such as goodwill, customer relationships, capitalized

software, trademarks and trade names, are initially recorded at estimated fair value. We amortize customer
relationships primarily over an estimated life of 7 to 15 years, using either the sum-of-the-years-digits or the

B-50

straight-line methods, depending on the type of customer. We amortize capitalized software using the straight-
line method over estimated lives ranging up to 7 years, except for approximately $237 million of our capitalized
software costs, which represents costs to develop an integrated billing and customer care system which is
amortized using the straight-line method over a 20 year period. We amortize our other intangible assets
predominantly using the sum-of-the-years-digits method over an estimated life of 4 to 20 years. Other intangible
assets not arising from business combinations are initially recorded at cost. Where there are no legal, regulatory,
contractual or other factors that would reasonably limit the useful life of an intangible asset, we classify the
intangible asset as indefinite-lived and such intangible assets are not amortized.

Internally used software, whether purchased or developed by us, is capitalized and amortized using the
straight-line method over its estimated useful life. We have capitalized certain costs associated with software
such as costs of employees devoting time to the projects and external direct costs for materials and services.
Costs associated with software to be used for internal purposes are expensed until the point at which the project
has reached the development stage. Subsequent additions, modifications or upgrades to internal-use software are
capitalized only to the extent that they allow the software to perform a task it previously did not perform.
Software maintenance, data conversion and training costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
We review the remaining economic lives of our capitalized software annually. Capitalized software is included in
other intangible assets, net, in our consolidated balance sheets.

Our long-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, with indefinite lives are assessed for impairment
annually, or, under certain circumstances, more frequently, such as when events or changes in circumstances
indicate there may be an impairment. These assets are carried at the estimated fair value at the time of acquisition
and assets not acquired in acquisitions are recorded at historical cost. However, if their estimated fair value is less
than the carrying amount, other indefinite-lived intangible assets are reduced to their estimated fair value through
an impairment charge to our consolidated statements of operations.

We are required to assess goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently, if an event occurs
or circumstances change that would indicate an impairment may have occurred. We are required to write-down
the value of goodwill in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of
goodwill. Our reporting units are not discrete legal entities with discrete financial statements. Therefore, the
equity carrying value and future cash flows must be estimated each time a goodwill impairment assessment is
performed on a reporting unit. As a result, our assets, liabilities and cash flows are assigned to reporting units
using reasonable and consistent allocation methodologies. Certain estimates, judgments and assumptions are
required to perform these assignments. We believe these estimates, judgments and assumptions to be reasonable,
but changes in any of these can significantly affect each reporting unit’s equity carrying value and future cash
flows utilized for our goodwill impairment assessment.

We are required to reassign goodwill to reporting units each time we reorganize our internal reporting

structure which causes a change in the composition of our reporting units. Goodwill is reassigned to the reporting
units using a relative fair value approach. We utilize the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization of each reporting unit as our allocation methodology as it represents a reasonable proxy for the fair
value of the operations being reorganized.

See Note 4—Goodwill, Customer Relationships and Other Intangible Assets for additional information.

Pension and Post-Retirement Benefits

We recognize the funded status of our defined benefit and post-retirement plans as an asset or a liability on

our consolidated balance sheet. Each year’s actuarial gains or losses are a component of our other comprehensive
income (loss), which is then included in our accumulated other comprehensive loss. Pension and post-retirement
benefit expenses are recognized over the period in which the employee renders service and becomes eligible to

B-51

receive benefits. We make significant assumptions (including the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan
assets, mortality and health care trend rates) in computing the pension and post-retirement benefits expense and
obligations. See Note 9—Employee Benefits for additional information.

Foreign Currency

Our results of operations include foreign subsidiaries, which are translated from the applicable functional
currency to the United States Dollar using the average exchange rates during the reporting period, while assets
and liabilities are translated at the reporting date. We include gains or losses from foreign currency
re-measurement in other income, net in our consolidated statements of operations. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries
designate the local currency as their functional currency, and we record the translation of their assets and
liabilities into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet date as translation adjustments and include them as a component
of accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets. We consider the majority of our
investments in our foreign subsidiaries to be long-term in nature.

Common Stock

At December 31, 2017, we had 4 million unissued shares of CenturyLink, Inc. common stock reserved for

acquisitions. In addition, we had 45 million shares authorized for future issuance under our equity incentive
plans.

Preferred stock

Holders of outstanding CenturyLink, Inc. preferred stock are entitled to receive cumulative dividends,

receive preferential distributions equal to $25 per share plus unpaid dividends upon CenturyLink, Inc.‘s
liquidation and vote as a single class with the holders of common stock.

Dividends

We pay dividends out of retained earnings to the extent we have retained earnings on the date the dividend
is declared. If the dividend is in excess of our retained earnings on the declaration date, then the excess is drawn
from our additional paid-in capital.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In 2017, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-18, “Restricted Cash (a consensus of the

Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Emerging Issues Task Force)” (“ASU 2016-18”). In the first
quarter of 2017, we adopted ASU 2016-09, “Improvements to Employee Share Based Compensation” (“ASU
2016-09”) and ASU 2017-07, “Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic
Postretirement Benefit Cost” (“ASU 2017-07”). Each of these is described further below.

Restricted Cash

On November 17, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, which requires that a statement of cash flows

explain the change in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash and
restricted cash equivalents as compared to the previous presentation, which explains only the change in cash and
cash equivalents. ASU 2016-18 is effective January 1, 2018, but early adoption is permitted and requires
retrospective application of the requirements to all previous periods presented. We early adopted ASU 2016-18
in the second quarter of 2017.

B-52

Share-based Compensation

ASU 2016-09 modified the accounting and associated income tax accounting for share-based compensation
in order to reduce the cost and complexity associated with previous U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”). The primary provisions of ASU 2016-09 that affect our consolidated financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2017 are:

1. A reclassification of the income tax effect associated with the difference between the expense

recognized for share-based payments and the related tax deduction from additional paid-in capital to
income tax expense. This change was applied on a prospective basis and resulted in a $5 million
increase in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017.

2. We elected to change our accounting policy to account for forfeitures of share-based payment grants as

they occur as opposed to our previous policy of estimating the forfeitures on the grant date. The
cumulative effect of adopting this policy as of January 1, 2017 resulted in an increase of $3 million, net
of a $2 million tax effect, in accumulated deficit.

Net Periodic Pension and Postretirement Benefit Costs

ASU 2017-07 modified the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs and

requires the service cost component to be reported separately from the other components in order to provide
more useful information. Under ASU 2017-07, the service cost component of net periodic pension and
postretirement benefit costs is required to be presented in the same expense category as the related salary and
wages for the employee. The other components of the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs are
required to be recognized below operating income in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements
of operations. This change was applied on a retrospective basis to all previous periods to match the current period
presentation. This retrospective application resulted in a $2 million increase in operating income and a
corresponding increase in total other expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 and a $26 million
reduction in operating income and a corresponding decrease in total other expense, net for the year ended
December 31, 2015.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Comprehensive Income

On February 14, 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, “Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income” (“ASU 2018-02”). Under current accounting guidance, the income
tax effects for changes in income tax rates and certain other transactions are recognized in income from
continuing operations resulting in income tax effects recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income
that don’t reflect the current tax rate of the entity (“stranded tax effects”). ASU 2018-02 allows us the option to
reclassify these stranded tax effects related to the change in the federal income tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act to retained earnings.

We currently plan to adopt the provisions of ASU 2018-02 in the first quarter of 2018 and elect to reclassify
the stranded tax effects related to the Tax Cuts and Job Act from accumulated comprehensive income to retained
earnings in first quarter of 2018. We currently estimate that our retained earnings and accumulated other
comprehensive loss will increase by approximately $400 million as a result of the adoption of ASU 2018-02.

Goodwill Impairment

On January 26, 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment”

(“ASU 2017-04”). ASU 2017-04 simplifies the impairment testing for goodwill by changing the measurement for
goodwill impairment. Under current rules, we are required to compute the implied fair value of goodwill to

B-53

measure the impairment amount if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Under ASU
2017-04, the goodwill impairment charge will equal the excess of the reporting unit carrying value above fair
value, limited to the amount of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit.

We are required to adopt the provisions of ASU 2017-04 for any goodwill impairment tests, including our
required annual test, occurring after January 1, 2020, but have the option to early adopt for any impairment test
that we are required to perform. We have not determined if we will elect to early adopt the provisions of ASU
2017-04. The provisions of ASU 2017-04 would not have affected our last goodwill impairment assessment, but
no assurance can be provided that the simplified testing methodology will not affect our goodwill impairment
assessment in the future.

Income Taxes

On October 24, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards

Update (“ASU”) 2016-16, “Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory” (“ASU 2016-16”). ASU
2016-16 eliminates the current prohibition on the recognition of the income tax effects on the transfer of assets
among our subsidiaries. After adoption of this ASU, the income tax effects associated with these asset transfers,
except for the transfer of inventory, will be recognized in the period the asset is transferred versus the current
deferral and recognition upon either the sale of the asset to a third party or over the remaining useful life of the
asset.

We plan to adopt the provisions of ASU 2016-16 on January 1, 2018. The adoption of ASU 2016-16 is not

expected to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.

Financial Instruments

On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial

Instruments” (“ASU 2016-13”). The primary impact of ASU 2016-13 for us is a change in the model for the
recognition of credit losses related to our financial instruments from an incurred loss model, which recognized
credit losses only if it was probable that a loss had been incurred, to an expected loss model, which requires our
management team to estimate the total credit losses expected on the portfolio of financial instruments. We are
currently reviewing the requirements of the standard and evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial
statements.

We are required to adopt the provisions of ASU 2016-13 effective January 1, 2020, but could elect to early

adopt the provisions as of January 1, 2019. We expect to recognize the impacts of adopting ASU 2016-13
through a cumulative adjustment to (accumulated deficit) retained earnings as of the date of adoption. As of the
date of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, we have not yet determined the
date we will adopt ASU 2016-13.

Leases

On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases” (“ASU 2016-02”). The core principle of
ASU 2016-02 will require lessees to present right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on their balance sheets for
operating leases, which are currently not reflected on their balance sheets.

ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2019. Early adoption of ASU

2016-02 is permitted. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, we are required to recognize and measure leases at the
beginning of the earliest period presented in our consolidated financial statements using a modified retrospective
approach. The modified retrospective approach includes a number of optional practical expedients that we may
elect to apply.

B-54

We have completed our initial assessment of our business and system requirements and we are currently

developing and implementing a new lease accounting and administrative system to comply with the requirements
of ASU 2016-02. We plan to adopt the standard when it becomes effective for us beginning January 1, 2019 and
the adoption of the standard will result in the recognition of right of use assets and lease liabilities that have not
previously been recorded. Although we believe it is premature as of the date of our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2017 to provide any estimate of the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02, we do
expect that it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, upon the
January 1, 2019, implementation of ASU 2016-02, accounting for the failed-sale-leaseback transaction described
in Note 3—Sale of Data Centers and Colocation Business will no longer be applicable based on our facts and
circumstances, and the real estate assets and corresponding financing obligation will be derecognized from our
consolidated balance sheet.

Revenue Recognition

On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASU

2014-09”). ASU 2014-09 replaces virtually all existing generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) on
revenue recognition and replaces them with a principles-based approach for determining revenue recognition
using a new five step model. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to
depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to
which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also includes new
accounting principles related to the deferral and amortization of contract acquisition and fulfillment costs.

On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved the deferral of the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year until

January 1, 2018, which is the date we plan to adopt this standard. ASU 2014-09 may be adopted by applying the
provisions of this standard on a retrospective basis to the periods included in the financial statements or on a
modified retrospective basis which would result in the recognition of a cumulative effect of adopting ASU
2014-09 in the first quarter of 2018. We adopted the new revenue recognition standard under the modified
retrospective transition method.

The most significant judgments and impacts upon adoption of the standard include the following items:

Upon adoption, we will defer (i.e. capitalize) incremental contract acquisition costs and recognize (i.e.

amortize) them over the term of the initial contract and anticipated renewal contracts to which the costs relate.
Our deferred contract costs for our business and consumer customers have average amortization periods of
approximately 49 months and 30 months, respectively, and are subject to being monitored every period to reflect
any significant change in assumptions. In addition, we will assess our deferred contract cost asset for impairment
on a periodic basis.

Promotional bill credits, discounts and prepaid cards offered to customers as part of renewing services or

entering into a new services arrangement that are paid over time and are contingent on the customer maintaining
a service contract results in an extended service contract term with multiple performance obligations, which
impacts the allocation and timing of revenue recognition between service revenue and revenue assigned to the
customer credits. A contract asset will be recorded when services are delivered to the customer, and subsequently
recognized as a reduction to service revenue over the extended contract term.

We are in the process of implementing a new revenue accounting system, as well as, new processes and

internal controls over revenue recognition to assist us in the application of the new standard.

The cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard on January 1, 2018 is estimated to be

an increase to retained earnings of approximately $400 million to $600 million.

Most of our indefeasible right of use arrangements, including certain long-term prepaid customer capacity

arrangements, are accounted for as operating leases.

(2) Acquisition of Level 3

On November 1, 2017, CenturyLink acquired Level 3 through successive merger transactions, including a
merger of Level 3 with and into a merger subsidiary, which survived such merger as our indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary under the name of Level 3 Parent, LLC. We entered into this acquisition to, among other things,
realize certain strategic benefits, including enhanced financial and operational scale, market diversification and
an enhanced combined network. As a result of the acquisition, Level 3 shareholders received $26.50 per share in
cash and 1.4286 shares of CenturyLink common stock, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares, for each
outstanding share of Level 3 common stock they owned at closing, subject to certain limited exceptions. We
issued this consideration with respect to all of the outstanding common stock of Level 3, with the exception of
shares held by the dissenting common shareholders. Upon closing, CenturyLink shareholders owned
approximately 51% and former Level 3 shareholders owned approximately 49% of the combined company.

In addition, each outstanding Level 3 restricted stock unit award granted prior to April 1, 2014 or granted to

an outside director of Level 3 was converted into $26.50 in cash and 1.4286 shares of CenturyLink common
stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) with respect to each Level 3 share covered by such award (the
“Converted RSU Awards”). Each outstanding Level 3 restricted stock unit award granted on or after April 1,
2014 (other than those granted to outside directors of Level 3) was converted into a CenturyLink restricted stock
unit award using a conversion ratio of 2.8386 to 1 as determined in accordance with a formula set forth in the
merger agreement (“the Continuing RSU Awards”).

The preliminary estimated amount of aggregate consideration of $19.617 billion is based on:

•

•

•

•

the 517.3 million shares of CenturyLink’s common stock (including those issued in connection with the
Converted RSU Awards) issued to consummate the acquisition and the closing stock price of
CenturyLink common stock at October 31, 2017 of $18.99;

the cash consideration of $26.50 per share on the 362.1 million common shares of Level 3 issued and
outstanding as of October 31, 2017, and the cash consideration of $1 million paid on the Converted
RSUs awards;

the estimated value of $136 million the Continuing RSU Awards, which represents the
pre-combination portion of Level 3’s share-based compensation awards replaced by CenturyLink; and

the estimated liability of $60 million for the dissenting common shares issued and outstanding as of
October 31, 2017.

At closing, CenturyLink assumed Level 3’s long-term debt of approximately $10.6 billion.

The aggregate cash payments required to be paid on or about the closing date were funded with the proceeds

of $7.945 billion of term loans and $400 million of funds borrowed under our new revolving credit facility
together with other available funds, which included $1.825 billion borrowed from Level 3 Parent, LLC. For
additional information regarding CenturyLink’s financing of the Level 3 acquisition see Note 5—Long-Term
Debt and Credit Facilities.

We have recognized the assets and liabilities of Level 3 based on CenturyLink’s preliminary estimates of

the fair value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities of Level 3 as of November 1,
2017, the consummation date of the acquisition, with the excess aggregate consideration recorded as goodwill.
The final determination of the allocation of the aggregate consideration paid by CenturyLink in the combination
will be based on the fair value of such assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date with any excess aggregate
consideration to be recorded as goodwill. The estimation of such fair values and the estimation of lives of
depreciable tangible assets and amortizable intangible assets will require significant judgment. As such, we have
not completed our valuation analysis and calculations in sufficient detail necessary to arrive at the final estimates
of the fair value of Level 3’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed, along with the related allocation to
goodwill. The fair values of certain tangible assets, intangible assets, certain liabilities and residual goodwill are

B-56

the most significant areas not yet finalized and therefore are subject to change. We expect to complete our final
fair value determinations prior to the anniversary date of the acquisition. Our final fair value determinations may
be significantly different than those reflected in our consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2017.

Based solely on our preliminary estimates, the aggregate consideration exceeds the aggregate estimated fair

value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities by $10.837 billion, which we have recognized as goodwill.
The goodwill is attributable to strategic benefits, including enhanced financial and operational scale, market
diversification and leveraged combined networks that we expect to realize. None of the goodwill associated with
this acquisition is deductible for income tax purposes.

The following is our preliminary assignment of the preliminary estimated aggregate consideration:

Includes a preliminary estimated fair value of $866 million for accounts receivable, which had a gross
contractual value of $884 million on November 1, 2017. The $18 million difference between the gross
contractual value and the preliminary estimated fair value assigned represents our best estimate as of
November 1, 2017 of contractual cash flows that will not be collected.

approximately 12.0 years.

On the acquisition date, we assumed Level 3’s contingencies. For more information on our contingencies,

Acquisition-Related Expenses

We have incurred acquisition-related expenses related to our acquisition of Level 3. The table below

Level 3 incurred transaction-related expenses of $47 million on the date of acquisition. This amount is not

included in our results of operations.

References to Acquired Businesses

In the discussion that follows, we refer to the incremental business activities that we now operate as a result
of the Level 3 acquisition as “Legacy Level 3”. References to “Legacy CenturyLink”, when used to a comparison
of our consolidated results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, mean the business we operated
prior to the Level 3 acquisition.

Combined Pro Forma Operating Results (Unaudited)

For the year ended December 31, 2017, CenturyLink’s results of operations included operating revenues

(net of intercompany eliminations) attributable to Level 3 of $1.39 billion. The addition of Level 3’s post-
acquisition operations contributed a net loss of $144 million to our consolidated net income.

The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the combined results of CenturyLink as if

the Level 3 acquisition had been consummated as of January 1, 2016.

This pro forma information reflects certain adjustments to previously-reported operating results, consisting

of primarily:

•

•

•

decreased operating revenues and expenses due to the elimination of deferred revenues associated with
installation activities that were preliminarily assigned no value at the acquisition date (excluding
certain deferred revenue associated with certain long-term prepaid customer capacity arrangements,
which have been included at its current carrying value) and the elimination of transactions among
CenturyLink and Level 3 that are now subject to intercompany elimination;

increased amortization expense related to identifiable intangible assets, net of decreased depreciation
expense to reflect the preliminary fair value of property, plant and equipment;

increased interest expense resulting from (i) interest on the new debt to finance the combination and
amortization of the related debt discount and debt issuance costs, (ii) the elimination of Level 3’s
historical amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs and (iii) a reduction in interest expense
due to the accretion of an adjustment to reflect the increased preliminary fair value of the long-term
debt of Level 3 recognized on the acquisition date; and

•

the related income tax effects.

The pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the

actual results of operations had the Level 3 acquisition been consummated at January 1, 2016, nor is it
necessarily indicative of future operating results. The pro forma information excludes transaction costs incurred
by us and Level 3 during 2017 (which are further described above in this note) and does not reflect integration
costs to be incurred by us in future periods. In addition, the pro forma information does not give effect to any
potential revenue enhancements, cost synergies or other operating efficiencies that could result from the
acquisitions (other than those realized in our historical consolidated financial statements after November 1,
2017).

(3) Sale of Data Centers and Colocation Business

On May 1, 2017, we sold our data centers and colocation business to a consortium led by BC Partners, Inc.

and Medina Capital in exchange for cash and a minority stake in the limited partnership that owns the
consortium’s newly-formed global secure infrastructure company, Cyxtera Technologies (“Cyxtera”).

We received pre-tax cash proceeds of $1.8 billion, and we have valued our minority stake at $150 million,
which was based upon the total amount of equity contributions to the limited partnership on the date made. Due
to the sale and related restructuring actions we have taken regarding certain subsidiaries involved in the data
centers and colocation business, we have estimated a cumulative current tax impact relating to the sale totaling
$65 million, $18 million of which was accrued in 2016 and $47 million of which was accrued in 2017.

In connection with our sale of the data centers and colocation business to Cyxtera, we agreed to lease back

from Cyxtera a portion of the data center space to provide data hosting services to our customers. Because we
have continuing involvement in the business through our minority stake in Cyxtera’s parent, we do not meet the
requirements for a sale-leaseback transaction as described in ASC 840-40, Leases - Sale-Leaseback Transactions.
Under the failed-sale-leaseback accounting model, we are deemed under GAAP to still own certain real estate
assets sold to Cyxtera, which we must continue to reflect on our consolidated balance sheet and depreciate over
the assets’ remaining useful life. We must also treat a certain amount of the pre-tax cash proceeds from the sale
of the assets as though it were the result of a financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheet, and our
consolidated results of operations must include imputed revenue associated with the portion of the real estate
assets that we have not leased back and imputed interest expense on the financing obligation. A portion of the
rent payments required under our leaseback arrangement with Cyxtera is recognized as a reduction of the
financing obligation, resulting in lower recognized rent expense than the amounts actually paid each period. At
the end of the lease term, the remaining imputed financing obligation and the remaining net book value of the
real estate assets will be derecognized. Please see “Leases” (ASU 2016-02) in Note 1—Background for
additional information on the impact the new lease standard will have on the accounting for the failed-sale-
leaseback.

The following table reflects the assets sold to and the liabilities assumed by Cyxtera on May 1, 2017,

including the impact of failed-sale-leaseback:

After factoring in the costs to sell the data centers and colocation business, excluding the impact from the

failed-sale-leaseback accounting treatment, the sale resulted in a $20 million gain as a result of the aggregate
value of the proceeds we received exceeding the carrying value of the assets sold and liabilities assumed. Based
on the fair market values of the failed-sale-leaseback assets, the failed-sale-leaseback accounting treatment
resulted in a loss of $102 million as a result of the requirement to treat a certain amount of the pre-tax cash
proceeds from the sale of the assets as though it were the result of a financing obligation. The combined net loss
of $82 million was included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. The sale also resulted in a significant capital loss
carryforward, which was entirely offset by a valuation allowance due to our determination that we are not likely
to be able to utilize this carryforward prior to its expiration.

We evaluated our minority stake in the limited partnership and determined that we were not the primary

beneficiary of the entity. As a result, we classified our $150 million investment in the limited partnership in other
assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. In addition to our investment, we have a
receivable for $49 million from Cyxtera, classified primarily in other current assets on our consolidated balance
sheet as of December 31, 2017. We will continue to have an ongoing obligation to Cyxtera related to our lease of
data center space from them. From May 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, we paid rent to Cyxtera totaling
$80 million.

Effective November 3, 2016, which is the date we entered into the agreement to sell our data centers and

colocation business, we ceased recording depreciation of the property, plant and equipment to be sold and
amortization of the business’s intangible assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules. Otherwise, we
estimate that we would have recorded additional depreciation and amortization expense of $67 million from
January 1, 2017 through May 1, 2017.

Our goodwill was derived from numerous acquisitions where the purchase price exceeded the fair value of

the net assets acquired (including the acquisition described in Note 2—Acquisition of Level 3). At December 31,
2017, the net carrying amounts of goodwill, customer relationships and other intangibles assets included
preliminary estimates of $20.060 billion as a result of our Level 3 acquisition. As of December 31, 2017, the
preliminary estimate of the weighted average remaining useful lives of the intangible assets acquired in the
acquisition of Level 3 was approximately 12 years in total, approximately 12 years for customer relationships, 5
years for capitalized software and 5 years for trade names.

Total amortization expense for intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was

$1.226 billion, $1.225 billion and $1.353 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, the gross carrying
amount of goodwill, customer relationships, indefinite-life and other intangible assets was $52.669 billion.

We estimate that total amortization expense for intangible assets (which include preliminary estimates for

the intangible assets acquired from Level 3) for the years ending December 31, 2018 through 2022 will be as
follows:

We assess our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or, under

certain circumstances, more frequently, such as when events or changes in circumstances indicate there may be
impairment. We are required to write down the value of goodwill only when our assessment determines the
recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value. Our annual impairment assessment date for
goodwill is October 31, at which date we assessed our reporting units, which were enterprise (excluding
wholesale), consumer and wholesale. Our annual impairment assessment date for indefinite-lived intangible
assets other than goodwill is December 31.

Our reporting units are not discrete legal entities with discrete financial statements. Our assets and liabilities

are employed in and relate to the operations of multiple reporting units. For each reporting unit, we compare its
estimated fair value of equity to its carrying value of equity that we assign to the reporting unit. If the estimated
fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying value, we conclude that no impairment exists. If the
estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second calculation is required in which

B-61

the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying value of goodwill that we assigned to the reporting
unit. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value, goodwill must be written down to its
implied fair value.

At October 31, 2017, we utilized a level 3 valuation technique to estimate the fair value of our enterprise
(excluding wholesale), consumer and wholesale reporting units by considering both a market approach and a
discounted cash flow method. The market approach method includes the use of comparable multiples of publicly
traded companies whose services are comparable to ours. The discounted cash flow method is based on the
present value of projected cash flows and a terminal value, which represents the expected normalized cash flows
of the reporting units beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period. We reconciled the estimated fair
values of the reporting units to our market capitalization as of October 31, 2017 and concluded that the indicated
implied control premium of approximately 36% was reasonable based on recent transactions in the market place.
As of October 31, 2017, based on our assessment performed with respect to these reporting units as described
above, we concluded that our goodwill for our three reporting units was not impaired as of that date.

The following table shows the rollforward of goodwill assigned to our reportable segments from

December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2017.

(1) Goodwill is net of accumulated impairment losses of $1.1 billion that related to our former hosting segment

now included in our business segment.

As of December 31, 2017, the $20.197 billion of goodwill assigned to our business reportable segment has

not been allocated to our expected future reporting units ((i) medium and small business, (ii) enterprise, (iii)
international and global accounts, (iv) wholesale and indirect and (v) consumer) as we have not completed our
valuation analysis and calculation in sufficient detail necessary to allocate the goodwill to these reporting units.

During 2016, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of three companies for total consideration of

$53 million, including future deferred or contingent cash payments of $14 million, of which $49 million has been
attributed to goodwill. We have completed our valuations of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed, along with the related allocations to goodwill and intangible assets for these three acquisitions. These
acquisitions were consummated to expand the product offerings of our business segment and therefore the
goodwill has been assigned to that segment. The majority of the goodwill is attributed primarily to expected
future increases in business segment revenue from the sale of new products. The majority of the goodwill from
these acquisitions is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

None of the above-described acquisitions materially impacted the consolidated results of operations from

the dates of the acquisitions and would not materially impact pro forma results of operations.

For additional information on our segments, see Note 14—Segment Information.

We completed our qualitative assessment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill as of

December 31, 2017 and concluded it is more likely than not that our indefinite-lived intangible assets are not
impaired; thus, no impairment charge was recorded in 2017.

B-62

As of October 31, 2016 and 2015, based on our assessments performed, we concluded that our goodwill for

our then three reporting units was not impaired as of those dates.

(2) The aggregate amount outstanding on our 2017 revolving credit facility at December 31, 2017 was

$405 million with a weighted-average interest rate of 4.186%. These amounts change on a regular basis. The
aggregate amount outstanding on our 2012 credit facility and revolving line of credit borrowings at
December 31, 2016 was $370 million with weighted-average interest rate of 4.500%. As described under
“2017 CenturyLink Credit Agreement” below, we discharged and terminated our 2012 credit facility on
November 1, 2017.

(3) As a result of not meeting the sale leaseback accounting requirements, we must treat a certain amount of the

pre-tax cash proceeds from the sale of our real estate assets as though it were the result of a financing
obligation on our consolidated balance sheet. Also, the capital lease obligations that were shown as held for
sale as of December 31, 2016 are retained and revalued. Please see Note 3—Sale of Data Centers and
Colocation Business for additional information on our most current estimate of the financing obligation.

Debt of CenturyLink, Inc. and its Subsidiaries

At December 31, 2017, most of our outstanding consolidated debt had been incurred by CenturyLink, Inc.
or one of the following four other primary borrowers or “borrowing groups,” each of which has borrowed funds
either on a standalone basis or as part of a separate restricted group with certain of its subsidiaries:

• Qwest Corporation;

• Qwest Capital Funding, Inc. (including its parent guarantor, Qwest Communications International

Inc.);

• Embarq Corporation; and

• Level 3 Parent, LLC (including its finance subsidiary, Level 3 Financing, Inc.).

Each of these borrowers or borrowing groups has entered into one or more credit agreements with certain
financial institutions or other institutional lenders, or issued senior notes. Certain of these debt instruments are
described further below.

Level 3 Long-Term Debt Acquired

As a result of the acquisition of Level 3 on November 1, 2017, Level 3’s pre-existing debt obligations,

which consisted of senior notes and a term loan issued by Level 3 Parent, LLC and Level 3 Financing, Inc., are
now included in our consolidated debt balances. Level 3 Financing, Inc.’s Tranche B 2024 Term Loan is further
described below under “Term Loans and Certain Other Debt of Subsidiaries”. On the acquisition date, Level 3’s
debt securities had (i) stated principal balances totaling $10.526 billion, (ii) fixed contractual interest rates on
senior notes ranging from 5.125% to 6.125% (with a weighted average of 5.47%) and a floating interest rate on
the term loan and (iii) maturities ranging from 2021 to 2026. In accounting for the Level 3 acquisition, we
recorded Level 3’s debt securities at their estimated fair values, which totaled $10.716 billion as of November 1,
2017. In addition, we assumed Level 3’s capital lease obligations of $179 million. Our acquisition date fair value
estimates were based primarily on quoted market prices where available or, if not available, based on discounted
future cash flows using current market interest rates. The amount by which the fair value of Level 3 debt
securities exceeded their stated principal balances on the acquisition date of $190 million is being recognized as a
reduction to interest expense over the remaining terms of the debt.

2017 CenturyLink Credit Agreement

As further described in Note 2—Acquisition of Level 3, CenturyLink, Inc. completed its acquisition of

Level 3 on November 1, 2017. To finance a substantial portion of its acquisition of Level 3, on June 19, 2017,
CenturyLink, Inc. caused its wholly-owned subsidiary, CenturyLink Escrow, LLC (the “Escrow Borrower”), to
enter into a credit agreement (the “2017 CenturyLink Credit Agreement”) with, among others, Bank of America,

B-64

N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, initially providing for $9.945 billion in senior secured credit
facilities (the “2017 Senior Secured Credit Facilities”). These facilities consist of the following:

•

•

•

•

a $2 billion revolving credit facility (“2017 Revolving Credit Facility”), which originally had 18
lenders, each with allocations ranging from $36.4 million to $167.8 million, which we initially drew
upon on November 1, 2017;

a $1.575 billion senior secured Term Loan A credit facility, which originally had 17 lenders, each with
commitments ranging from $28.6 million to $132.2 million, which we drew in full on November 1,
2017;

a $370 million senior secured Term Loan A-1 credit facility with CoBank, ACB, which we drew in full
on November 1, 2017; and

a $6 billion senior secured Term Loan “B” credit facility, which we fully pre-funded the proceeds, net
of a discount, into escrow on June 19, 2017 and released to us on November 1, 2017.

Loans under the Term Loan A and A-1 facilities and the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a
rate equal to, at our option, the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or the alternative base rate (each as
defined in the 2017 CenturyLink Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin between 2.25% to 3.00% per
annum for LIBOR loans and 1.25% to 2.00% per annum for alternative base rate loans, depending on our then
current total leverage ratio. Borrowings under the Term Loan B facility bore interest at 1.375% per annum
through July 18, 2017 and at 2.75% per annum thereafter through November 1, 2017. Subsequent to November 1,
2017, borrowings under the Term Loan B facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.75% per annum. Loans under
each of the term loan facilities require certain specified quarterly amortization payments and certain specified
mandatory prepayments in connection with certain asset sales and debt issuances and out of excess cash flow,
among other things, subject in each case to certain significant exceptions.

CenturyLink, Inc. used the proceeds of the borrowings under the 2017 Senior Secured Credit Facilities,

together with other available funds (including $1.825 billion borrowed from Level 3), (i) to fund the cash portion
of the consideration and transaction costs payable in connection with the Level 3 acquisition and (ii) to repay all
indebtedness outstanding under its 2012 term loan. The 2017 Revolving Credit Facility and borrowings under the
Term Loan A and A-1 facilities will mature on November 1, 2022. Borrowings under the Term Loan B facility
will mature on January 31, 2025.

By virtue of merging the Escrow Borrower into CenturyLink, Inc. on November 1, 2017, CenturyLink, Inc.
assumed all rights and obligations under the 2017 CenturyLink Credit Agreement, including the right to borrow
funds under the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility on the terms and conditions specified in the 2017 CenturyLink
Credit Agreement.

All of CenturyLink, Inc.‘s obligations under the 2017 Senior Secured Credit Facilities are guaranteed by
certain of its subsidiaries. The guarantees by certain of those guarantors are secured by a first priority security
interest in substantially all assets (including certain subsidiaries stock) directly owned by them, subject to certain
exceptions and limitations.

The 2017 Revolving Credit Facility replaced CenturyLink, Inc.‘s 2012 revolving credit facility. A portion of
the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility in an amount not to exceed $100 million is available for swingline loans, and
a portion in an amount not to exceed $400 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit. In addition, on
November 1, 2017, CenturyLink, Inc. discharged its 2012 term loan scheduled to mature in 2019 and entered into
Term Loan A-1 with the same lender.

CenturyLink, Inc. is permitted under the 2017 CenturyLink Credit Agreement to request certain incremental

borrowings subject to the satisfaction of various conditions and to certain other limitations. Any incremental
borrowings would be subject to the same terms and conditions under the 2017 CenturyLink Credit Agreement.

Term Loans and Certain Other Debt of Subsidiaries

Qwest Corporation

In 2015, Qwest Corporation entered into a term loan in the amount of $100 million with CoBank, ACB. The

outstanding unpaid principal amount of this term loan plus any accrued and unpaid interest is due on
February 20, 2025. Interest is paid monthly based upon either the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or
the base rate (as defined in the credit agreement) plus an applicable margin between 1.50% to 2.50% per annum
for LIBOR loans and 0.50% to 1.50% per annum for base rate loans depending on Qwest Corporation’s then
current senior unsecured long-term debt rating. At both December 31, 2017 and 2016, the outstanding principal
balance on this term loan was $100 million.

Level 3 Financing, Inc.

At November 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017, Level 3 Financing, Inc. owed $4.611 billion under the

Tranche B 2024 Term Loan, which matures on February 22, 2024. The Tranche B 2024 Term Loan carries an
interest rate, in the case of base rate borrowings, equal to (i) the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds
Effective Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points (with all such terms and calculations as
defined or further specified in the applicable credit agreement) plus (ii) 1.25% per annum. Any Eurodollar
borrowings under the Tranche B 2024 Term Loan bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.25% per annum.

The Tranche B 2024 Term Loan requires certain specified mandatory prepayments in connection with

certain asset sales and other transactions, subject to certain significant exceptions. The obligations of Level 3
Financing, Inc. under the Tranche B 2024 Term Loan are, subject to certain exceptions, secured by certain assets
of Level 3 Parent, LLC and, subject to pending regulatory approvals, certain of its material domestic
telecommunication subsidiaries. Also, Level 3 Parent, LLC has guaranteed and, upon receipt of pending
regulatory approvals, certain of its subsidiaries will guarantee the obligations of Level 3 Financing, Inc. under the
Tranche B 2024 Term Loan. Subject to the receipt of pending regulatory approvals, Level 3 Communications,
LLC and its material domestic subsidiaries will guarantee and, subject to certain exceptions, will pledge certain
of their assets to secure the obligations of Level 3 Financing, Inc. under the Tranche B 2024 Term Loan.

Embarq Subsidiaries

At December 31, 2017, two of our Embarq subsidiaries had outstanding first mortgage bonds. Each issue of

these first mortgage bonds is secured by substantially all of the property, plant and equipment of the issuing
subsidiary.

Revolving Letters of Credit

CenturyLink, Inc. maintains an uncommitted revolving letter of credit facility separate from the letter of
credit facility included in the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility noted above. On November 1, 2017, this facility
was amended to increase its size from $160 million to $225 million and to provide the lender with credit
enhancements in the form of secured guarantees issued by certain CenturyLink subsidiaries. As of December 31,
2017 and 2016, CenturyLink, Inc.’s outstanding letters of credit under this credit facility totaled $104 million and
$105 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2017, Level 3 Parent, LLC had outstanding letters of credit or other similar obligations
of approximately $36 million of which $30 million is collateralized by cash that is reflected on the consolidated
balance sheets in restricted cash and securities.

Senior Notes

CenturyLink, Inc., Level 3 Financing, Inc., Level 3 Parent, LLC, Qwest Corporation, Qwest Capital

Funding, Inc. and Embarq Corporation have each issued unsecured senior notes. All of these notes carry fixed

B-66

interest rates and all principal is due on the notes’ respective maturity dates, which rates and maturity dates are
summarized in the table above. The senior notes issued by Level 3 Financing, Inc. are guaranteed by its parent,
Level 3 Parent, LLC and another of its affiliates. The senior notes issued by Qwest Capital Funding, Inc. are
guaranteed by its parent, Qwest Communications International Inc. Except for a limited number of senior notes
issued by Qwest Corporation, the issuer generally can redeem the notes, at its option, in whole or in part,
(i) pursuant to a fixed schedule of pre-established redemption prices, (ii) pursuant to a “make whole” redemption
price or (iii) under certain other specified limited conditions. Under certain circumstances in connection with a
“change of control” of CenturyLink, Inc., it will be required to make an offer to repurchase each series of these
senior notes (other than two of its older series of notes) at a price of 101% of the principal amount redeemed,
plus accrued and unpaid interest. Also, under certain circumstances in connection with a “change of control” of
Level 3 Parent, LLC, it, as well as Level 3 Financing, Inc., will be required to make an offer to repurchase each
series of its outstanding senior notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued and
unpaid interest.

New Issuances

2017
As described above under “2017 CenturyLink Credit Agreement”, on June 19, 2017, CenturyLink, Inc.

caused one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries to enter into the 2017 CenturyLink Credit Agreement initially

in part, at CenturyLink, Inc.‘s option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount
of the Notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal
and interest on the Notes to be redeemed, discounted to the redemption date in the manner described in the Notes,
plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. In addition, at any time on or prior to April 1, 2019,
CenturyLink, Inc. may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes at a redemption price of
107.5% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, with the net
proceeds of certain equity offerings. Under certain circumstances, CenturyLink, Inc. will be required to make an
offer to repurchase the Notes at a price of 101% of the aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest to the repurchase date.

associated real estate assets. Also, the aggregate maturities of long-term debt do not include future imputed
lease income of $173 million attributable to the accounting for certain of the real estate assets under the
failed-sale-leaseback. See Note 3—Sale of Data Centers and Colocation Business for additional
information.

(2) Actual principal paid in any year may differ due to the possible future refinancing of outstanding debt or the

issuance of new debt. The projected amounts in the table also exclude any impacts from any further
acquisitions.

Covenants

CenturyLink, Inc.

With respect to the Term Loan A and A-1 facilities and the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility, the 2017

CenturyLink Credit Agreement requires us to maintain (i) a maximum total leverage ratio of not more than 5.00
to 1.00 between the closing date of the Level 3 acquisition and the second anniversary thereof and 4.75 to 1.00
thereafter and (ii) a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 2.00 to 1.00, with such ratios being
determined and calculated in the manner described in the 2017 CenturyLink Credit Agreement.

The 2017 Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain various representations and warranties and extensive

affirmative and negative covenants. Such covenants include, among other things and subject to certain significant
exceptions, restrictions on our ability to declare or pay dividends, repurchase stock, repay certain other
indebtedness, create liens, incur additional indebtedness, make investments, engage in transactions with its
affiliates, dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with any other person.

B-69

The senior notes of CenturyLink, Inc. were issued under an indenture dated March 31, 1994. This indenture

restricts our ability to (i) incur, issue or create liens upon the property of CenturyLink, Inc. and (ii) consolidate
with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to any other party. The indenture does
not contain any provisions that are impacted by our credit ratings or that restrict the issuance of new securities in
the event of a material adverse change to us. However, as indicated above under “Senior Notes”, CenturyLink,
Inc. will be required to offer to purchase certain of its long-term debt securities issued under this indenture under
certain circumstances in connection with a “change of control” of CenturyLink, Inc.

Level 3 Companies

The term loan and senior notes of Level 3 Parent, LLC and Level 3 Financing, Inc. contain extensive

affirmative and negative covenants. Such covenants include, among other things and subject to certain significant
exceptions, restrictions on their ability to declare or pay dividends, repay certain other indebtedness, create liens,
incur additional indebtedness, make investments, engage in transactions with their affiliates, dispose of assets
and merge or consolidate with any other person. Also, as indicated above under “Senior Notes”, Level 3 Parent,
LLC, as well as Level 3 Financing, Inc., will be required to offer to purchase certain of its long-term debt
securities under certain circumstances in connection with a “change of control” of Level 3 Parent, LLC.

Qwest Companies

Under its term loan, Qwest Corporation must maintain a debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes,

depreciation and amortization, as defined in such term loan) ratio of not more than 2.85:1.0, as of the last day of
each fiscal quarter for the four quarters then ended. The term loan also contains a negative pledge covenant,
which generally requires Qwest Corporation to secure equally and ratably any advances under the term loan if it
pledges assets or permit liens on its property for the benefit of other debtholders.

The senior notes of Qwest Corporation were issued under indentures dated April 15, 1990 and October 15,

1999. These indentures contain restrictions on the incurrence of liens and the consummation of certain
transactions substantially similar to the above-described covenants in CenturyLink, Inc.‘s March 31, 1994
indenture (but contain no mandatory repurchase provisions). The senior notes of Qwest Capital Funding, Inc.
were issued under an indenture dated June 29, 1998 containing terms substantially similar to those set forth in
Qwest Corporation’s indentures.

Embarq

Embarq’s senior note was issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of May 17, 2006. While Embarq is

generally prohibited from creating liens on its property unless its senior notes are secured equally and ratably,
Embarq can create liens on its property without equally and ratably securing its senior notes so long as the sum of
all indebtedness so secured does not exceed 15% of Embarq’s consolidated net tangible assets. The indenture
also contains restrictions on the consummation of certain transactions substantially similar to CenturyLink, Inc.’s
above-described covenants (but without mandatory repurchase provision), as well as certain customary covenants
to maintain properties and pay all taxes and lawful claims.

Impact of Covenants

The debt covenants applicable to CenturyLink, Inc. and its subsidiaries could materially adversely affect
their ability to operate or expand their respective businesses, to pursue strategic transactions, or to otherwise
pursue their plans and strategies. The covenants of the Level 3 companies may significantly restrict the ability of
CenturyLink, Inc. to receive cash from the Level 3 companies, to distribute cash from the Level 3 companies to
other of CenturyLink, Inc.’s affiliated entities, or to enter into other transactions among CenturyLink, Inc.’s
wholly-owned entities.

B-70

Certain of the debt instruments of CenturyLink, Inc. and its subsidiaries contain cross payment default or

cross acceleration provisions. When present, these provisions could have a wider impact on liquidity than might
otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument.

The ability of CenturyLink, Inc. and its subsidiaries to comply with the financial covenants in their

respective debt instruments could be adversely impacted by a wide variety of events, including unforeseen
contingencies, many of which are beyond their control.

Compliance

At December 31, 2017, CenturyLink, Inc. believes it and its subsidiaries were in compliance with the

provisions and covenants contained in their respective material debt agreements.

Guarantees

CenturyLink, Inc. does not guarantee the debt of any unaffiliated parties, but, as noted above, certain of its
largest subsidiaries guarantee (i) its debt outstanding under the 2017 CenturyLink Credit Agreement and (ii) the
outstanding term loans or senior notes issued by certain other subsidiaries. As further noted above, several of the
subsidiaries guaranteeing the 2017 CenturyLink Credit Agreement have pledged substantially all of their assets
to secure their respective guarantees.

Subsequent Events

On January 21, 2018, a subsidiary of Embarq Corporation redeemed all $13 million of its 8.77% Notes due

2019, which resulted in an immaterial loss.

On January 29, 2018, the 2017 CenturyLink Credit Agreement was amended to:

• Add a lender to the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility and to increase CenturyLink, Inc.’s borrowing

capacity thereunder to approximately $2.168 billion; and

• Add a lender to the Term Loan A credit facility and to increase CenturyLink, Inc.’s borrowing capacity

thereunder to approximately $1.707 billion.

In connection with this amendment, the new lender provided approximately $132 million of Term Loan A
loan proceeds, which CenturyLink used, together with available cash, to reduce its borrowings under the 2017
Revolving Credit Facility.

We recorded depreciation expense of $2.710 billion, $2.691 billion and $2.836 billion for the years ended

December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Asset Retirement Obligations

At December 31, 2017, our asset retirement obligations balance was primarily related to estimated future

costs of removing equipment from leased properties and estimated future costs of properly disposing of asbestos
and other hazardous materials upon remodeling or demolishing buildings. Asset retirement obligations are
included in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

B-72

As of the Level 3 acquisition date, we recorded liabilities to reflect our preliminary estimates of fair values
of Level 3’s asset retirement obligations. Our preliminary fair value estimates were determined using discounted
cash flow method.

We revised our estimates for the cost of removal of network equipment, asbestos remediation, and other

obligations by $8 million and $21 million, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2015, respectively. These
revisions resulted in a reduction of the asset retirement obligation and offsetting reduction to gross property,
plant and equipment, and revisions to assets specifically identified are recorded as a reduction to accretion
expense. We did not revise our estimates for the cost of removal of network equipment, asbestos remediation,
and other obligations during 2016.

(8) Severance and Leased Real Estate

Periodically, we reduce our workforce and accrue liabilities for the related severance costs. These workforce

reductions result primarily from the progression or completion of our post-acquisition integration plans,
increased competitive pressures, cost reduction initiatives, process improvements through automation and
reduced workload demands due to the loss of customers purchasing certain services.

We report severance liabilities within accrued expenses and other liabilities—salaries and benefits in our

consolidated balance sheets and report severance expenses in selling, general and administrative expenses in our
consolidated statements of operations. As described in Note 14—Segment Information, we do not allocate these
severance expenses to our segments.

We have recognized liabilities to reflect our estimates of the fair values of the existing lease obligations for
real estate which we have ceased using, net of estimated sublease rentals. As of the Level 3 acquisition date, we
recorded liabilities to reflect our preliminary estimates of the fair values of the existing lease obligations for real
estate for which we had ceased using, net of estimated sublease rentals. Our fair value estimates were determined
using discounted cash flow methods. We recognize expense to reflect accretion of the discounted liabilities and
periodically we adjust the expense when our actual subleasing experience differs from our initial estimates. We
report the current portion of liabilities for ceased-use real estate leases in accrued expenses and other liabilities-
other and report the noncurrent portion in deferred credits and other liabilities-other in our consolidated balance
sheets. We report the related expenses in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated
statements of operations. At December 31, 2017, the current and noncurrent portions of our leased real estate
accrual were $11 million and $53 million, respectively. The remaining lease terms range from 0.16 years to 7.9
years, with a weighted average of 6.7 years.

(9) Employee Benefits
Pension, Post-Retirement and Other Post-Employment Benefits

We sponsor various defined benefit pension plans (qualified and non-qualified) which, in the aggregate,

cover a substantial portion of our employees including legacy CenturyLink, legacy Qwest Communications
International, Inc. (“Qwest”) and legacy Embarq employees. On December 31, 2015, we merged our existing
qualified pension plans, which included merging the Qwest Pension Plan and Embarq Retirement Pension Plan
into the CenturyLink Retirement Plan. The CenturyLink Retirement Plan was renamed the CenturyLink
Combined Pension Plan (“Combined Plan”). Pension benefits for participants of the new Combined Plan who are
represented by a collective bargaining agreement are based on negotiated schedules. All other participants’
pension benefits are based on each individual participant’s years of service and compensation. We also maintain
non-qualified pension plans for certain current and former highly compensated employees. We maintain post-
retirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for certain eligible retirees. We also
provide other post-employment benefits for certain eligible former employees. We use a December 31
measurement date for all our plans.

Pension Benefits

In connection with the acquisition of Level 3 Communications, Inc. on November 1, 2017, we assumed

defined benefit pension plans sponsored by various Level 3 companies for their employees. Based on a valuation
analysis, we recognized a $20 million liability on November 1, 2017 for the unfunded status of the Level 3
pension plans, reflecting projected benefit obligations of 167 million, in excess of the $147 million fair value of
plan assets.

Current funding laws require a company with a pension shortfall to fund the annual cost of benefits earned

in addition to a seven-year amortization of the shortfall. Our funding policy for our Combined Plan is to make
contributions with the objective of accumulating sufficient assets to pay all qualified pension benefits when due
under the terms of the plan. The accounting unfunded status of our qualified pension plan was $2.004 billion and
$2.352 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

We made a voluntary cash contribution to our qualified pension plan of $100 million in both 2017 and 2016,
and paid $5 million and $7 million of benefits directly to participants of our non-qualified pension plans in 2017
and 2016, respectively. Based on current laws and circumstances, we are not required to make any contributions
to our qualified pension plan in 2018, but we currently expect to make a voluntary contribution of $100 million
to the trust for our qualified pension plan in 2018. We estimate that in 2018 we will pay $5 million of benefits
directly to participants of our non-qualified pension plans.

B-74

As mentioned above, we assumed in the Level 3 acquisition certain contributory and non-contributory

employee pension plans, both qualified and non-qualified plans (the “Level 3 Pensions”). At December 31, 2017,
the fair value of the Level 3 Pensions’ plan assets was $147 million, and the associated benefit obligation was
$167 million. We recognized the unfunded status of Level 3’s pension plans of $20 million on our consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2017, and the net periodic benefit expense of less than $1 million for the period
November 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017, in our consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31,
2017. Due to the insignificant amount of these pension plans, we have predominantly excluded them from the
remaining employee benefit disclosures in this Note.

Post-Retirement Benefits

In connection with our acquisition of Level 3 Communications, Inc. on November 1, 2017, we assumed
post-retirement benefit plans sponsored by Level 3 Communications, L.L.C. and Continental Level 3, Inc. for
certain of its current and former employees. Based on a valuation analysis, we recognized less than $1 million in
liability for the unfunded status of Level 3’s post-retirement benefit plans.

Our post-retirement benefit plans provide post-retirement benefits to qualified retirees and allow (i) eligible

employees retiring before certain dates to receive benefits at no or reduced cost and (ii) eligible employees
retiring after certain dates to receive benefits on a shared cost basis. The post-retirement benefits not paid by the
trusts are funded by us and we expect to continue funding these post-retirement obligations as benefits are paid.
The accounting unfunded status of our qualified post-retirement benefit plan was $3.352 billion and
$3.360 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Assets in the post-retirement trusts have been substantially depleted as of December 31, 2016; however we
will continue to pay certain post-retirement benefits through the trusts. No contributions were made to the post-
retirement trusts in 2017 and 2016. Benefits not paid from the trusts are expected to be paid directly by us with
available cash. In 2017, we paid $237 million of post-retirement benefits, net of participant contributions and
direct subsidies. In 2018, we expect to pay $283 million of post-retirement benefits, net of participant
contributions and direct subsidies. The increase in anticipated post-retirement benefit payments is the result of
increased utilization coupled with a continued rise in the cost of care.

We expect our health care cost trend rate to range from 5.0% to 6.5% in 2018, 5.0% to 7.0% in 2019, 5.0%

to 6.5% in 2020 and grading to 4.50% by 2025. Our post-retirement benefit cost, for certain eligible legacy
Qwest retirees and certain eligible legacy CenturyLink retirees, is capped at a set dollar amount. Therefore, those
health care benefit obligations are not subject to increasing health care trends after the effective date of the caps.

As mentioned above, we assumed in the Level 3 acquisition certain post-retirement plans. Though largely
unfunded, these post-retirement plans, in the aggregate, are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.
Due to the insignificant amount of these post-retirement plans, we have predominantly excluded them from the
remaining employee benefit disclosures in this Note.

A change of 100 basis points in the assumed initial health care cost trend rate would have had the following

effects in 2017:

Net Periodic Benefit Expense

In 2016, we changed the method we use to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic

benefit expense for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. This change resulted in a decrease in the
service and interest components in 2017 and 2016. Beginning in 2016, we utilized a full yield curve approach in
connection with estimating these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the
determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows, as opposed to the single weighted-
average discount rate derived from the yield curve that we have used in the past. We believe this change more
precisely measures service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows
to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. This change did not affect the measurement of our total benefit
obligations but lowered our annual net periodic benefit cost by $122 million and $149 million in 2017 and 2016,
respectively, when compared to pre-2016 methodology. This change was treated as a change in accounting
estimate and accordingly, we did not adjust the amounts recorded in 2015.

The actuarial assumptions used to compute the net periodic benefit expense for our qualified pension,

non-qualified pension and post-retirement benefit plans are based upon information available as of the beginning
of the year, as presented in the following table.

We report service costs for our qualified pension, non-qualified pension and post-retirement benefit plans in

cost of services and products and selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of
operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Additionally, a portion of the service cost is
also allocated to certain assets under construction, which are capitalized and reflected as part of property, plant
and equipment in our consolidated balance sheets. The remaining components of net periodic benefit expense
(income) are reported in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations. In 2016, we
announced plans to reduce our workforce, initially through voluntary severance packages and the balance
through involuntary reductions, as a result we recognized a one-time charge of $16 million for special
termination benefit enhancements paid to certain eligible employees upon voluntary retirement.

Benefit Obligations

The actuarial assumptions used to compute the funded status for the plans are based upon information

available as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 and are as follows:

In 2017, 2016 and 2015, we adopted the revised mortality tables and projection scales released by the

Society of Actuaries (“SOA”), which decreased the projected benefit obligation of our benefit plans by
$113 million, $268 million and $379 million, respectively. The change in the projected benefit obligation of our
benefit plans was recognized as part of the net actuarial loss and is included in accumulated other comprehensive
loss, a portion of which is subject to amortization over the remaining estimated life of plan participants, which
was approximately 9 to 10 years as of December 31, 2017.

The following tables summarize the change in the benefit obligations for the pension and post-retirement

benefit plans:

Our aggregate benefit obligation as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $16.497 billion,

$16.714 billion and $16.916 billion, respectively.

Plan Assets

We maintain plan assets for our qualified pension plan and certain post-retirement benefit plans. The

qualified pension plan’s assets are used for the payment of pension benefits and certain eligible plan expenses.
The post-retirement benefit plan’s assets are used to pay health care benefits and premiums on behalf of eligible
retirees and to pay certain eligible plan expenses. As discussed further above, the liquid plan assets in our post-
retirement trust have been substantially depleted as of December 31, 2017. The expected rate of return on plan
assets is the long-term rate of return we expect to earn on the plans’ assets, net of administrative expenses paid

B-78

from plan assets. The rate of return is determined by the strategic allocation of plan assets and the long-term risk
and return forecast for each asset class. The forecasts for each asset class are generated primarily from an
analysis of the long-term expectations of various third party investment management organizations. The expected
rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually and revised, as necessary, to reflect changes in the financial
markets and our investment strategy.

The following tables summarize the change in the fair value of plan assets for the pension and post-

retirement benefit plans:

Pension Plans: Our investment objective for the qualified pension plan assets is to achieve an attractive

risk-adjusted return over time that will provide for the payment of benefits and minimize the risk of large losses.
Our pension plan investment strategy is designed to meet this objective by broadly diversifying plan assets across
numerous strategies with differing expected returns, volatilities and correlations. The pension plan assets have
target allocations of 45% to interest rate sensitive investments and 55% to investments designed to provide
higher expected returns than the interest rate sensitive investments. Interest rate sensitive investments include
30% of plan assets targeted primarily to long-duration investment grade bonds, 10% targeted to high yield and
emerging market bonds and 5% targeted to diversified strategies, which primarily have exposures to global
bonds, as well as some exposures to global stocks and commodities. Assets expected to provide higher returns
than the interest rate sensitive assets include broadly diversified equity investments with targets of approximately
15% to U.S. equity markets and 15% to non-U.S. developed and emerging markets. Approximately 7% is
targeted to broadly diversified multi-asset class strategies that have the flexibility to adjust exposures to different
asset classes. Approximately 10% is allocated to private markets investments including funds primarily invested
in private equity, private debt and hedge funds. Real estate investments are targeted at 8% of plan assets. At the
beginning of 2018, our expected annual long-term rate of return on pension assets before consideration of
administrative expenses is assumed to be 7.0%. However, projected increases in PBGC (Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation) premium rates have now become large enough to reduce the annual long-term expected
return net of administrative expenses to 6.5%.

Our non-qualified pension plans are not funded. We pay benefits directly to the participants of these plans.

B-79

Post-Retirement Benefit Plans: Our investment objective for the post-retirement benefit plans’ assets is to

achieve an attractive risk-adjusted return and minimize the risk of large losses over the expected life of the assets.
At the beginning of 2018, our expected annual long-term rate of return on post-retirement benefit plan assets is
assumed to be 4.0%.

Permitted investments: Plan assets are managed consistent with the restrictions set forth by the Employee

Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, which requires diversification of assets and also generally
prohibits defined benefit and welfare plans from investing more than 10% of their assets in securities issued by
the sponsor company. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the post-retirement benefit plans did not directly own
any shares of our common stock or debt instruments. At December 31, 2017, the pension benefit plan directly
held approximately $4 million of our equity securities and approximately $2 million of CenturyLink, Inc. debt
securities. At December 31, 2016 the pension benefit plan held approximately $1 million of our debt securities.

Derivative instruments: Derivative instruments are used to reduce risk as well as provide return. The
pension plan uses exchange traded futures and swaps to gain exposure to equity and interest rate markets
consistent with target asset allocations and to reduce risk relative to measurement of the benefit obligation, which
is sensitive to interest rate changes. Foreign exchange forward contracts are used to manage currency exposures.
Credit default swaps are used to manage credit risk exposures in a cost effective and targeted manner relative to
transacting with physical corporate fixed income securities. Options are currently used to manage interest rate
exposure taking into account the implied volatility and current pricing of the specific underlying market
instrument. Some derivative instruments subject the plans to counterparty risk. The external investment
managers, along with Plan Management, monitor counterparty exposure and mitigate this risk by diversifying the
exposure among multiple high credit quality counterparties, requiring collateral and limiting exposure by
periodically settling contracts.

The gross notional exposure of the derivative instruments directly held by the pension benefit plan is shown

below. The notional amount of the derivatives corresponds to market exposure but does not represent an actual
cash investment. Our post-retirement plans were not invested in derivative instruments for the years ended
December 31, 2017 or 2016.

Fair Value Measurements: Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between independent and knowledgeable parties who are willing and
able to transact for an asset or liability at the measurement date. We use valuation techniques that maximize the
use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value and then we
rank the estimated values based on the reliability of the inputs used following the fair value hierarchy set forth by
the FASB. For additional information on the fair value hierarchy, see Note 12—Fair Value Disclosure.

B-80

At December 31, 2017, we used the following valuation techniques to measure fair value for assets. There

were no changes to these methodologies during 2017:

• Level 1—Assets were valued using the closing price reported in the active market in which the

individual security was traded.

• Level 2—Assets were valued using quoted prices in markets that are not active, broker dealer

quotations, net asset value of shares held by the plans and other methods by which all significant inputs
were observable at the measurement date.

• Level 3—Assets were valued using unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists as

reported by the respective institutions at the measurement date.

The tables below present the fair value of plan assets by category and the input levels used to determine
those fair values at December 31, 2017. It is important to note that the asset allocations do not include market
exposures that are gained with derivatives. Investments include dividend and interest receivables, pending trades
and accrued expenses.

The plans’ assets are invested in various asset categories utilizing multiple strategies and investment

managers. Interests in commingled funds are valued using the net asset value (“NAV”) per unit of each fund. The
NAV reported by the fund manager is based on the market value of the underlying investments owned by each
fund, minus its liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding. Commingled funds can be redeemed at
NAV, generally within a year of the financial statement date. Investments in private funds, primarily limited
partnerships, represent long-term commitments with a fixed maturity date and are also valued at NAV. Valuation
inputs for these private fund interests are generally based on assumptions and other information not observable in
the market. The assumptions and valuation methodologies of the pricing vendors, account managers, fund
managers and partnerships are monitored and evaluated for reasonableness. Below is an overview of the asset
categories, the underlying strategies and valuation inputs used to value the assets in the preceding tables:

(a) Investment grade bonds represent investments in fixed income securities as well as commingled

bond funds comprised of U.S. Treasury securities, agencies, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, asset-
backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities. Treasury securities are valued at the bid price
reported in the active market in which the security is traded and are classified as Level 1. The valuation inputs of
other investment grade bonds primarily utilize observable market information and are based on a spread to U.S.
Treasury securities and consider yields available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings.
The primary observable inputs include references to the new issue market for similar securities, the secondary
trading markets and dealer quotes. Option adjusted spread models are utilized to evaluate securities such as asset
backed securities that have early redemption features. These securities are classified as Level 2. The commingled
funds are valued at NAV based on the market value of the underlying fixed income securities using the same
valuation inputs previously described.

(b) High yield bonds represent investments in below investment grade fixed income securities as well
as commingled high yield bond funds. The valuation inputs for the securities primarily utilize observable market
information and are based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities and consider yields available on comparable
securities of issuers with similar credit ratings. These securities are primarily classified as Level 2. Securities

B-83

whose valuation inputs are not based on observable market information are classified as Level 3. The
commingled funds are valued at NAV based on the market value of the underlying high yield instruments using
the same valuation inputs previously described.

(c) Emerging market bonds represent investments in securities issued by governments and other entities
located in developing countries as well as registered mutual funds and commingled emerging market bond funds.
The valuation inputs for the securities utilize observable market information and are primarily based on dealer
quotes or a spread relative to the local government bonds. The registered mutual fund is classified as Level 1
while individual securities are primarily classified as Level 2. Securities whose valuation inputs are not based on
observable market information are classified as Level 3. The commingled funds are valued at NAV based on the
market value of the underlying emerging market bonds using the same valuation inputs previously described.

(d) Diversified strategies represent an investment in a commingled fund that primarily has exposures to

global government, corporate and inflation linked bonds, global stocks and commodities. This asset category
includes investments in a registered mutual fund which is classified at Level 1, and a commingled fund which is
valued at NAV based on the market value of the underlying investments. The valuation inputs utilize observable
market information including published prices for exchange traded securities, bid prices for government bonds,
and spreads and yields available for comparable fixed income securities with similar credit ratings.

(e) U.S. stocks represent investments in stocks of U.S. based companies as well as commingled U.S.

stock funds. The valuation inputs for U.S. stocks are based on the last published price reported on the major stock
market on which the securities are traded and are primarily classified as Level 1. Securities whose valuation
inputs are not based on observable market information are classified as Level 3. The commingled funds are
valued at NAV based on the market value of the underlying investments using the same valuation inputs
previously described.

(f) Non-U.S. stocks represent investments in stocks of companies based in developed countries outside

the U.S. as well as commingled funds. The valuation inputs for non-U.S. stocks are based on the last published
price reported on the major stock market on which the securities are traded and are primarily classified as
Level 1. The commingled funds are valued at NAV based on the market value of the underlying investments
using the same valuation inputs previously described.

(g) Emerging market stocks represent investments in commingled funds comprised of stocks of

companies located in developing markets. The commingled funds are valued at NAV based on the market value
of the underlying investments using the same valuation inputs described previously for individual stocks.

(h) Private equity represents non-public investments in domestic and foreign buy out and venture

capital funds. Private equity funds are primarily structured as limited partnerships and are valued according to the
valuation policy of each partnership, subject to prevailing accounting and other regulatory guidelines. The
partnerships are valued at NAV using valuation methodologies that consider a range of factors, including but not
limited to the price at which investments were acquired, the nature of the investments, market conditions, trading
values on comparable public securities, current and projected operating performance, and financing transactions
subsequent to the acquisition of the investments. These valuation methodologies involve a significant degree of
judgment.

(i) Private debt represents non-public investments in distressed or mezzanine debt funds and pension

group insurance contracts. Pension group insurance contracts are valued based on actuarial assumptions, and are
classified as Level 3. Mezzanine debt instruments are debt instruments that are subordinated to other debt issues
and may include embedded equity instruments such as warrants. Private debt funds are primarily structured as
limited partnerships and are valued at NAV according to the valuation policy of each partnership, subject to
prevailing accounting and other regulatory guidelines. The valuation of underlying fund investments are based on

B-84

factors including the issuer’s current and projected credit worthiness, the security’s terms, reference to the
securities of comparable companies, and other market factors. These valuation methodologies involve a
significant degree of judgment.

(j) Market neutral hedge funds hold investments in a diversified mix of instruments that are intended in

combination to exhibit low correlations to market fluctuations. These investments are typically combined with
futures to achieve uncorrelated excess returns over various markets. Directional hedge funds—This asset
category represents investments that may exhibit somewhat higher correlations to market fluctuations than the
market neutral hedge funds. Investments in hedge funds include both direct investments and investments in
diversified funds of funds. Hedge funds are valued at NAV based on the market value of the underlying
investments which include publicly traded equity and fixed income securities and privately negotiated debt
securities. The hedge funds are valued by third party administrators using the same valuation inputs previously
described.

(k) Real estate represents investments in commingled funds and limited partnerships that invest in a
diversified portfolio of real estate properties. These investments are valued at NAV according to the valuation
policy of each fund or partnership, subject to prevailing accounting and other regulatory guidelines. The
valuation inputs of the underlying properties are generally based on third-party appraisals that use comparable
sales or a projection of future cash flows to determine fair value.

(l) Multi-asset strategies represent broadly diversified strategies that have the flexibility to tactically
adjust exposures to different asset classes through time. This asset category includes investments in a registered
mutual fund which is classified as Level 1 and a commingled fund which is valued at NAV based on the market
value of the underlying investments.

(m) Derivatives include exchange traded futures contracts which are classified as Level 1, as well as

privately negotiated over the counter swaps and options that are valued based on the change in interest rates or a
specific market index and are classified as Level 2. The market values represent gains or losses that occur due to
fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, security prices, or other factors.

(n) Cash equivalents and short-term investments represent investments that are used in conjunction
with derivatives positions or are used to provide liquidity for the payment of benefits or other purposes. The
valuation inputs of securities are based on a spread to U.S. Treasury Bills, the Federal Funds Rate, or London
Interbank Offered Rate and consider yields available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit
ratings and are primarily classified as Level 2. The commingled funds are valued at NAV based on the market
value of the underlying investments using the same valuation inputs described above.

Concentrations of Risk: Investments, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as significant world
events, interest rate, credit, foreign currency and overall market volatility risk. These risks are managed by
broadly diversifying assets across numerous asset classes and strategies with differing expected returns,
volatilities and correlations. Risk is also broadly diversified across numerous market sectors and individual
companies. Financial instruments that potentially subject the plans to concentrations of counterparty risk consist
principally of investment contracts with high quality financial institutions. These investment contracts are
typically collateralized obligations and/or are actively managed, limiting the amount of counterparty exposure to
any one financial institution. Although the investments are well diversified, the value of plan assets could change
materially depending upon the overall market volatility, which could affect the funded status of the plans.

Certain gains and losses are allocated between assets sold during the year and assets still held at year-end

based on transactions and changes in valuations that occurred during the year. These allocations also impact our
calculation of net acquisitions and dispositions.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, the investment program produced actual gains on qualified pension
and post-retirement plan assets of $1.307 billion as compared to expected returns of $668 million for a difference
of $639 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the investment program produced actual losses on
pension and post-retirement plan assets of $759 million as compared to the expected returns of $739 million for a
difference of $20 million. The short-term annual returns on plan assets will almost always be different from the
expected long-term returns and the plans could experience net gains or losses, due primarily to the volatility
occurring in the financial markets during any given year.

Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003

We sponsor post-retirement health care plans with several benefit options that provide prescription drug
benefits that we deem actuarially equivalent to or exceeding Medicare Part D. We recognize the impact of the
federal subsidy received under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 in
the calculation of our post-retirement benefit obligation and net periodic post-retirement benefit expense.

Other Benefit Plans

Health Care and Life Insurance

We provide health care and life insurance benefits to essentially all of our active employees. We are largely

self-funded for the cost of the health care plan. Our health care benefit expense for current employees was
$341 million, $399 million and $381 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Union-represented employee benefits are based on negotiated collective bargaining agreements.
Employees contributed $128 million, $127 million and $125 million for the years ended December 31, 2017,
2016 and 2015, respectively. Our group basic life insurance plans are fully insured and the premiums are paid by
us.

401(k) Plans

We sponsor qualified defined contribution plans covering substantially all of our employees. Under these

plans, employees may contribute a percentage of their annual compensation up to certain maximums, as defined
by the plans and by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). Currently, we match a percentage of employee
contributions in cash. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the assets of the plans included approximately 7 million
shares and 7 million shares, respectively, of our common stock all of which were the result of the combination of
previous employer match and participant directed contributions. We recognized expenses related to these plans
of $77 million, $79 million and $83 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Upon the November 1, 2017 closing of our acquisition of Level 3, we assumed various defined contribution

plans covering substantially all eligible employees of Level 3. On December 31, 2017, we merged the Level 3
Communications, Inc. 401(k) Plan into the CenturyLink Dollar & Sense 401(k) Plan. The resulting plan covers
substantially all eligible non-represented employees of the combined company in the US.

Deferred Compensation Plans

We sponsored non-qualified deferred compensation plans for various groups that included certain of our

current and former highly compensated employees. The value of liabilities related to these plans was not
significant.

B-88

(10) Share-based Compensation

We maintain equity programs that allow our Board of Directors (through its Compensation Committee or

our Chief Executive Officer as its delegate) to grant incentives to certain employees and our outside directors in
any one or a combination of several forms, including incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and market and performance shares. Stock
options generally expire ten years from the date of grant.

Acquisition of Level 3

Upon the November 1, 2017 closing of our acquisition of Level 3, and pursuant to the terms of the merger

agreement, we replaced certain of Level 3’s share-based compensation awards with our share-based
compensation awards. Specifically:

•

•

each outstanding Level 3 restricted stock unit award granted prior to April 1, 2014 or granted to an
outside director of Level 3 was converted into $26.50 in cash and 1.4286 shares of our common stock
(and cash in lieu of fractional shares) with respect to each Level 3 share covered by such award (the
“Converted RSU Awards”); and

each outstanding Level 3 restricted stock unit award granted on or after April 1, 2014 (other than these
granted to outside directors of Level 3) was converted into a CenturyLink restricted stock unit award
using a conversion ratio of 2.8386 to 1 as determined in accordance with a formula set forth in the
merger agreement (the “Continuing RSU Awards”).

The preliminary aggregate fair value of the replaced Level 3 awards was $239 million, of which

$103 million was attributable to service performed prior to the acquisition date and was included in the cost of
the acquisition. The fair value of CenturyLink shares was determined based on the $18.99 closing price of our
common stock on November 1, 2017. The remaining $137 million of the preliminary aggregate fair value of the
replaced Level 3 awards was attributable to post-acquisition period and is being recognized as compensation
expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the remaining vesting period from 1 to 2 years.

During 2017, we received net cash proceeds of less than $1 million in connection with our option exercises.

The tax benefit realized from these exercises was less than $1 million. The total intrinsic value of options
exercised for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, was less than $1 million each year. The total
intrinsic value of options exercised for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $4 million.

B-89

Restricted Stock Awards

For equity based restricted stock awards that contain only service conditions for vesting (time-based

awards), we calculate the award fair value based on the closing price of CenturyLink common stock on the
accounting grant date. We also grant equity based awards that contain service conditions as well as additional
market or performance conditions. For awards with service and market conditions, the award fair value is
calculated using Monte-Carlo simulations. Awards with service as well as market or performance conditions
specify a target number of shares for the award. Each recipient ultimately has the opportunity to receive between
0% and 200% of the target number of shares. For awards with service and market conditions, the percentage
received is based on our total shareholder return over the three-year service period versus that of selected peer
companies. For awards with service and performance conditions, the percentage received depends upon the
attainment of two financial performance targets during the three-year service period.

Awards Granted in 2017

In 2017, we granted 6 million shares of restricted stock awards, of which 4.7 million shares contained only

service conditions and 1.3 million target shares that contained service conditions and either market or
performance conditions. The details of these grants are as follows:

During the first quarter of 2017, we granted 784 thousand shares of restricted stock to certain executive

level employees as part of our long-term incentive program, of which 314 thousand shares contained only service
conditions and will vest on a straight-line basis on February 21, 2018, 2019 and 2020. The remaining awards,
470 thousand target shares, contain service conditions and either market or performance conditions and are
scheduled to vest on February 21, 2020.

During the first quarter of 2017, we also granted 2 million shares to certain key employees as part of our

annual equity compensation program, of which 1.8 million shares contained only service conditions and will vest
on a straight-line basis on February 20, 2018, 2019 and 2020. The remaining awards, 200 thousand target shares,
contain service conditions and either market or performance conditions and are scheduled to vest on February 20,
2020.

During the second quarter of 2017, we granted 894 thousand shares to certain executive level employees as
integration and retention awards related to the Level 3 acquisition, of which 647 thousand shares of the retention
awards will vest on June 1, 2018, 2019 and 2020. The remaining retention awards, 125 thousand shares, will vest
on December 15, 2018 and 2019. Integration awards, which contain service and performance conditions, specify
a target number of shares for the award. Each recipient ultimately has the opportunity to receive from 80% to
120% of the target number of shares. Integration awards of 122 thousand target shares are scheduled to vest on
December 15, 2018.

During the fourth quarter of 2017, we granted 948 thousand shares of restricted stock to certain executive

level employees as part of our long-term equity retention program. Time-based awards totaled 493 thousand
shares. The remaining awards, 455 thousand target shares, contain service conditions and either market or
performance conditions are scheduled to vest on March 31, 2019 and November 1, 2020. We also granted
1.1 million shares to certain key employees as part of our special retention program. Of these, time-based awards
totaled 911 thousand shares and will vest on November 1, 2019 and 2020. The remaining awards, 187 thousand
shares, are scheduled to vest on November 1, 2018, 2019 and 2020.

In 2016, we granted 3.8 million shares of restricted stock awards, of which 3.1 million shares contained only

service conditions and 700 thousand target shares that contained service conditions and either market or
performance conditions. The details of these grants are as follows:

During the first quarter of 2016, we granted 766 thousand shares of restricted stock to certain executive

level employees as part of our long-term incentive program, of which 306 thousand contained only service
conditions and will vest on a straight-line basis on February 23, 2017, 2018 and 2019. The remaining awards,
460 thousand target shares, contain service conditions and either market or performance conditions and are
scheduled to vest on February 23, 2019.

During the first quarter of 2016, we also granted 1.9 million shares to certain key employees as part of our
annual equity compensation program, of which 1.7 million contained only service conditions and will vest on a
straight-line basis on February 25, 2017, 2018 and 2019. The remaining awards, 200 thousand target shares,
contain service conditions and either market or performance conditions and are scheduled to vest on February 25,
2019. During the first and third quarter of 2016, we granted shares to certain key employees as part of our long-
term equity retention program. These awards will vest over a three to seven year period with 113 thousand,
322 thousand and 209 thousand shares vesting on August 16, 2019, 2021 and 2023, respectively, and 22 thousand
shares vesting on January 13, 2021 and 22 thousand shares vesting on January 13, 2023. The remaining awards
granted throughout 2016 to certain other key employees and our outside directors were made as part of our equity
compensation and retention programs. These awards require only service conditions for vesting and typically
vest equally over a three year period.

Awards Granted in 2015

In 2015, we granted 2.9 million shares of restricted stock awards, of which 2.6 million shares contained only

service conditions and 300 thousand target shares that contained service conditions and either market or
performance conditions. The details of these grants are as follows:

During the first quarter of 2015, we granted 496 thousand shares of restricted stock to certain executive-

level employees as part of our long-term incentive program, of which 198 thousand contained only service
conditions and will vest on a straight-line basis on February 23, 2016, 2017 and 2018. The remaining awards,
298 thousand target shares, contain service conditions and market or performance conditions and are scheduled
to vest on February 23, 2018.

At the end of the first quarter of 2015, we granted 1.2 million shares to certain key employees as part of our
annual equity compensation program. These awards contained only service conditions and will vest on a straight-
line basis on March 12, 2016, 2017 and 2018. During the third quarter of 2015 we granted shares to certain key
employees as part of our long-term equity retention program. These awards will vest over a three to seven year
period with 193 thousand, 423 thousand and 230 thousand shares vesting on August 14, 2018, 2020 and 2022,
respectively, and 55 thousand shares vesting equally on August 14, 2017, 2019, and 2021. The remaining awards
granted throughout 2015 to certain other key employees and our outside directors were made as part of our equity
compensation and retention programs. These awards require only service conditions for vesting and typically
vest equally over a three year period.

excluded from this figure.

During 2016, we granted 3.6 million shares of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards at a

weighted-average price of $30.83. During 2015, we granted 2.9 million shares of restricted stock and restricted
stock unit awards at a weighted-average price of $31.83. The total fair value of restricted stock that vested during
2017, 2016 and 2015, was $60 million, $47 million and $59 million, respectively.

Compensation Expense and Tax Benefit

We recognize compensation expense related to our market and performance share-based awards with graded

vesting that only have a service condition on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire
award. Total compensation expense for all share-based payment arrangements for the years ended December 31,
2017, 2016 and 2015, was $111 million, $80 million and $73 million, respectively. Our tax benefit recognized in
the consolidated statements of operations for our share-based payment arrangements for the years ended
December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, was $28 million, $31 million and $28 million, respectively. At
December 31, 2017, there was $240 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to our share-
based payment arrangements, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years.

Our calculation of diluted earnings per common share excludes shares of common stock that are issuable
upon exercise of stock options when the exercise price is greater than the average market price of our common
stock. We also exclude unvested restricted stock awards that are antidilutive as a result of unrecognized
compensation cost. Such shares averaged 4.7 million, 3.3 million and 3.1 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.

(12) Fair Value Disclosure

Our financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts

payable and long-term debt, excluding capital lease and other obligations. Due to their short-term nature, the
carrying amounts of our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable
approximate their fair values.

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between independent and knowledgeable parties who are willing and able to transact for an
asset or liability at the measurement date. We use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value and then we rank the estimated
values based on the reliability of the inputs used following the fair value hierarchy set forth by the FASB.

B-93

We determined the fair values of our long-term debt, including the current portion, based on quoted market

prices where available or, if not available, based on discounted future cash flows using current market interest
rates.

The three input levels in the hierarchy of fair value measurements are defined by the FASB generally as

follows:

Input Level Description of Input
Level 1
Level 2
Level 3

Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets.
Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable.
Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists.

The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our long-term debt,

excluding capital lease and other obligations, as well as the input level used to determine the fair values indicated

(13) Income Taxes

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was signed into law. The Act significantly
changes U.S. tax law. The Act reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to 21% for
all corporations, effective January 1, 2018, and makes certain changes to U.S. taxation of income earned by
foreign subsidiaries, capital expenditures, interest expense and various other items.

As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, we re-measured our net

deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2017 and recognized a provisional tax benefit of approximately
$1.1 billion in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.

The Act imposed a one-time repatriation tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Act also

includes certain anti-abuse and base erosion provisions that may impact the amounts of U.S. tax that we pay with
respect to income earned by our foreign subsidiaries. We have not yet been able to make a reasonable estimate of
the impact of these provisions and continue to account for these items based on our existing accounting under
U.S. GAAP and the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect prior to the Act’s enactment.

On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff addressed the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a

registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in
reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act. We have provisionally
recognized the tax impacts related to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities in the amount noted
above in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The ultimate impact may
differ from our provisional amount due to additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions we
have made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take as a result of the Act.

B-94

The change from our current provisional estimates will be reflected in our future statements of operations and
could be material. We expect to complete the accounting by the time we file our 2017 U.S. corporate income tax
return in the 4th quarter of 2018, although we cannot assure you of this.

The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects the benefit of approximately

$1.1 billion from the re-measurement of deferred taxes as noted above, a $27 million tax expense related to the

B-95

sale of our colocation business and $32 million tax impact of non-deductible transaction costs related to the
Level 3 acquisition. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflects a tax impact of
$18 million from an intercompany dividend payment from one of our foreign subsidiaries to its domestic parent
company that was made as part of our corporate restructuring in preparation for the sale of our colocation
business. The 2015 rate reflects a tax benefit of approximately $34 million related to affiliate debt rationalization,
research and development tax credits of $28 million for 2011 through 2015 and a $16 million tax decrease due to
changes in state taxes caused by apportionment changes, state tax rate changes and the changes in the expected
utilization of net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”).

Of the $1.979 billion and $3.463 billion net deferred tax liability at December 31, 2017 and 2016,
respectively, $2.413 billion and $3.471 billion is reflected as a long-term liability and $434 million and
$8 million is reflected as a net noncurrent deferred tax asset at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

At December 31, 2017, we had federal NOLs of $9.1 billion and state NOLs of $21 billion. If unused, the

NOLs will expire between 2018 and 2033; however, no significant amounts expire until 2023. We also had
foreign NOL carryforwards of $5.8 billion as a result of the Level 3 acquisition. At December 31, 2017, we had
an immaterial amount of federal tax credits. Our acquisitions of Level 3, Qwest and SAVVIS, Inc. (“Savvis”)
caused “ownership changes” within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“Section 382”).
As a result, our ability to use these NOLs and AMT credits are subject to annual limits imposed by Section 382.
Despite this, we expect to use substantially all of these tax attributes to reduce our future federal tax liabilities,
although the timing of that use will depend upon our future earnings and future tax circumstances.

We establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to amounts we expect to

realize. As of December 31, 2017, a valuation allowance of $1.341 billion was established as it is more likely
than not that this amount of net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards will not be utilized prior
to expiration. Our valuation allowance at December 31, 2017 and 2016 is primarily related to foreign and state
NOL carryforwards. This valuation allowance increased by $966 million during 2017, primarily due to the
acquisition of Level 3 and the related valuation allowances.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective income tax

rate was $66 million and $34 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Our policy is to reflect interest expense associated with unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

We had accrued interest (presented before related tax benefits) of approximately $56 million and $35 million at
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

We, or at least one of our subsidiaries, file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various

states and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or
non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2003. The Internal Revenue Service and
state and local taxing authorities reserve the right to audit any period where net operating loss carryforwards are
available.

Based on our current assessment of various factors, including (i) the potential outcomes of these ongoing

examinations, (ii) the expiration of statute of limitations for specific jurisdictions, (iii) the negotiated settlement
of certain disputed issues, and (iv) the administrative practices of applicable taxing jurisdictions, it is reasonably
possible that the related unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions previously taken may decrease by
up to $16 million within the next 12 months. The actual amount of such decrease, if any, will depend on several
future developments and events, many of which are outside our control.

(14) Segment Information

In January 2017, we implemented a new organization structure designed to further strengthen our ability to
attain our operational, strategic and financial goals. Prior to this reorganization, we operated and reported as two
segments, business and consumer. As a result of this reorganization, we changed the name of the predecessor
business segment to “enterprise” segment. Additionally, we also reassigned our information technology,
managed hosting, cloud hosting and hosting area network services from our business segment to a new
non-reportable operating segment. We reported two segments, enterprise and consumer, from January 2017
through October 2017.

In connection with our acquisition of Level 3 (discussed further in Note 2—Acquisition of Level 3),

effective November 1, 2017, we implemented a new organization structure and began managing our operations in
two segments: business and consumer. Our consumer segment remains substantially unchanged under this
reorganization, and our newly reorganized business segment includes the legacy CenturyLink enterprise segment
operations and the legacy Level 3 operations. In addition, we reassigned our information technology, managed
hosting, cloud hosting and hosting area network operations back into the business segment from the former
non-reportable operating segment. At December 31, 2017, we had the following two segments:

•

Business Segment. This segment consists generally of providing products and services to small,
medium and enterprise business, wholesale and government customers, including other communication

B-97

providers. Our products and services offered to these customers include our local and long-distance
voice, VPN data network, private line (including business data services), Ethernet, information
technology, wavelength, broadband, colocation and data center services, managed services,
professional and other services provided in connection with selling equipment, network security and
various other ancillary services, all of which are described further under “Products and Services
Categories”; and

•

Consumer Segment. This segment consists generally of providing products and services to residential
customers. Our products and services offered to these customers include our broadband, local and long-
distance voice, video and other ancillary services.

The following table summarizes our segment results for 2017, 2016 and 2015 based on the segment

categorization we were operating under at December 31, 2017.

Product and Service Categories

We categorize our products, services and revenues among the following five categories:

•

•

•

•

•

IP and data services, which include primarily VPN data networks, Ethernet, IP, video (including our
facilities-based video services and Vyvx broadcast services) and other ancillary services;

Transport and infrastructure, which include broadband, private line (including business data services),
data center facilities and services, including cloud, hosting and application management solutions,
wavelength, equipment sales and professional services, network security services and other ancillary
services;

Voice and collaboration, which includes primarily local and long-distance voice, including wholesale
voice, and other ancillary service;

IT and managed services, which include information technology services and managed services, which
may be purchased in conjunction with our other network services;

Regulatory revenues, which consists of Universal Service Fund (“USF”) and Connect America Fund
(“CAF”) support payments, USF surcharges and other operating revenues. We receive federal support
payments from both federal and state USF programs and from the federal CAF program. The USF and

B-98

CAF support payments are government subsidies designed to reimburse us for various costs related to
certain telecommunications services. We generate other operating revenues from the leasing and
subleasing of space in our office buildings, warehouses and other properties and from rental income
associated with the failed-sale-leaseback. Because we centrally manage the activities that generate
these regulatory revenues, these revenues are not included in our segment revenues.

Our operating revenues for our products and services are presented as follows for the years ended

December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:

We recognize revenues in our consolidated statements of operations for certain USF surcharges and
transaction taxes that we bill to our customers. Our consolidated statements of operations also reflect the
offsetting expense for the amounts we remit to the government agencies. The total amount of such surcharges
and transaction taxes that we included in revenues aggregated to $601 million, $572 million and $544 million for
the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These USF surcharges, where we record
revenue, and transaction taxes are assigned to the products and services categories of each segments based on the
underlying revenues. We also act as a collection agent for certain other USF and transaction taxes that we are
required by government agencies to bill our customers, for which we do not record any revenue or expense
because we only act as a pass-through agent.

B-99

Allocations of Revenues and Expenses

Our segment revenues include all revenues from our IP and data services, transport and infrastructure

services, voice and collaboration, colocation and security services and IT and managed services as described in
more detail above. Our segment revenues are based upon each customer’s classification. We report our segment
revenues based upon all services provided to that segment’s customers. Our segment expenses include specific
expenses incurred as a direct result of providing services and products to segment customers, along with selling,
general and administrative expenses that are (i) directly associated with specific segment customers or activities,
and (ii) allocated expenses which include network expenses, facilities expenses and other expenses such as fleet
and real estate expenses. We do not assign depreciation and amortization expense or impairments to our
segments, as the related assets and capital expenditures are centrally managed and are not monitored by or
reported to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) by segment. Generally speaking, severance expenses,
restructuring expenses and certain centrally managed administrative functions (such as finance, information
technology, legal and human resources) are not assigned to our segments. Interest expense is also excluded from
segment results because we manage our financing on a consolidated basis and have not allocated assets or debt to
specific segments. Other income and expense items are not monitored as a part of our segment operations and are
therefore excluded from our segment results.

The following table reconciles segment income to net income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016

and 2015:

We do not have any single customer that provides more than 10% of our consolidated total operating

revenues. Approximately 2% of our consolidated total operating revenues come from customers located outside
of the U.S. Approximately 10% of our consolidated total assets and approximately 10% of our consolidated long-
lived assets are located outside of the U.S.

During the first quarter of 2017, we recognized $10 million of expenses related to our acquisition of Level 3

followed by acquisition-related expenses of $18 million, $37 million and $206 million in the second, third and
fourth quarters of 2017, respectively. During the first quarter of 2017, depreciation and amortization expense of
$50 million was not recognized on colocation assets held for sale. During the second quarter, we recognized a
combined loss of $119 million resulting from the sale of the colocation business and data centers and the
accounting treatment of the failed-sale-leaseback. During the second quarter of 2017, we recognized a one-time
depreciation charge of $44 million related to the failed-sale-leaseback accounting. During the third and fourth
quarters of 2017, we recognized $44 million and $20 million, respectively, of interest expense related to
CenturyLink, Inc.‘s $6 billion secured term loan utilized in the acquisition of Level 3. In the fourth quarter of
2017, we recognized a tax benefit of approximately $1.1 billion due to the change in the federal corporate tax rate
from 35% to 21%.

During the fourth quarter of 2016, we recognized $164 million of severance expenses and other one-time

termination benefits associated with our workforce reductions and $52 million of expenses related to our pending
acquisition of Level 3.

(16) Commitments and Contingencies

We are vigorously defending against all of the matters described below (excluding those referred to under

the heading “Hurricane Damage”). As a matter of course, we are prepared to both litigate these matters to
judgment, as well as to evaluate and consider all reasonable settlement opportunities. In this Note, when we refer
to a class action as “putative” it is because a class has been alleged, but not certified in that matter. We have
established accrued liabilities for these matters described below where losses are deemed probable and
reasonably estimable.

Shareholder Class Action Suit

CenturyLink and certain members of the CenturyLink Board of Directors have been named as defendants in
a putative shareholder class action lawsuit filed on January 11, 2017 in the 4th Judicial District Court of the State
of Louisiana, Ouachita Parish, captioned Jeffery Tomasulo v. CenturyLink, Inc., et al. The complaint asserts,
among other things, that the members of CenturyLink’s Board allegedly breached their fiduciary duties to the
CenturyLink shareholders in approving the Level 3 merger agreement and, more particularly, that: the
consideration that CenturyLink agreed to pay to Level 3 stockholders in the transaction is allegedly unfairly high;
the CenturyLink directors allegedly had conflicts of interest in negotiating and approving the transaction; and the

B-101

disclosures set forth in our preliminary joint proxy statement/prospectus filed in December 2016 are insufficient
in that they allegedly fail to contain material information concerning the transaction. The complaint seeks, among
other things, a declaration that the members of the CenturyLink Board have breached their fiduciary duties,
corrective disclosure, rescissory or other damages and equitable relief, including rescission of the transaction. On
February 13, 2017, the parties entered into a memorandum of understanding providing for the settlement of the
lawsuit. The proposed settlement is subject to court approval, among other conditions, and the amount of the
settlement is not material to our consolidated financial statements.

Retiree Benefits Suit

In William Douglas Fulghum, et al. v. Embarq Corporation, et al., filed on December 28, 2007 in the United

States District Court for the District of Kansas, a group of retirees filed a class action lawsuit challenging the
decision to make certain modifications in retiree benefits programs relating to life insurance, medical insurance
and prescription drug benefits, generally effective January 1, 2006 and January 1, 2008 (which, at the time of the
modifications, were expected to reduce estimated future expenses for the subject benefits by more than $300
million). Defendants include Embarq, certain of its benefit plans, its Employee Benefits Committee and the
individual plan administrator of certain of its benefits plans. Additional defendants include Sprint Nextel and
certain of its benefit plans. The court certified classes on the claims for vested benefits and age discrimination,
but rejected class certification on the claims for breach of fiduciary duty. On October 14, 2011, the Fulghum
lawyers filed a new, related lawsuit, Abbott et al. v. Sprint Nextel et al. In Abbott, approximately 1,500 plaintiffs
alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the changes in retiree benefits that were at issue in Fulghum.
After extensive district court proceedings in Fulghum, and an interlocutory appeal to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, defendants prevailed in 2015 on all age discrimination claims and on the majority
of claims for vested benefits. The district court in Fulghum subsequently granted judgment in favor of defendants
on all remaining vested benefits claims, and in July 2016 ordered that any affected class members could appeal
this ruling. No appeal was taken, and all claims for vested benefits thus have lapsed. On August 31, 2016, the
parties reached a settlement in principle on all remaining claims in Fulghum and Abbott. Since then, a settlement
agreement has been finalized and, per its terms, the settlement funds have been distributed to class members. The
settlement payments were not material to our consolidated financial statements.

Switched Access Disputes

Subsidiaries of CenturyLink, Inc. are among hundreds of companies involved in an industry-wide dispute,

raised in nearly 100 federal lawsuits (filed between 2014 and 2016) that have been consolidated in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Texas for pretrial procedures. The disputes relate to switched
access charges that local exchange carriers (“LECs”) collect from interexchange carriers (“IXCs”) for IXCs’ use
of LEC’s access services. In the lawsuits, IXCs, including Sprint Communications Company L.P. (“Sprint”) and
various affiliates of Verizon Communications Inc. (“Verizon”), assert that federal and state laws bar LECs from
collecting access charges when IXCs exchange certain types of calls between mobile and wireline devices that
are routed through an IXC. Some of these IXCs have asserted claims seeking refunds of payments for access
charges previously paid and relief from future access charges.

In November 2015, the federal court agreed with the LECs and rejected the IXCs’ contention that federal
law prohibits these particular access charges, and also allowed the IXCs to refile state-law claims. Since then,
many of the LECs and IXCs have filed revised pleadings and additional motions, which remain pending.
Separately, some of the defendants, including CenturyLink, Inc.‘s LECs, have petitioned the FCC to address
these issues on an industry-wide basis.

As both an IXC and a LEC, we both pay and assess significant amounts of the charges in question. The

outcome of these disputes and lawsuits, as well as any related regulatory proceedings that could ensue, are
currently not predictable. If we are required to stop assessing these charges or to pay refunds of any such charges,
our financial results could be negatively affected.

B-102

State Tax Suits

CenturyLink, Inc. and several of its subsidiaries are defendants in lawsuits filed over the past few years in
the Circuit Court of St. Louis County, Missouri by numerous Missouri municipalities alleging underpayment of
taxes. These municipalities are seeking, among other things, (i) a declaratory judgment regarding the extent of
our obligations to pay certain business license and gross receipts taxes and (ii) a monetary award of back taxes
covering 2007 to the present, plus penalties and interest. In a February 2017 ruling in connection with one of
these pending cases, the court entered into a final order awarding plaintiffs $4 million and broadening the tax
base on a going forward basis. We filed a notice of appeal on March 3, 2017. We expect the outcome of our
appeal to reduce our ultimate exposure, although we can provide no assurances to this effect. In a June 9, 2017
ruling in connection with another one of these pending cases, the court made findings which, if not overturned,
will result in a tax liability to us well in excess of the contingent liability we have established. Following further
proceedings at the district court, we plan to file an appeal and continue to vigorously defend against these claims.
For a variety of reasons, we expect the outcome of our appeal to significantly reduce our ultimate exposure,
although we can provide no assurances to this effect.

Billing Practices Suits

In June 2017, a former employee filed an employment lawsuit against us claiming that she was wrongfully

terminated for alleging that we charged some of our retail customers for products and services they did not
authorize. Starting shortly thereafter and continuing since then, and based in part on the allegations made by the
former employee, a series of consumer and shareholder putative class actions were filed against us, and we
received several shareholder derivative demands. In July 2017, the Minnesota Attorney General also filed a civil
suit on behalf of the Minnesota consumers alleging that we engaged in improper sales and billing practices. The
filing of additional related lawsuits is possible. The consumer putative class actions have been transferred to the
U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota for coordinated and consolidated pretrial proceedings. The
shareholder putative class actions have been consolidated into a single action that currently is pending in U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Louisiana. In addition, a separate, related class action was filed in U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York purportedly on behalf of persons who purchased certain of
our Senior Notes. This class action suit has been transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Louisiana.

In late June 2017, the Board of Directors formed a special committee of outside directors to investigate

improper sales and billing practices and related matters. In late 2017, the special committee concluded its review
and issued its key findings. Among other things, the committee found that (i) our investment in consumer sales
monitoring was insufficient, (ii) our ordering and billing software contributed to customer confusion and
(iii) systems and human errors contributed to inaccurate billing. In August 2017, the Board of Directors formed a
special litigation committee of outside directors to address the allegations of impropriety contained in the
shareholder derivative demands. The investigation of the special litigation committee is ongoing.

Pending Litigation Matters Assumed in Level 3 Acquisition

Peruvian Tax Litigation

Beginning in 2005, one of Level 3’s Peruvian subsidiaries received a number of assessments for tax,

penalties and interest for calendar years 2001 and 2002. Peruvian tax authorities (“SUNAT”) took the position
that the Peruvian subsidiary incorrectly documented its importations resulting in additional income tax
withholding and value-added taxes (“VAT”). The total amount of the asserted claims, including potential interest
and penalties, was $26 million, consisting of $3 million for income tax withholding in connection with the import
of services for calendar years 2001 and 2002, $7 million for VAT in connection with the import of services for
calendar years 2001 and 2002, and $16 million in connection with the disallowance of VAT credits for periods
beginning in 2005. After taking into account the developments described below, as well as the accrued interest
and foreign exchange effects, the total amount of exposure is $15 million at December 31, 2017.

B-103

Level 3 challenged the 2002 tax period assessments via administrative and then judicial review processes. In

October 2011, the highest administrative review tribunal (the Tribunal) decided the central issue underlying the
2002 tax period assessments in the government’s favor, while denying a portion of the assessment on procedural
grounds. Level 3 then appealed the Tribunal’s decision to the judicial court in Peru. After further development of
the record, the first judicial level decided the central issue in favor of Level 3. SUNAT and Level 3 filed cross-
appeals. In May 2017, the court of appeal issued a decision reversing the first judicial level. In June 2017,
Level 3 filed an appeal of the decision to the Supreme Court of Justice, the final judicial level. That appeal is
pending.

In October 2013, the Tribunal decided the central issue underlying the year 2001 tax period assessments in
the government’s favor, while denying a portion of the assessment on procedural grounds. Level 3 appealed that
decision to the judicial court in Peru. After further development of the record, the first judicial court issued a
ruling against Level 3. In June 2017, Level 3 filed an appeal with the court of appeal. An oral hearing took place
before the court of appeals on October 18, 2017. In November 2017, the court of appeals issued a decision
affirming the lower court’s decision and Level 3 filed an appeal of the decision to the Supreme Court of Justice,
the final judicial level. That appeal is pending.

In December 2013, SUNAT initiated an audit of calendar year 2001. In June 2014, Level 3 was served with
SUNAT’s assessments of the 2001 VAT credits declared null by the Tribunal and the corresponding fine. In July
2014, Level 3 challenged these assessments by filing administrative claims before SUNAT. In January 2015,
SUNAT rejected the administrative claims, thereby confirming the assessments. Level 3 filed an appeal with the
Tribunal in February 2015. In May 2015, the Tribunal notified Level 3 of its administrative resolution declaring
the assessments and corresponding fines null. The time for SUNAT to appeal this resolution has closed. Under
local practice, notification of an appeal can take several months. Counsel confirmed in the first quarter of 2016
that SUNAT has not filed an appeal to the resolution. Nevertheless, SUNAT retains the right to reissue the
assessments declared null or start a new audit. However, Level 3 is under no obligation to provide additional
information and any fine issued by SUNAT based on the same information that it has already used in the past
would be declared null.

Employee Severance and Contractor Termination Disputes

A number of former employees and third-party contractors have asserted a variety of claims in litigation
against certain of Level 3’s Latin American subsidiaries for separation pay, severance, commissions, pension
benefits, unpaid vacation pay, breach of employment contracts, unpaid performance bonuses, property damages,
moral damages and related statutory penalties, fines, costs and expenses (including accrued interest, attorneys’
fees and statutorily mandated inflation adjustments) as a result of their separation from Level 3 or termination of
service relationships. Level 3 is vigorously defending itself against the asserted claims, which aggregate to
approximately $17 million at December 31, 2017.

Brazilian Tax Claims

In December 2004, March 2009, April 2009 and July 2014, the São Paulo state tax authorities issued tax
assessments against one of Level 3’s Brazilian subsidiaries for the Tax on Distribution of Goods and Services
(“ICMS”) with respect to revenue from leasing movable properties (in the case of the December 2004, March
2009 and July 2014 assessments) and revenue from the provision of Internet access services (in the case of the
April 2009 and July 2014 assessments), by treating such activities as the provision of communications services,
to which the ICMS tax applies. In September 2002, July 2009 and May 2012, the Rio de Janeiro state tax
authorities issued tax assessments to the same Brazilian subsidiary on similar issues. Level 3 has filed objections
to these assessments, arguing that the lease of assets and the provision of Internet access are not communication
services subject to ICMS. The objections to the September 2002, December 2004 and March 2009 assessments
were rejected by the respective state administrative courts, and Level 3 has appealed those decisions to the
judicial courts. In October 2012 and June 2014, Level 3 received favorable rulings from the lower court on the

B-104

December 2004 and March 2009 assessments regarding equipment leasing, but those rulings are subject to appeal
by the state. No ruling has been obtained with respect to the September 2002 assessment. The objections to the
April and July 2009 and May 2012 assessments are still pending final administrative decisions. The July 2014
assessment was confirmed during the fourth quarter of 2014 at the first administrative level and Level 3 appealed
this decision to the second administrative level.

Level 3 is vigorously contesting all such assessments in both states and, in particular, views the assessment

of ICMS on revenue from leasing movable properties to be without merit. Nevertheless, Level 3 believes it is
reasonably possible that these assessments could result in a loss of up to $53 million at December 31, 2017 in
excess of the accruals established for these matters.

Other Level 3 Matters

Level 3 has recently been notified of a qui tam action pending against Level 3 Communications, Inc., certain

former employees and others in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, captioned
United States of America ex rel., Stephen Bishop v. Level 3 Communications, Inc. et al. The original qui tam
complaint was filed under seal on November 26, 2013, and an amended complaint was filed under seal on
June 16, 2014. The court unsealed the complaints on October 26, 2017.

The amended complaint alleges that Level 3, principally through two former employees, submitted false
claims and made false statements to the government in connection with two government contracts. The relator
seeks damages in this lawsuit of approximately $50 million, subject to trebling, plus statutory penalties,
pre-and-post judgment interest, and attorney’s fees. The case is currently stayed.

Level 3 is evaluating its defenses to the claims. At this time, Level 3 does not believe it is probable Level 3
will incur a material loss. If, contrary to its expectations, the plaintiff prevails in this matter and proves damages
at or near $50 million, and is successful in having those damages trebled, the outcome could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability is recognized and on our cash flows
for the period in which any damages are paid.

The two former Level 3 employees named in the qui tam amended complaint and others were also indicted

in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on October 3, 2017, and charged with,
among other things, accepting kickbacks from a subcontractor, who was also indicted, for work to be performed
under a prime government contract. Level 3 is fully cooperating in the government’s investigations in this matter.

Other Proceedings and Disputes

From time to time, we are involved in other proceedings incidental to our business, including patent

infringement allegations, administrative hearings of state public utility commissions relating primarily to our
rates or services, actions relating to employee claims, various tax issues, environmental law issues, grievance
hearings before labor regulatory agencies and miscellaneous third party tort actions.

We are currently defending several patent infringement lawsuits asserted against us by non-practicing

entities, many of which are seeking substantial recoveries. These cases have progressed to various stages and one
or more may go to trial in the coming 24 months if they are not otherwise resolved. Where applicable, we are
seeking full or partial indemnification from our vendors and suppliers. As with all litigation, we are vigorously
defending these actions and, as a matter of course, are prepared to litigate these matters to judgment, as well as to
evaluate and consider all reasonable settlement opportunities.

We are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety

laws. From time to time, we are subject to judicial and administrative proceedings brought by various
governmental authorities under these laws. Several such proceedings are currently pending, but none is
reasonably expected to exceed $100,000 in fines and penalties.

B-105

The outcome of these other proceedings is not predictable. However, based on current circumstances, we do

not believe that the ultimate resolution of these other proceedings, after considering available defenses and any
insurance coverage or indemnification rights, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results
of operations or cash flows.

Hurricane Damage

During the third quarter of 2017, multiple hurricanes struck portions of United States, which caused damage

to our facilities and disruption of our services in certain areas of multiple states. We are still in the process of
assessing the full extent of the damage. However, based on our current assessment, we estimate that expenditures
required for the restoration of our network and physical plant may range from $20 million to $25 million,
including repairs and equipment replacement. In addition, Level 3 incurred damage to certain of its facilities
from multiple hurricanes, and estimate expenditures required for the restoration of their network and physical
plant of $6 million, including repairs and equipment replacement. These damage estimates are subject to many
uncertainties and may change materially as we complete physical surveys.

The hurricanes did not have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2017, as the majority of the capital and repair expenditures will be recorded in
the future periods as we incur the costs.

The ultimate outcome of the above-described matters may differ materially from the outcomes anticipated,
estimated, projected or implied by us in certain of our forward-looking statements appearing above in this Note,
and proceedings currently viewed as immaterial by us may ultimately materially impact us. For more
information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters—Our pending legal
proceedings could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results, on the trading
price of our securities and on our ability to access the capital markets” in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Environmental Contingencies

In connection with our largely historical operations, we have responded to or been notified of potential

environmental liability at approximately 200 properties. We are engaged in addressing or have liquidated
environmental liabilities at many of those properties. We could potentially be held liable, jointly, or severally,
and without regard to fault, for the costs of investigation and remediation of these sites. The discovery of
additional environmental liabilities or changes in existing environmental requirements could have a material
adverse effect on our business.

Capital Leases

We lease certain facilities and equipment under various capital lease arrangements. Depreciation of assets

under capital leases is included in depreciation and amortization expense in our consolidated statements of
operations. Payments on capital leases are included in repayments of long-term debt, including current maturities
in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

Operating Leases

CenturyLink leases various equipment, office facilities, retail outlets, switching facilities and other network
sites. These leases, with few exceptions, provide for renewal options and escalations that are either fixed or based
on the consumer price index. Any rent abatements, along with rent escalations, are included in the computation
of rent expense calculated on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The lease term for most leases includes the
initial non-cancelable term plus any term under renewal options that are reasonably assured. For the years ended
December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our gross rental expense was $550 million, $482 million and $467 million,
respectively. We also received sublease rental income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 of
$13 million, $12 million and $12 million, respectively.

Purchase Commitments

We have several commitments primarily for marketing activities and support services from a variety of

vendors to be used in the ordinary course of business totaling $953 million at December 31, 2017. Of this
amount, we expect to purchase $343 million in 2018, $265 million in 2019 through 2020, $103 million in 2021
through 2022 and $242 million in 2023 and thereafter. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated
purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which we were contractually committed as of
December 31, 2017.

(17) Other Financial Information
Assets Held for Sale

Assets held for sale includes several assets that we expect to sell within the next twelve months. On

January 22, 2018, we entered into an agreement to sell a block of Internet Protocol Addresses for aggregate
consideration of $68 million, which is to be paid in two equal installments. In addition, the U.S. Department of
Justice (“DOJ”) approved our acquisition of Level 3 subject to conditions of a consent decree on October 2,
2017, which requires the combined company to divest certain Level 3 metro network assets in the markets
located in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Boise, Idaho; and Tucson, Arizona and to divest dark fiber connecting 30
specified city-pairs across the United States in the form of an Indefeasible Right of Use agreement. As of the date
of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, we have signed two letters of intent
that the DOJ is reviewing.

respectively, representing book overdrafts and (ii) $225 million and $196 million, respectively, associated with
capital expenditures.

(18) Labor Union Contracts

As of December 31, 2017, approximately 28% of our employees were members of various bargaining units

represented by the Communication Workers of America (“CWA”) and the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers (“IBEW”). We believe that relations with our employees continue to be generally good. Less
than 1,000 of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements that expired in 2017 and, as of
December 31, 2017, were being renegotiated. In mid-2017, we reached new agreements with the CWA District 7
and IBEW Local 206, which represented at December 31, 2017 approximately 10,000, or 71%, of our
represented employees. The new agreements were effective June 18, 2017 and will expire on March 8, 2020 and
include terms substantially similar to those contained in the prior agreements. Approximately 1,000 of our
employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements that are scheduled to expire in 2018.
