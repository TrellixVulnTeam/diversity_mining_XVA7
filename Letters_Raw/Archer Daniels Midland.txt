2018 Letter to Stockholders 
 
2017 Form 10-K

Proxy Statement

Dear Stockholders,

ADM works to grow earnings and returns by anticipating and meeting trends in demand for basic foods, ingredients, food
solutions that promote health and wellness, and renewable fuels and chemicals.

Our three-part strategy for achieving those goals — enhancing our core; advancing Readiness, the evolution of our
operational excellence efforts; and growing strategically, particularly in the areas of our value chain that are closer to the
end customer — continues to drive the company’s long-term vision and our ability to deliver strong results for share-
holders.

In 2017, ADM delivered adjusted earnings of $2.43 per share, compared with $2.16 in the prior year — a 12.5 percent
increase. We also improved our trailing four-quarter average adjusted return on invested capital (ROIC) to 6.4 percent —
40 basis points above our annual weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 6.0 percent.

This performance enabled us to generate positive economic value added, or EVA, of almost $100 million on a four-quarter
trailing average basis during the year. At the same time, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in 2017 as part of a bal-
anced capital-allocation framework that also provides for investments in long-term value creation. Much of that amount
came in the form of shareholder dividends. The fourth quarter of 2017 was our 345th consecutive quarterly payment, or 86
uninterrupted years of dividends.

Following are highlights of the year’s key strategic accomplishments:

• Enhancing our core. Our work to optimize our portfolio of existing businesses resulted in significant volume growth

in our specialty oils business; operating profit growth of more than 25 percent in our WILD Flavors business; and
year-over-year volume growth of more than 20 percent for our destination-marketing business.

We also continued to manage our asset portfolio to maximize returns, including the sale of our Crop Risk Services
business and the agreement to sell our oilseeds crushing operations in Bolivia.

• Improving our cost structure through Readiness. Readiness is a multiyear initiative combining lean manufactur-

ing, process standardization and digital design. Its objectives are to lower costs and enable consistently great
customer experiences. In 2017, we achieved $285 million in run-rate cost savings, and we will continue improving
efficiency and reducing costs by leveraging technology to help save hundreds of millions of additional dollars.

• Growing strategically by building out our integrated value chain in EMEA. Our acquisitions of Chamtor — a

French company that produces sweeteners from wheat — and Biopolis, the Valencia, Spain-based probiotics manu-
facturer, have increased our participation in the regional markets for sweeteners, starches and bioactives. We grew
our destination marketing business in the Middle East with the acquisition of a majority stake in Israel’s Industries
Centers, and in early 2018, we announced the formation of a joint venture with Cargill to provide soybean meal and
oil for customers in Egypt.

We also continued using the increased flex-crush capacity at our German oilseeds facilities to crush non-GMO soy-
beans to meet the region’s growing demand. And in March of this year, we announced an agreement to acquire a
50 percent equity stake in the sweeteners and starches business of Russia-based Aston Foods and Food Ingredients, a
move that will allow us to address the Russian food and beverage industry’s growing ingredient needs. We are also
investing to move closer to customers to help them lead in fast-growing market segments, including natural flavors
and colors, plant-based proteins, ancient grains and soluble fiber.

2018 outlook

As we did last year, we are pulling the levers under our control in 2018 to drive results, even as “green shoots” of improv-
ing business conditions continue to emerge in various segments. Our emphasis is on optimizing our existing businesses,
and on reducing run-rate costs by an additional $200 million through Readiness. We will accelerate Readiness in 2018,
with initiatives including:

• The continued rollout of 1ADM, our business transformation project that is helping standardize processes and sys-

tems, improve decision-making, and control costs.

• Driving energy-efficiency projects with high-efficiency motors, low-energy evaporation technologies and low-energy

mixing technology.

• Broadening our Performance Excellence initiative — a rigorous program that is empowering, engaging and enabling

front-line colleagues to help improve and standardize processes throughout the business.

We also will benefit from several of our largest recent investments — including our Campo Grande, Brazil, specialty pro-
teins complex — ramping up production in 2018.

Leading with a clear purpose

As a premier global agribusiness and food-ingredient provider, ADM plays a critical role in feeding a protein-hungry world
whose population will surpass 9.5 billion by the middle of this century. At the same time, our mission has evolved to
include providing better nutrition for consumers worldwide, which has a positive impact on people’s quality of life.

To fulfill these commitments to our customers, their consumers and society at-large, we will pursue growth in five key plat-
forms that we believe hold great potential to drive stronger earnings and returns. They are:

• Taste: We’ve already seen tremendous growth in the WILD Flavors business we acquired in 2014. Going forward, we

will advance our product-innovation work, broaden our foodservice and private-label customer base, and work to
replicate our regional strengths — such as the culinary capabilities we’ve built in North America following our 2015
acquisition of Eatem Foods — on a global scale. We also plan to continue expanding our network of innovation cen-
ters, which enable us to collaborate with customers on new-product development and reformulations. We opened one
facility in Sydney in 2017 and another in Singapore in January 2018, following on the Cranbury, New Jersey, center we
opened in 2016.

• Nutrition: In addition to accelerating sales from the Campo Grande specialty proteins complex, we see opportunities
to leverage our existing strengths in proteins, fibers, edible beans and other food ingredients to develop new products
and services that help our customers respond effectively to changing consumer preferences.

• Animal Nutrition: As global meat consumption continues to increase, we will serve as a leading provider of high-

quality animal nutrition products for livestock and aquaculture producers, as well as for companion-animal owners.
With that goal in mind, last year we acquired the pet-treat manufacturer Crosswind Industries, Inc., completed our
latest feed-premix facility in Zhangzhou, China, and announced plans to construct another premix plant in Xiangtan,
China. We also added aquaculture feed production lines at our existing Nanjing, China, complex.

• Bioactives: Science’s understanding of the human and animal gut microbiomes continues to deepen, which provides

ADM with an opportunity to build a portfolio of prebiotics and probiotics, personalized nutrition solutions and
animal-health enzymes that address fast-growing demand across the food and beverage, personal care, infant care
and pharmaceutical segments. Last year’s acquisition of Biopolis gave us a strong presence in this sector, and our
subsequent announcement of a joint research partnership with the Mayo Clinic centered on weight loss could result in
findings with broad implications for human health and wellness. Meanwhile, in January 2018, we announced a joint
development agreement with Qingdao Vland Biotech Group Co., Ltd., for the development and commercialization of
enzymes for animal feed applications. And later this year, we will open a new enzyme lab in Davis, California, to sup-
port additional research and commercialization efforts.

• Carbohydrates: With a view to growing our industrial, food and specialty-starch portfolios, we will create a broader
carbohydrate platform with significant growth potential. Our acquisition of Chamtor, our launch of new sweeteners
made from stevia and monk fruit, and the continued success of the former Eaststarch sweetener operations in Eastern
Europe illustrate just some of the possibilities.

Safety, Sustainability and Service to Our Communities

The health and safety of our 31,000 colleagues around the globe will always be our highest priority. The fourth quarter of 2017
was ADM’s single safest three-month period on record, and we set three monthly safety records during the calendar year.

Also ongoing is our work to strengthen our environmental performance and the integrity of our supply chain. In May, we
reported that ADM had reduced energy intensity by 25 percent and emissions by 11 percent on a per-unit-of-production
basis since 2010; water usage declined nearly 25 percent on the same basis since 2008. In keeping with the commitments
set forth in the no-deforestation policy we adopted in 2015, we reported achieving 98 percent traceability in our palm oil
supply chain; 95.5 percent traceability for palm kernel oil; and 99 percent traceability to the municipality/district level for
our soybean supply chain.

Because we believe that a key success factor for businesses is an inclusive culture and a diverse workforce, ADM founded
and currently leads Together We Grow, a cross-functional council representing industry, academia, NGOs and legislative
bodies that are working to grow the pipeline of diverse talent within the agricultural industry. We also are a member of
CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion, a CEO-led collaboration to cultivate workplaces that are both diverse and inclusive.
Companywide, we continue to invest in colleague development to further enhance our team’s capabilities and build our
base of talent for the future.

As we move further into 2018, I am proud of our 31,000 colleagues’ dedication and sense of responsibility for delivering the
best performance possible. Their perseverance, customer focus and commitment to excellence in all they do was evident
throughout 2017, and I am confident we will have many more positive developments to write about next year at this time.

Sincerely,

Juan R. Luciano
Chairman, CEO and President

PROXY SUMMARY

GOVERNANCE HIGHLIGHTS

Our Board of Directors views itself as the long-term stewards of ADM. The Board is committed to enhancing the success and value of our
company for its stockholders, as well as for other stakeholders such as employees, business partners, and others. The Board recognizes the
importance of good corporate governance and understands that transparent disclosure of its governance practices helps stockholders assess
the quality of our company and its management and the value of their investment decisions.

ADM’s corporate governance practices are intended to ensure independence, transparency, management accountability, effective decision
making, and appropriate monitoring of compliance and performance. We believe that these strong corporate governance practices, together
with our enduring corporate values and ethics, are critical to providing lasting value to the stockholders of our company.

We use majority voting for uncontested director elections.

We have an independent Lead Director, selected by the

independent directors. The Lead Director provides the Board with
independent leadership, facilitates the Board’s independence from
management, and has broad powers as described on page 11. We

recently enhanced the Lead Director’s responsibilities, as described

on page 11.

We have a policy prohibiting directors and officers from trading in

derivative securities of our company, and no NEOs or directors have

pledged any company stock.

10 of our 11 current directors are independent and only
independent directors serve on the Audit, Compensation/

Succession, and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committees.

Our independent directors meet in executive session at each

regular in-person board meeting.

Significant stock ownership requirements are in place for directors

and executive officers.

The Board and each standing committee annually conduct

evaluations of their performance. Directors annually evaluate each

other, and these evaluations are used to assess future

Individuals cannot stand for election as a director once they reach
age 75, and our Corporate Governance Guidelines set forth limits
on the number of for-profit company boards on which a director

re-nominations to our Board.

can serve.

Holders of 10% or more of our common stock have the ability to

call a special meeting of stockholders.

Our bylaws include a “proxy access” provision under which a small
group of stockholders who has owned at least 3% of our common
stock for at least 3 years may submit nominees for up to 20% of

the board seats for inclusion in our proxy statement.

GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING

PROXY STATEMENT

General Matters

Our Board of Directors asks that you complete the accompanying proxy for the annual stockholders’ meeting. The meeting will be held at the
time, place, and location mentioned in the Notice of Annual Meeting included in these materials. This year, we will be using the “Notice and
Access” method of providing proxy materials to stockholders via the internet. We will mail to our stockholders (other than those described
below) a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials containing instructions on how to access our proxy statement and the 2017
Annual Report on Form 10-K and how to vote electronically via the internet. This notice will also contain instructions on how to request a
paper copy of the proxy materials. Those stockholders who previously have opted out of participation in notice and access procedures will
receive a paper copy of the proxy materials by mail or an electronic copy of the proxy materials by email. We are first providing our stock-
holders with notice and access to, or first mailing or emailing, this proxy statement and a proxy form around March 23, 2018.

We pay the costs of soliciting proxies from our stockholders. We have retained Georgeson LLC to help us solicit proxies. We will pay George-
son LLC a base shareholder meeting services fee of approximately $24,000 plus reasonable project management fees and expenses for its
services. Our employees or employees of Georgeson LLC may also solicit proxies in person or by telephone, mail, or the internet at a cost
which we expect will be nominal. We will reimburse brokerage firms and other securities custodians for their reasonable fees and expenses
in forwarding proxy materials to their principals.

We have a policy of keeping confidential all proxies, ballots, and voting tabulations that identify individual stockholders. Such documents are
available for examination only by the inspectors of election, our transfer agent, and certain employees associated with processing proxy
cards and tabulating the vote. We will not disclose any stockholder’s vote except in a contested proxy solicitation or as may be necessary to
meet legal requirements.

Our common stockholders of record at the close of business on March 12, 2018, are the only people entitled to notice of the annual meeting
and to vote at the meeting. At the close of business on March 12, 2018, we had 558,872,570 outstanding shares of common stock, each share
being entitled to one vote on each of the director nominees and on each of the other matters to be voted on at the meeting. Our stockholders
and advisors to our company are the only people entitled to attend the annual meeting. We reserve the right to direct stockholder repre-
sentatives with the proper documentation to an alternative room to observe the meeting.

All stockholders will need a form of photo identification to attend the annual meeting. If you are a stockholder of record and plan to attend,
please detach the admission ticket from the top of your proxy card and bring it with you to the meeting. The number of people we will admit
to the meeting will be determined by how the shares are registered, as indicated on the admission ticket. If you are a stockholder whose
shares are held by a broker, bank, or other nominee, please request an admission ticket by writing to our office at Archer-Daniels-Midland
Company, Investor Relations, 4666 Faries Parkway, Decatur, Illinois 62526-5666. Your letter to our office must include evidence of your
stock ownership. You can obtain evidence of ownership from your broker, bank, or nominee. The number of tickets that we send will be
determined by the manner in which shares are registered. If your request is received by April 19, 2018, an admission ticket will be mailed to
you. Entities such as a corporation or limited liability company that are stockholders may send one representative to the annual meeting,
and the representative should have a pre-existing relationship with the entity represented. All other admission tickets can be obtained at the
registration table located at the James R. Randall Research Center lobby beginning at 7:30 A.M. on the day of the meeting. Stockholders who
do not pre-register will be admitted to the meeting only upon verification of stock ownership.

The use of cameras, video or audio recorders, or other recording devices in the James R. Randall Research Center is prohibited. The display
of posters, signs, banners, or any other type of signage by any stockholder in the James R. Randall Research Center is also prohibited. Fire-
arms are also prohibited in the James R. Randall Research Center.

Any request to deviate from the admittance guidelines described above must be in writing, addressed to our office at Archer-Daniels-
Midland Company, Attention: Secretary, 77 West Wacker Drive, Suite 4600, Chicago, Illinois 60601, and received by us by April 19, 2018. We
will also have personnel in the lobby of the James R. Randall Research Center beginning at 7:30 A.M. on the day of the meeting to consider
special requests.

If you properly execute the enclosed proxy form, your shares will be voted at the meeting. You may revoke your proxy form at any time
prior to voting by:

(1) delivering written notice of revocation to our Secretary;

(2) delivering to our Secretary a new proxy form bearing a date later than your previous proxy; or

(3) attending the meeting and voting in person (attendance at the meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy).

ADM Proxy Statement 2018

GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING

Under our bylaws, stockholders elect our directors by a majority vote in an uncontested election (one in which the number of nominees is
the same as the number of directors to be elected) and by a plurality vote in a contested election (one in which the number of nominees
exceeds the number of directors to be elected). Because this year’s election is an uncontested election, each director nominee receiving a
majority of votes cast will be elected (the number of shares voted “for” a director nominee must exceed the number of shares voted “against”
that nominee). Approval of each other proposal presented in the proxy statement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of common stock present in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on that matter. Shares not present
at the meeting and shares voting “abstain” have no effect on the election of directors. For the other proposals to be voted on at the meeting,
abstentions are treated as shares present or represented and voting, and therefore have the same effect as negative votes. Broker non-votes
(shares held by brokers who do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received voting instructions from their
clients) are counted toward a quorum, but are not counted for any purpose in determining whether a matter has been approved.

PROPOSAL NO. 1

PROPOSAL NO. 1 — ELECTION OF DIRECTORS FOR A ONE-YEAR TERM

Our Board of Directors has fixed the size of the current board at twelve. Eleven of the twelve nominees proposed for election to our Board of
Directors are currently members of our Board and have been elected previously by our stockholders. The new nominee for election is
Michael S. Burke. Mr. Burke was identified by the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee as a potential nominee, with assistance
from a third-party search firm retained to identify director candidates, and was recommended by the Nominating/Corporate Governance
Committee after it completed its interview and vetting process. Unless you provide different directions, we intend for board-solicited prox-
ies (like this one) to be voted for the nominees named below.

If elected, the nominees would hold office until the next annual stockholders’ meeting and until their successors are elected and qualified. If
any nominee for director becomes unable to serve as a director, the persons named as proxies may vote for a substitute who will be des-
ignated by the Board of Directors. Alternatively, the Board of Directors could reduce the size of the board. The Board has no reason to
believe that any nominee will be unable to serve as a director.

Our bylaws require that each director be elected by a majority of votes cast with respect to that director in an uncontested election (where
the number of nominees is the same as the number of directors to be elected). In a contested election (where the number of nominees
exceeds the number of directors to be elected), the plurality voting standard governs the election of directors. Under the plurality standard,
the number of nominees equal to the number of directors to be elected who receive more votes than the other nominees are elected to the
Board, regardless of whether they receive a majority of the votes cast. Whether an election is contested or not is determined as of the day
before we first mail our meeting notice to stockholders. This year’s election was determined to be an uncontested election, and the majority
vote standard will apply. If a nominee who is serving as a director is not elected at the annual meeting, Delaware law provides that the direc-
tor would continue to serve on the Board as a “holdover director.” However, under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, each director
annually submits an advance, contingent, irrevocable resignation that the Board may accept if the director fails to be elected through a
majority vote in an uncontested election. In that situation, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee would make a recom-
mendation to the Board about whether to accept or reject the resignation. The Board will act on the Nominating/Corporate Governance
Committee’s recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days after the date the election results
are certified. The Board will nominate for election or re-election as director, and will elect as directors to fill vacancies and new director-
ships, only candidates who agree to tender the form of resignation described above. If a nominee who was not already serving as a director
fails to receive a majority of votes cast at the annual meeting, Delaware law provides that the nominee does not serve on the Board as a
“holdover director.”

The information below describes the nominees, their ages, positions with our company, principal occupations, current directorships of other
publicly owned companies, directorships of other publicly owned companies held within the past five years, the year in which each first was
elected as a director, and the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned as of March 12, 2018, directly or indirectly. Unless
otherwise indicated, and subject to community property laws where applicable, we believe that each nominee named in the table below has
sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares indicated as beneficially owned. Unless otherwise indicated, all of the nominees
have been executive officers of their respective companies or employed as otherwise specified below for at least the last five years.

The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the election of the twelve nominees named below as directors. Proxies
solicited by the Board will be so voted unless stockholders specify a different choice.

Director Experiences, Qualifications, Attributes, and Skills; Board Diversity

In assessing an individual’s qualifications to become a member of the Board, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee may
consider various factors including education, experience, judgment, independence, integrity, availability, and other factors that the Commit-
tee deems appropriate. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee strives to recommend candidates that complement the current
board members and other proposed nominees so as to further the objective of having a Board that reflects a diversity of background and
experience with the necessary skills to effectively perform the functions of the Board and its committees. In addition, the Committee consid-
ers personal characteristics of nominees and current board members, including race, gender, and geographic origin, in an effort to obtain a
diversity of perspectives on the Board.

The specific experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills that qualify each of our directors to serve on our Board are described in the
biographies above.

Director Nominations from Stockholders

The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee will consider nominees recommended by a stockholder, provided that the stockholder
submits the nominee’s name in a written notice delivered to our Secretary at our principal executive offices not less than 60 nor more than
90 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual stockholders’ meeting. However, if the annual meeting is called
for a date that is not within 30 days before or after such anniversary date, the notice must be received at our principal executive offices not
later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or pub-
lic disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made (whichever first occurs). Different notice delivery requirements may apply if the
number of directors to be elected at an annual meeting is being increased, and we do not make a public announcement naming all of the
nominees or specifying the size of the increased board at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting.
Any notice of a stockholder nomination must set forth the information required by Section 1.4(c) of our bylaws, and must be accompanied
by a written consent from the proposed nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected, and a written statement
from the proposed nominee as to whether he or she intends, if elected, to tender the advance, contingent, irrevocable resignation that would
become effective should the individual fail to receive the required vote for re-election at the next meeting of stockholders. Stockholders may
also have the opportunity to include nominees in our proxy statement by complying with the requirements set forth in Section 1.15 of our
bylaws. All candidates, regardless of the source of their recommendation, are evaluated using the same criteria.

BOARD LEADERSHIP AND OVERSIGHT

BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE

Our company’s Board of Directors does not have a current requirement that the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board
be either combined or separated, because the Board believes it is in the best interest of our company to make this determination based on
the position and direction of the company and the constitution of the Board and management team. The Board regularly evaluates whether
the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board should be combined or separated. The Board’s implementation of a careful
and seamless succession plan over the past several years demonstrates that the Board takes seriously its responsibilities under the Corpo-
rate Governance Guidelines to determine who should serve as Chairman at any point in time in light of the specific circumstances facing our
company. After careful consideration, the Board has determined that having Mr. Luciano, our company’s Chief Executive Officer, serve as
Chairman is in the best interest of our stockholders at this time. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the day-to-day management of
our company and the development and implementation of our company’s strategy, and has access to the people, information, and resources
necessary to facilitate board function. Therefore, the Board believes at this time that combining the roles of Chief Executive Officer and
Chairman contributes to an efficient and effective board.

The independent directors elect a Lead Director at the Board’s annual meeting. Mr. Felsinger is currently serving as Lead Director. The
Board believes that having an independent Lead Director provides the Board with independent leadership and facilitates the independence
of the Board from management. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee regularly evaluates the responsibilities of the Lead
Director and considers current trends regarding independent board leadership. Since the 2017 annual meeting, the Board enhanced the
Lead Director’s responsibilities, as set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, in connection with determining performance criteria
for evaluating the Chief Executive Officer, evaluating the Board, committees, and individual directors, and planning for management succes-
sion. In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines as so revised, the Lead Director: (i) presides at all meetings of the Board at
which the Chairman is not present, including executive sessions of the independent directors, and regularly meets with the Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer for discussion of appropriate matters arising from these sessions; (ii) coordinates the activities of the other
independent directors and serves as liaison between the Chairman and the independent directors; (iii) consults with the Chairman and
approves all meeting agendas, schedules, and information provided to the Board, and may, from time to time, invite corporate officers, other
employees, and advisors to attend Board or committee meetings whenever deemed appropriate; (iv) interviews, along with the Chairman
and the Chair and members of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, all director candidates and makes recommendations to
the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee; (v) advises the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee on the selection of
members of the board committees; (vi) advises the board committees on the selection of committee chairs; (vii) works with the Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer to propose a schedule of major discussion items for the Board; (viii) guides the Board’s governance processes;
(ix) provides leadership to the Board if circumstances arise in which the role of the Chairman or Chief Executive Officer may be, or may be
perceived to be, in conflict; (x) has the authority to call meetings of the independent directors; (xi) if requested by major stockholders,
ensures that he or she is available for consultation and direct communication; (xii) leads the non-management directors in determining
performance criteria for evaluating the Chief Executive Officer and coordinates the annual performance review of the Chief Executive Offi-
cer; (xiii) works with the Chair of the Compensation/Succession Committee to guide the Board’s discussion of management succession
plans; (xiv) works with the Chair and members of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee to facilitate the evaluation of the per-
formance of the Board, committees, and individual directors; and (xv) performs such other duties and responsibilities as the Board may
determine.

In addition to electing a Lead Director, our independent directors facilitate the Board’s independence by meeting frequently as a group and
fostering a climate of transparent communication. The high level of contact between our Lead Director and our Chairman between board
meetings and the specificity contained in the Board’s delegation of authority parameters also serve to foster effective board leadership.

BOARD ROLE IN RISK OVERSIGHT

Management is responsible for day-to-day risk assessment and mitigation activities, and our company’s Board of Directors is responsible for
risk oversight, focusing on our company’s overall risk management strategy, our company’s degree of tolerance for risk, and the steps man-
agement is taking to manage our company’s risks. While the Board as a whole maintains the ultimate oversight responsibility for risk man-
agement, the committees of the Board can be assigned responsibility for risk management oversight of specific areas. The Audit Committee
currently maintains responsibility for overseeing our company’s enterprise risk management process and regularly discusses our company’s
major risk exposures, the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures, and guidelines and policies to govern our
company’s risk assessment and risk management processes. The Audit Committee periodically reports to our Board of Directors regarding
significant matters identified with respect to the foregoing.

BOARD ROLE IN OVERSEEING POLITICAL ACTIVITIES

Our Board of Directors believes that participation in the political process is important to our business. We and our political action committee
(ADMPAC) therefore support candidates for political office and organizations that share our pro-growth vision, our aspirations for the
future of global agriculture, and our commitment to the people who depend on it for their lives and livelihoods. Decisions to support partic-
ular candidates and/or organizations are subject to fixed policies and determined by the company’s best interests, not the personal political
preferences of our company’s executives. ADMPAC submits to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) regular, detailed reports on all federal
political contributions, which reports are available to the public on the FEC’s website. Similarly, contributions to state candidates are dis-
closed to relevant state authorities and typically disclosed on individual states’ websites.

In addition to our contributions to individual candidates for public office and candidate committees, we also support a small number of
so-called “527” groups, including the Democratic Governors Association, the Republican Governors Association, Ag America, and the Repub-
lican State Leadership Committee. We have not supported independent political expenditures or 501(c)(4) organizations. Finally, we have
memberships in several industry, trade, and business associations representing agriculture and the business community. If a trade associa-
tion engages in political activity, the amount of dues associated with this political advocacy is reported in our quarterly LD2 filings.

12

ADM Proxy Statement 2018

BOARD LEADERSHIP AND OVERSIGHT

We engage in a centralized, deliberative process when making decisions about the company’s political participation to ensure that it com-
plies with all applicable laws and makes appropriate disclosures. Contributions of greater than $1,000 typically require the approval of the
board of directors of ADMPAC, a political action committee funded by our employees’ voluntary contributions. The ADMPAC board of direc-
tors is chaired by the vice president of state government relations and composed of employees who represent various areas of the company.
Contributions of less than $1,000 may be authorized by the company’s vice president of government relations and vice president of state
government relations.

Our Board of Directors provides oversight of ADMPAC’s and the company’s political activities, political contributions, and compliance with
relevant laws. At each quarterly board meeting, ADM management provides the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee with a
detailed report on our political contributions in the previous quarter. Any member of the Board may obtain further detailed information
concerning political contributions, trade associations, compliance with federal and state laws, or any other related topic.

DIRECTOR EVALUATIONS; SECTION 16(a) REPORTING COMPLIANCE

BOARD, COMMITTEE, AND DIRECTOR EVALUATIONS

The Board believes that a robust annual evaluation process is a critical part of its governance practices. Accordingly, the Nominating/
Corporate Governance Committee oversees an annual evaluation of the performance of the Board of Directors, each committee of the Board,
and each individual director. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee approves written evaluation questionnaires which are dis-
tributed to each director. The results of each written evaluation are provided to, and compiled by, an outside firm. Individual directors are
evaluated by their peers in a confidential process. Our Lead Director works with the Chair and members of the Nominating/Corporate
Governance Committee to facilitate the evaluation of the performance of the Board, committees, and individual directors, and delivers and
discusses individual evaluation results with each director. The chair of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee delivers and dis-
cusses the Lead Director’s individual evaluation with him or her. Results of the performance evaluations of the committees and the Board
are discussed at appropriate committee meetings and with the full board.

Our Board utilizes the results of these evaluations in making decisions on board agendas, board structure, committee responsibilities and
agendas, and continued service of individual directors on the board.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) requires our directors and executive officers to file reports of
ownership and changes in ownership on Forms 3, 4, and 5 with the SEC. Based on our review of Forms 3, 4, and 5 that we have received
from, or have filed on behalf of, our directors and executive officers, and on written representations from those persons that they were not
required to file a Form 5, we believe that, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, our directors and executive officers complied
with all Section 16(a) filing requirements.

INDEPENDENCE OF DIRECTORS

INDEPENDENCE OF DIRECTORS

NYSE Independence

The listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE,
require companies listed on the NYSE to have a majority of
“independent” directors. Subject to certain exceptions and transition
provisions, the NYSE standards generally provide that a director will
qualify as “independent” if the Board affirmatively determines that
he or she has no material relationship with our company other than
as a director, and will not be considered independent if:

1. the director or a member of the director’s immediate family is, or
in the past three years has been, one of our executive officers or,
in the case of the director, one of our employees;

2. the director or a member of the director’s immediate family has
received during any 12-month period within the last three years
more than $120,000 per year in direct compensation from us other
than for service as a director, provided that compensation received
by an immediate family member for service as a non-executive
officer employee is not considered in determining independence;

3. the director or an immediate family member is a current partner

of one of our independent auditors, the director is employed by
one of our independent auditors, a member of the director’s
immediate family is employed by one of our independent auditors
and personally works on our audits, or the director or a member
of the director’s immediate family was within the last three years
an employee of one of our independent auditors and personally
worked on one of our audits;

4. the director or a member of the director’s immediate family is, or
in the past three years has been, employed as an executive officer
of a company where one of our executive officers at the same time
serves or served on the compensation committee; or

5. the director is a current employee of, or a member of the director’s
immediate family is an executive officer of, a company that makes
payments to, or receives payments from, us in an amount which, in
any of the last three fiscal years, exceeds the greater of $1 million
or 2% of such other company’s consolidated gross revenues.

The Board of Directors has reviewed business and charitable rela-
tionships between us and each non-employee director and director
nominee to determine compliance with the NYSE standards
described above and our bylaw standards described below and to
evaluate whether there are any other facts or circumstances that
might impair a director’s or nominee’s independence. Based on that
review, the Board has determined that ten of its eleven current
members, Messrs. Boeckmann, Crews, Dufour, Felsinger, Moore,
Sanchez, Shih, and Westbrook, Ms. Harrison, and Ms. Sandler are
independent, and that Mr. Burke, the director nominee, is also
independent. Mr. Luciano is not independent under the NYSE or
bylaw standards because of his employment with us.

In determining that Mr. Boeckmann is independent, the Board con-
sidered that, in the ordinary course of business, BP p.l.c. sold natural
gas and fuel to our company and purchased ethanol and biodiesel
from our company, all on an arm’s-length basis during the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2017. Mr. Boeckmann is a director of BP. The
Board determined that Mr. Boeckmann does not have a direct or
indirect material interest in such transactions and that such trans-
actions do not impair Mr. Boeckmann’s independence.

In determining that Mr. Burke is independent, the Board considered
that, in the ordinary course of business, AECOM, of which Mr. Burke
is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, sold engineering services to
our company and purchased various products from our company on
an arm’s-length basis during the fiscal year ended December 31,
2017. The Board determined that this arrangement did not exceed
the NYSE’s threshold of 2.0% of AECOM’s consolidated gross rev-
enues, that Mr. Burke does not have a direct or indirect material
interest in such transactions, and that such transactions do not
impair Mr. Burke’s independence.

In determining that Mr. Crews is independent, the Board considered
that, in the ordinary course of business, WestRock Company, of
which Mr. Crews is a director, purchased various products from our
company and that Hormel Foods Corporation, of which Mr. Crews is
a director, purchased certain commodity products from our com-
pany, all on an arm’s-length basis during the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2017. The Board determined that Mr. Crews does not
have a direct or indirect material interest in such transactions and
that such transactions do not impair Mr. Crews’ independence.

In determining that Mr. Dufour is independent, the Board consid-
ered that, in the ordinary course of business, Air Liquide Group, of
which Mr. Dufour was Senior Executive Vice President and is a
director, sold certain chemicals to our company on an arm’s-length
basis during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The Board
determined that this arrangement did not exceed the NYSE’s
threshold of 2.0% of Air Liquide Group’s consolidated gross rev-
enues, that Mr. Dufour does not have a direct or indirect material
interest in such transactions, and that such transactions do not
impair Mr. Dufour’s independence.

In determining that Ms. Harrison is independent, the Board consid-
ered that, in the ordinary course of business, Colgate-Palmolive
Company, of which Ms. Harrison is President of Global Oral Care,
purchased various products from our company on an arm’s-length
basis during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The Board
determined that this arrangement did not exceed the NYSE’s
threshold of 2.0% of Colgate Palmolive Company’s consolidated
gross revenues, that Ms. Harrison does not have a direct or indirect
material interest in such transactions, and that such transactions do
not impair Ms. Harrison’s independence.

determination of independence, at least one executive session
includes only independent directors. The Lead Director, or in his or
her absence, the chairman of the Nominating/Corporate Governance
Committee, presides at such meetings. The non-management direc-
tors met in independent executive session four times during fiscal
year 2017.

In determining that Mr. Westbrook is independent, the Board
considered that, in the ordinary course of business, Mosaic Com-
pany, of which Mr. Westbrook is a director, sold fertilizer products
to our company and purchased certain logistics and other services
from our company on an arm’s-length basis during the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2017. The Board determined that
Mr. Westbrook does not have a direct or indirect material interest in
such transactions and that such transactions do not impair
Mr. Westbrook’s independence.

Bylaw Independence

Section 2.8 of our bylaws also provides that a majority of the Board
of Directors be comprised of independent directors. Under our
bylaws, an “independent director” means a director who:

1. is not a current employee or a former member of our senior

management or the senior management of one of our affiliates;

2. is not employed by one of our professional services providers;

3. does not have any business relationship with us, either personally
or through a company of which the director is an officer or a con-
trolling shareholder, that is material to us or to the director;

4. does not have a close family relationship, by blood, marriage, or

otherwise, with any member of our senior management or the
senior management of one of our affiliates;

5. is not an officer of a company of which our Chairman or Chief

Executive Officer is also a board member;

6. is not personally receiving compensation from us in any capacity

other than as a director; and

7. does not personally receive or is not an employee of a foundation,

university, or other institution that receives grants or endow-
ments from us, that are material to us, the recipient, or the
foundation/university/institution.

Corporate Governance Guidelines

The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines that gov-
ern the structure and functioning of the Board and set forth the
Board’s policies on governance issues. The guidelines, along with the

BOARD MEETINGS AND ATTENDANCE AT ANNUAL MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

During the last fiscal year, our Board of Directors held ten meetings. All incumbent directors attended 75% or more of the combined total
meetings of the Board and the committees on which they served during such period. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that all
directors standing for election are expected to attend the annual meeting of stockholders. All director nominees standing for election at our
last annual stockholders’ meeting held on May 4, 2017, attended that meeting, with the exception of Mr. Dufour.

INFORMATION CONCERNING COMMITTEES AND MEETINGS

The Board’s standing committees are the Audit, Compensation/Succession, Nominating/Corporate Governance, and Executive Committees.
Each committee operates pursuant to a written charter adopted by the Board, available on our website, www.adm.com.

Audit Committee

The Audit Committee consists of Mr. Crews (Chairman), Mr. Dufour, Mr. Moore, Mr. Sanchez, and Ms. Sandler. The Audit Committee met
nine times during the most recent fiscal year. All of the members of the Audit Committee were determined by the Board to be independent
directors, as that term is defined in our bylaws, in the NYSE listing standards, and in Section 10A of the Exchange Act. No director may
serve as a member of the Audit Committee if such director serves on the audit committees of more than two other public companies unless
the Board determines that such service would not impair such director’s ability to serve effectively on the Audit Committee.

The Audit Committee reviews:

1. the overall plan of the annual independent audit;

7. the performance of our company’s compliance function;

2. financial statements;

3. the scope of audit procedures;

4. the performance of our independent auditors and internal

auditors;

us and each non-employee director, director nominee, and
executive officer to assess potential conflicts of interest and
impairment of independence; and

INFORMATION CONCERNING COMMITTEES AND MEETINGS

The Compensation/Succession Committee provides reports to the Board of Directors and, where appropriate, submits actions to the
Board of Directors for ratification. Members of management attend meetings of the committee and make recommendations to the com-
mittee regarding compensation for officers other than the Chief Executive Officer. In determining the Chief Executive Officer’s compensa-
tion, the committee considers the evaluation prepared by the non-management directors.

In accordance with the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the committee may delegate to one or more officers the authority to grant
stock options to other officers and employees who are not directors or executive officers, provided that the resolution authorizing this
delegation specifies the total number of options that the officer or officers can award. The charter for the Compensation/Succession
Committee also provides that the committee may form subcommittees and delegate tasks to them.

For additional information on the responsibilities and activities of the Compensation/Succession Committee, including the committee’s
processes for determining executive compensation, see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Compensation Discussion and
Analysis.”

Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee

The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee consists of Mr. Moore (Chairman), Mr. Boeckmann, Ms. Sandler, Mr. Shih, and
Mr. Westbrook. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee met four times during the most recent fiscal year. All of the members
of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee were determined by the Board to be independent directors, as that term is defined
in our bylaws and in the NYSE listing standards.

The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee:

1. identifies individuals qualified to become members of the

4. leads the evaluation of the directors, the Board, and board

Board, including evaluating individuals appropriately suggested
by stockholders in accordance with our bylaws;

2. recommends individuals to the Board for nomination as mem-

bers of the Board and board committees;

3. develops and recommends to the Board a set of corporate

governance principles applicable to the company;

Executive Committee

committees; and

5. has oversight responsibility for the company’s corporate

objectives and policies relating to social responsibility and sus-
tainability.

The Executive Committee consists of Mr. Luciano (Chairman), Mr. Felsinger (Lead Director), and the chairs of our three standing commit-
tees, Mr. Crews, Mr. Moore, and Mr. Westbrook. The Executive Committee met one time during the most recent fiscal year. The Executive
Committee acts on behalf of the Board to determine matters which, in the judgment of the Chairman of the Board, do not warrant conven-
ing a special board meeting but should not be postponed until the next scheduled board meeting. The Executive Committee exercises all
the power and authority of the Board in the management and direction of our business and affairs except for matters which are expressly
delegated to another board committee and matters that cannot be delegated by the Board under applicable law, our certificate of
incorporation, or our bylaws.

STOCKHOLDER OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT

STOCKHOLDER OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT

As part of our commitment to effective corporate governance practices, in 2017 we reached out to many of our largest institutional stock-
holders to hold formal discussions with them to help us better understand the views of our investors on key topics. Our Lead Director (who,
as discussed in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, ensures that he is available for consultation and direct communication with major
stockholders) and senior management participated in these meetings to discuss and obtain feedback on corporate governance, executive
compensation, and other related issues important to our stockholders. We share stockholder feedback with our Board and its committees to
enhance both our governance practices and transparency of these practices to our stockholders. We review the voting results of our most
recent annual meeting of stockholders, the stockholder feedback received through our engagement process, the governance practices of our
peers and other large companies, and current trends in governance as we consider enhancements to our governance practices and dis-
closure. We value our dialogue with our stockholders and believe our outreach efforts, which are in addition to our other communication
channels available to our stockholders and interested parties, help ensure our corporate governance, compensation, and other related
practices continue to evolve and reflect the insights and perspectives of our many stakeholders. We welcome suggestions from our stock-
holders on how the Board and management can enhance this dialogue in the future.

Communications with Directors

We have approved procedures for stockholders and other interested parties to send communications to individual directors or the
non-employee directors as a group. You should send any such communications in writing addressed to the applicable director or directors in
care of the Secretary, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, 77 West Wacker Drive, Suite 4600, Chicago, Illinois 60601. All correspondence will
be forwarded to the intended recipients.

CODE OF CONDUCT

The Board has adopted a Code of Conduct that sets forth standards regarding matters such as honest and ethical conduct, compliance with
law, and full, fair, accurate, and timely disclosure in reports and documents that we file with the SEC and in other public communications.
The Code of Conduct applies to all of our directors, employees, and officers, including our principal executive officer, principal financial offi-
cer, and principal accounting officer. The Code of Conduct is available at our website, www.adm.com, and is available free of charge upon
written request to Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, Attention: Secretary, 77 West Wacker Drive, Suite 4600, Chicago, Illinois 60601. Any
amendments to certain provisions of the Code of Conduct or waivers of such provisions granted to certain executive officers will be dis-
closed promptly on our website.

EXECUTIVE STOCK OWNERSHIP

Executive Stock Ownership Policy

The Board of Directors believes that it is important for each member of our senior management to acquire and maintain a significant owner-
ship position in shares of our common stock to further align the interests of senior management with the stockholders’ interests. Accord-
ingly, we have adopted a policy regarding ownership of shares of our common stock by senior management. The policy calls for members of
senior management to own shares of common stock with a fair market value within a range of one to six times that individual’s base salary,
depending on each individual’s level of responsibility with our company. The stock ownership guidelines applicable to the named executive

Our Compensation Philosophy and Objectives

ADM’s executive compensation programs are designed to align the interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders. We
believe in:

• Rewarding executives for creating value for our stockholders.

• Designing and providing market-competitive compensation programs, enabling us to attract and retain high quality executive talent by

rewarding excellence in leadership and the successful implementation of our business strategy.

• Encouraging a culture of pay-for-performance by requiring sufficient financial performance before awards may be earned and directly

tying awards to quantifiable performance.

• Delivering competitive levels of compensation to our executives if we achieve our performance goals and enhance stockholder value.

SECTION 1 — EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Our Compensation Elements

In 2017, the three key elements of our pay program continued to be base salary, annual cash incentive awards, and long-term incentive (LTI)
awards. We refer to the combination of these three elements as “total direct compensation.”

We believe our salaries and performance-based annual cash incentives awards encourage and reward current business results while our LTI
awards and stock ownership guidelines reward sustained performance.

2017 Compensation Changes

For 2017, the Compensation/Succession Committee approved a number of changes which included:

• A move to market based LTI equity awards providing long term incentives for 2017 in amounts with a more direct tie to the company’s

three-year future performance and value creation.

• Grant of performance share units that may be earned over a three-year future performance period based on the degree to which the

company achieves various performance metrics.

• Provision for “double trigger” accelerated vesting upon a change in control, revised from prior single-trigger change in control.

• Expansion of the scope of the LTI award forfeiture and recovery provisions to further mitigate risks associated with the compensation

program and further protect the company’s interest against unfair and inappropriate conduct.

2017 ADM Performance

ADM delivered positive results in challenging market conditions, overcoming certain of the challenges we faced in 2016. In 2017, we grew earn-
ings per share, improved returns on invested capital, and generated positive economic value added. Our focus on efficiency and costs during a
challenging period helped to increase adjusted earnings per share to $2.43 in 2017, a 12.5 percent increase from 2016. We achieved a trailing
four-quarter average adjusted return on invested capital (ROIC) of 6.4 percent, 40 basis points above our 2017 weighted average cost of capital
(WACC) of 6.0 percent. Our 2017 Adjusted EBITDA was $3,187 million. We continued executing the most sweeping portfolio transformation in
115 years by acquiring, investing in, partnering with, or divesting around 20 companies since 2014 to expand and focus our product portfolio.

2017 Financial and Operating Performance Inclusive of 2017 Retroactive Biodiesel Blender’s Tax Credit(1)

The Compensation Succession Committee chose to recognize the 2017 retroactive biodiesel blender’s tax credit in the year it was earned
even though it was not approved by Congress until February 2018. The Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted ROIC metrics used to calculate the
2017 annual cash incentive target levels included the net benefits of the biodiesel blender’s tax credits and hence it was appropriate for the
Committee to consider this in the performance compensation calculation. Those values are reflected below for FY2017. The value will be
deducted from any performance compensation calculations in 2018.

adjusted to exclude the impact of certain items) are financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), and are
referred to as non-GAAP financial measures. Attached as Annex A to this Proxy Statement are more detailed definitions of these terms, a reconciliation of each to the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measure, and related disclosures about the use of these non-GAAP financial measures.

Impact of 2017 ADM Performance on Executive Pay

ADM executive total direct compensation is delivered through a mix of cash and equity awards that emphasize multiple performance factors
tied to stockholder value creation over near-, mid- and longer-term time horizons.

In 2017, we actively managed our business portfolio to further advance the largest portfolio transformation in the history of the company,
which began in 2014. We accomplished this portfolio transformation, which began in 2014, while taking billions of dollars in run-rate costs
out of the business, including $285 million in 2017, monetizing billions more in invested capital, $378 million of this in 2017. We also have
returned nearly $8 billion to shareholders since 2014, $1.5 billion of that being in 2017.

SECTION 2 — COMPONENTS OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

The company’s executive compensation program is built on a structure that balances short and long term performance. We believe our sal-
aries and performance-based annual cash incentives awards encourage and reward current business results while our LTI awards and stock
ownership guidelines reward sustained performance. The following chart summarizes the components and associated objectives of our
fixed and performance-based pay for executives in 2017:

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Salary

The Compensation/Succession Committee establishes base salaries based on an executive’s position, skills, performance, experience, tenure,
and responsibilities. The Committee annually assesses the competitiveness of base salary levels relative to salaries within the marketplace
for similar executive positions. The Committee also considers factors such as individual performance, changes in responsibilities, and/or
changes in competitive marketplace levels.

Annual Cash Incentive

We pay an annual cash incentive only if the company meets certain specified performance goals. The company’s annual cash incentive pro-
gram emphasizes company-wide performance objectives to encourage the executives to focus on overall company success and leadership to
generate the most value across the entire company. Our assessment of company performance is directly tied to stockholder expectations by
ensuring the delivery of threshold levels of forward-looking metrics such as Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted ROIC before awards may be
earned. Individual performance and the Compensation/Succession Committee’s informed judgment are incorporated to ensure actual
awards appropriately reflect the company’s operating environment and individual executive contributions.

The company’s 2017 annual cash incentive program was primarily based on several key measures of financial performance which are
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted ROIC relative to annual WACC, with final awards based on company, group/business unit, and individual
performance, as well as achievements related to the company’s strategic and business objectives. To better align with company perform-
ance, the annual cash bonus program was revised for 2017 to include a variable percentage of Adjusted EBITDA achieved and the achieve-
ment of three specific strategic goals. The three strategic goals for 2017 were: (i) achieve $225 million in run rate savings; (ii) monetize
$300 million in invested capital through specific transactions not in the normal course of business that enhance asset turnover or are
deployed for improved returns or accretion; and (iii) realize a $500 million increase in year-on-year revenue from recent acquisitions and
major projects. For 2017, the recent acquisitions and major projects included destination marketing (including Medsofts), Crosswinds, a
Morocco-based corn wet mill, Tianjin HFCS, AOR, WILD Flavors, SCI businesses, Campo Grande, Tianjin Fibersol, Harvest Innovations, Eatem
Foods, and Bioactives. Depending on the achievement of the three goals and Adjusted EBITDA, the percentage of Adjusted EBITDA in excess
of a specified threshold amount used to fund the bonus pool could range from 0.8% to 3.4%. Each strategic goal can increase the Adjusted
EBITDA percentage by 0.2%, making the total range of Adjusted EBITDA 0.8% to 4.0%.

LTI Awards

The company’s LTI program is designed to reward sustained performance and to attract and retain talented executives and employees. His-
torically, the Compensation/Succession Committee has reviewed company performance by incorporating perspectives on company and
market factors, including relative and absolute stockholder return and strategic, operating, and financial milestones.

For awards granted in 2017, LTI award grant sizes were based upon market-based equity awards. The performance-based LTI awards
granted in 2017 used a mix of PSUs (50%) and RSUs (50%) to continue the alignment of the interests of the company’s Named Executive
Officers (“NEOs”) and stockholders.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Benefits

In addition to these direct elements of pay, the company provides benefits to our NEOs to provide for basic health, welfare, and income secu-
rity needs and to support the attraction, retention, and motivation of these employees. With few exceptions, such as supplemental benefits
provided to employees whose benefits under broad-based plans are limited under applicable tax laws, the company’s philosophy is to offer
the same benefits to all U.S. salaried employees as are offered to the company’s NEOs.

pay, up to $18,500 for 2017. Employees who are 50 years of age or older can elect to
make additional contributions of up to $6,000 for 2017. The company provides a 1%
non-elective employer contribution and a match of 4% on the first 6% contributed by

an employee. The employee contribution can be made pre-tax (401(k)) or after-tax

(Roth 401(k)). Employees may also defer traditional after tax contributions into the plan
for a total $55,000 savings opportunity including all contribution types (pre-tax, Roth,

and after tax) plus any ADM matching and 1% non-elective contributions.

Those with less than 5 years of service as of January 1, 2009, participate in a qualified
cash balance pension formula where the benefit is based on an accrual of benefit based
on a stated percent of the participant’s base compensation each year. Those with 5 or
more years of service as of January 1, 2009, participate in a qualified traditional defined

benefit formula where the benefit is based on number of years of service and base
salary during the later stages of employment. Effective December 31, 2021, the

traditional defined benefit will sunset. Effective January 1, 2022, any participant in the
traditional defined benefit pension will begin to accrue a benefit under the cash balance

pension formula.

Eligible participants may defer up to 75% of their annual base salary and up to 100% of
their annual cash incentive until elected future dates. Earning credits are added to the

deferred compensation account balances based upon hypothetical investment

elections available under these plans and chosen by the participant. These hypothetical

investment options correspond with the investment options (other than company
common stock) available under the 401(k) Plan/Employee Stock Ownership Plan.

Supplemental
Retirement Plan

Employees whose retirement
benefit is limited by applicable

Non-qualified deferred compensation plan that ensures participants in the Retirement
Plan receive an aggregate retirement benefit that would have been received if not for

Healthcare and Other Benefits. NEOs receive the same healthcare benefits as other employees. We provide a benefits package for employ-
ees (including NEOs) and their dependents, portions of which may be paid for by the employee. Benefits include: life, accidental death and
dismemberment, health (including prescription drug), dental, vision, and disability insurance; dependent and healthcare reimbursement
accounts; tuition reimbursement; paid time-off; holidays; and a matching gifts program for charitable contributions.

Perquisites. Consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy, we limit executive perquisites. Perquisites are an additional form of
income to the NEOs, as shown in the Summary Compensation Table, and the NEOs are individually responsible for any taxes related to this
income. We provide our Chairman and CEO with limited personal use of company-owned aircraft. Use of the company-owned aircraft by
other NEOs is by exception only. The Compensation/Succession Committee allows our Chairman and CEO to have access to the aircraft for
personal use for security and efficiency reasons. See the notes to the Summary Compensation Table for a description of other perquisites
provided to the NEOs.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

SECTION 3 — EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION BEST PRACTICES

We annually review all elements of NEO pay and, where appropriate for our business and talent objectives and our stockholders, may make
changes to incorporate and maintain current best practices. The following table provides a summary of “what we do” and “what we don’t do”.

What We Do

What We Don’t Do

✓ Pay-for-Performance: We tie compensation to performance by

setting clear and challenging company financial goals and
individual goals and having a majority of target total direct
compensation consist of performance-based components

✓ Multiple Performance Metrics: We use performance measures

including Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted ROIC and strategic
company goals for revenue, savings, and monetization for
annual cash incentives, as well as multi-year vesting or
measurement periods

✓ Aggressive Stock Ownership and Retention Requirements:
We have stock ownership and retention requirements for our
NEOs. In 2017, we increased CEO stock ownership to 6x base
salary. No sales can be made until guidelines are met.

✓ Compensation-Related Risk Review: The Compensation/

Succession Committee regularly reviews compensation-
related risks, with the assistance of independent consultants, to
confirm that any such risks are not reasonably likely to have a
material adverse effect on the company

✓ Clawback Policy: The company has a policy to recover pre-
viously paid cash and equity based incentive compensation
from executives in the event of a financial restatement, ethical
misconduct, or other specified circumstances

✗ No Employment Contracts/Agreements: We do not have an

employment contract with any executive officer

✗ No Dividends Paid on Unvested Performance Awards: We do

not pay dividends on unvested performance-based awards

✗ No Hedging: We prohibit NEOs from engaging in hedging trans-

actions with company common stock

✗ No Repricing or Buyouts of Stock Options: Our equity plan
prohibits repricing or buyouts of underwater stock options

✗ No Gross Up of Excise Tax Payments: We do not allow gross

up of excise tax payments

✓ Use of Independent Compensation Consultant: The Compen-

sation/Succession Committee retains an independent
compensation consulting firm that performs no other consult-
ing services for the company and has no conflicts of interest

✗ No Excessive Executive Perks: With the exception of certain

benefits provided under our expatriate program, executive
perquisites are limited to executive physicals, limited personal
use of the company aircraft, and company-provided life
insurance

✓ Regular Review of Proxy Advisor Policies and Corporate

Governance Best Practices: The Compensation/Succession
Committee regularly considers proxy advisor and corporate
governance best practices as they relate to our executive
compensation programs

✗ No Excessive Pledging: We prohibit executives from pledging

company securities if they have not met stock ownership
guidelines, and we require our executives to obtain approval
from our General Counsel before pledging company securities

✓ Forward Looking LTI Awards: Beginning in 2017, our PSUs use

✗ Discontinued LTI Awards Issued with a “Look-Back”

forward looking metrics for long term incentive awards; our
NEOs receive performance share units as part of their annual
long term incentive award

Approach: In 2017, we effectively transitioned away from a
look-back approach for long-term incentive awards and moved
to PSU awards that are based on forward-looking metrics

✓ Double Trigger: Double trigger accelerated vesting of equity

awards applied for a change in control, previously a single trig-
ger was applied.

Shareholder Engagement

Results of 2017 Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation

At the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we held the company’s seventh advisory vote on executive compensation. Approximately 93%
of the votes cast were in favor of this advisory proposal. The Compensation/Succession Committee believes that this strong level of support,
and the similarly strong levels of support manifested in prior periods, affirm broad stockholder agreement with the alignment of existing
executive compensation programs with stockholder interests and the Compensation/Succession Committee’s approach. After making sig-
nificant changes to the executive compensation program in 2017 to more closely align with stockholder interests, the Committee considered
this outcome in determining that no substantive changes in the executive compensation programs would occur for 2018. At the Annual
Meeting of Stockholders to be held on May 3, 2018, we will again hold an advisory vote on executive compensation. The Compensation/
Succession Committee will continue to consider stockholder feedback and the results from this year’s and future advisory votes on executive
compensation.

Our company routinely conducts extensive proactive outreach to engage with key institutional shareholders in order to understand and
address the key issues that are important to our shareholders as well as fostering long-term relationships. During the course of the year, an
engagement team consisting of our Lead Independent Director, Compensation/Succession Committee Chair, SVP of Human Resources, Gen-
eral Counsel, and Investor Relations and Sustainability staff met with several institutional shareholders to discuss matters of governance,
compensation, environmental, and other issues.

Executive Stock Ownership

The Board of Directors believes that it is important for each member of our senior management to acquire and maintain a significant owner-
ship position in shares of our common stock to further align the interests of senior management with the stockholders’ interests. Accord-
ingly, we have adopted a policy regarding ownership of shares of our common stock by senior management. The policy calls for members of
senior management to own shares of common stock with a fair market value within a range of one to six times that individual’s base salary,
depending on each individual’s level of responsibility with our company. The stock ownership guidelines applicable to our NEOs are set
forth on page 20 under “Executive Stock Ownership.” As of March 12, 2018, each of our NEOs is in compliance with our stock ownership
guidelines.

SECTION 4 — OVERSIGHT OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

The Role of the Compensation/Succession Committee

The Compensation/Succession Committee is composed solely of independent directors and is responsible to the board of directors and the
company’s stockholders for establishing the company’s compensation philosophy and establishing and administering the company’s
compensation policies and programs consistent with this philosophy. The Compensation/Succession Committee’s responsibilities are set
forth in its charter, which is available on the company’s website, www.adm.com. Additional information regarding the Compensation/
Succession Committee’s authority to determine compensation can be found under the caption “Compensation/Succession Committee” else-
where in this proxy.

The Role of the Board

The Board approves the company’s business plan, which is one of the factors used to set financial business objectives for the annual cash
incentive plan. The independent directors establish and approve all performance criteria for evaluating the Chairman and CEO and annually
evaluate the performance of the Chairman and CEO based on these criteria. The non-management directors also ratify the Chairman and
CEO’s compensation. The board can also provide input and ratification on any additional compensation-related issues. The Board also con-
ducts an annual review of the company’s performance.

The Role of the Compensation/Succession Committee Consultant

The Compensation/Succession Committee retained Pay Governance LLC as its independent executive compensation consultant. Pay Gover-
nance provides no other services to the company. The independent compensation consultant reports directly to the Compensation/Succession
Committee, and provides the Compensation/Succession Committee with objective and expert analyses and independent advice on executive
and director compensation and other matters in support of the Compensation/Succession Committee’s responsibilities under its charter. Each
Compensation/Succession Committee meeting includes an executive session where the Compensation/Succession Committee meets

exclusively with the independent consultant; company management is not included in these sessions. Outside of these sessions, the
independent consultant interacts with the company’s management team solely on behalf of the Compensation/Succession Committee to assist
the Compensation/Succession Committee in fulfilling its duties and responsibilities. The Compensation/Succession Committee will only retain
consultants that it believes will provide independent advice. The Compensation/Succession Committee has assessed the independence of Pay
Governance pursuant to the SEC’s and NYSE’s rules and concluded that the work Pay Governance has performed does not raise any conflict of
interest.

The Role of Executives

To assist the Compensation/Succession Committee in determining compensation for the other NEOs, the company’s Chairman and CEO par-
ticipates in discussions with the Compensation/Succession Committee regarding the other officers’ performance and compensation. The
Chairman and CEO provides the Compensation/Succession Committee with an assessment of the other NEOs’ performance, both as
individuals and with respect to the functions or business units they oversee. The Chairman and CEO also recommends to the Compensation/
Succession Committee, but does not vote on, annual base salary adjustments, individual and group performance factors, and short and long-
term incentive award target levels that should be paid to the other NEOs.

The company’s Senior Vice President of Human Resources oversees all employee compensation and the administration of benefits programs,
under the oversight and direction of the Compensation/Succession Committee. He prepares the majority of the materials for the Compensa-
tion/Succession Committee meetings and provides analyses that assist the Compensation/Succession Committee with its decisions, such as
summaries of competitive market practices, summaries of the company’s succession planning actions, and reports regarding the company’s
performance. In addition, throughout the year, he facilitates meetings with management to help the Compensation/Succession Committee
gain a better understanding of company performance. He ensures that the Compensation/Succession Committee is provided a rigorous
assessment of year-to-date performance at each of its meetings. At the direction of the Chairman of the Compensation/Succession Commit-
tee, the company’s Senior Vice President of Human Resources involves other members of management in portions of the Compensation/
Succession Committee meetings to participate in discussions related to company and individual performance and the company’s compensa-
tion and benefit programs. The company’s executives leave meetings during discussions of individual compensation actions affecting them
personally and during all executive sessions, unless requested to attend by the Compensation/Succession Committee.

The Committee’s Decisions Incorporate the Company’s Executive Compensation Objectives

• Alignment of Executive and Stockholder Interests. We believe that a substantial portion of total compensation should be delivered in the

form of equity in order to align the interests of the company’s NEOs with the interests of the company’s stockholders. Our RSU awards
typically vest three years from the date of grant, and our stock option grants typically vest pro rata over a five year period. Our PSU
awards typically have a three year performance period and vest only if certain performance metrics are achieved. In 2017, an average of
69% of actual total direct compensation paid to our NEOs was in the form of equity awards. The 2017 awards were comprised of time-
based RSUs and performance-based PSUs which use three forward looking metrics focused on the three-year Adjusted EBITDA from 2017
to 2019, Adjusted ROIC, and relative TSR as compared to the S&P 100 Industrials Index. We also protect our stockholders’ interest by
including a clawback provision in agreements for long-term incentive awards, enabling the company to recover awards if the recipient
engages in a broad range of prohibited conduct, including post-vesting non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions.

• Enable the Company to Attract and Retain Top Executive Talent. Stockholders are best served when we can attract, retain and motivate
talented executives with compensation packages that are competitive and fair. The company’s compensation program for NEOs delivers a
mix of salary, annual cash incentives, and long-term incentives targeted to be market competitive as described below. As a large, global
company engaged in multiple lines of business, the company’s competition for talent, business, and investment is broad.

• NEO Compensation Should Reflect the Company’s Results. The company’s executive compensation program emphasizes variable,

performance-based pay and is targeted and assessed in the aggregate, although the Compensation/Succession Committee reviews each
component independently as well. Base salary is reviewed annually and adjusted based on a variety of factors including, in addition to an
evaluation relative to competitive market practices as described above, a subjective evaluation of each NEO’s overall performance, tenure,
and changes in responsibilities if applicable. Annual cash incentives are paid if, and to the extent that, corporate goals approved by the
Compensation/Succession Committee are attained. For example, the annual cash incentive plan for 2017 targeted awards at 100% to
200% of each NEO’s base salary, but actual payouts ranged from 82% to 173% of the target level depending on performance against the
specific goals. Performance-based equity compensation is assessed in a manner similar to the annual cash incentive compensation and is
designed to reward measurable results.

SECTION 5 — 2017 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

This Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes the compensation of the following named executive officers, or NEOs:

R. G. Young

D. C. Findlay

G. A. Morris

J. D. Taets

Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President (“Chairman and CEO”)

Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”)

Senior Vice President and President, Global Business Readiness (as of March 19, 2018); Senior
Vice President and President, Ag Services (prior to March 19, 2018)

Of the total direct compensation that we consider attributable to 2017 performance, the company’s NEOs received, on average, 84% of
actual total direct compensation in variable pay and 69% of actual total direct compensation in equity awards for 2017. Although the Com-
pensation/Succession Committee has not adopted a policy for allocating the various elements of total direct compensation, we do place
greater emphasis on variable pay for executives with more significant responsibilities, reflecting their greater capacity to affect the compa-
ny’s performance and results. For these purposes, we consider the base salary paid in 2017, the annual cash incentive earned in 2017 (paid
in early 2018), and the award value of equity granted early in 2017 with a look at performance from 2017 to 2019. The equity award value
represents the dollar amount of such awards as approved by the Compensation/Succession Committee.

(1) The award value of LTI represents the dollar amount of such awards as approved by the Compensation/Succession Committee, and differs from the grant date fair value of such
awards as shown in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table and the Summary Compensation Table because of timing differences in the valuation methodologies used.

2017 Annual Cash Incentives

Annual cash incentives are determined by the degree to which company financial performance expectations are achieved and the Compensa-
tion/Succession Committee’s independent assessment of the company’s performance as well as the individual performance of the NEO,
which makes up 25% of the annual cash bonus target. This outcome may then be adjusted within a range of –25% to +25% based on the
Compensation/Succession Committee’s assessment of individual and group performance. For 2017 annual cash incentive payout, the Com-
pensation Succession Committee chose to recognize the 2017 retroactive biodiesel blender’s tax credit in the year it was earned even though
it was not approved by Congress until February 2018. Those values are reflected below for FY2017 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted ROIC.
The value will be deducted from any performance compensation calculations in 2018. The formula used to calculate an annual cash
incentive payout for NEOs can be expressed as follows:

Company Performance Payout Percentage (75%) + Individual Performance Percentage (25%) = Overall Payout Percentage

Individual Performance Components

Based on business results and the economic environment for 2017 performance, the Compensation/Succession Committee elected to award
the Chairman and CEO a 25% individual performance percentage based on accomplishments described above. The Compensation/Succession
Committee incorporated its and the full board’s assessment of the Chairman and CEO’s performance and full company performance when
approving Mr. Luciano’s individual performance percentage. Mr. Findlay and Mr. Young received an individual performance percentage of
25%, and Mr. Taets and Mr. Morris received an individual performance percentage of 20%, in recognition of their performance against
individual and company goals described above. Individual performance can range from 0% to 50% based upon performance against goals for

the year. The 25% individual performance percentage is used for target performance. Our leaders are responsible for driving performance
company-wide and their individual performance rating is a result of their performance for the year.

The Resulting Annual Cash Incentive for Each NEO

The purpose of the annual cash incentive program is to reward performance based on the achievement of company, business, and individual
objectives. At the start of each fiscal year, the Compensation/Succession Committee approves minimum, target, and maximum annual cash
incentive levels for each NEO. Target annual cash incentive levels are expressed as a percentage of salary. Based on company and individual
performance, annual cash incentive payouts can range between 0% and 200% of the target annual cash incentive. Based on the determi-
nation of the company and individual performance factors as described above, each NEO, excluding Mr. Taets and Mr. Morris, received an
annual cash incentive for 2017, payable in Q1 of 2018, equal to 86.6% (82.1% company performance making up 75% of the total annual
cash incentive award plus individual award amounts of 25%) of his target annual cash incentive. Mr. Taets and Mr. Morris received an
annual cash incentive equal to 81.6% of their total target based upon 20% individual performance.

Equity-Based Long-Term Incentives & How They Were Determined for 2017

The company’s LTI Program aligns the interests of executives with those of stockholders by rewarding the achievement of long-term stock-
holder value, supporting stock ownership, and encouraging long-term service with the company. In the following sections, we discuss the
process for determining equity grants delivered under the company’s LTI Program.

In terms of grant size and grant form, the company’s LTI awards in 2017 transitioned from awards based upon a historical review to awards
based upon market competitive LTI that consist of performance share units (PSUs) and restricted stock units (RSUs) with three-year vesting.
The overall LTI award value was allocated 50% to PSUs and 50% to RSUs. The transition to the forward-looking LTI program was made to
better align our equity program with market practice and strengthen the focus of our equity program on growth and future value creation
for shareholders. If this does not occur, there will be no payout for the other metrics. The February 2017 grants appear in the Grants of Plan-
Based Awards table and are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table information for FY2017.

ADM Proxy Statement 2018

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Terms of the company’s equity awards granted in February 2017 generally are as follows:

• PSUs with a three-year vest after certain performance criteria are met. Payout can range for 0% to 200% and fluctuate based upon share

price. PSU metrics are: (i) the company’s relative TSR as compared to the companies in the S&P 100 Industrials Index (25% weighting),
(ii) the degree to which the company achieves specified Adjusted ROIC goals (37.5% weighting), and (iii) the degree to which the compa-
ny’s Adjusted EBITDA exceeds its Adjusted EBITDA during fiscal years 2014–2016 (37.5% weighting). Before the PSU can pay out, the
company’s Adjusted EBITDA must exceed its Adjusted EBITDA during fiscal years 2014–2016. If this does not occur, there will be no
payout for the other metrics.

• RSUs typically vest three years after the date of grant.

• Upon the death of the executive, RSUs granted under the LTI Program vest immediately and PSUs will vest based on actual performance

during the truncated performance period and on a pro rata basis based on the target number of units for the year following the truncated
performance period. RSUs and PSUs continue to vest if the executive leaves the company because of disability or retirement (age 55 or
greater with 10 or more years of service). A detailed description of the change-in-control provisions is contained in Section 8 below. For
grants with respect to 2012 and beyond, award agreements include forfeiture and clawback provisions as described in Section 8.

Our Policy for When Grants are Made

The Compensation/Succession Committee grants all equity awards to NEOs, and no attempt is made to time the granting of these awards in
relation to the release of material, non-public information. The exercise price of all stock options is set at fair market value on the grant date.
Under the 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan, fair market value is the closing market price of the company’s common stock on the last trad-
ing day prior to the date of grant. The Compensation/Succession Committee meets during the first fiscal quarter of each fiscal year and
determines the annual equity awards granted to NEOs. These awards are issued promptly following the date of the Compensation/
Succession Committee’s meeting and approval. In addition to annual awards, the NEOs may receive awards when they join the company or
change their status, including promotions.

SECTION 6 — PEER GROUP

The Compensation/Succession Committee utilizes the 98 companies that comprise the S&P 100 Industrial Index as a peer group to evaluate
whether executive officer pay levels are aligned with performance on a relative basis.

SECTION 7 — EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS,
SEVERANCE, AND CHANGE-IN-CONTROL BENEFITS

No Employment Contracts

None of our NEOs have an employment contract or separation
agreement. Consistent with our approach of rewarding perform-
ance, employment is not guaranteed, and either ADM or the NEO
may terminate the employment relationship at any time.

ADM maintains a severance program that serves as a guideline for
severance benefits that may be provided to various levels of
employees upon termination of their employment without cause,
but the program does not create a contractual right to receive any
severance benefits on the part of the employee. The Compensation/
Succession Committee generally requires the employee to enter into
a non-competition and/or non-solicitation agreement in exchange
for receiving severance under the program.

Change-in-Control Provisions

Upon a change in control of the company, NEOs may receive certain
protections related to their LTI awards, as described more fully
below, and other compensation as detailed in the sections titled
“Pension Benefits,” “Nonqualified Deferred Compensation,” and
“Termination of Employment and Change-in-Control
Arrangements.” NEOs are not eligible to receive any other cash sev-
erance, continued health and welfare benefits, tax gross ups or other
change-in-control benefits.

The Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Long-Term Incentive Plan
provides non-employee directors and all employees, including
executive officers, change-in-control protections for their LTI
awards. For awards granted in 2017 and onward, if a
change-in-control occurs with respect to the company, the equity
grants held by the company’s executive officers generally will vest

immediately in full in the case of RSUs and on a modified pro rata
basis for PSUs if the equity award does not continue because it is not
assumed or replaced or the award is assumed or replaced, but the
executive officer’s employment is terminated for reasons other than
cause or good reason within 24 months of the change in control
(referred to as “double trigger” vesting). The double trigger accel-
erated vesting had been adopted to provide the executives with
some assurance that they will not be disadvantaged with respect to
their equity awards in the event of a change-in-control of the com-
pany. This assurance increases the value of these awards to the
executives, which in turn enhances retention.

SECTION 8 — GOVERNANCE FEATURES OF OUR
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS

Clawback Provisions

We have included clawback provisions in the company’s long-term
incentive award agreements that provide us with the ability to
recover long-term incentive compensation for a broad range of
reasons. This aggressive approach to recoupment of long-term
incentive compensation reflects the company’s commitment to pro-
tecting stockholder value.

For awards granted in August 2012 and beyond, we have
implemented an additional clawback policy for all cash and equity-
based long-term incentive awards. Specifically, this policy provides
for the recoupment of any cash or equity incentive awards for a
period of three years from the date of award. We have the right to
clawback incentive payments made to NEOs and certain other
members of senior management in the event of a financial restate-
ment or ethical misconduct. In 2015 and in 2017, additional lan-
guage was added to equity awards which includes post-vesting
non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions prohibiting com-
petitive activity and solicitation of ADM customers and employees.

price of the company’s securities. In addition, employees and direc-
tors are required to review any pledging of company securities with
the company’s General Counsel prior to engaging in such activity.

The company’s Insider Trading Policy also provides that all trans-
actions in our company’s securities by the company’s directors, the
NEOs, and certain other officers and employees must be pre-cleared
by the company’s law department.

How Recent Revisions to Section 162(m) of the Internal
Revenue Code Impact the Company

Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code as in effect prior to the
enactment of tax reform legislation in December 2017 generally dis-
allowed a tax deduction to public corporations for compensation paid
in excess of $1 million annually to the Chairman and CEO and the three
other most highly-compensated executive officers, other than the CFO,
unless the compensation in excess of $1 million qualified as
“performance-based” compensation. Recent tax reform legislation
retained the $1 million deduction limit, but repealed the performance-
based compensation exemption from the deduction limit and expanded
the definition of “covered employees,” effective for taxable years
beginning after December 31, 2017. Consequently, compensation paid
in 2018 and later years to our NEOs in excess of $1 million will not be
deductible unless it qualifies for transitional relief applicable to certain
binding, written performance-based compensation arrangements that
were in place as of November 2, 2017.

The Compensation/Succession Committee continues to believe that
shareholder interests are best served if its discretion and flexibility
in structuring and awarding compensation is not restricted, even
though some compensation awards may have resulted in the past,
and are expected to result in the future, in non-deductible
compensation expenses to the Company. The Compensation/
Succession Committee also believes that the amount of any expected
loss of a tax deduction under Section 162(m) will be insignificant to
the company’s overall tax position.

The Company’s Evaluation of Its Compensation Programs
as They Relate to Risk

On an ongoing basis, the Compensation/Succession Committee, with
input from management, assesses potential risks associated with
compensation decisions and discusses them with our board of direc-
tors if warranted. To date, we have not identified any incentive
compensation programs that encourage inappropriate risk taking.
We have established a policy under which we engage an outside

consultant every other year to review the company’s programs and
independently assess the risk in them.

In 2017, ADM engaged an outside consultant, The Korn Ferry Hay
Group (“Hay”), to assist the Compensation/Succession Committee in
evaluating the risk in the company’s compensation programs. In
conducting an independent assessment, Hay reviewed all of the
company’s incentive compensation programs and determined there
were no compensation programs that encourage inappropriate risk-
taking or the manipulation of earnings. The detailed findings of this
review were discussed with management and presented to the
Compensation/Succession Committee in November 2017. The
incentive programs were reviewed and found that none of the plan
presents significant risk to the organization. Another independent
review of the company’s incentive programs will be conducted dur-
ing 2019 and reported to the Compensation/Succession Committee.

The Company’s Mindful Approach to Addressing Liabilities
Associated with Retirement Programs

The Compensation/Succession Committee is mindful that the
non-qualified deferred compensation and supplemental retirement
plans create financial statement liabilities. We generally do not set
amounts aside in a “rabbi” trust for the benefit of participants in the
deferred compensation or supplemental retirement plans. However,
the deferred compensation plans have “rabbi” trust funding triggers in
the event of a potential change in control of the company. This trigger
provides some measure of assurance to employees that amounts they
have chosen to defer from their current compensation will be held for
their benefit, although still subject to creditor claims as required under
the applicable tax law. In maintaining the non-qualified plans, the
Compensation/Succession Committee has duly considered that the
federal income tax deduction available to the company occurs at the
same time that participants are paid benefits from the applicable plan.

The company is required to fund its qualified pension plans in a
manner consistent with the minimum funding requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code and the Employee Retirement Income Secu-
rity Act. Historically, the company has made contributions in excess
of the minimum to maintain its plans at or near a full funding level
relative to the accrued benefit obligation.

Compensation/Succession Committee Report

The Compensation/Succession Committee has reviewed and discussed
the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management. Based
upon this review and discussion, the Compensation/Succession Com-
mittee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation
Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement.

(1) Stock awards in 2017 consisted of restricted stock unit (RSU) awards and performance share unit (PSU) awards. The amounts reported in this column represent the aggregate
grant date fair value of the RSU awards for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015 and of the target level of the PSU awards for fiscal year 2017. We calculated these amounts in
accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718 utilizing the assumptions discussed in Note 11 to our financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017,
December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015. The grant date fair value of the 2017 RSUs and the grant date fair value of the 2017 PSUs if target performance and maximum
performance is achieved are as follows:

(2) The amounts reported in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the option awards for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We calculated these
amounts in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718 utilizing the assumptions discussed in Note 11 to our financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31,
2017, December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015.

(3) The amounts reported in this column represent amounts earned under our annual incentive plan during each of the respective fiscal periods shown. In each case, the amounts
were paid shortly after the close of the applicable fiscal period.

(4) The amounts reported in this column for 2017 represents the aggregate change in actuarial present value of the NEO’s accumulated benefit under all defined benefit and actuarial
pension plans from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, using the same assumptions used for financial reporting purposes except that retirement age is assumed to be the
normal retirement age (65) specified in the plans. No NEO received above market or preferential earnings on deferred compensation. To derive the change in pension value for
financial reporting purposes, the assumptions used to value pension liabilities on December 31, 2017 were an interest rate of 3.73% for the ADM Retirement Plan, an interest rate of
3.61% for the ADM Supplemental Retirement Plan, and mortality was determined using the RP2014 mortality table, with a white collar adjustment, projected generationally using
Scale MP-2017. The assumptions used to value pension liabilities on December 31, 2016 were an interest rate of 4.10% for the ADM Retirement Plan, an interest rate of 3.90% for
the ADM Supplemental Retirement Plan, and mortality determined using the RP2014 mortality table, with a white collar adjustment, projected generationally using Scale MP-2016.

(5) The amounts reported in this column for 2017 include costs for personal use of company aircraft, imputed value of company-provided life insurance, costs for executive
healthcare services, company contributions under our 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan, charitable gifts pursuant to the company’s matching charitable gift program
which is available to substantially all full-time employees and non-employee directors, and, for Mr. Taets, expenses related to the completion of his overseas assignment. Specific
perquisites and other items applicable to each NEO listed are identified below by an “X”. Where a perquisite or benefit exceeded $10,000 for an individual, the dollar amount is given.

Mr. Taets’ expenses related to the completion of his overseas assignment included $1,833 related to certain expatriate tax services and tax gross ups related thereto as well as $9,113
in relocation expenses.

(6) Mr. Morris first became an NEO in 2016. The additional cash award of $640,000 paid in March of 2017 was in recognition of his efforts in connection with the integration of WFSI
during 2015 and 2016.

(7) Mr. Taets’ title changed on March 19, 2018. Prior to March 19, 2018, Mr. Taets was our Senior Vice President and President, Ag Services.

Aggregate incremental cost to our company of perquisites and personal benefits is determined as follows. In the case of payment of expenses
related to items such as executive healthcare services and relocation expenses, incremental cost is determined by the amounts paid to third-
party providers. In the case of personal use of company-owned aircraft, incremental cost is based solely on the cost per hour to the company
to operate the aircraft, and does not include fixed costs that do not change based on usage, such as purchase costs of the aircraft and
non-trip-related hangar expenses. Our direct operating cost per hour of an aircraft is based on the actual costs of fuel, on-board catering,
aircraft maintenance, landing fees, trip-related hangar and parking costs, and smaller variable costs, divided by the number of hours the
aircraft was operated during the year.

(1) The grant date fair value is generally the amount the company would expense in its financial statements over the award’s service period under FASB ASC Topic 718. With respect
to the PSUs the value represents the probable outcome of the performance condition using target payout levels. See Footnote 1 to the Summary Compensation Table for additional
detail.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

All of the awards in the table above were granted under our 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan. The awards shown in the columns des-
ignated “Estimated Future Payouts Under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards” were made pursuant to our annual cash incentive plan. The
amounts actually paid with respect to these awards are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table in the “Non-Equity Incentive Plan
Compensation” column. See “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” for more information about our annual cash incentive plan.

The awards shown in the column designated “Estimated Future Payouts Under Equity Incentive Plan Awards” in the table above are PSU
awards and vest in three years if the company achieves certain performance goals over a three year performance period (2017–2019). The
2017 PSU metrics are: (i) the company’s relative TSR as compared to the companies in the S&P 100 Industrials Index (25% weighting),
(ii) the degree to which the company achieves specified Adjusted ROIC goals (37.5% weighting), and (iii) the degree to which the company’s
Adjusted EBITDA exceeds its Adjusted EBITDA during fiscal years 2014–2016 (37.5% weighting). Before the PSU can pay out, the company’s
Adjusted EBITDA must exceed its Adjusted EBITDA during fiscal years 2014–2016. If this does not occur, there will be no payout for the
other metrics.

All of the awards shown in the “All Other Stock Awards” column in the table above are RSUs awards and vest in full three years after the date
of the grant. Under the terms of the RSU award agreements, the recipient of the award may receive cash dividend equivalents on RSUs prior
to their vesting date, but may not transfer or pledge the units in any manner prior to vesting. Dividend equivalents on RSUs are paid at the
same rate as dividends to our stockholders generally.

The 2017 RSU and PSU awards are subject to double trigger accelerated vesting and payout upon a change in control only if the award recipi-
ent’s employment is terminated without cause or if the award recipient resigns for good reason, in each case, within 24 months after the
change in control, or if the surviving entity in the change-in-control transaction refuses to continue, assume, or replace the awards. In such
instance the 2017 RSU awards will vest in full immediately, and the 2017 PSU awards will vest based on actual performance during the
truncated performance period and on a pro rata basis based on a target number of units for the year following the truncated performance
period. Upon the death of an award recipient, vesting of the RSU awards will accelerate in full while the vesting of the PSU awards will accel-
erate in the manner described in the preceding sentence. If an award recipient’s employment ends as a result of disability or retirement,
both the RSU and PSU awards will continue to vest in accordance with the original vesting schedule. If an award recipient’s employment
ends for any other reason, unvested RSU and PSU awards will be forfeited. With respect to each of the RSU and PSU awards described above,
if an award recipient’s employment is terminated for cause, or if the recipient breaches a non-competition, non-solicitation or confidentiality
restriction or participates in an activity deemed by us to be detrimental to our company, the recipient’s unvested units will be forfeited, and
any shares issued in settlement of units that have already vested must be returned to us or the recipient must pay us the amount of the
shares’ fair market value as of the date they were issued.

The impact of a termination of employment or change-in-control of our company on RSU and PSU awards held by our named executive offi-
cers is quantified in the “Termination of Employment and Change-in-Control Arrangements” section below.

(1) The number of years of credited service was calculated as of the pension plan measurement date used for financial statement reporting purposes, which was December 31, 2017.
For each of the named executive officers, the number of years of credited service is equal to the number of actual years of service with our company.

(2) The assumptions used to value pension liabilities as of December 31, 2017 were an interest rate of 3.73% for the ADM Retirement Plan and 3.61% for the ADM Supplemental
Retirement Plan and mortality was determined under the RP2014 mortality table, with a white collar adjustment, projected generationally using scale MP-2017. Mr. Morris and
Mr. Taets participate in the final average pay formula under the ADM Retirement Plan and the ADM Supplemental Retirement Plan, while Mr. Luciano, Mr. Young, and Mr. Findlay
participate in the cash balance formula under those plans. The amounts reported for Mr. Luciano, Mr. Young, and Mr. Findlay are the present value of their respective projected
normal retirement benefit under the Retirement and Supplemental Plans at December 31, 2017. The amounts reported are calculated by projecting the balance in the accounts
forward to age 65 by applying a 2.88% interest rate, converting to a single-life annuity as of age 65, and then discounting back to December 31, 2017 using the assumptions specified
above. The total account balance for Mr. Luciano at December 31, 2017 under the Retirement and Supplemental Plans was $209,730, the total account balance for Mr. Young at
December 31, 2017 under the Retirement and Supplemental Plans was $163,104, and the total account balance for Mr. Findlay at December 31, 2017 under the Retirement and
Supplemental Plans was $87,180, which are the amounts that would have been distributable if such individuals had terminated employment on that date.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

Qualified Retirement Plan

We sponsor the ADM Retirement Plan (the “Retirement Plan”), which is a qualified defined benefit plan under Section 401(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code. The Retirement Plan covers eligible salaried employees of our company and its participating affiliates.

Effective January 1, 2009, the Retirement Plan was amended to provide benefits determined under a cash balance formula. The cash balance
formula applies to any participant entering or re-entering the plan on or after January 1, 2009 and to any participant who had less than five
years of service prior to January 1, 2009. For a participant with an accrued benefit but less than five years of service prior to January 1, 2009,
an account was established on January 1, 2009 with an opening balance equal to the present value of his or her accrued benefit determined
under the final average pay formula. The accrued benefits of all other participants to whom the cash balance formula does not apply con-
tinue to be determined under the traditional final average pay formula. Messrs. Luciano, Young, and Findlay participate in the cash balance
formula, while Messrs. Morris and Taets participate in the final average pay formula.

A participant whose accrued benefit is determined under the
cash balance formula has an individual hypothetical account
established under the Retirement Plan. Pay and interest
credits are made on an annual basis to the participant’s
account. Pay credits are equal to a percentage of the
participant’s earnings for the year based on the sum of the
participant’s age and years of service at the end of the year
under the schedule to the right.

day of the plan year, using an interest rate based upon the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds, subject to a minimum annual interest rate of
1.95%. The participant’s pension benefit will be the amount of the balance in the participant’s account at the time that the pension becomes
payable under the Retirement Plan. The pension payable to a participant whose accrued benefit under the final average pay formula was
converted to the cash balance formula at January 1, 2009, if paid in annuity form, will be increased to reflect any additional benefit which the
participant would have received in that form under the traditional formula, but only with respect to the benefit accrued by the participant
prior to January 1, 2009. A participant under the cash balance formula becomes vested in a benefit under the Retirement Plan after three
years of service. There are no special early retirement benefits under the cash balance formula.

For a participant whose accrued benefit is determined under the final average pay formula, the formula calculates a life annuity payable at a
normal retirement age of 65 based upon a participant’s highest average earnings over 60 consecutive months during the last 15 years of
employment. The final average pay formula provides a benefit of 36.0% of a participant’s final average earnings, plus 16.5% of the partic-
ipant’s final average earnings in excess of Social Security “covered compensation.” This benefit accrues ratably over 30 years of service. A
participant accrues an additional benefit of 0.5% of final average earnings for years of service in excess of 30. Early retirement is available at
age 55 with 10 years of service. The life annuity payable at early retirement is subsidized relative to the normal retirement benefit. The pay-
ment amount in life annuity form is 97% of the full benefit amount at age 64, and 50% at age 55, with adjustments between those two ages. All
participants under the final average pay formula are vested in their benefits under the Retirement Plan, based on five years of service.

Earnings for purposes of the cash balance and the final average pay formulas generally include amounts reflected as pay on Form W-2,
increased by 401(k) Plan pre-tax deferrals and elective “cafeteria plan” contributions, and decreased by bonuses, expense allowances/
reimbursements, severance pay, income from stock option and restricted stock awards or cash payments in lieu thereof, merchandise or
service discounts, amounts paid in a form other than cash, and other fringe benefits. Annual earnings are limited as required under Sec-
tion 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code.

When a participant is eligible for a pension, the participant has a choice of a life annuity, a joint and 50% survivor annuity, a joint and 75%
survivor annuity, or a joint and 100% survivor annuity. Each joint and survivor annuity form is the actuarial equivalent of the life annuity
payable at the same age, with actuarial equivalence determined using the IRS prescribed mortality table under Section 417(e) of the Internal
Revenue Code and an interest rate assumption of 6%. Cash balance participants may also elect a lump-sum payment option.

In December 2017, the Retirement Plan was amended to freeze final average pay formula benefit accruals as of December 31, 2021 for all
active final average pay formula participants in the Retirement Plan on that date. Final average pay accrued benefits would be calculated as
if the participant terminated employment on the earlier of their actual termination date or December 31, 2021. The final average pay benefit

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

will not be converted to a cash balance benefit, but will remain subject to the final average pay benefit rules. As of January 1, 2022, all Retire-
ment Plan participants will accrue future benefits under the cash balance formula, based on their age and total years of service.

Supplemental Retirement Plan

We also sponsor the ADM Supplemental Retirement Plan (the “Supplemental Plan”), which is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan
under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The Supplemental Plan covers participants in the Retirement Plan whose benefit under
such plan is limited by the benefit limits of Section 415 or the compensation limit of Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code. The
Supplemental Plan also covers any employee whose Retirement Plan benefit is reduced by participation in the ADM Deferred Compensation
Plan. Participation by those employees who otherwise qualify for coverage is at the discretion of the Board, the Compensation/Succession
Committee or, in the case of employees other than executive officers, the Chief Executive Officer. The Supplemental Plan provides the addi-
tional benefit that would have been provided under the Retirement Plan but for the limits of Section 415 or 401(a)(17) of the Internal Rev-
enue Code, and but for the fact that elective contributions made by the participant under the ADM Deferred Compensation Plan are not
included in the compensation base for the Retirement Plan. A participant is not vested in a benefit under the Supplemental Plan unless and
until the participant is vested in a benefit under the Retirement Plan, which requires three years of service for a cash balance formula partic-
ipant and five years of service for a final average pay formula participant for vesting. A separate payment form election is required with
respect to the Supplemental Plan benefit from among the same options available under the Retirement Plan, subject to the limitations of
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation

The following table summarizes information with respect to the participation of the named executive officers in the ADM Deferred Compen-
sation Plan for Selected Management Employees I and II, which are non-qualified deferred compensation plans, for the fiscal year ended

(1) The amount reported in this column was not reported in the Summary Compensation Table as part of Mr. Taets’ compensation for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017
because none of the earnings is considered to be “above market.”

(2) Of the amount shown in this column, $674,977 was previously reported as compensation to Mr. Taets in the Summary Compensation Table in previous years, not all of which is
reflected in this column due in part to the distribution to Mr. Taets of $369,697 during 2017.

We sponsor two nonqualified deferred compensation plans — the ADM Deferred Compensation Plan for Selected Management Employees I
and II (referred to as “Deferred Comp Plan I” and “Deferred Comp Plan II”, respectively). Deferred Comp Plan I was frozen as to new partic-
ipants and new deferrals effective January 1, 2005, and is maintained as a separate “grandfathered” plan under Section 409A of the Internal
Revenue Code. Deferred Comp Plan II is structured to comply with Section 409A. Deferred Comp Plan II covers salaried employees of our
company and its affiliates whose annualized base salary is $175,000 or more. Participation by those employees who otherwise qualify for
coverage is at the discretion of the Board, the Compensation/Succession Committee or, in the case of employees other than executive offi-
cers, the Chief Executive Officer.

A participant in Deferred Comp Plan II can defer up to 75% of his or her base salary and up to 100% of his or her bonus. Earnings credits are
added based upon hypothetical investment elections made by participants. A participant can elect each year when to be paid the base salary
or bonus amounts deferred for that year, by electing to be paid upon a specified future date prior to separation from service or following
retirement, in the form of a lump sum or in installments over a period of two to twenty years. If a participant separates from service prior to
the elected payment date (or prior to qualifying for retirement), the payment will be made in a lump sum after separation from service,
subject to the six month “specified employee” payment delay required by Section 409A. Withdrawals are allowed upon a showing of
“hardship” by the participant in accordance with Section 409A. Small account balances of $10,000 or less are paid in a lump sum only.

ADM Proxy Statement 2018

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

Deferred Comp Plan II provides for “make-whole” company credits to the extent that a participant’s election to defer under the Deferred
Comp Plan II causes a loss of company contributions under the 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan. No “make-whole” company
credits were made on behalf of the named executive officers for fiscal year 2017.

A participant with an account balance remaining under Deferred Comp Plan I continues to receive earnings credits on such account based
upon hypothetical investment elections made by the participant. A participant can establish up to two “scheduled distribution accounts” that
are payable upon dates specified by the participant in either a lump sum or installments over a period of two to four years. A participant also
can take unscheduled withdrawals of up to 25% of the balance of his or her accounts, subject to a withdrawal penalty of 10% of the with-
drawn amount. Only one such unscheduled withdrawal is allowed in any year. Withdrawals also are allowed upon a showing of “hardship”
by the participant. A participant’s account under Deferred Comp Plan I is paid following termination of employment. Payment following
termination of employment is in a lump sum, except that a participant can elect to have installments paid over a period of two to 20 years if
termination of employment occurs after retirement eligibility or due to disability.

Deferred Comp Plan I balances are fully-vested. A participant becomes vested in his or her company credits to Deferred Comp Plan II after
two years of service. Unpaid amounts at death are paid to designated beneficiaries.

The hypothetical investment options available under Deferred Comp Plans I and II are determined by us and correspond with the invest-
ment options (other than our company’s common stock) that are made available to participants in the qualified 401(k) and Employee Stock
Ownership Plan. These investment options are listed below, and the plan earnings credited to each participant’s account in these plans
correspond to the earnings performance of the investment selected. Participants in the Deferred Comp Plans I and II may reallocate the
amount of new deferrals and existing account balances among these investment options at any time. We do not set assets aside for the bene-
fit of plan participants, but the Deferred Comp Plans I and II provide for full funding of all benefits upon a change-in-control or potential
change-in-control, as defined in the plans.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

Termination of Employment and Change-in-Control Arrangements

We have entered into certain agreements and maintain certain plans that will require us to provide compensation to our named executive
officers in the event of a termination of employment or a change in control of our company. See the tabular disclosure and narrative descrip-
tion under the “Pension Benefits” and “Nonqualified Deferred Compensation” sections above for detail regarding payments that would result
from a termination of employment or change-in-control of our company under our pension and nonqualified deferred compensation plans.

Under the terms of our stock option agreements, vesting and exercisability accelerate upon the death of the recipient or change in control of
our company, and continue in accordance with the original vesting schedule if employment ends as a result of disability or retirement. If
employment ends for reasons other than death, disability, retirement, or cause, a recipient forfeits any interest in the unvested portion of
any option but retains the right to exercise the previously vested portion of any option for a period of three months. In addition, if an award
recipient’s employment is terminated for cause, or if the recipient breaches a non-competition or confidentiality restriction or participates
in an activity deemed by us to be detrimental to our company, the recipient’s right to exercise any unexercised options will terminate, the
recipient’s right to receive option shares will terminate, and any shares already issued upon exercise of the option must be returned to us in
exchange for the lesser of the shares’ then-current fair market value or the price paid for the shares, or the recipient must pay us cash in the
amount of the gain realized by the recipient from the exercise of the option.

Under the terms of our 2017 RSU award agreements, vesting accelerates upon a change in control of the company only if the award recipi-
ent’s employment is terminated without cause or if the award recipient resigns for good reason, in each case, within 24 months after the
change in control, or if the surviving entity in the change-in-control transaction refuses to continue, assume, or replace the awards. Under
the terms of our pre-2017 time-vested RSU award agreements, vesting accelerates upon a change in control of our company. Under all of our
RSU award agreements, vesting accelerates upon death and continues in accordance with the original vesting schedule if employment ends
as a result of disability or retirement. If employment ends for other reasons, the unvested portion of each award is forfeited. In addition, if an
award recipient’s employment is terminated for cause, or if the recipient breaches a non-competition or confidentiality restriction or partic-
ipates in an activity deemed by us to be detrimental to our company, the recipient’s unvested awards will be forfeited, and any award shares
that have already been issued in settlement must be returned to us or the recipient must pay us the amount of the shares’ fair market value
as of the date the award vested.

Under the terms of our PSU award agreements, vesting accelerates upon the death of the award recipient or upon a change in control of our
company only if the award recipient’s employment is terminated without cause or if the award recipient resigns for good reason, in each
case, within 24 months after the change in control, or if the surviving entity in the change-in-control transaction refuses to continue, assume,
or replace the awards. In all such instances, the PSU awards will vest based on actual performance during the truncated performance period
and on a pro rata basis based on a target number of units for the year following the truncated performance period. If employment ends as a
result of disability or retirement, vesting will continue in accordance with the original vesting schedule. If employment ends for other rea-
sons, the unvested portion of each award is forfeited. In addition, if an award recipient’s employment is terminated for cause, or if the
recipient breaches a non-competition or confidentiality restriction or participates in an activity deemed by us to be detrimental to our
company, the recipient’s unvested awards will be forfeited, and any award shares that have already been issued in settlement must be
returned to us or the recipient must pay us the amount of the shares’ fair market value as of the date the award vested.

(1) Pursuant to the terms of the stock option and RSU awards issued under the 2009
Incentive Compensation Plan, vesting and exercisability of these equity awards are
accelerated in full upon death. The amount shown with respect to RSU awards was
calculated by multiplying the number of units as to which accelerated vesting and
settlement occurs by $40.08, the closing sale price of a share of our common stock on
the NYSE on December 29, 2017. The amounts shown with respect to stock options
were calculated with respect to options that were “in the money” as of December 31,
2017 and were determined by multiplying the number of shares subject to each option
as to which accelerated vesting occurs by the difference between $40.08, the closing sale
price of a share of our common stock on the NYSE on December 29, 2017, and the
exercise price of the applicable stock option.

target number of units multiplied by a fraction whose numerator is the number of fiscal
years not included in the original performance period that were not included in the
truncated performance period and whose denominator is three. The amount shown with
respect to PSU awards, assuming the first year of the performance period has been
completed and that the Relative TSR as well as the levels of both Adjusted ROIC and
Adjusted EBITDA achieved for such one year period equate to a 100% payout of the
total number of target shares, was calculated by (i) deeming 33% of the target number
of shares earned and entitled to vest and (ii) multiplying the target number of shares by
66.7% of the remaining target share amount and finally (iii) multiplying the sum of
(i) and (ii) by $40.08, the closing sale price of a share of our common stock on the NYSE
on December 29, 2017.

Pursuant to the terms of the PSU awards issued under the 2009 Incentive Compensation
Plan, vesting of the PSU awards will accelerate upon death in an amount equal to the

(3) Pursuant to the terms of the stock option and RSU awards issued prior to 2017
under the 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan, vesting and exercisability of these equity
awards are accelerated in full upon a change in control. However, beginning in 2017, the
company made the RSU awards as well as the PSU awards subject to a double trigger
vesting and payout mechanism upon a change in control, meaning that only if (i) within
24 months after the change in control, one of our executive officer’s employment is
terminated without cause or he or she resigns for good reason or (ii) the surviving entity
in the change of control does not continue, assume, or replace the awards, the RSU
awards will accelerate in full and the PSU awards will accelerate on a pro rata basis as
described in footnote 1 above. Therefore, this column excludes the 2017 RSU and PSU
awards and only includes unvested pre-2017 RSU awards. The amounts shown with
respect to pre-2017 RSU awards were calculated by multiplying the number of units as
to which accelerated vesting and settlement occurs by $40.08, the closing sale price of a
share of our common stock on the NYSE on December 29, 2017. The amounts shown
with respect to stock options were calculated with respect to options that were “in the
money” as of December 31, 2017 and were determined by multiplying the number of
shares subject to each option as to which accelerated vesting occurs by the difference
between $40.08, the closing sale price of a share of our common stock on the NYSE on
December 29, 2017, and the exercise price of the applicable stock option.

24 months after the change in control, one of our executive officer’s employment is
terminated without cause or he or she resigns for good reason or (ii) the surviving entity
in the change of control does not continue, assume, or replace the awards, the RSU
awards will accelerate in full and the PSU awards will accelerate on a pro rata basis as
described in footnote 1 above. Therefore, this column includes (i) all unexercisable
options, (ii) all unvested RSU awards, and (iii) a portion of the unvested PSU awards
(calculated in the manner set forth in footnote 1). The amounts shown with respect to
stock options were calculated with respect to options that were “in the money” as of
December 31, 2017 and were determined by multiplying the number of shares subject
to each option as to which accelerated vesting occurs by the difference between $40.08,
the closing sale price of a share of our common stock on the NYSE on December 29,
2017, and the exercise price of the applicable stock option. The amounts shown with
respect to RSU and PSU awards was calculated by multiplying the number of units as to
which accelerated vesting and settlement occurs by $40.08, the closing sale price of a
share of our common stock on the NYSE on December 29, 2017.

(5) Because this named executive officer is not yet eligible for retirement under the
terms of the ADM Retirement Plan, no current termination of employment would be
considered “retirement” under any of the applicable equity-based compensation plans.

(6) In accordance with commitments made at the time of Mr. Findlay’s hiring, his 2013
stock option award is accelerated in full if his employment is terminated by us for
reasons other than gross misconduct or by him for good reason. The amount shown was
calculated in the manner described in footnote (1) above.

The calculation of the pay ratio was based upon the same total compensation as shown for our Chairman and CEO in the Summary Compen-
sation Table to include: (1) salary received in fiscal year 2017, (2) annual incentive payment received for performance in fiscal year 2017,
(3) grant date fair value of any awards for fiscal year 2017, (4) change in pension value and nonqualified deferred compensation earnings,
and (5) all other compensation as included in the Summary Compensation Table. We determined the median employee by using a con-
sistently applied compensation measure of total cash compensation paid to our global employee population (including full-time, part-time,
temporary, and seasonal employees) other than our Chairman and CEO, as of December 31, 2017. We define “total cash compensation” as
base salary for salaried colleagues, base hourly compensation and overtime for hourly permanent employees, actual compensation for sea-
sonal or temporary colleagues, sales commission (if applicable), and any annual cash incentive compensation for the year ending on
December 31, 2017. To be consistent with our compensation philosophy, all global colleagues are paid based upon their local market as
reviewed on an annual basis to ensure they are paid competitively. For purposes of the pay ratio, their compensation is converted to U.S.
dollars as of December 31, 2017 exchange rate to determine the median employee. The median employee’s annual total compensation for
fiscal year 2017 was $57,345.(1) The annual total compensation of our Chairman and CEO, as identified in the Summary Compensation Table
for fiscal year 2017 was $15,875,055. The ratio between the Chairman and CEO’s annual total compensation to the annual total compensa-
tion of our median employee is 276:1.

(1) When we determined the annual total compensation of the median employee in the same manner that we determine the total compensation of our named executive officers for
purposes of the Summary Compensation Table, we reasonably determined there were compensation characteristics of the median employee’s compensation due to variances in local
compensation and benefits practices that would have a significant impact on our CEO pay ratio. As a result, we substituted an alternate employee as our median employee who had
substantially similar total cash compensation to the original median employee.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION FOR FISCAL 2017

For fiscal 2017, our standard compensation for non-employee directors consists of an annual retainer in the amount of $275,000. With respect
to the $275,000 annual retainer, $150,000 must be paid in stock units pursuant to our Stock Unit Plan for Non-Employee Directors. The remain-
ing portion of the annual retainer may be paid in cash, stock units, or a combination of both, at the election of each non-employee director. Each
stock unit is deemed for valuation and bookkeeping purposes to be the equivalent of a share of our common stock. In addition to the annual
retainer for fiscal year 2017, our Lead Director received a stipend in the amount of $30,000, the chairman of the Audit Committee received a
stipend in the amount of $20,000, the chairman of the Compensation/Succession Committee received a stipend in the amount of $20,000, and
the chairman of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee received a stipend in the amount of $15,000. All such stipends are paid in
cash. We do not pay fees for attendance at board and committee meetings. Directors are reimbursed for out-of-pocket traveling expenses
incurred in attending board and committee meetings. Directors may also be provided with certain perquisites from time to time.

Stock units are credited to the account of each non-employee director on a quarterly basis in an amount determined by dividing the quar-
terly amount of the retainer to be paid in stock units by the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the last business day of that
quarter, and are fully-vested at all times. As of any date on which cash dividends are paid on our common stock, each director’s stock unit
account is also credited with stock units in an amount determined by dividing the dollar value of the dividends that would have been paid on
the stock units in that director’s account had those units been actual shares by the fair market value of a share of our stock on the dividend
payment date. For purposes of this plan, the “fair market value” of a share of our common stock on any date is the average of the high and
low reported sales prices for our stock on the NYSE on that date. Each stock unit is paid out in cash on the first business day following the
earlier of (i) five years after the end of the calendar year that includes the quarter for which that stock unit was credited to the director’s
account, and (ii) when the director ceases to be a member of our Board. The amount to be paid will equal the number of stock units credited
to a director’s account multiplied by the fair market value of a share of our stock on the payout date. A director may elect to defer the receipt
of these payments in accordance with the plan.

The following table summarizes compensation provided to each non-employee director for services provided during fiscal year 2017.

(1) As described above, $150,000 of the annual retainer of $275,000 is paid in stock
units, which are reported in the “Stock Awards” column. In addition, our directors may
elect to receive the remaining portion of the annual retainer in the form of cash, stock
units, or a combination of both. For fiscal year 2017, Mr. Boeckmann and Ms. Carter each
elected to receive his or her entire annual retainer in the form of stock units.

(2) The amounts set forth in this column represent the grant date fair value of stock unit
grants to each of the listed directors computed in accordance with the provisions of
FASB ASC Topic 718. Each of the listed directors is a non-employee director and the fair
value of services provided by each director has been used to calculate the number of
stock units credited to each director by dividing the quarterly fair value of the services
provided by the fair market value of a share of our company’s common stock on the last
business day of the quarter. For purposes of this plan, the “fair market value” of a share
of our common stock on any date is the average of the high and low reported sales
prices for our stock on the NYSE on that date. The fair value of services provided by each

of the directors has been determined to be $68,750 per quarter. The aggregate number
of stock units credited to the account of each non-employee director as of December 31,
2017 (including mandatory stock unit grants, voluntary elections to receive stock units,
and the deemed reinvestment of dividends) was as follows:

(4) Ms. Carter and Mr. Maciel did not stand for reelection at our 2017 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders on May 4, 2017. The annual non-employee director compensation
provided to each of them was prorated to reflect that period of service during 2017.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION FOR FISCAL 2018

(5) Ms. Harrison was elected to our Board of Directors at our 2017 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders on May 4, 2017, and her annual non-employee director compensation was
prorated to reflect her period of service during 2017.

For fiscal 2018, our standard compensation for non-employee directors will consist of an annual retainer in the amount of $300,000. With
respect to the $300,000 annual retainer, $175,000 must be paid in stock units pursuant to our Stock Unit Plan for Non-Employee Directors,
which will be credited to the directors’ accounts in the same manner described above. The remaining portion of the annual retainer may be
paid in cash, stock units, or a combination of both, at the election of each non-employee director. We will pay the following stipends in addi-
tion to the annual retainer: our Lead Director will receive $30,000, the chairman of the Audit Committee will receive $25,000, the chairman
of the Compensation/Succession Committee will receive $20,000, and the chairman of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee
will receive $15,000. All such stipends are paid in cash. We will continue our practice of not paying fees, but will reimburse out-of-pocket
traveling expenses, for attendance at board and committee meetings.

DIRECTOR STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES

Our company has guidelines regarding ownership of shares of our common stock by our non-employee directors. These guidelines call for
non-employee directors to own shares of common stock (including stock units issued pursuant to the Stock Unit Plan for Non-Employee
Directors) over time with a fair market value of not less than five times the amount of the maximum cash portion of the annual retainer,
which is an increase from our guideline in effect prior to 2017 of not less than three times the amount of the maximum cash portion of the
annual retainer. Application of these guidelines will consider the time each director has served on our Board of Directors, as well as stock
price fluctuations that may impact the achievement of the five times cash retainer ownership guidelines.

We prohibit non-employee directors from pledging company securities if they have not met stock ownership guidelines, and we require our
non-employee directors to obtain approval from our General Counsel before pledging company securities.

Review and Approval of Certain Relationships and Related Transactions

Various policies and procedures of our company, including our Code of Conduct, our bylaws, the charter of the Nominating/Corporate Gover-
nance Committee, and annual questionnaires completed by all of our directors and executive officers, require the directors and executive
officers to disclose and otherwise identify to the company the transactions or relationships that may constitute conflicts of interest or
otherwise require disclosure under applicable SEC rules as “related person transactions” between our company or its subsidiaries and
related persons. For these purposes, a related person is a director, executive officer, nominee for director, or 5% stockholder of the company
since the beginning of the last fiscal year and their immediate family members.

Although the company’s processes vary with the particular transaction or relationship, in accordance with our Code of Conduct, directors,
executive officers, and other company employees are directed to inform appropriate supervisory personnel as to the existence or potential
existence of such a transaction or relationship. To the extent a related person is involved in the relationship or has a material interest in the
transaction, the company’s practice, although not part of a written policy, is to refer consideration of the matter to the Board or the Audit
Committee. The transaction or relationship will be evaluated by the Board or the Committee, which will approve or ratify it if it is
determined that the transaction or relationship is fair and in the best interests of the company. Generally, transactions and series of related
transactions of less than $120,000 are approved or ratified by appropriate company supervisory personnel and are not approved or ratified
by the Board or a committee thereof.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions

During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the brother of C. Cuddy, one of our executive officers, was employed by our company as a
vice president of our Golden Peanut and Tree Nut business. Such relationship was considered by the Audit Committee and found to be fair
and in the best interests of our company.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE

The Audit Committee provides assistance to the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibility to the stockholders relating to the
Company’s (i) financial statements and the financial reporting process, (ii) preparation of the financial reports and other financial
information provided by the Company to any governmental or regulatory body, (iii) systems of internal accounting and financial controls,
(iv) internal audit functions, (v) annual independent audit of the Company’s financial statements, (vi) major risk exposures, (vii) legal com-
pliance and ethics programs as established by management and the Board, (viii) related-party transactions, and (ix) performance of the
compliance function.

The Audit Committee assures that the corporate information gathering, analysis and reporting systems developed by management represent
a good faith attempt to provide senior management and the Board of Directors with information regarding material acts, events, and con-
ditions within the Company. In addition, the Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and
oversight of the independent auditor. The Audit Committee ensures that the Company establishes, resources, and maintains a professional
internal auditing function and that there are no unjustified restrictions or limitations imposed on such function. The Audit Committee
reviews the effectiveness of the internal audit function and reviews and approves the actions relating to the General Auditor, including per-
formance appraisals and related base and incentive compensation. The Audit Committee is comprised of five independent directors, all of
whom are financially literate and one of whom (T. K. Crews, the Chairman) has been determined by the Board of Directors to be an “audit
committee financial expert” as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the systems of internal con-
trols. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements in the annual
report with management, including a discussion of the quality — not just the acceptability — of the accounting principles, the reason-
ableness of significant judgments, the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates, and the clarity of disclosures in the
financial statements. Also, the Audit Committee discussed with management education regarding compliance with the policies and proce-
dures of the Company as well as federal and state laws.

The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with the independent auditor, who is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity
of those audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles, the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting, and the matters required to be discussed by the applicable Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”)
standards including their judgment as to the quality — not just the acceptability — of the Company’s accounting principles, the reason-
ableness of significant judgments and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. In addition, the Audit Committee received the
written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditor required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the
independent auditor’s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed with the independent auditor
the auditor’s independence from management and the Company. The Audit Committee has adopted an Audit and Non-Audit Services
Pre-Approval Policy and considered the compatibility of non-audit services with the independent auditor’s independence. The Audit
Committee recommended to the Board of Directors (and the Board of Directors approved) a hiring policy related to current and former
employees of the independent auditor.

The Committee discussed the Company’s major risk exposures, the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures, and
guidelines and policies to govern the Company’s risk assessment and risk management processes.

The meetings of the Audit Committee are designed to facilitate and encourage communication among the Audit Committee, the Company,
the Company’s internal audit function and the Company’s independent auditor. The Audit Committee discussed with the internal and
independent auditors the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. The Audit Committee met with the internal and independent
auditors, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of the accounting and finan-
cial controls, and the overall quality of the Company’s financial reporting. The Audit Committee met individually with members of manage-
ment in executive session. The Audit Committee held nine meetings during fiscal year 2017.

The Audit Committee recognizes the importance of maintaining the independence of the Company’s independent auditor, both in fact and
appearance. Each year, the Audit Committee evaluates the qualifications, performance, tenure and independence of the Company’s
independent auditor and determines whether to re-engage the current independent auditor. In doing so, the Audit Committee considers the
quality and efficiency of the services provided by the auditors, the auditors’ global capabilities and the auditors’ technical expertise and
knowledge of the Company’s operations and industry. Based on this evaluation, the Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP as
independent auditor for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. The members of the Audit Committee and the Board believe that, due to
Ernst & Young LLP’s knowledge of the Company and of the industries in which the Company operates, it is in the best interests of the Com-

ADM Proxy Statement 2018

pany and its stockholders to continue retention of Ernst & Young LLP to serve as the Company’s independent auditor. Although the Audit
Committee has the sole authority to appoint the independent auditors, the Board is submitting the selection of Ernst & Young LLP to our
stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice.

In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors (and the Board of
Directors approved) that the audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2017 for filing with the SEC.

PROPOSAL NO. 2 — RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of the independent registered
public accounting firm retained to audit the company’s financial statements. The Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP as our
company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. Ernst & Young LLP, or its prede-
cessor firms, has served as our independent registered public accounting firm for more than 85 years.

The Audit Committee is responsible for the audit fee negotiations associated with our company’s retention of Ernst & Young LLP. In order to
assure continuing auditor independence, the Audit Committee periodically considers whether there should be regular rotation of the
independent registered public accounting firm. In conjunction with the required rotation of Ernst & Young LLP’s lead engagement partner,
the Audit Committee and its Chairman are directly involved in the selection of Ernst & Young LLP’s new lead engagement partner.

We are asking our stockholders to ratify the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm. Although
ratification is not required by our bylaws or otherwise, our Board is submitting the selection of Ernst & Young LLP to our stockholders as a
matter of good corporate practice. The members of the Audit Committee, and the Board of Directors, believe that the continued retention of
Ernst & Young LLP to serve as the company’s independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of our company and its
stockholders. Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP will attend the annual meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if they
desire to do so, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.

The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our company’s
independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. Proxies solicited by the
Board will be so voted unless stockholders specify a different choice.

ment terms and fees, and any changes in such terms or fees, are subject to the specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee. The policy fur-
ther provides that all other audit services, audit-related services, tax services, and permitted non-audit services are subject to pre-approval
by the Audit Committee. All of the services Ernst & Young LLP performed for us during fiscal years 2017 and 2016 were pre-approved by the
Audit Committee.

PROPOSAL NO. 3 — ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, the following proposal provides our stockholders with an opportunity to vote to approve, on an
advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement. In considering your vote, you may
wish to review the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” discussion herein, which provides details as to our compensation policies,
procedures, and decisions regarding the named executive officers, as well as the Summary Compensation Table and other related
compensation tables, notes, and narrative disclosures in this proxy statement. This vote is not intended to address any specific element of
our executive compensation program, but rather the overall compensation program for our named executive officers.

The Compensation/Succession Committee, which is comprised entirely of independent directors, and our Board of Directors believe that the
executive compensation policies, procedures, and decisions made with respect to our named executive officers are competitive, are based on
our pay-for-performance philosophy, and are focused on achieving our company’s goals and enhancing stockholder value.

Accordingly, for the reasons discussed above and in the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” section of this proxy statement, the Board
asks our stockholders to vote FOR the adoption of the following resolution to be presented at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2018:

RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company’s named executive officers as
disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, the compensation tables, and the related narrative disclosure in
this Proxy Statement.

Although this advisory vote is not binding on our Board of Directors, the Board and the Compensation/Succession Committee will review
and expect to take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation decisions.

The Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the advisory resolution on the compensation of
our company’s named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement. Proxies solicited by the Board will be so
voted unless stockholders specify a different choice.

PROPOSAL NO. 4 — APPROVAL OF THE ADM EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

Introduction

We are asking our stockholders to approve the ADM Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Plan”), which is intended to be a qualified
employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). The Plan was approved by our Board of Direc-
tors on February 8, 2018.

The purpose of the Plan is to provide our employees with a convenient means of purchasing shares of our common stock at a discount to
market prices through the use of payroll deductions. The full text of the Plan is contained in Annex B to this proxy statement, and the
material features of the Plan are summarized below.

The Compensation/Succession Committee of our Board of Directors (the “Committee”) is authorized to administer the Plan. The Committee
has full authority to adopt rules and procedures to administer the Plan, to interpret the provisions of the Plan, to determine the terms and
conditions of offerings under the Plan, to designate which of our subsidiaries may participate in the Plan, and to adopt rules, procedures, and
sub-plans to permit employees of foreign subsidiaries to participate in the Plan on a basis intended to achieve tax, securities law, or other
compliance objectives in locations outside of the United States. All costs and expenses incurred for Plan administration are paid by us.

Securities Subject to the Plan

Up to 4,000,000 shares of our common stock may be purchased by participants under the Plan. The shares are to be made available from
authorized but unissued shares of our common stock. Any shares issued under the Plan will reduce, on a one-for-one basis, the number of
shares available for subsequent issuance under the Plan. In the event of any change to our outstanding common stock, such as a recapital-
ization, stock dividend, stock split, or similar event, appropriate adjustments will be made to the number and class of shares available under
the Plan, the limit on the number of shares that a participant may purchase during any purchase period, and the number, class, and purchase
price of shares subject to purchase under any pending offering.

Eligibility and Participation

With one exception, any individual employed by our company or any participating subsidiary corporation is eligible to participate in the
Plan. However, no employee who owns stock possessing 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of our stock
or the stock of any of our subsidiaries may participate in the Plan. The Committee may, consistent with the requirements of Section 423,
impose additional eligibility requirements for individual offerings under the Plan. As of March 12, 2018, we estimate that approximately
18,000 employees, including our nine executive officers, were eligible to participate in the Plan.

Eligible employees may enroll in the Plan and begin participating at the start of any purchase period.

Purchase Periods and Purchase Dates

Shares of common stock will be offered under the Plan through a series of offerings, each of which consists of a single purchase period of six
months, or such other duration (up to 27 months) as the Committee may prescribe. If our stockholders approve this proposal, we expect that
our shares will be offered under the Plan through a series of successive six-month purchase periods that are expected to commence on
July 1, 2018 and on the first day of July and January thereafter. Purchases under the Plan are expected to occur on the last trading day of June
and December each year.

Purchase Price

Unless a lesser purchase price is established by the Committee, the purchase price of each of common stock sold pursuant to the Plan will be
95% of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the purchase date at the end of the applicable six-month purchase period. In no
event will the purchase price be less than 85% of the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the purchase date.

The fair market value of a share of our common stock on any relevant date under the Plan will be deemed to be equal to the closing sale
price per share on such date on the New York Stock Exchange. The closing sale price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange
on March 12, 2018 was $44.53 per share.

PROPOSAL NO. 4

Payroll Deductions and Stock Purchases

Each participant may elect to have a percentage of eligible compensation between 1% and 10% withheld as a payroll deduction per pay
period. The accumulated deductions will automatically be applied on each purchase date (the last trading day of a purchase period) to the
purchase of shares of our common stock at the purchase price in effect for that purchase date. In connection with specific offerings under the
Plan, the Committee may permit participants to make additional contributions other than by payroll deductions during the applicable pur-
chase period. For purposes of the Plan, eligible compensation generally includes cash compensation including wages, salary, commission,
and overtime earnings, and excludes bonuses, company 401(k) contributions, amounts deferred to a non-qualified deferred compensation
plan, expense reimbursements and allowances, and income with respect to equity-based awards.

Special Limitations

The Plan imposes certain limitations upon a participant’s right to purchase our common stock under the Plan, including the following:

•

•

A participant may not be granted rights to purchase more than $25,000 worth of our common stock (valued at the time each pur-
chase right is granted) for each calendar year in which such purchase rights are outstanding.

No participant may purchase more than 1,000 shares of our common stock (or such other number of shares as the Committee may
designate for a specific offering) on any one purchase date.

Changing Contribution Amounts; Withdrawal from Plan

A participant may decrease or increase the amount of his or her payroll deduction contributions effective as of the first day of the next pur-
chase period. A participant may also decrease the amount of his or her payroll deduction contributions during a purchase period. A partic-
ipant may withdraw from the Plan at any time, and his or her accumulated (but not yet invested) contributions to the Plan will be refunded.

Termination of Employment

A participant’s purchase right will immediately terminate upon his or her termination of employment for any reason. Any payroll deductions
that the participant may have made for the purchase period in which such termination of employment occurs will be refunded and will not
be applied to the purchase of common stock.

Stockholder Rights

No participant will have any stockholder rights with respect to the shares covered by his or her purchase rights under the Plan until the
shares are actually purchased on the participant’s behalf through the Plan and issued and delivered.

Transferability

No purchase rights under the Plan will be assignable or transferable by the participant, except by will or the laws of inheritance following a
participant’s death. Unless otherwise provided in connection with a specific offering, shares of common stock purchased through the Plan by
a participant may not be sold by the participant prior to the later of two years after the first day of the purchase period in which the shares
were acquired or more than one year after the actual purchase date of the shares.

Corporate Transactions

If our company is acquired by merger, consolidation, or other reorganization, or sells all or substantially all its assets, each right to acquire
shares on any purchase date scheduled to occur after the date of the consummation of the acquisition transaction shall be continued or
assumed or an equivalent right shall be substituted by the surviving or successor corporation or its parent or subsidiary. If those rights are
not continued, assumed, or substituted, then our Board of Directors may terminate the Plan or shorten the purchase period then in progress
by setting a new purchase date to occur prior to the transaction.

Share Proration

Should the total number of shares of common stock to be purchased pursuant to outstanding purchase rights on any particular purchase
date exceed the number of shares remaining available for issuance under the Plan at that time, the Committee will make a pro rata allocation
of the available shares on a uniform and nondiscriminatory basis, and the payroll deductions of each participant not used to purchase shares
will be refunded.

56

ADM Proxy Statement 2018

PROPOSAL NO. 4

Amendment and Termination

The Plan may be terminated at any time by the Board of Directors, and will terminate upon the date on which all shares remaining available
for issuance under the Plan are sold pursuant to exercised purchase rights.

The Committee may at any time amend or suspend the Plan. However, the Committee may not, without stockholder approval, amend the
Plan to (i) increase the number of shares issuable under the Plan, (ii) effect any other change in the Plan that would require stockholder
approval under applicable law or the New York Stock Exchange rules, or (iii) effect any other change in the Plan that would require stock-
holder approval in order to maintain compliance with Code Section 423.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences

The following is a summary of the principal United States federal income tax consequences to the company and to participants subject to U.S.
taxation with respect to participation in the Plan. This summary assumes the Plan qualifies as an “employee stock purchase plan” within the
meaning of Code Section 423, is not intended to be exhaustive and does not discuss the income tax laws of any city, state or foreign juris-
diction in which a participant may reside.

Under a qualified Code Section 423 arrangement, no taxable income will be recognized by a participant, and no deductions will be allowed to
the company, upon either the grant or the exercise of purchase rights under the Plan. Taxable income will not be recognized until either
there is a sale or other disposition of the shares acquired under the Plan or in the event the participant dies while still owning the purchased
shares.

If a participant sells or otherwise disposes of the purchased shares within two years after the first day of the purchase period in which such
shares were acquired, or within one year after the actual purchase date of those shares, then the participant will recognize ordinary income
in the year of sale or disposition equal to the amount by which the closing market price of the shares on the purchase date exceeded the
purchase price paid for those shares, and the company will be entitled to an income tax deduction, for the taxable year in which such dis-
position occurs, equal in amount to such excess. The participant also will recognize a capital gain to the extent the amount realized upon the
sale of the shares exceeds the sum of the aggregate purchase price for those shares and the ordinary income recognized in connection with
their acquisition.

If a participant sells or otherwise disposes of the purchased shares more than two years after the first day of the purchase period in which
the shares were acquired and more than one year after the actual purchase date of those shares, the participant will recognize ordinary
income in the year of sale or disposition equal to the lower of (i) the amount by which the selling price of the shares on the sale or dis-
position date exceeded the purchase price paid for those shares or (ii) 5% of the closing market price of the shares on the first day of the
purchase period in which the shares were acquired (or such purchase price discount provided by the Committee for the purchase period,
not to exceed 15%). Any additional gain upon the disposition will be taxed as a long-term capital gain. The company will not be entitled to an
income tax deduction with respect to such disposition.

If a participant still owns the purchased shares at the time of death, his or her estate will recognize ordinary income in the year of death
equal to the lower of (i) the amount by which the closing market price of the shares on the date of death exceeds the purchase price or (ii)
5% of the closing market price of the shares on the first day of the purchase period in which those shares were acquired (or such purchase
price discount provided by the Committee for the purchase period, not to exceed 15%).

Plan Benefits

The benefits to be received by our officers and employees under the Plan are not determinable because the amounts of future purchases by
participants are based on elective participant contributions.

The Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the Plan. Proxies solicited by the Board will be so
voted unless stockholders specify a different choice.

PROPOSAL NO. 5 — STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING INDEPENDENT BOARD CHAIRMAN

Text of Stockholder Proposal

Proposal 5 — Independent Board Chairman

Shareholders request our Board of Directors to adopt as policy, and amend our governing documents as necessary, to require henceforth
that the Chair of the Board of Directors, whenever possible, to be an independent member of the Board. The Board would have the dis-
cretion to phase in this policy for the next CEO transition, implemented so it does not violate any existing agreement.

If the Board determines that a Chair who was independent when selected is no longer independent, the Board shall select a new Chair who
satisfies the requirements of the policy within a reasonable amount of time. Compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director
is available and willing to serve as Chairman. This proposal requests that all the necessary steps be taken to accomplish the above.

Caterpillar is an example of a company recently changing course and naming an independent board chairman. Caterpillar had strongly
opposed a shareholder proposal for an independent board chairman as recently as its 2016 annual meeting. Wells Fargo also changed
course and named an independent board chairman in 2016.

It was reported that 53% of the Standard & Poors 1,500 firms separate these 2 positions (2015 report): Chairman and CEO. This proposal
topic won 50%-plus support at 5 major U.S. companies in 2013 including 73%-support at Netflix.

This proposal topic won 47% support at our 2014 annual meeting. This 47%-support would have been higher (perhaps 51%) if small share-
holders had the same access to corporate governance information as large shareholders. Plus in 2014 our stock was above $50.

Also there was weakness in our board with Directors Kelvin Westbrook and Patrick Moore receiving our highest negative votes by far in
2017. They each had long-tenure which can impair the independence of a director. Independence is a highly valuable attribute in a director.

A number of institutional investors said that a strong, objective board leader can best provide the necessary oversight of management. Thus,
the California Public Employees’ Retirement System’s Global Principles of Accountable Corporate Governance recommends that a company’s
board should be chaired by an independent director, as does the Council of Institutional Investors. An independent director serving as
chairman can help ensure the functioning of an effective board.

Please vote to enhance CEO accountability to shareholders:

Independent Board Chairman — Proposal 5

Recommendation of the Board of Directors AGAINST the Proposal

The Board has carefully considered the above proposal and recommends that stockholders vote against the proposal for the following rea-
sons:

The Company’s Lead Director Ensures Strong Independent Board Leadership

Our independent directors elect our Lead Director, who has well-defined responsibilities as set forth in our Corporate Governance Guide-
lines that ensure our Board provides effective independent oversight of management. The Board expanded these responsibilities since our
last annual meeting in the areas of determining performance criteria for evaluating the Chief Executive Officer, evaluating the Board,
committees and individual directors, and planning for management succession.

Our Lead Director:

• Presides at all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present, including executive sessions of the independent directors, and

regularly meets with the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for discussion of appropriate matters arising from these sessions;

• Coordinates the activities of the other independent directors and serves as liaison between the Chairman and the independent directors;

• Consults with the Chairman and approves all meeting agendas, schedules and information provided to the Board, and may, from time to

time, invite corporate officers, other employees and advisors to attend Board or committee meetings whenever deemed appropriate;

• Interviews, along with the Chairman and the Chair and members of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, all director candi-

dates and makes recommendations to the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee;

58

ADM Proxy Statement 2018

PROPOSAL NO. 5

• Advises the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee on the selection of members of the Board committees;

• Advises the Board committees on the selection of committee chairs;

• Works with the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to propose a schedule of major discussion items for the Board;

• Guides the Board’s governance processes;

• Provides leadership to the Board if circumstances arise in which the role of the Chairman or Chief Executive Officer may be, or may be

perceived to be, in conflict;

• Has the authority to call meetings of the independent directors;

• If requested by major stockholders, ensures that he is available for consultation and direct communication;

• Leads the non-management directors in determining performance criteria for evaluating the Chief Executive Officer and coordinates the

annual performance review of the Chief Executive Officer;

• Works with the Chair of the Compensation/Succession Committee to guide the Board’s discussion of management succession plans;

• Works with the Chair and members of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee to facilitate the evaluation of the performance of

the Board, committees and individual directors; and

• Performs such other duties and responsibilities as the Board may determine.

In addition to having a Lead Director position with significant responsibilities, the Company has a number of governance structures in place
to support the independent operation of the Board:

• Ten out of eleven of the current directors — all directors other than Mr. Luciano — are independent under the standards of the New York

Stock Exchange;

• The Board’s Audit Committee, Compensation/Succession Committee, and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee are composed

solely of independent directors;

• Non-management directors meet privately in executive session presided over by the Lead Director at least quarterly, and if any of the

non-management directors are not independent pursuant to the Board’s independence determination, at least one executive session each
year will include only independent directors;

• Non-management directors determine the performance criteria for evaluating the Chief Executive Officer and perform the annual perform-

ance review of the Chief Executive Officer;

• Directors have full and free access to the officers and employees of the Company; and

• The Board and each committee of the Board has the power to retain experts or advisors without consulting or obtaining the approval of

any officer of the Company.

The Board Should Continue to Have Flexibility to Determine in its Business Judgment Whether to Separate or Combine the Roles
of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

The Board believes it is important to maintain the flexibility to choose whether to separate the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles at
the Company. The Board believes the proposed policy would be detrimental to the Company because it would remove the Board’s flexibility
and narrow the governance arrangements that the Board may consider. The Board believes that, depending on the Company’s circumstances
at any given point in time, it may not be in the best interests of the Company or its stockholders to have a Chairman who is an independent
director for a variety of reasons. Overall, the Board believes it should be allowed to use its business judgment to select the director it
believes is best suited to serve as Chairman and to change that determination as facts and circumstances change.

The Board Regularly Reviews and Assesses Board Leadership Structure

The Board regularly reviews its governance processes including its leadership structure, and will make determinations based upon the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders at that time. The Board considers, among other things, the changing needs of the Board and the
Company and evolving corporate governance best practices (which show, according to the Spencer Stuart U.S. Board Index 2017, that 72% of
S&P 500 companies do not have an independent board chairman). The Board also considers current trends and stockholder feedback
received through engagement and votes on stockholder proposals (such as the similar proposals voted on by stockholders in 2014 and 2015,
neither of which received the support of a majority of the Company’s stockholders).

ADM Proxy Statement 2018

59

PROPOSAL NO. 5

The Current Leadership Structure is the Most Effective for the Company

At present, the independent directors have determined that the Company is well-served by having both Chairman and Chief Executive Offi-
cer roles performed by Mr. Luciano, who provides excellent leadership and direction for both management and the Board and who facili-
tates the flow of business information and communications. This structure allows our Chief Executive Officer to speak for and lead the
Company and Board while also providing for effective oversight and governance by an independent Board through the independent Lead
Director.

Accordingly, the Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote AGAINST this stockholder proposal. Proxies
solicited by the Board will be so voted unless stockholders specify a different choice.

SUBMISSION OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS AND OTHER MATTERS

DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

Proposals of stockholders, including nominations for director, intended to be presented at the next annual meeting and desired to be
included in our proxy statement for that meeting must be received by the Secretary, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, 77 West Wacker
Drive, Suite 4600, Chicago, Illinois 60601, no later than November 23, 2018, and, in the case of nominations for director, no earlier than
October 24, 2018, in order to be included in such proxy statement. These proposals and nominations must also meet all the relevant
requirements of our bylaws in order to be included in our proxy statement. Generally, if written notice of any stockholder proposal intended
to be presented at the next annual meeting, and not included in our proxy statement for that meeting, is not delivered to the Secretary at the
above address between February 2, 2019 and March 4, 2019 (or, if the next annual meeting is called for a date that is not within the period
from April 3, 2019 to June 2, 2019, if such notice is not so delivered by the close of business on the tenth day following the earlier of the date
on which notice of the date of such annual meeting is mailed or public disclosure of the date of such annual meeting is made), or if such
notice does not contain the information required by Section 1.4(c) of our bylaws, the chair of the annual meeting may declare that such
stockholder proposal be disregarded.

Stockholders with the Same Address

Individual stockholders sharing an address with one or more other stockholders may elect to “household” the mailing of the proxy state-
ment and our annual report. This means that only one annual report and proxy statement will be sent to that address unless one or more
stockholders at that address specifically elect to receive separate mailings. Stockholders who participate in householding will continue to
receive separate proxy cards. Also, householding will not affect dividend check mailings. We will promptly send a separate annual report
and proxy statement to a stockholder at a shared address on request. Stockholders with a shared address may also request us to send sepa-
rate annual reports and proxy statements in the future, or to send a single copy in the future if we are currently sending multiple copies to
the same address.

Requests related to householding should be made in writing and addressed to Investor Relations, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, 4666
Faries Parkway, Decatur, Illinois 62526-5666, or by calling our Investor Relations at 217-424-5656. If you are a stockholder whose shares
are held by a bank, broker, or other nominee, you can request information about householding from your bank, broker, or other nominee.

Other Matters

It is not contemplated or expected that any business other than that pertaining to the subjects referred to in this proxy statement will be
brought up for action at the meeting, but in the event that other business does properly come before the meeting calling for a stockholders’
vote, the named proxies will vote thereon according to their best judgment in the interest of our company.

ANNEX A

DEFINITION AND RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES

DEFINITION AND RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES

We use Adjusted ROIC to mean “Adjusted ROIC Earnings” divided by “Adjusted Invested Capital”. Adjusted ROIC Earnings is the Company’s
net earnings attributable to controlling interests adjusted for the after-tax effects of interest expense, changes in the LIFO reserve, and other
specified items. Adjusted Invested Capital is the average of quarter-end amounts for the trailing four quarters, with each such quarter-end
amount being equal to the sum of the Company’s equity (excluding noncontrolling interests), interest-bearing liabilities, the after-tax effect
of the LIFO reserve, and other specified items. Management uses Adjusted ROIC to measure the Company’s performance by comparing
Adjusted ROIC to the Company’s weighted average cost of capital, or WACC.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization, adjusted for specified items. Adjusted EPS is
defined as diluted Earnings Per Share adjusted for the effects on reported diluted EPS of certain specified items. Management believes
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are useful measures of the Company’s performance because they provide investors additional information
about the Company’s operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability.

Adjusted economic value added (EVA) is the Company’s trailing 4-quarter economic value added adjusted for LIFO and other specified
items. The Company calculates economic value added by comparing ADM’s trailing 4-quarter adjusted returns to its Annual WACC
multiplied by adjusted invested capital. Adjusted economic value added is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not intended to replace or be
an alternative to GAAP financial measures.

Adjusted ROIC, Adjusted ROIC Earnings, Adjusted Invested Capital, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures
and are not intended to replace or be alternatives to GAAP financial measures. The following tables present reconciliations of Adjusted ROIC
Earnings to net earnings attributable to controlling interests, the most directly comparable amount reported under GAAP; of Adjusted
Invested Capital to Total Shareholders’ Equity, the most directly comparable amount reported under GAAP; of Adjusted EBITDA to earnings
before income taxes, the most directly comparable amount reported under GAAP; of Adjusted EPS to diluted EPS, the most directly
comparable amount reported under GAAP; and the calculations of Adjusted EVA and Adjusted ROIC for the year ended December 31, 2017.

(1) Non-GAAP measure: The Company uses certain “Non-GAAP” financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. These are measures of performance not
defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and should be considered in addition to, not in lieu of, GAAP reported measures.

(a) Adjusted Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is Adjusted ROIC Earnings divided by Adjusted Invested Capital. Adjusted ROIC Earnings is ADM’s net earnings adjusted for the

after tax effects of interest expense, changes in the LIFO reserve, and other specified items. Adjusted ROIC Invested Capital is the sum of ADM’s equity (excluding
noncontrolling interests), interest-bearing liabilities, the after tax effect of the LIFO reserve, and the after tax effect of other specified items.

(b) Other specified items are comprised of several individually insignificant asset impairments and restructuring charges of $10 million ($8 million, after tax, $0.01 per share)

and certain discrete tax adjustments of $4 million ($0.01 per share) related to valuation allowances for the quarter ended March 31, 2017; charges related to impairment of
certain long-lived assets, restructuring, and a settlement totaling $28 million ($21 million, after tax, $0.04 per share) and net gains of $8 million ($22 million loss, after tax,
$0.04 per share) related to the gain on sale of the crop risk business, partially offset by an adjustment of the proceeds of the 2015 sale of the cocoa business for the quarter

DEFINITION AND RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES

ended June 30, 2017; asset impairments related to the configuration of the Company’s Peoria, Illinois ethanol complex and restructuring charges related to the reduction of
certain positions within the Company’s global workforce totaling $107 million ($69 million, after tax, $0.12 per share), gains related to an adjustment of the proceeds of the
2015 sale of the cocoa business and the sale of an asset totaling $12 million ($10 million, after tax, $0.02 per share), and a debt extinguishment charge of $11 million
($7 million, after tax, $0.01 per share) related to the early redemption of the $550 million notes due on March 15, 2018 for the quarter ended September 30, 2017; and a legal
settlement charge, asset impairments related to the closure of a facility, and several individually insignificant asset impairments and restructuring charges totaling
$69 million ($46 million, after tax, $0.08 per share), a gain related to the sale of an asset of $2 million ($2 million, after tax), and a net tax adjustment related to the estimated
impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act U.S. tax reform and certain discrete items of $370 million ($0.65 per share) for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.

(c) Biodiesel blender’s tax credit of $123 million ($123 million, after tax) is the amount of biodiesel blender’s tax credit that the Company earned in 2017 but recorded in 2018
after the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 was passed by Congress and signed into law on February 9, 2018, retroactively extending the biodiesel blender’s tax credit for 2017.

(d) Adjusted EVA is Adjusted ROIC less the Company’s Annual WACC multiplied by Adjusted Invested Capital.

(e) Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA adjusted for certain specified items as described above.

ADM EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

ADM EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

1. Purpose of the Plan. The purpose of this ADM Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Plan”) is to provide the employees of Archer Daniels
Midland Company (“ADM”) and its participating subsidiaries with a convenient means of purchasing shares of ADM common stock from
time to time at a discount to market prices through the use of payroll deductions. ADM intends that the Plan shall qualify as an “employee
stock purchase plan” under Code § 423. Accordingly, the Plan will be construed so as to extend and limit Plan participation in any Offering

Employees under the Plan shall be 4,000,000 Shares. If the purchases by all Participants in an Offering would otherwise cause the aggregate
number of Shares to be sold under the Plan to exceed the number specified in this Sec. 3, each Participant in that Offering shall be allocated a
ratable portion of the remaining number of Shares which may be sold under the Plan.

4. Eligibility and Participation. To be eligible to participate in the Plan for a given Purchase Period, an employee must be an Eligible
Employee on the first day of such Purchase Period.

An Eligible Employee may elect to participate in the Plan by filing an election form with ADM (or its agent) before the Offering Date for a
Purchase Period that authorizes regular payroll deductions from Eligible Compensation beginning with the first payday in such Purchase
Period and continuing until the Plan is terminated or the Eligible Employee withdraws from the Plan, modifies his or her authorization, or
ceases to be an Eligible Employee, as hereinafter provided.

5. Amount of Common Stock Each Eligible Employee May Purchase.

5.1. Purchase Amounts and Limitations. Subject to the provisions of this Plan, each Participant shall be offered the right to purchase on
the Purchase Date the maximum number of whole Shares that can be purchased with the balance in the Participant’s Recordkeeping
Account at the per Share price specified in Sec. 5.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Participant shall be entitled to:

(a) the right to purchase Shares under this Plan and all other employee stock purchase plans (within the meaning of Code §
423(b)), if any, of ADM and its Affiliates that accrues at a rate which in the aggregate exceeds $25,000 of Fair Market Value
(determined on the Offering Date of a Purchase Period when the right is granted) for each calendar year in which such right is out-
standing at any time; or

(b) purchase Shares in excess of 1000 Shares per Offering (or such other maximum Share limit as established by the Committee in
its sole discretion), with such limit subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in Sec. 14.1.

5.2. Purchase Price. Unless a lesser purchase price is established by the Committee for an Offering prior to the commencement of the
applicable Purchase Period, the purchase price of each Share sold pursuant to this Plan will be 95% of the Fair Market Value of such
Share on the Purchase Date. In no event shall the purchase price be less than 85% of the Fair Market Value of such Share on the Pur-
chase Date.

6. Method of Participation.

6.1. Notice and Date of Grant. ADM shall give notice to each Eligible Employee of the opportunity to purchase Shares pursuant to this
Plan and the terms and conditions of such Offering. ADM contemplates that for tax purposes the Offering Date for a Purchase Period will
be considered the date of the grant of the right to purchase such Shares.

6.2. Contribution Elections. Each Eligible Employee who desires to participate in the Plan for a Purchase Period shall signify his or her
election to do so by completing an election with ADM (or its agent) in a manner approved by the Committee. An Eligible Employee may
elect to have any whole percent of Eligible Compensation (that is, 1%, 2%, 3%, etc.) withheld as a payroll deduction, but not exceeding
10% per pay period (or such other maximum percentage as the Committee may establish from time to time prior to the commencement

B-2

ADM EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

of an Offering). An election to participate in the Plan and to authorize payroll deductions as described herein must be made before the
Offering Date of a Purchase Period, and shall be effective beginning with the first payday in the Purchase Period immediately following
the filing of such election. Any election submitted shall remain in effect until the Plan is terminated or such Participant withdraws from
the Plan, modifies his or her authorization, or ceases to be an Eligible Employee, as hereinafter provided.

6.3 Additional Contributions. If specifically provided by the Committee in connection with an Offering (including for purposes of comply-
ing with applicable local law), in addition to or instead of making contributions by payroll deductions, a Participant may make addi-
tional contributions to his or her Recordkeeping Account through the payment by cash or check prior to a Purchase Date. A Participant
may make such additional contributions into his or her Recordkeeping Account only if the Participant has not already had the maximum
permitted amount withheld during the Offering through payroll deductions, subject to the limitations set forth in Sec. 5.1.

6.4. Offering Terms and Conditions. Each Offering shall consist of a single Purchase Period and shall be in such form and shall contain
such terms and conditions as the Committee shall deem appropriate, consistent with the terms of the Plan. The Committee may provide
for separate Offerings for different Designated Affiliates, and the terms and conditions of the separate Offerings, including the appli-
cable Purchase Period, need not be consistent. Any Offering shall comply with the requirement of Code § 423 that all Participants shall
have the same rights and privileges for such Offering. The terms and conditions of any Offering shall be incorporated by reference into
the Plan and treated as part of the Plan.

7. Recordkeeping Accounts.

7.1. Crediting Payroll Deduction Contributions. ADM (or its agent) shall maintain a Recordkeeping Account for each Participant. Payroll
deductions pursuant to Sec. 6 will be credited to such Recordkeeping Accounts on each payday.

7.2. No Interest Payable. No interest will be credited to a Participant’s Recordkeeping Account (unless required under local law).

7.3. No Segregation of Accounts. The Recordkeeping Account is established solely for accounting purposes, and all amounts credited to
the Recordkeeping Account will remain part of the general assets of ADM and need not be segregated from other corporate funds
(unless required under local law).

7.4. Additional Contributions. A Participant may not make any separate cash payment into a Recordkeeping Account, except as may be
permitted in accordance with Sec. 6.3, and any such additional contributions will be credited to the Recordkeeping Accounts when
received by ADM.

8. Right to Adjust Participation; Withdrawals from Recordkeeping Account.

8.1. Withdrawal from Plan. A Participant may at any time withdraw from the Plan. If a Participant withdraws from the Plan, ADM will
pay to the Participant in cash the entire balance in such Participant’s Recordkeeping Account and no further deductions will be made
from the Participant’s Eligible Compensation during such Purchase Period. A Participant who withdraws from the Plan will not be eligi-
ble to reenter the Plan until the next succeeding Purchase Period, and any such reentry shall be through the enrollment process
described in Sec. 6.2.

8.2. Adjusting Level of Participation. A Participant may adjust his or her rate of payroll deduction contributions to the Plan as follows:

(a) A Participant may, by written notice, direct ADM to increase or decrease his or her rate of payroll deduction contributions, with
such change to be effective as of the first day of the next Purchase Period.

(b) A Participant may, by written notice, direct ADM to decrease his or her rate of payroll deduction contributions for a Purchase
Period (including a decrease to 0%) one time during the applicable Purchase Period, with such change to become effective as soon
as reasonably practicable. Any Participant who has decreased his or her rate of payroll deductions to 0% and does not increase
such rate of payroll deductions from 0% to at least 1% in accordance with Sec. 8.2(a) prior to the start of the next Purchase Period
will be withdrawn from the Plan effective as of the first day of that next Purchase Period.

8.3. Submission of Notices. Notification of a Participant’s election to withdraw from the Plan as provided in Sec. 8.1 or to change his or
her rate of payroll deductions as provided in Sec. 8.2 shall be made by completing an updated election with ADM (or its agent) in a
manner approved by the Committee. The Committee may promulgate rules regarding the time and manner for submitting any such
updated election, which may include a requirement that the election be on file for a reasonable period before it will be effective.

8.4. Adjustments by ADM. To the extent necessary to comply with Code § 423(b)(8) or Sec. 5.1, a Participant’s payroll deduction con-
tributions to the Plan may be decreased by ADM to 0% at any time during a Purchase Period.

9. Termination of Employment.

9.1. Refund of Recordkeeping Account. If the employment of a Participant is terminated for any reason, including death, disability, or
retirement, the entire balance in the Participant’s Recordkeeping Account will be refunded in cash to the Participant within 30 days
after the date of termination of employment. Unless determined otherwise by the Committee in a manner that is permitted by, and in
compliance with Code § 423, a Participant whose employment transfers between entities through a termination with an immediate
rehire (with no break in service) by ADM or a Designated Affiliate shall not be treated as a termination under the Plan.

9.2. Designation of Beneficiary. If permitted by the Committee, a Participant may file a beneficiary designation for who is to receive the
Participant’s Recordkeeping Account or Share subaccount, if any, following the death of a Participant. If no beneficiary is named, the
beneficiary shall be the Participant’s spouse or certified domestic partner (as determined by ADM policy), or if none, the Participant’s
estate. If a Participant is married and the designated beneficiary is not the spouse, consent of the spouse will be required for such
designation to be effective. All beneficiary designations will be in such form and manner as the Committee may designate from time to
time.

10. Purchase of Shares.

10.1. Number of Shares Purchased. As of each Purchase Date, the balance in each Participant’s Recordkeeping Account will be used to
purchase the maximum number of whole Shares (subject to the limitations of Sec. 5.1) at the purchase price determined in accordance
with Sec. 5.2, unless the Participant has filed an appropriate form with ADM in advance of that date to withdraw from the Plan in
accordance with Sec. 8.1. Any amount remaining in a Participant’s Recordkeeping Account that represents the purchase price for any
fractional share will be carried over in the Participant’s Recordkeeping Account to the next Purchase Period. Any amount remaining in a
Participant’s Recordkeeping Account that represents the purchase price for any whole Shares that could not be purchased by reason of
the limitations of Sec. 5.1 or under the circumstances described in Sec. 3 will be refunded to the Participant.

10.2. Conversion of Foreign Currency. In circumstances where payroll deductions have been taken from a Participant’s Eligible Compen-
sation in a currency other than United States dollars, Shares shall be purchased by converting the balance in the Participant’s Record-
keeping Account to United States dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the fifth Trading Day preceding the Purchase Date,
as published by Bloomberg.com if available or as determined with respect to a particular jurisdiction by the Committee or its delegate
for this purpose, and such dollar amount shall be used to purchase Shares as of the Purchase Date.

10.3. Crediting of Shares. Promptly after the end of each Purchase Period, the number of Shares purchased by all Participants as of the
applicable Purchase Date shall be issued and delivered to an agent selected by ADM. Delivery of the shares to the agent shall be effected
by an appropriate book-entry in the stock register maintained by ADM’s transfer agent or delivery of a certificate. The agent will hold
the Shares for the benefit of all Participants who have purchased Shares and will maintain a Share subaccount for each Participant
reflecting the number of Shares credited to each Participant. Each Participant will be entitled to direct the voting by the agent of all
Shares credited to such Participant’s Share subaccount, and the agent may reinvest any dividends paid on Shares credited to a Partic-
ipant’s Share subaccount in additional Shares in accordance with such rules as the Committee may prescribe.

10.4 Withdrawal of Shares From Share Subaccount. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, a Participant may not withdraw
Shares or otherwise transfer Shares from the Participant’s Share subaccount until after the Participant has satisfied the minimum hold-
ing period requirements established by Code § 423(a)(1). Once this holding period requirements have been satisfied with respect to
Shares credited to a Participant’s Share subaccount, the Participant may request that the agent transfer any or all of those Shares
directly to the Participant or to a brokerage account maintained by the Participant. The agent shall deliver the requested number of
whole Shares by the issuance of a stock certificate, the electronic delivery of the Shares to a brokerage account designated by the Partic-
ipant, or an appropriate book-entry in the stock register maintained by ADM’s transfer agent with a notice of issuance provided to the
Participant, and will pay the Participant a cash amount representing the Fair Market Value of any applicable fractional Share with-
drawn.

11. Rights as a Shareholder. A Participant shall not be entitled to any of the rights or privileges of a shareholder of ADM with respect to
Shares offered for purchase under the Plan, including the right to vote or direct the voting or to receive any dividends that may be declared
by ADM, until (i) the Participant actually has paid the purchase price for such Shares and (ii) such Shares have been issued and delivered, as
provided in Sec. 10.3.

12. Rights Not Transferable. A Participant’s rights under this Plan are exercisable only by the Participant during his or her lifetime, and may
not be sold, pledged, assigned, transferred or disposed of in any manner other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Any
attempt to sell, pledge, assign, transfer or dispose of the same shall be void and without effect. The amounts credited to a Recordkeeping
Account may not be sold, pledged, assigned, transferred or disposed of in any way, and any attempted sale, pledge, assignment, transfer or
other disposition of such amounts will be void and without effect.

13. Administration of the Plan.

13.1. Authority of the Committee. This Plan shall be administered by the Committee. Subject to the express provisions of the Plan and
applicable law, and in addition to other express powers and authorizations conferred on the Committee by the Plan, the Committee
shall have full power and authority to:

(a) Determine when each Purchase Period under this Plan shall occur, and the terms and conditions of each related Offering (which
need not be identical);

(b) Designate from time to time which Affiliates of ADM shall be eligible to participate in the Plan;

(c) Construe and interpret the Plan and establish, amend and revoke rules, regulations and procedures for the administration of
the Plan. The Committee may, in the exercise of this power, correct any defect, omission or inconsistency in the Plan, in such man-
ner and to the extent it may deem necessary, desirable or appropriate to make the Plan fully effective;

(d) Exercise such powers and perform such acts as the Committee may deem necessary, desirable or appropriate to promote the
best interests of ADM and its Designated Affiliates and to carry out the intent that the Offerings made under the Plan are treated as
qualifying under Code § 423(b);

(e) As more fully described in Sec. 18, to adopt such rules, procedures and sub-plans as may be necessary, desirable or appropriate
to permit participation in the Plan by employees who are foreign nationals or employed outside the United States by a non-U.S.
Designated Affiliate, and to achieve tax, securities law and other compliance objectives in particular locations outside the United
States; and

(f) Adopt and amend, as the Committee deems appropriate, a Plan rule specifying that Shares purchased by a Participant during a
Purchase Period may not be sold by the Participant for a specified period of time after the Purchase Date on which the Shares were
purchased by the Participant, and establish such procedures as the Committee may deem necessary to implement such rule.

13.2. Interpretations and Decisions by the Committee. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, all designations, determinations,
interpretations, and other decisions under or with respect to the Plan shall be within the sole discretion of the Committee, may be made
at any time and shall be final, conclusive, and binding upon all persons, including ADM, any Affiliate, any Participant and any Eligible
Employee.

13.3. Delegation by the Committee. Subject to the terms of the Plan and applicable law, the Committee may delegate ministerial duties
associated with the administration of the Plan to such of ADM’s officers, employees or agents as the Committee may determine.

13.4. Indemnification. No member of the Board or Committee shall be liable for any action taken or determination made in good faith
with respect to the Plan. In addition to such other rights of indemnification as they may have as members of the Board or officers or
employees of ADM or a Designated Affiliate, members of the Board and Committee and any officers or employees of the ADM or Des-
ignated Affiliate to whom authority to act for the Committee is delegated shall be indemnified by ADM from and against any and all
liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by such persons as a result of any act or omission to act in connection with the performance of
such person’s duties, responsibilities and obligations under the Plan if such person has acted in good faith and in a manner that he or
she reasonably believes to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of ADM.

14. Changes in Capitalization and Corporate Transactions.

14.1. Adjustments. In the event of any change in the Common Stock of ADM by reason of a stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split,
corporate separation, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, combination, exchange of shares and the like, the Committee shall make
such equitable adjustments as it deems appropriate in the aggregate number and class of Shares or other securities available under this
Plan, the Share limitation referred to in Sec. 5.1(b) of the Plan, if any, and the number, class and purchase price of Shares or other secu-
rities subject to purchase under any pending Offering.

14.2. Corporate Transactions. In the event of a Corporate Transaction, each right to acquire Shares on any Purchase Date that is sched-
uled to occur after the date of the consummation of the Corporate Transaction may be continued or assumed or an equivalent right may
be substituted by the surviving or successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such corporation. If such surviving or successor
corporation or parent or subsidiary thereof refuses to continue, assume or substitute for such outstanding rights, then the Board may,
in its discretion, either terminate the Plan or shorten the Purchase Period then in progress by setting a new Purchase Date for a speci-
fied date before the date of the consummation of the Corporate Transaction. Each Participant shall be notified in writing, prior to any
new Purchase Date, that the Purchase Date for the existing Offering has been changed to the new Purchase Date and that the Partic-
ipant’s right to acquire Shares will be exercised automatically on the new Purchase Date unless prior to such date the Participant’s

ADM Proxy Statement 2018

B-5

ADM EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

employment has been terminated or the Participant has withdrawn from the Plan. In the event of a dissolution or liquidation of ADM,
any Offering and Purchase Period then in progress will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such action, unless other-
wise provided by the Board.

15. Amendment or Suspension of Plan. The Committee, in its sole discretion, may at any time suspend this Plan or amend it in any respect,
but no such amendment may, without shareholder approval, increase the number of shares reserved under this Plan, or effect any other
change in the Plan that would require shareholder approval under applicable law or regulations or the rules of any securities exchange on
which the Shares may then be listed, or to maintain compliance with Code § 423. No such amendment or suspension shall adversely affect
the rights of Participants pursuant to Shares previously acquired under the Plan. During any suspension of the Plan, no new Offering or
Purchase Period shall begin and no Eligible Employee shall be offered any new right to purchase Shares under the Plan or any opportunity to
elect to participate in the Plan, and any existing payroll deduction authorizations shall be suspended, but any such right to purchase Shares
previously granted for a Purchase Period that began prior to the Plan suspension shall remain subject to the other provisions of this Plan
and the discretion of the Board and the Committee with respect thereto.

16. Effective Date and Term of Plan. The Plan will become effective June 15, 2018. No rights to purchase Shares granted under this Plan will
be exercised unless and until the Plan has been approved by the shareholders of ADM, which approval must be within 12 months before or
after the date the Plan is adopted by the Board. The Plan and all rights of Participants hereunder shall terminate (i) at any time, at the dis-
cretion of the Committee, or (ii) upon the completion of any Offering under which the limitation on the total number of Shares to be issued
during the entire term of the Plan, as determined in accordance with Sec. 3, has been reached. Except as otherwise determined by the Board,
upon termination of this Plan, ADM shall pay to each Participant cash in an amount equal to the entire remaining balance in such Partic-
ipant’s Recordkeeping Account.

17. Governmental Regulations and Listing. All rights granted or to be granted to Eligible Employees under this Plan are expressly subject
to all applicable laws and regulations and to the approval of all governmental authorities required in connection with the authorization,
issuance, sale or transfer of the Shares reserved for this Plan, including, without limitation, there being a current registration statement of
ADM under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the Shares purchasable on the Purchase Date applicable to such Shares. If
applicable, all such rights hereunder are also similarly subject to effectiveness of an appropriate listing application to a national securities
exchange covering the Shares issuable under the Plan upon official notice of issuance.

18. Rules for Foreign Jurisdictions. The Committee may adopt rules, procedures or subplans relating to the operation and administration of
the Plan to accommodate the specific requirements of local laws and procedures. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Com-
mittee is specifically authorized to adopt rules and procedures regarding handling of payroll deductions, payment of interest, conversion of
local currency, payroll tax, the definition of Eligible Compensation, withholding procedures and handling of stock certificates that vary with
local requirements.

19. Miscellaneous.

19.1. Effect on Employment Status. This Plan shall not be deemed to constitute a contract of employment between ADM or any Des-
ignated Affiliate and any Participant, nor shall it interfere with the right of ADM (or any Affiliate) to terminate the employment of any
Participant and treat him or her without regard to the effect that such treatment might have upon him or her under this Plan.

19.2. Governing Law. This Plan, and all agreements hereunder, shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the
State of Illinois.

19.3. Electronic Documentation and Signatures. Any reference in the Plan to election or enrollment forms, notices, authorizations or any
other document to be provided in writing shall include the provision of any such form, notice, authorization or document by electronic
means, including through ADM’s intranet or with ADM’s agent, and any reference in the Plan to the signing of any document shall
include the authentication of any such document provided in electronic form, in each case in accordance with procedures established by
the Committee.

19.4. Book-Entry and Electronic Transfer of Shares. Any reference in this Plan to the issuance or transfer of a stock certificate evidencing
Shares shall be deemed to include, in the Committee’s discretion, the issuance or transfer of such Shares in book-entry or electronic
form. Uncertificated Shares shall be deemed delivered for all purposes of this Plan when ADM or its agent shall have provided to the
recipient of the Shares a notice of issuance or transfer by electronic mail (with proof of receipt) or by United States mail, and have
recorded the issuance or transfer in its records.

19.5. Registration of Share Accounts and Certificates. Any Share account contemplated by Sec. 10.3 and certificate to be issued to a Partic-
ipant shall be registered in the name of the Participant, or jointly in the name of the Participant and another person, as the Participant
may direct on an appropriate form filed with ADM or the agent.

19.6. Code § 409A. The Plan is exempt from the application of Code § 409A and any ambiguities herein will be interpreted to so be
exempt from Code § 409A. In furtherance of the foregoing and notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, if the Commit-
tee determines that an option granted under the Plan may be subject to Code § 409A or that any provision in the Plan would cause an
option under the Plan to be subject to Code § 409A, the Committee may amend the terms of the Plan and/or of an outstanding Offering
under the Plan, or take such other action as the Committee determines is necessary or appropriate, in each case, without the Partic-
ipant’s consent, to exempt any outstanding option or future option that may be granted under the Plan from or to allow any such
options to comply with Code § 409A, but only to the extent any such amendments or actions by the Committee would not violate Code §
409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ADM and the Committee shall have no liability to a Participant or any other party if the option to
purchase Shares under the Plan that is intended to be exempt from or compliant with Code § 409A is not exempt or compliant or for
any action taken by the Committee with respect thereto. ADM makes no representations that the option to purchase Shares under the
Plan is compliant with Code § 409A.

19.7. Severability. If any provision of the Plan is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason in any
jurisdiction or as to any Participant, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan and the
Plan shall be construed and enforced as to such jurisdiction or Participant as if the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had not
been included.

BUSINESS

Company Overview

Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (the Company) was incorporated in Delaware in 1923, successor to the Daniels Linseed Co. 
founded in 1902.  The Company is one of the world’s leading producers of food and beverage ingredients, and other products 
made from oilseeds, corn, wheat, and other agricultural commodities.  The Company's products include natural flavors and colors, 
health and nutrition products, vegetable oil, corn sweeteners, flour, animal feed, and biofuels.  The Company has an extensive 
global grain elevator and transportation network to procure, store, clean, and transport agricultural commodities, such as oilseeds, 
corn, wheat, milo, oats, and barley, as well as products derived from those inputs.  The Company has significant investments in 
joint ventures.  The Company expects to benefit from these investments, which typically aim to expand or enhance the Company’s 
market for its products or offer other benefits including, but not limited to, geographic or product line expansion.

The Company’s vision is to be the most admired global agribusiness and ingredients company while creating value and growing 
responsibly.  The Company’s strategy involves expanding the volume and diversity of crops that it merchandises and processes, 
expanding the global reach of its core model, and expanding its value-added product portfolio.  The Company desires to execute 
this vision and these strategies by conducting its business in accordance with its core values of operating with integrity, treating 
others with respect, achieving excellence, being resourceful, displaying teamwork, and being responsible.

As  the  world  population  grows,  so  does  demand  for  quality  foods,  feed  ingredients  for  livestock,  alternative  fuels,  and 
environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional chemicals.  As one of the world's leading agricultural and food ingredient 
processors, the Company plays a pivotal role in meeting all of these needs in sustainable ways.  The Company produces the food 
ingredients, biofuels, and other products that manufacturers around the world use to provide wholesome food and a better life to 
millions of people around the globe.

Segment Descriptions
 
The Company’s operations are organized, managed, and classified into four reportable business segments: Agricultural Services, 
Corn Processing, Oilseeds Processing, and Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients.  Each of these segments is organized based 
upon the nature of products and services offered.  The Company’s remaining operations are not reportable business segments, as 
defined by the applicable accounting standard, and are classified as Other.  Financial information with respect to the Company’s 
reportable business segments is set forth in Note 17 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Item 8 herein, 
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Agricultural Services

The Agricultural Services segment utilizes its extensive global grain elevator and transportation networks, and port operations to 
buy, store, clean, and transport agricultural commodities, such as oilseeds, corn, wheat, milo, oats, rice, and barley, and resells 
these commodities primarily as food and feed ingredients and as raw materials for the agricultural processing industry.  The 
Agricultural Services segment includes international agricultural commodities merchandising and handling activities managed 
through a global trade desk based in Rolle, Switzerland.  Agricultural Services’ grain sourcing, handling, and transportation network 
provides reliable and efficient services to the Company’s customers and agricultural processing operations.  Agricultural Services’ 
transportation network capabilities include barge, ocean-going vessel, truck, rail, and container freight services.  The Agricultural 
Services segment also includes the activities related to structured trade finance and the processing of wheat into wheat flour.  In 
July  2017,  the  Company  completed  the  acquisition  of  a  51%  controlling  interest  in  Industries  Centers,  an  Israeli  company 
specializing in the import and distribution of agricultural feed products, which is now known as ADM Israel.
  
The Company has a 32.2% interest in Pacificor (formerly Kalama Export Company LLC).  Pacificor owns and operates a grain 
export elevator in Kalama, Washington and a grain export elevator in Portland, Oregon.

The Company held a 19.8% interest in GrainCorp Limited (GrainCorp), a publicly listed company on the Australian Stock Exchange, 
until its sale in December 2016.  GrainCorp is engaged in grain receival and handling, transportation, port operations, oilseed 
processing, malt processing, flour processing, and grain marketing activities.

Corn Processing

The Company’s Corn Processing segment is engaged in corn wet and dry milling and other activities, utilizing its asset base 
primarily located in the central part of the United States with additional facilities in China, Bulgaria, France, Morocco, Spain, and 
Turkey.  The Corn Processing segment converts corn into sweeteners, starches, and bioproducts.  Its products include ingredients 
used in the food and beverage industry including sweeteners, starch, syrup, glucose, and dextrose.  Dextrose and starch are used 
by the Corn Processing segment as feedstocks for its bioproducts operations.  By fermentation of dextrose, the Corn Processing 
segment produces alcohol, amino acids, and other food and animal feed ingredients.  Ethyl alcohol is produced by the Company 
for industrial use as ethanol or as beverage grade.  Ethanol, in gasoline, increases octane and is used as an extender and oxygenate.  
Bioproducts also include essential amino acids such as lysine and threonine used in swine and poultry diets to optimize performance.  
Corn gluten feed and meal, as well as distillers’ grains, are produced for use as animal feed ingredients.  Corn germ, a by-product 
of the wet milling process, is further processed into vegetable oil and protein meal.  The Corn Processing segment also includes 
activities related to the processing and distribution of formula feeds and animal health and nutrition products.  Other Corn Processing 
products include citric acids and glycols, all of which are used in various food and industrial products.  The Corn Processing 
segment also included the activities of the Company’s Brazilian sugarcane ethanol plant and related operations until the Company 
completed the sale of these operations in May 2016.  In February 2017, the Company acquired Crosswind Industries, Inc., an 
industry leader in the manufacture of contract and private label pet treats and food, as well as specialty ingredients, and an 89% 
controlling interest in Biopolis SL, a leading provider of microbial technology with a strong portfolio of novel food ingredients.

The  Oilseeds  Processing  segment  includes  global  activities  related  to  the  origination,  merchandising,  crushing,  and  further 
processing of oilseeds such as soybeans and soft seeds (cottonseed, sunflower seed, canola, rapeseed, and flaxseed) into vegetable 
oils and protein meals.  Oilseeds products produced and marketed by the Company include ingredients for the food, feed, energy, 
and industrial products industries.  Crude vegetable oils produced by the segment’s crushing activities are sold “as is” or are further 
processed by refining, blending, bleaching, and deodorizing into salad oils.  Salad oils are sold “as is” or are further processed by 
hydrogenating and/or interesterifying into margarine, shortening, and other food products. Partially refined oils are used to produce 
biodiesel or are sold to other manufacturers for use in chemicals, paints, and other industrial products.  Oilseed protein meals are 
principally sold to third parties to be used as ingredients in commercial livestock and poultry feeds.  In Europe and South America, 
the Oilseeds Processing segment includes origination and merchandising activities as adjuncts to its oilseeds processing assets.  
These activities include a network of grain elevators, port facilities, and transportation assets used to buy, store, clean, and transport 
grains and oilseeds.  The Oilseeds Processing segment is a major supplier of peanuts, tree nuts, and peanut-derived ingredients to 
both the U.S. and export markets.  In North America, cottonseed flour is produced and sold primarily to the pharmaceutical industry 
and cotton cellulose pulp is manufactured and sold to the chemical, paper, and filter markets.  The Oilseeds Processing segment 
also included activities related to its global chocolate and cocoa businesses until the sale of these businesses in July 2015 and 
October 2015, respectively. 
 
The Company has an equity interest in Wilmar International Limited (Wilmar), a Singapore publicly listed company.  During the 
year ended December 31, 2017, the Company acquired additional shares in Wilmar, increasing its ownership interest from 23.2% 
to 24.9% as of December 31, 2017.  Wilmar, a leading agribusiness group in Asia, is engaged in the businesses of oil palm cultivation,

The Company continues to expand the size and global reach of its business through the development of new products.  Acquisitions, 
especially in the Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients segment, expand the Company’s ability to serve the customers’ evolving 
needs through its offering of natural flavor and ingredient products.  The Company does not expect any of its new products to have 
a significant impact on the Company’s revenues in 2018. 

Source and Availability of Raw Materials

Substantially all of the Company’s raw materials are agricultural commodities.  In any single year, the availability and price of 
these commodities are subject to factors such as changes in weather conditions, plantings, government programs and policies, 
competition, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.  The 
Company’s raw materials are procured from thousands of growers, grain elevators, and wholesale merchants in North America, 
South America, EMEA, Asia, and Australia, pursuant primarily to short-term (less than one year) agreements or on a spot basis.  The 
Company is not dependent upon any particular grower, elevator, or merchant as a source for its raw materials.

Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses

The Company owns patents, trademarks, and licenses, principally consisting of $222 million of trademarks from the Wild Flavors 
acquisition in 2014, but does not consider any segment of its business dependent upon any single or group of patents, trademarks 
or licenses. 

Seasonality, Working Capital Needs, and Significant Customers

Since the Company is widely diversified in global agribusiness markets, there are no material seasonal fluctuations in overall 
global processing volumes and the sale and distribution of its products and services.  There is a degree of seasonality in the growing 
cycles, procurement, and transportation of the Company’s principal raw materials: oilseeds, corn, wheat, and other grains.
 
The prices of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly, directly affect the Company’s 
working capital requirements.  Because the Company has a higher portion of its operations in the northern hemisphere, principally 
North America and Europe, relative to the southern hemisphere, primarily South America, inventory levels typically peak after 
the northern hemisphere fall harvest and are generally lower during the northern hemisphere summer months.  Working capital 
requirements have historically trended with inventory levels.  No material part of the Company’s business is dependent upon a 
single customer or very few customers.  The Company has seasonal financing arrangements with farmers in certain countries 
around the world.  Typically, advances on these financing arrangements occur during the planting season and are repaid at harvest.

Competition

The Company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates based principally on price, foreign exchange rates, 
quality, global supply, and alternative products, some of which are made from different raw materials than those utilized by the 
Company.  Given the commodity-based nature of many of its businesses, the Company, on an ongoing basis, focuses on managing 
unit costs and improving efficiency through technology improvements, productivity enhancements, and regular evaluation of the 
Company’s asset portfolio.

BUSINESS (Continued)

Research and Development Expenditures

The Company’s research and development expenditures are focused on responding to demand from customers’ product development 
or formulation needs, improving processing efficiency, and developing food, feed, fuel, and industrial products from renewable 
agricultural  crops.  Research  and  development  expense  during  the  years  ended  December 31,  2017,  2016,  and  2015,  net  of 
reimbursements of government grants, was approximately $129 million, $123 million, and $122 million, respectively.

The Company’s laboratories and technical centers around the world enhance its ability to interact with customers in Europe, Asia, 
and South America, not only to provide flavors, but also to support the sales of other food ingredients.  The acquisition of Wild 
Flavors in October 2014 approximately doubled the number of scientists and technicians in research and development.  Since that 
time, additional laboratories have been added, including food & beverages applications laboratories in Sydney, Australia and 
Cranbury, New Jersey as well as expanded laboratories in Decatur, Illinois and Singapore.

The Company is working with the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Energy Technology Laboratory and other key academic 
and corporate partners on carbon sequestration projects to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from manufacturing operations.  The 
second carbon sequestration project, the Illinois Industrial Carbon Capture & Sequestration, started carbon dioxide injection in 
April 2017.

The Company is continuing to invest in research to develop a broad range of sustainable materials with an objective to produce 
key intermediate materials that serve as a platform for producing a variety of sustainable packaging products.  The key materials 
are derived from the Company’s starch and oilseed-based feedstocks.  Conversion technologies include utilizing expertise in both 
fermentation and catalysis.  The materials pipeline includes the development of chemicals and intermediates that are currently 
produced from petrochemical resources as well as new-to-the-market bio-based products. The Company’s current portfolio includes 
products that are in the early development phase and those that are close to pilot plant demonstration.  The Company’s project 
with DuPont to develop sustainable packaging solutions with improved barrier properties has progressed to the construction of a 
demonstration semi-works plant.  This facility, which will be completed in early 2018, will provide both development samples for 
customers as well as engineering data for a full scale plant.

The Company is also expanding its human health and nutrition portfolio with the acquisition of an 89% controlling interest in 
Biopolis SL (Biopolis), a leading provider of probiotics and genomic services.  Biopolis provides genomic sequencing capabilities 
for the Company's customers as well as for its internal use.  Biopolis also has high through-put biological functionality testing 
capabilities that can be used to discover new probiotics and nutraceuticals.  In September 2017, the Company announced a 
collaboration with the Mayo Clinic to study gut microflora with respect to personalized nutrition.

In January 2018, the Company announced a joint development agreement with Vland Biotech to develop and commercialize 
enzymes for animal feed.
 
ADM Ventures, which was launched by the Company in October 2016, has made its first selections of high-potential, new-product 
development projects from its business units.  ADM Ventures is also looking at several promising, early-stage start-up companies 
in which the Company may wish to invest.

Environmental Compliance

During the year ended December 31, 2017, $40 million was spent specifically to improve equipment, facilities, and programs for 
pollution control and compliance with the requirements of various environmental agencies.

There have been no material effects upon the earnings and competitive position of the Company resulting from compliance with 
applicable laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment.

Item 1.

BUSINESS (Continued)

A number of jurisdictions where the Company has operations have implemented or are in the process of implementing carbon 
pricing programs or regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including, but not limited to, the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the 
E.U. and its member states, and China.  The Company's operations located in countries with effective and applicable carbon pricing 
and regulatory programs currently meet their obligations in this regard with no significant impact on the earnings and competitive 
position of the Company.  The Company’s business could be affected in the future by additional global, regional, national, and 
local regulation, pricing of greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change legislation, regulation or agreements.  It is difficult 
at this time to estimate the likelihood of passage, or predict the potential impact, of any additional legislation, regulations or 
agreements.    Potential  consequences  of  new  obligations  could  include  increased  energy,  transportation,  raw  material,  and 
administrative costs, and may require the Company to make additional investments in its facilities and equipment.

Number of Employees

The number of full-time employees of the Company was approximately 31,300 at December 31, 2017 and 31,800 at December 31, 
2016.  The net decrease in the number of full-time employees is primarily related to the reduction of certain positions within the 
Company's global workforce and divestitures, partially offset by acquisitions.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS

The Company faces risks in the normal course of business and through global, regional, and local events that could have an adverse 
impact on its reputation, operations, and financial performance.

Management directs a Company-wide Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Program, with oversight from the Company’s Board 
of Directors.  The Company’s Audit Committee has the delegated risk management oversight responsibility and receives updates 
on the risk management processes and key risk factors on a quarterly basis.

The risk factors that follow are the main risks that the ERM program focuses on to protect and enhance shareholder value through 
intentional risk mitigation plans based on management-defined risk limits.

9

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)

The Company, through its business unit, functional, and corporate teams, continually updates, assesses, monitors, and mitigates 
these and other business and compliance risks in accordance with the ERM Program and as monitored by the ERM Program team 
and Chief Risk Officer.  

The availability and prices of the agricultural commodities and agricultural commodity products the Company procures, 
transports,  stores,  processes,  and  merchandises  can  be  affected  by  weather  conditions,  disease,  government  programs, 
competition, and various other factors beyond the Company’s control and could adversely affect the Company’s operating 
results.

The availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to changes in weather conditions, crop 
disease, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and 
global  production  of  similar  and  competitive  crops.  The  Company  uses  a  global  network  of  procurement,  processing,  and 
transportation assets, as well as robust communications between global commodity merchandiser teams, to continually assess price 
and basis opportunities.  These commodity trade teams monitor commodity positions against management established limits 
(including a corporate wide value-at-risk metric), with robust internal reporting to ensure optimized results versus the Company’s 
strategic  plans.   Additionally,  the  Company  depends  globally  on  agricultural  producers  to  ensure  an  adequate  supply  of  the 
agricultural commodities used by the Company in its operations is maintained.  These factors have historically caused volatility 
in the availability and prices of agricultural commodities and, consequently, in the Company’s operating results and working capital 
requirements.  Reduced supply of agricultural commodities due to weather-related factors or other reasons could adversely affect 
the Company’s profitability by increasing the cost of raw materials and/or limiting the Company’s ability to procure, transport, 
store, process, and merchandise agricultural commodities in an efficient manner.  For example, a drought in North America in 
2012 reduced the availability of corn and soybean inventories while prices increased.  High and volatile commodity prices can 
adversely affect the Company’s ability to meet its liquidity needs.  Conversely, if supplies are abundant and crop production globally 
outpaces demand for more than one or two crop cycles, price volatility is somewhat diminished.  This could result in reduced 
operating results due to the lack of supply chain dislocations and reduced market spread and basis opportunities.  

Advances in technology, such as seed and crop protection technology, farming techniques, or speed of information flow, may 
reduce the significance of dislocations and arbitrage opportunities in the agricultural global markets, which may reduce the earnings 
potential of agricultural merchandisers and processors such as the Company.  

The Company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates.

The Company faces significant competition in each of its businesses and has numerous competitors.  The company competes for 
the acquisition of inputs such as agricultural commodities, transportation services, and other materials and supplies, as well as for 
workforce and talent.  Additionally, competitors offer similar products and services, as well as alternative products and services, 
to the Company’s customers.  The Company is dependent on being able to generate revenues in excess of cost of products sold in 
order to obtain margins, profits, and cash flows to meet or exceed its targeted financial performance measures and provide cash 
for operating, working capital, dividend, or capital expenditure needs.  Competition impacts the Company’s ability to generate 
and increase its gross profit as a result of the following factors.  Pricing of the Company’s products is partly dependent upon 
industry processing capacity, which is impacted by competitor actions to bring idled capacity on-line, build new production capacity 
or execute aggressive consolidation.  Many of the products bought and sold by the Company are global commodities or are derived 
from global commodities.  The markets for global commodities are highly price competitive and in many cases the commodities 
are subject to substitution.  Significant changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar, particularly the 
currencies of major crop growing countries, could also make goods and products of these countries more competitive than U.S. 
products, thereby negatively impacting the competitiveness of the Company’s significant origination, processing, and export 
footprint, and the Company’s operating results.  Improved yields in different crop growing regions may reduce the reliance on 
origination territories in which the Company has a significant presence.  In addition, continued merger and acquisition activities 
resulting in further consolidations result in greater cost competitiveness and global scale of certain players in the industry that 
could impact the relative competitiveness of the Company, especially when acquirers are state-owned and/or backed by public 
funds and have profit and return objectives that may differ from publicly traded enterprises.  To compete effectively, the Company 
focuses on improving efficiency in its production and distribution operations, developing and maintaining appropriate market 
share, maintaining a high level of product safety and quality, and working with customers to develop new products and tailored 
solutions.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)

Fluctuations in energy prices could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The Company’s operating costs and the selling prices of certain finished products are sensitive to changes in energy prices.  The 
Company’s processing plants are powered principally by electricity, natural gas, and coal.  The Company’s transportation operations 
are dependent upon diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products.  Significant increases in the cost of these items, including any 
consequences of regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases, could adversely affect the Company’s production costs and operating 
results.

The Company has certain finished products, such as ethanol and biodiesel, which are closely related to, or may be substituted for, 
petroleum products, or in the case of ethanol, blended into gasoline to increase octane content.  Therefore, the selling prices of 
ethanol and biodiesel can be impacted by the selling prices of gasoline, diesel fuel, and other octane enhancers.  A significant 
decrease in the price of gasoline, diesel fuel, or other octane enhancers could result in a significant decrease in the selling price of 
the Company’s ethanol and biodiesel and could adversely affect the Company’s revenues and operating results.  The Company 
uses derivative contracts as anticipatory hedges for both purchases of commodity inputs and sales of energy-based products in 
order to protect itself against these price trends and to protect and maximize processing margins. 

The Company is subject to economic downturns and regional economic volatilities, which could adversely affect the Company’s 
operating results.

The Company conducts its business and has substantial assets located in many countries and geographic areas. While 56 percent
of the Company’s processing plants and 74 percent of its procurement facilities are located in the United States, the Company also 
has significant operations in both developed areas (such as Western Europe, Canada, and Brazil) and emerging market areas (such 
as Eastern Europe, Asia, portions of South and Central America, the Middle East, and Africa).  One of the Company’s strategies 
is to expand the global reach of its core model which may include expanding or developing its business in emerging market areas 
such as Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Both developed and emerging market areas are subject to impacts of 
economic downturns, including decreased demand for the Company’s products, and reduced availability of credit, or declining 
credit quality of the Company’s suppliers, customers, and other counterparties.  In addition, emerging market areas could be subject 
to  more  volatile  operating  conditions  including,  but  not  limited  to,  logistics  limitations  or  delays,  labor-related  challenges, 
limitations or regulations affecting trade flows (such as concerning genetically modified organisms), local currency concerns, and 
other  economic  and  political  instability.  Political  fiscal  instability  could  generate  intrusive  regulations  in  emerging  markets 
potentially creating unanticipated assessments of taxes, fees, increased risks of corruption, etc.  Economic downturns and volatile 
market conditions could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and ability to execute its long-term business strategies, 
thus reducing the Company’s overall market value.  The Company mitigates this risk in many ways including country risk analysis, 
government relations and tax compliance activities, and active ethics compliance training requirements. 

The Company is subject to numerous laws, regulations, and mandates globally which could adversely affect the Company’s 
operating results and forward strategy.

The Company does business globally, connecting crops and markets in more than 170 countries.  The Company is required to 
comply with the numerous and far-reaching laws and regulations administered by United States federal, state, local, and foreign 
governmental authorities.  The Company must comply with other general business regulations covering areas such as accounting 
and income taxes, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, global trade, trade sanctions, environmental, product safety, and handling and 
production of regulated substances.  The Company frequently faces challenges from U.S. and foreign tax authorities regarding the 
amount of taxes due.  These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of 
income among various tax jurisdictions.  In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company 
records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company.  As examples, the Company has received large 
tax assessments from tax authorities in Brazil and Argentina, challenging income tax positions taken by subsidiaries of the Company 
covering various prior periods.  Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or appropriately resolve these challenges 
could subject the Company to administrative, civil, and criminal remedies including fines, penalties, disgorgement, injunctions, 
and recalls of its products, and damage to its reputation.

The production of the Company’s products requires the use of materials which can create emissions of certain regulated substances, 
including greenhouse gas emissions.  Although the Company has programs in place throughout the organization globally to ensure 
compliance with laws and regulations, failure to comply with these laws and regulations can have serious consequences, including 
civil, administrative, and criminal penalties as well as a negative impact on the Company’s reputation, business, cash flows, and 
results of operations.

11

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)

In addition, changes to regulations or implementation of additional regulations, for example the imposition of regulatory restrictions 
on greenhouse gases or regulatory modernization of food safety laws, may require the Company to modify existing processing 
facilities and/or processes which could significantly increase operating costs and adversely affect operating results.

Government policies, mandates, and regulations specifically affecting the agricultural sector and related industries; regulatory 
policies or matters that affect a variety of businesses; taxation polices; and political instability could adversely affect the 
Company’s operating results.

Agricultural  production  and  trade  flows  are  subject  to  government  policies,  mandates,  regulations,  and  trade  agreements. 
Governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry, such as taxes, tariffs, duties, subsidies, incentives, foreign exchange 
rates,  and  import  and  export  restrictions  on  agricultural  commodities  and  commodity  products,  including  policies  related  to 
genetically modified organisms, traceability standards, product safety and labeling, renewable fuels, and low carbon fuel mandates, 
can influence the planting of certain crops, the location and size of crop production, whether unprocessed or processed commodity 
products are traded, the volume and types of imports and exports, the availability and competitiveness of feedstocks as raw materials, 
the viability and volume of production of certain of the Company’s products, and industry profitability.  For example, changes in 
government policies or regulations of ethanol and biodiesel, including but not limited to changes in the Renewable Fuel Standard 
program under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 in the United States, can have an impact on the Company’s 
operating results.  International trade regulations can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting 
trade between countries or regions.  Regulations of financial markets and instruments, including the Dodd-Frank Act, Consumer 
Protection Act, and the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, create uncertainty and may lead to additional risks and costs, 
and could adversely affect the Company’s futures commission merchant business and its agricultural commodity risk management 
practices.  Future government policies may adversely affect the supply of, demand for, and prices of the Company’s products; 
adversely affect the Company's ability to deploy adequate hedging programs; restrict the Company’s ability to do business in its 
existing and target markets; and adversely affect the Company’s revenues and operating results.

The Company’s operating results could be affected by political instability and by changes in other governmental policies, mandates, 
regulations, and trade agreements including monetary, fiscal and environmental policies, laws, regulations, acquisition approvals, 
and other activities of governments, agencies, and similar organizations.  These risks include but are not limited to changes in a 
country’s or region’s economic or political conditions, local labor conditions and regulations, safety and environmental regulations, 
reduced protection of intellectual property rights, changes in the regulatory or legal environment, restrictions on currency exchange 
activities, currency exchange fluctuations, burdensome taxes and tariffs, enforceability of legal agreements and judgments, adverse 
tax,  administrative  agency  or  judicial  outcomes,  and  regulation  or  taxation  of  greenhouse  gases.  International  risks  and 
uncertainties, including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism, political hostilities, and war, could limit 
the Company’s ability to transact business in these markets and could adversely affect the Company’s revenues and operating 
results.  There has been a recent increase in populism and nationalism in various countries around the world and the concept and 
benefits of free trade are being challenged.  The Company has benefited from the free flow of agricultural and food and feed 
ingredient products from the U.S. and other sources to markets around the world.  Should there be an increase in tariff and restrictive 
trade activities around the world, the Company could be negatively impacted from its inability to enter certain markets or the price 
of the products being less competitive in the destination markets.

The Company’s strategy involves expanding the volume and diversity of crops it merchandises and processes, expanding the global 
reach of its core model, and expanding its value-added product portfolio.  Government policies, including antitrust and competition 
law, trade restrictions, food safety regulations, sustainability requirements, traceability, and other government regulations and 
mandates, can impact the Company’s ability to execute this strategy successfully.

The Company is subject to industry-specific risks which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The Company is subject to risks which include, but are not limited to, product safety or quality; shifting consumer preferences; 
federal, state, and local regulations on manufacturing or labeling; socially acceptable farming practices; environmental, health and 
safety regulations; and customer product liability claims.  The liability which could result from certain of these risks may not 
always be covered by, or could exceed liability insurance related to product liability and food safety matters maintained by the 
Company.  In addition, negative publicity caused by product liability, food safety, occupational health and safety, and environmental 
matters may damage the Company’s reputation.  The Company has a particularly strong capability and culture around occupational 
health and safety and food safety.  However, the occurrence of any of the matters described above could adversely affect the 
Company’s revenues and operating results.

12

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)

Certain of the Company’s merchandised commodities and finished products are used as ingredients in livestock and poultry 
feed.  The Company is subject to risks associated with economic, product quality, feed safety or other factors which may adversely 
affect the livestock and poultry businesses, including the outbreak of disease in livestock and poultry.  An outbreak of disease 
could adversely affect demand for the Company’s products used as ingredients in livestock and poultry feed.  A decrease in demand 
for ingredients in livestock and poultry feed could adversely affect the Company’s revenues and operating results.  In addition, as 
the Company increases its investment in flavors and ingredients businesses, it is exposed to increased risks related to rapidly 
changing consumer preferences and the impacts these changes could have on the success of certain of the Company's customers.

The Company is exposed to potential business disruption, including but not limited to disruption of transportation services, 
supply of non-commodity raw materials used in its processing operations, and other impacts resulting from acts of terrorism 
or war, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, and accidents which could adversely affect the Company’s operating 
results.

The Company’s operations rely on dependable and efficient transportation services.  A disruption in transportation services could 
result in difficulties supplying materials to the Company’s facilities and impair the Company’s ability to deliver products to its 
customers in a timely manner.  The Company relies on access to navigable rivers and waterways in order to fulfill its transportation 
obligations more effectively.  If access to these navigable waters is interrupted, the Company’s operating results could be adversely 
affected.  In addition, if certain non-agricultural commodity raw materials, such as water or certain chemicals used in the Company’s 
processing operations, are not available, the Company’s business could be disrupted.  Any major lack of available water for use 
in certain of the Company’s processing operations could have a material adverse impact on operating results.  Certain factors which 
may impact the availability of non-agricultural commodity raw materials are out of the Company’s control including, but not 
limited to, disruptions resulting from weather, economic conditions, manufacturing delays or disruptions at suppliers, shortage of 
materials, interruption of energy supply, and unavailable or poor supplier credit conditions.

The assets and operations of the Company could be subject to extensive property damage and business disruption from various 
events which include, but are not limited to, acts of terrorism, for example, economic adulteration of the Company’s products, or 
war, natural disasters and severe weather conditions, accidents, explosions, and fires. The potential effects of these conditions 
could adversely affect the Company’s revenues and operating results.  The Company is continuing to enhance and deploy additional 
food safety and security procedures and controls to appropriately mitigate the risks of any adulteration of the Company’s products 
in supply chain and finished products in production and distribution networks. In addition, the Company conforms to management 
systems, such as International Organization for Standardization (ISO) or other recognized global standards.

The Company’s business is capital-intensive in nature and the Company relies on cash generated from its operations and 
external financing to fund its growth and ongoing capital needs.  Limitations on access to external financing could adversely 
affect the Company’s operating results.

The Company requires significant capital, including continuing access to credit markets, to operate its current business and fund 
its growth strategy.  The Company’s working capital requirements, including margin requirements on open positions on futures 
exchanges, are directly affected by the price of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly.  The 
Company also requires substantial capital to maintain and upgrade its extensive network of storage facilities, processing plants, 
refineries,  mills,  ports,  transportation  assets  and  other  facilities  to  keep  pace  with  competitive  developments,  technological 
advances, regulations and changing safety standards in the industry.  Moreover, the expansion of the Company’s business and 
pursuit of acquisitions or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital.  Access to credit markets and 
pricing of the Company’s capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies.  Sufficient 
credit ratings allow the Company to access cost competitive tier one commercial paper markets.  If the Company is unable to 
maintain sufficiently high credit ratings, access to these commercial paper and other debt markets and costs of borrowings could 
be adversely affected.  If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or maintain access to adequate external financing, 
including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets, it could restrict the Company’s current operations and 
its growth opportunities which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.  The Company manages this risk with 
constant monitoring of credit/liquidity metrics, cash forecasting, and routine communications with credit rating agencies on risk 
management practices.  

13

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)

The Company’s risk management strategies may not be effective.
 
The Company’s business is affected by fluctuations in agricultural commodity cash prices and derivative prices, transportation 
costs, energy prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity markets.  The Company monitors position limits 
and counterparty risks and engages in other strategies and controls to manage these risks.  The Company has a Chief Risk Officer 
and  an  established  commodity  merchandising  governance  process  to  ensure  proper  position  reporting  and  monitoring,  limit 
approvals, and execute training on trade compliance, commodity regulatory reporting controls, and other policies.  The Company’s 
monitoring efforts may not be successful at detecting a significant risk exposure.  If these controls and strategies are not successful 
in mitigating the Company’s exposure to these fluctuations, it could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.
 
The Company has limited control over and may not realize the expected benefits of its equity investments and joint ventures.
 
The Company has $5.1 billion invested in or advanced to joint ventures and investments over which the Company has limited 
control as to the governance and management activities of these investments.  Net sales to unconsolidated affiliates during the 
year ended December 31, 2017 was $6.0 billion.  The Company faces certain risks, including risks related to the financial strength 
of the investment partner; loss of revenues and cash flows to the investment partner and related gross profit; the inability to 
implement  beneficial  management  strategies,  including  risk  management  and  compliance  monitoring,  with  respect  to  the 
investment’s activities; and the risk that the Company may not be able to resolve disputes with the investment partner.  The Company 
may encounter unanticipated operating issues, financial results, or compliance and reputational risks related to these investments 
that may impact the Company’s revenues and operating results.  The Company mitigates this risk using controls and policies related 
to joint venture formation, governance including board of directors representation, merger and acquisition integration management, 
and harmonization of joint venture policies with the Company’s policies and controls. 

The Company’s information technology (IT) systems, processes, and sites may suffer interruptions, security breaches, or failures 
which may affect the Company’s ability to conduct its business.
 
The Company’s operations rely on certain key IT systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, to 
provide critical data connectivity, information, and services for internal and external users.  These interactions include, but are not 
limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, risk management activities, converting raw materials to finished 
products, inventory management, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of 
operations, human resources benefits and payroll management, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, and other 
processes necessary to manage the business.  The Company is also in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource 
planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis as part of its ongoing business transformation program, which is expected to improve 
the efficiency and effectiveness of certain financial and business transaction processes and the underlying systems environment.  
Increased IT security and social engineering threats and more sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats, 
pose a potential risk to the security of the Company’s IT systems, networks, and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability, 
and integrity of the Company’s third party data.  The Company has put in place security measures to prevent, detect, and mitigate 
cyber-based attacks and instituted control procedures for cyber security incident responses and disaster recovery plans for its 
critical systems.  In addition, the Company monitors this risk on an ongoing basis to detect and correct any breaches and reports 
metrics to the highest level of management and to the Board of Directors on the quality of the Company’s data security efforts and 
control environment.  However, if the Company’s IT systems are breached, damaged, or cease to function properly due to any 
number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, or cyber-based attacks, and the Company’s disaster 
recovery plans do not effectively mitigate the risks on a timely basis, the Company may suffer significant interruptions in its ability 
to manage its operations, loss of valuable data, actual or threatened legal actions, and damage to its reputation, which may adversely 
impact the Company’s revenues, operating results, and financial condition.

The Company’s operations are such that most products are efficiently processed near the source of raw materials.  Consequently, 
the Company has many plants strategically located in agricultural commodity producing areas.  The annual volume of commodities 
processed will vary depending upon availability of raw materials and demand for finished products.  The Company also owns 
approximately 230 warehouses and terminals primarily used as bulk storage facilities and 44 innovation centers.  Warehouses, 
terminals, corporate, and sales offices are not included in the tables above.  Processing plants and procurement facilities owned 
or leased by unconsolidated joint ventures are also not included in the tables above.

To  enhance  the  efficiency  of  transporting  large  quantities  of  raw  materials  and  finished  products  between  the  Company’s 
procurement facilities and processing plants and also the final delivery of products to its customers around the world, the Company 
owns approximately 1,800 barges, 12,300 rail cars, 290 trucks, 1,300 trailers, 100 boats, and 10 oceangoing vessels; and leases, 
under operating leases, approximately 510 barges, 16,000 rail cars, 270 trucks, 130 trailers, 10 boats, and 15 oceangoing vessels.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is routinely involved in a number of actual or threatened legal actions, including those involving alleged personal 
injuries, employment law, product liability, intellectual property, environmental issues, alleged tax liability (see Note 13 in Item 
8 for information on income tax matters), and class actions.  The Company also routinely receives inquiries from regulators and 
other government authorities relating to various aspects of its business, and at any given time, the Company has matters at various 
stages of resolution with the applicable government authorities.  The outcomes of these matters are not within the Company's 
complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time.  In some actions, claimants seek damages, as well as other 
relief, including injunctive relief, that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues. In accordance with applicable 
accounting standards, the Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for material loss contingencies when 
a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  If the reasonable estimate of a known or 
probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is 
accrued.  If a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the 
estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  When determining the estimated 
loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded.  Estimates of 
probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, 
particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages, with incomplete facts or legal discovery; involve unsubstantiated or 
indeterminate claims for damages; potentially involve penalties, fines, disgorgement, or punitive damages; or could result in a 
change in business practice.  See Note 20 in Item 8 for information on the Company’s legal proceedings.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
OPERATIONS

Company Overview

This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

The Company is principally engaged in procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities, 
products, and ingredients.  The Company uses its significant global asset base to originate and transport agricultural commodities, 
connecting to markets in more than 170 countries.  The Company also processes corn, oilseeds, and wheat into products for food, 
animal feed, chemical and energy uses.  The Company uses its global asset network, business acumen, and its relationships with 
suppliers and customers to efficiently connect the harvest to the home thereby generating returns for our shareholders, principally 
from margins earned on these activities.

The Company’s operations are organized, managed, and classified into four reportable business segments: Agricultural Services, 
Corn Processing, Oilseeds Processing, and Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients.  Each of these segments is organized based 
upon the nature of products and services offered.  The Company’s remaining operations are not reportable business segments, as 
defined by the applicable accounting standard, and are classified as Other.  See Note 17 of Item 8 for more information about the 
Company’s business segments.

The Company’s recent significant portfolio actions and announcements include:

• 

• 

• 
• 

• 

• 
• 

• 
• 
• 

• 
• 

• 

the acquisition in February 2017 of Crosswind Industries, Inc., an industry leader in the manufacture of contract and 
private label pet treats and foods, as well as specialty ingredients;
the acquisition in February 2017 of an 89% controlling interest in Biopolis SL, a leading provider of microbial technology 
with a strong portfolio of novel food ingredients, followed later in the year by a partnership with the Mayo Clinic to 
explore personalized nutrition applications including the effects of prebiotics and probiotics that may improve digestive 
health;
the construction of a new feed-premix facility in Xiangtan, China, which is expected to be completed in 2019;
the sale in May 2017 of the Company's crop risk services business to Validus Holdings, a global group of insurance and 
reinsurance companies;
the completion in May 2017 of a series of major enhancements at the Company’s export terminal in Santos, in the Brazilian 
state of Sao Paulo;
the construction of a new flour mill in Mendota, Illinois, which is expected to be completed in 2019;
the expansion of a Golden Peanut and Tree Nuts production facility in Blakely, Georgia, which is expected to be completed  
in 2018;
the completion in June 2017 of a new silo located on the Danube River in Silistra, Bulgaria; 
the acquisition in June 2017 of Chamtor, a French producer of wheat-based sweeteners and starches;
the acquisition in July 2017 of a 51% controlling interest in Industries Centers, an Israeli company specializing in the 
import and distribution of agricultural feed products, which is now known as ADM Israel;
the modernization of the flour mill in Enid, Oklahoma, which is expected to be completed in 2018;
the announcement in December 2017 of the sale of the Company's oilseeds operations in Bolivia to Inversiones Piuranas 
S.A., which is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first half of 2018; and
the announcement in January 2018 of a joint development agreement and Vland Biotech to develop and commercialize 
enzymes for animal feed. 

As part of the implementation of the Company’s strategic plan, the Company continues to evaluate the capital intensity of its 
operations and portfolio, seeking ways to reduce and redeploy capital in its efforts to reduce volatility of earnings and drive long-
term returns.

Operating Performance Indicators

The Company’s agricultural services and oilseeds processing operations are principally agricultural commodity-based businesses 
where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commodity-based agricultural raw materials.  
Therefore, changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both revenues and cost of products sold.  
Thus, changes in revenues of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in margins or gross profit.

26

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
OPERATIONS (Continued)

The  Company’s  corn  processing  operations  and  Wild  Flavors  and  Specialty  Ingredients  businesses  also  utilize  agricultural 
commodities (or products derived from agricultural commodities) as raw materials.  However, in these operations, agricultural 
commodity market price changes do not necessarily correlate to changes in cost of products sold.  Thus, changes in revenues of 
these businesses may correspond to changes in margins or gross profit.

The Company has consolidated subsidiaries in more than 80 countries.  For the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries located 
outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency.  Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods.  For the majority of the Company’s 
business activities in Brazil, the functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however, certain transactions, including taxes, occur in 
local currency and require remeasurement to the functional currency.  Changes in revenues are expected to be correlated to changes 
in expenses reported by the Company caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, British 
pound, Canadian dollar, and Brazilian real, as compared to the U.S. dollar.

The Company measures its performance using key financial metrics including net earnings, segment operating profit, return on 
invested capital, EBITDA, economic value added, manufacturing expenses, and selling, general, and administrative expenses.  
The Company’s financial results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices, weather 
conditions, crop plantings, government programs and policies, trade policies, changes in global demand, general global economic 
conditions, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.  Due to these unpredictable 
factors, the Company undertakes no responsibility for updating any forward-looking information contained within “Management’s 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016 

As an agricultural commodity-based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Company's 
operating results.  In Agricultural Services, U.S. export competitiveness was strong during the first half of the year but weakened 
during the second half due to the large crops in South America.  Overall low market volatility continued due to surplus in the global 
market.  In Corn Processing, demand and prices for sweeteners and starches remained solid in North America while co-product 
prices were stable.  Ethanol continues to face a challenging environment.  Although ethanol demand remained strong both in North 
America and export markets due to favorable gasoline blending economics and ethanol's continuing status as a competitive octane 
enhancer, U.S. industry ethanol production also remained at high levels which limited margins. Global oilseeds processing volumes 
remained strong, but ample supply of competing proteins and abundance of Argentine meal and oil in world markets pressured 
margins.  Slow selling by farmers in Brazil continues to depress grain origination margins despite strong export volumes.  While 
demand and margins for refined oil remained solid across all regions, uncertainty surrounding the U.S. biodiesel tax credit has 
negatively impacted biodiesel margins.  Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients benefited from strong demand for flavor ingredients 
and flavor systems, but continued to be adversely affected by start-up costs and margin pressure in certain non-flavor food ingredient 
markets.

Net earnings attributable to controlling interests increased $0.3 billion to $1.6 billion.   Segment operating profit decreased $0.2 
billion to $2.5 billion.  Included in segment operating profit in the current year was a net charge of $134 million consisting of a 
net gain on sales of assets and businesses, impairment, restructuring, and settlement charges, and corn hedge timing effects.  Included 
in segment operating profit in the prior year was income of $81 million consisting of  a net gain on sales of assets and businesses/
revaluation, impairment and restructuring charges, and corn hedge timing effects.  Adjusted segment operating profit increased 
$47 million to $2.7 billion due to solid results in Corn Processing, partially offset by weaker South American origination margins, 
lower soybean crush margins, and weaker results in some specialty ingredients.  Corporate results were a net expense of $927 
million in the current year compared to $882 million in the prior year. Corporate results in the current year included a credit of $2 
million from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves, compared to a charge 
of $19 million in the prior year.

Income taxes decreased $527 million due to lower earnings before income taxes and a lower effective tax rate.  The Company’s 
effective tax rate for 2017 decreased to 0.4% compared to 29.3% for 2016 due primarily to the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act (the “Act”).  Excluding the impact of the Act, the Company's effective tax rate for 2017 would have decreased from 
29.3% to approximately 24.0% due primarily to the impact of changes in discrete tax items, including the favorable resolution of 
an uncertain tax position related to a 2014 acquisition and return to provision adjustments in the current year, partially offset by 
changes in the geographic mix of pre-tax earnings and the expiration of U.S. tax credits, including the biodiesel credit, at the end 
of 2016 (see Note 13 in Item 8 for more information).

The Company generally operates its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, 
as needed, to react to the current margin environment and seasonal local supply and demand conditions. Processed volumes of 
oilseeds increased due to the strong demand environment for soybean meal and canola oil.  The overall increase in corn is due to 
the strong demand environment for ethanol, partially offset by the production disruption in one of the Company’s plants due to a 
water main break in the first quarter and the reconfiguration of the Company’s Peoria, Illinois ethanol complex.

Revenues  and  cost  of  products  sold  in  a  commodity  merchandising  and  processing  business  are  affected  by  the  underlying 
commodity prices and volumes.  In periods of significant changes in commodity prices, the underlying performance of the Company 
is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold, particularly in Oilseeds Processing and 
Agricultural  Services,  generally  have  a  relatively  equal  impact  from  commodity  price  changes  which  generally  result  in  an 
insignificant impact to gross profit.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
OPERATIONS (Continued)

Revenues decreased $1.5 billion, or 2%, to $60.8 billion due to lower sales volumes ($1.4 billion) and lower average sales prices 
($0.1 billion).  The decrease in sales volumes was due principally to a decrease in volumes of unprocessed commodities, in particular 
volumes of soybeans, corn, rapeseed, and wheat.  Agricultural Services revenues decreased 6% to $26.2 billion due to lower sales 
volumes ($1.5 billion) and lower average sales prices ($0.1 billion).  Corn Processing revenues decreased 1% to $9.4 billion due 
to lower sales volumes ($0.1 billion).  Oilseeds Processing revenues increased 2% to $22.5 billion due to higher sales volumes 
($0.3 billion).  Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients revenues decreased 5% to $2.3 billion due to lower sales volumes ($0.1 
billion).   

Cost of products sold decreased $1.4 billion to $57.3 billion due principally to lower sales volumes.   Included in cost of products 
sold is a credit of $2 million from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves 
compared to a charge of $19 million in the prior year.  Manufacturing expenses increased $0.1 billion to $5.2 billion due to increased 
expenses for energy, operating and maintenance supplies, and contracted labor, and higher salaries and benefits.
 
Gross profit decreased $0.1 billion, or 3%, to $3.5 billion.  Lower results in soybean processing ($152 million) and grain origination 
($90 million) were partially offset by higher results in canola processing ($41 million), sweeteners and starches ($71 million), and 
animal nutrition ($53 million).   These factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 31. The effect of 
changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves had a $2 million positive impact on gross profit 
compared to a negative impact of $19 million in the prior year.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses of $2.0 billion were comparable to the prior year.  Current year expenses included 
increased salaries and benefits cost related to further investments in the Company’s business transformation, IT, research and 
development, and innovation initiatives.  Prior year expenses included expenses related to the settlement of a legal matter.
 
Asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs increased $118 million to $173 million.  Current year charges consisted of $63 
million of asset impairments in the Corn Processing segment primarily related to the reconfiguration of the Company’s Peoria, 
Illinois ethanol complex, $20 million of asset impairments in the Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients segment primarily related 
to the closure of a facility, $54 million of restructuring charges in Corporate primarily related to the reduction of certain positions 
within the Company’s global workforce, and $36 million of several individually insignificant asset impairments and restructuring 
charges.    Prior  year  charges  included  $11  million  of  software  impairment  in  Corporate,  $6  million  of  other-than-temporary 
impairment charges on the Company's investment in two available for sale equity securities in Corporate, and $17 million and $21 
million of individually insignificant fixed asset impairment and restructuring charges, respectively.
 
Interest expense increased $37 million to $330 million primarily due to higher interest rates on short-term debt, the issuance of 
the $1 billion fixed-rate notes in August 2016, and interest related to an amended foreign income tax from a prior year, partially 
offset by the retirement of the $261 million bond that matured in April 2017.  Interest expense in the prior year also included a 
credit of $8 million for the revaluation of the mandatorily redeemable 10% interest in Harvest Innovations. 

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $164 million to $456 million primarily due to higher earnings from the 
Company’s investment in Wilmar resulting from the increased ownership stake in and higher results from Wilmar and improved 
results from the Company’s equity investment in CIP, partially offset by losses from a new equity investment and decreased earnings 
resulting from the disposal of an equity investment.

Other income - net decreased $110 million to $37 million.  Prior year income included realized additional consideration related 
to the sale of the Company's equity investment in Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. in December 2012, recovery of loss provisions and gain 
related to the sale of the Company's Brazilian sugar ethanol facilities, a gain related to the revaluation of the remaining interest to 
settlement value in conjunction with the acquisition of Amazon Flavors, and loss on sale of other individually immaterial assets.   
Current period income included gains related to the sale of the crop risk services business and disposals of other individually 
insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business, partially offset by an adjustment of the proceeds of the 2015 sale of the 
cocoa business, changes in contingent settlement provisions, a charge related to the full redemption of the Company's $559 million 
notes due March 15, 2018, and foreign exchange losses.

Agricultural Services operating profit increased 2%.  Merchandising and Handling operating results increased due to improved 
Global Trade execution and strong destination marketing volume growth.  Merchandising and Handling results also included a 
gain related to a confidential legal settlement, and a $42 million net recovery of property damage costs and business interruption 
losses related to the Company's New Orleans, Louisiana export facility.  Milling and Other decreased due to lower volumes and 
margins.  Transportation results decreased due to river conditions and lower barge freight volumes and margins.

Corn Processing operating profit increased 19%.  Sweeteners and Starches operating profit increased due to improved domestic 
demand and higher volumes and margins from the international business.  Bioproducts profit increased due to improved lysine 
margins and higher trading resuts, partially offset by lower volumes caused by a mild winter and slightly lower ethanol margins.

Oilseeds Processing operating profit decreased 4%.  Crushing and Origination operating profit decreased from the prior year.  
Higher softseed results in North America and Europe were more than offset by weaker soybean crush margins due to ample supply 
of alternative proteins competing with soybean meal.  In addition, improved South American soybean crushing results were more 
than offset by weak grain origination margins throughout the year.  Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel, and Other operating profit 
declined due to weaker biodiesel and specialty oils margins partially offset by higher results in South American packaged oils and 
the global peanut business.  Asia results increased on higher earnings from the Company’s investment in Wilmar due to the increased 
ownership stake in and higher results from Wilmar.

Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients (WFSI) operating profit increased 3%.  The continuing strong demand for flavor ingredients 
and flavor systems across all regions were partially offset by lower results in specialty ingredients, due in part to operational start-
up costs.

Other operating profit decreased 62% primarily due to losses from the Company's captive insurance operations and lower results 
from its futures commission brokerage business.  Current year results included settlement of insurance claims from the Company's 
Agricultural Services segment totaling $50 million related to the New Orleans, Louisiana export facility.

Corporate results were a net expense of $927 million in the current year compared to $882 million in the prior year.  The effect of 
changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves resulted in a credit of $2 million in the current 
year compared to a charge of $19 million in the prior year.  Interest expense - net increased $28 million due principally to higher 
interest rates on short-term debt, the issuance of $1 billion fixed-rate debt in August 2016, and interest related to an amended 
foreign income tax return from a prior year, partially offset by the retirement of the $261 million bond that matured in April 2017 
and the absence of the original Harvest Innovation adjustment of buy-out liability in May 2016. Unallocated corporate costs 
increased  $13  million  due  principally  to  increased  investments  in  the  Company’s  business  transformation,  IT,  research  and 
development, and innovation initiatives partially offset by the absence of last year’s railroad maintenance expense.  Other charges 
in the current year included a charge related to the full redemption of the Company’s $559 million notes due on March 15, 2018 
and restructuring charges related to the reduction of certain positions within the Company’s global workforce.  Other charges in 
the prior year included legal settlement costs and legal fees, a software impairment charge, other-than-temporary impairment 
charges on the Company’s investments in two available for sale equity securities, a loss on the sale of an investment, and other 
asset impairment and restructuring charges, partially offset by a gain related to a U.S. retiree medical benefit plan curtailment.  
Minority interest and other expense increased $12 million due principally to lower results from the Company's equity investment 
in CIP.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses adjusted earnings per share (EPS), adjusted earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization 
(EBITDA), and adjusted segment operating profit, non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, to evaluate the Company’s financial performance.  These performance measures are not defined by accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial 
measures.  

Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted EPS adjusted for the effects on reported diluted EPS of certain specified items.  Adjusted 
EBITDA is defined as earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for specified items.  The Company 
calculates adjusted EBITDA by removing the impact of specified items and adding back the amounts of interest expense and 
depreciation and amortization to earnings before income taxes.  Adjusted segment operating profit is segment operating profit 
adjusted, where applicable, for specified items.  

Management believes that adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted segment operating profit are useful measures of the 
Company’s performance because they provide investors additional information about the Company's operations allowing better 
evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability.  Adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and 
adjusted segment operating profit are not intended to replace or be an alternative to diluted EPS, earnings before income taxes, 
and segment operating profit, respectively, the most directly comparable amounts reported under GAAP. 

The table below provides a reconciliation of diluted EPS to adjusted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
OPERATIONS (Continued)

Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015 

As an agricultural commodity-based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Company’s 
operating results.  Agricultural Services was negatively impacted in the first half of the year 2016 by weak U.S. grain export 
competitiveness and decreased global merchandising opportunities.  Starting in the third quarter, export volumes and margins 
improved due to the U.S. harvest and weather conditions in South America.  In Corn Processing, global demand for sweeteners 
and starches and U.S. exports, principally to Mexico, continued to grow.  In Europe, raw material costs improved, resulting in 
improved margins.  Corn-based ethanol remained a very competitive transportation fuel, and domestic blending was strong as U.S. 
gasoline demand was up compared to 2015.  U.S. ethanol also continued to be one of the cheapest oxygenates in the world, driving 
strong export volumes throughout 2016.  Industry production levels remained high during the year, limiting margins.  In Oilseeds 
Processing, global crushing operations achieved strong capacity utilization, although margins were weaker mainly due to higher 
supply of soybean meal from Argentina and other protein meal substitutes.  Softseed margins improved due to better seed supply 
and oil demand.  Vegetable oils continued to maintain a steady demand from the food industry.  Additionally, vegetable oil sales 
volumes benefited from demand driven by the U.S. 2016 biodiesel blenders credit. The Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients 
business benefited from increased demand for flavor ingredients and flavor systems, specialty proteins, natural health and nutrition 
products and polyols, but was adversely impacted by soft market conditions in non-flavor food ingredient markets and a strong 
U.S. dollar, as well as operational issues at the specialty commodities unit.  

Net earnings attributable to controlling interests decreased $0.6 billion to $1.3 billion.  Segment operating profit decreased $0.6 
billion to $2.7 billion, primarily due to the 2015 gain on sale of the global cocoa and chocolate businesses and lower earnings in 
the  year  2016  due  to  the  sale  of  those  businesses,  weaker  global  crushing  and  origination  margins,  and  lower  international 
merchandising results, partially offset by better ethanol results.  Corporate results in the year 2016 included a charge of $19 million 
from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves, compared to a credit of $2 
million in the prior year and a decrease of approximately $70 million in the Company's share of the results of Compagnie Industrielle 
et Financiere des Produits Amylaces SA (Luxembourg) (CIP).

Income taxes increased $96 million due to a higher effective tax rate partially offset by lower earnings before income taxes.  The 
Company's effective tax rate for 2016 increased to 29.3% compared to 19.2% for 2015 due primarily to low tax rates on significant 
gains related to portfolio actions in 2015, a $71 million 2015 discrete tax benefit resulting mainly from the release of a $66 million 
valuation allowance compared to a $49 million discrete tax expense in 2016, and changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings 
(see Note 13 in Item 8 for more information).

The Company generally operates its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, 
as needed, to react to current margin environment and and seasonal local supply and demand conditions.  The overall decrease in 
corn relates to the disposal of the sugar ethanol operations in May 2016 partially offset by volumes from the acquisition of Eaststarch 
C.V. in November 2015.

Revenues  and  cost  of  products  sold  in  a  commodity  merchandising  and  processing  business  are  affected  by  the  underlying 
commodity prices and volumes.  In periods of significant changes in commodity prices, the underlying performance of the Company 
is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold, particularly in Oilseeds Processing and 
Agricultural  Services,  generally  have  a  relatively  equal  impact  from  commodity  price  changes  which  generally  result  in  an 
insignificant impact to gross profit.  

Revenues decreased $5.4 billion, or 8%, to $62.3 billion due to lower average sales prices ($3.5 billion), including $0.6 billion in 
foreign currency translation impacts, and lower overall sales volumes ($1.9 billion).  The decrease in sales prices was due principally 
to lower underlying agricultural commodity prices, in particular prices of corn, soybeans, and soybean-related products.  The 
decrease in sales volumes was due principally to the sale of the cocoa business and decreased sales volumes of ethanol and South 
American grain and oilseed origination.  Agricultural Services revenues decreased 6% to $27.9 billion due to lower average sales 
prices ($2.5 billion) partially offset by higher sales volumes ($0.7 billion).  Corn Processing revenues decreased 5% to $9.5 billion 
due to lower sales volumes ($0.5 billion) due principally to ethanol and the sale of the sugar ethanol business partially offset by 
sales volumes from the acquisition of Eaststarch C.V.  Oilseeds Processing revenues decreased 12% to $22.2 billion due to lower 
average sales prices ($0.8 billion) and lower sales volumes ($2.3 billion) principally due to South American grains and oilseeds 
and the sale of the cocoa business.  WFSI revenues were flat due to lower average sales prices ($0.2 billion) which were offset by 
higher sales volumes ($0.2 billion). 

Cost of products sold decreased $5.0 billion to $58.7 billion due principally to lower average commodity costs, including $0.6 
billion in foreign currency translation impacts, and lower manufacturing costs.  Included in cost of products sold is a charge of 
$19 million from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves compared to a credit 
of $2 million in the prior year.  Manufacturing expenses decreased $0.2 billion to $5.2 billion primarily due to the sale of the cocoa 
business, lower energy usage and prices, and decreased repairs and maintenance expenses.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
OPERATIONS (Continued)

Gross profit decreased $0.3 billion, or 9%, to $3.6 billion.  The decrease in gross profit consisted principally of lower soy crush 
margins ($309 million), reduced merchandising results ($95 million) primarily due to Agricultural Services global trade execution 
and positioning losses, lower volumes and freight rates in barge operations ($24 million), the sale of the cocoa business in 2015 
($78 million), partially offset by contribution of the recent Eaststarch C.V. acquisition ($85 million), and higher results in sweeteners 
and starches ($169 million). These factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 38.  The effect of 
changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves had a $19 million negative impact on gross profit 
compared to a positive impact of $2 million in 2015.  The decrease in underlying commodity prices did not result in a significant 
decrease in margins or gross profit as lower underlying commodity prices had a relatively equal impact on revenues and cost of 
products sold.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses of $2.0 billion were comparable to 2015.  Decreased expenses related to the sale of 
the cocoa business and a U.S. retiree medical benefit plan curtailment gain were offset by legal settlements, costs, and legal fees, 
increased transaction fees due to increased trading volume from the brokerage business, and expenses for the recently consolidated 
Eaststarch C.V.

Asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs decreased $145 million to $55 million.  Charges in 2015 included long-lived asset 
impairments of $129 million related to certain Oilseeds Processing facilities, sugar ethanol facilities in Brazil, a facility in the 
Corn Processing segment, and capitalized software costs and restructuring and exit costs of $71 million related principally to an 
international pension plan settlement, sugar ethanol facilities in Brazil, and several individually insignificant restructuring and exit 
costs.  Charges in 2016 included $11 million of software impairment in Corporate, $6 million of other-than-temporary impairment 
charges on the Company's investment in two available for sale equity securities in Corporate, and $17 million and $21 million of 
individually insignificant fixed asset impairment and restructuring charges, respectively.

Interest expense declined $15 million to $293 million primarily due to lower interest rates on long-term debt and the $8 million 
effect of the revaluation of the mandatorily redeemable 10% interest in Harvest Innovations. 

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased $98 million to $292 million primarily due to lower earnings from the 
Company’s investments in Wilmar and CIP and a decrease in equity earnings from Eaststarch C.V. which is now fully consolidated 
following the acquisition of the remaining interest in November 2015, partially offset by increased earnings from other equity 
investees.

Other income - net decreased $203 million to $147 million.  Income in 2015 consisted primarily of gain on sales of $256 million 
related primarily to the sale of the cocoa, chocolate, and lactic businesses, a gain of $212 million on the revaluation of the Company’s 
previously held equity investments in North Star Shipping, Minmetal, and Eaststarch C.V. in conjunction with the acquisition of 
the remaining interests, and a gain of $62 million on the sale of a 50% interest in the Barcarena export terminal facility in Brazil 
to Glencore plc, partially offset by a $189 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the repurchase of outstanding debt and 
loss provisions of $45 million related to sugar ethanol facilities in Brazil.  Income in 2016 included $48 million of realized additional 
consideration related to the sale of the Company’s equity investment in Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. in December 2012, a $59 million 
gain, including recovery of loss provisions, related to the sale of the Company’s Brazilian sugar ethanol facilities, a $12 million 
gain related to the revaluation of the remaining interest to settlement value in conjunction with the acquisition of Amazon Flavors, 
and a $10 million loss on sale of other individually immaterial assets.

Agricultural Services operating profit decreased 16%.  Merchandising and Handling operating results declined primarily due to 
compressed grain handling margins in the first half of 2016.  International merchandising results were down driven by poor 
execution and low market volatility which limited forward merchandising opportunities partially offset by strong origination results 
in Argentina and the addition of destination marketing in Egypt through the Company’s Medsofts joint venture.  Milling and Other 
results decreased 7% due to lower grain and feed margins.  Transportation operating profit declined due to weak barge demand 
and lower freight rates.

Corn Processing operating profit increased 26%.  Sweeteners and Starches operating profit increased as the business continued to 
perform well with higher volumes and pricing and improved margins from optimizing flex grind in the Company’s corn wet mills.  
The integration of the Eaststarch C.V. and Morocco acquisitions has progressed smoothly, significantly exceeding the Company's 
earnings accretion target.  Bioproducts profit declined as weak ethanol margins continued due to high industry inventory levels.

Oilseeds Processing operating profit decreased 32%.  Crushing and Origination operating profit declined driven primarily by lower 
global soy crush margins which were high in 2015, lower South American grain origination results caused by smaller soybean and 
corn crops in the region and year-over-year slower farmer-selling, partially offset by strong softseed volumes and margins in North 
America.  Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel, and Other results improved due to good demand and improved margins for refined and 
packaged oils and improved European biodiesel results.  Asia results declined due primarily to equity losses of $48 million from 
the Company’s investment in Wilmar that was recorded in the Company's results in the third quarter of 2016.

Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients (WFSI) operating profit decreased 5% due to weaker sales of hydrocolloids and fibers, a 
short edible beans crop impacting volumes and costs, and operational issues at the specialty commodities unit, partially offset by 
strong results in flavors and systems, polyols, and natural health and nutrition products.

Other operating profit increased on higher volumes from the Company’s futures commission brokerage business and improved 
results from its captive insurance operations.

Corporate results were a net expense of $882 million in 2016 compared to $988 million in the prior year.  The effect of changes 
in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves resulted in a charge of $19 million in 2016 compared to a 
credit of $2 million in the prior year.  Interest expense - net declined $15 million due principally to lower interest rates on long-
term debt and the effect of the revaluation of the mandatorily redeemable 10% interest in Harvest Innovations.  Unallocated 
corporate costs increased $24 million due primarily to increased spending on the Company’s ERP program and various strategic 
business improvement projects.  Other charges in 2016 included legal settlement costs and legal fees, a software impairment charge, 
other-than-temporary impairment charges on the Company’s investments in two available for sale equity securities, a loss on the 
sale of an investment, and other asset impairment and restructuring charges, partially offset by a gain related to a U.S. retiree 
medical benefit plan curtailment.  Other charges in 2015 consisted of the $189 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the 
repurchase of outstanding debt, restructuring charges of $29 million related principally to an international pension plan settlement, 
and asset impairment and settlement charges of $24 million.  The increase in minority interest and other expense is due to a decrease 
of approximately $70 million in the Company’s share of the results of CIP.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
OPERATIONS (Continued)

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses adjusted earnings per share (EPS), adjusted earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization 
(EBITDA), and adjusted segment operating profit, non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, to evaluate the Company’s financial performance.  These performance measures are not defined by accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial 
measures.  

Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted EPS adjusted for the effects on reported diluted EPS of certain specified items.  Adjusted 
EBITDA is defined as earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for specified items.  The Company 
calculates adjusted EBITDA by removing the impact of specified items and adding back the amounts of interest expense and 
depreciation and amortization to earnings before income taxes.  Adjusted segment operating profit is segment operating profit 
adjusted, where applicable, for specified items.  

Management believes that adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted segment operating profit are useful measures of the 
Company’s performance because they provide investors additional information about the Company's operations allowing better 
evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability.  Adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and 
adjusted segment operating profit are not intended to replace or be an alternative to diluted EPS, earnings before income taxes, 
and segment operating profit, respectively, the most directly comparable amounts reported under GAAP. 

The table below provides a reconciliation of diluted EPS to adjusted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and 
capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity-based business.  The Company’s strategy involves expanding 
the volume and diversity of crops that it merchandises and processes, expanding the global reach of its core model, and expanding 
its value-added product portfolio.  The Company depends on access to credit markets, which can be impacted by its credit rating 
and factors outside of the Company’s control, to fund its working capital needs and capital expenditures.  The primary source of 
funds to finance the Company’s operations, capital expenditures, and advancement of its growth strategy is cash generated by 
operations and lines of credit, including a commercial paper borrowing facility.  In addition, the Company believes it has access 
to funds from public and private equity and debt capital markets in both U.S. and international markets.

Cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 billion for 2017 compared to $1.6 billion in 2016.  Working capital changes increased 
cash by $0.3 billion in the current year compared to a decrease of $0.5 billion in the prior year.  Trade receivables decreased $0.1 
billion due to lower revenues and higher receivables sold under the accounts receivable securitization programs.  Inventories 
increased $0.1 billion due to higher prices.  The Company made a voluntary contribution to the U.S. pension plans of $0.2 billion
in 2016.  Cash used in investing activities was $0.9 billion this year compared to $1.2 billion last year.  Capital expenditures and 
net assets of businesses acquired were $1.2 billion this year compared to $1.0 billion last year.  Proceeds from the sale of businesses 
and assets of $0.2 billion in the current year were comparable to the prior year.  Sales of marketable securities, net of purchases, 
were $0.4 billion this year compared to $0.3 billion last year.  Investments in and advances to affiliates included additional 
investments in Wilmar of $0.3 billion this year compared to $0.6 billion last year.  Cash used in financing activities was $1.0 billion
this year compared to $0.6 billion last year.  Long-term debt borrowings in the current year related to the $0.5 billion notes issued 
on September 14, 2017 compared to the prior year's $1.0 billion notes issued on August 11, 2016.  Long-term debt payments in 
the current year of $0.8 billion primarily related to the full redemption of the $559 million notes due in 2018 and the retirement 
of the $261 million bond that matured in April 2017.  The Company issued $0.5 billion notes in the current year for general 
corporate expenses and to pay down commercial paper borrowings.  Commercial paper borrowings in the current year were $0.7 
billion compared to $0.1 billion in the prior year.  Share repurchases were $0.8 billion in the current year compared to $1.0 billion
in the prior year.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
OPERATIONS (Continued)

At December 31, 2017, the Company had $0.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities and a current 
ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 1.6 to 1.  Included in working capital is $5.9 billion of readily 
marketable commodity inventories.  At December 31, 2017, the Company’s capital resources included shareholders’ equity of 
$18.3 billion and lines of credit, including the accounts receivable securitization programs described below, totaling $7.7 billion, 
of  which  $5.5  billion  was  unused.  The  Company’s  ratio  of  long-term  debt  to  total  capital  (the  sum  of  long-term  debt  and 
shareholders’ equity) was 27% at December 31, 2017 and 2016.  The Company uses this ratio as a measure of the Company’s 
long-term indebtedness and an indicator of financial flexibility.  The Company’s ratio of net debt (the sum of short-term debt, 
current maturities of long-term debt, and long-term debt less the sum of cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable 
securities) to capital (the sum of net debt and shareholders’ equity) was 27% at December 31, 2017 and 26% at December 31, 
2016.  Of the Company’s total lines of credit, $5.0 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there was 
$0.7 billion of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2017.
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $0.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $0.4 billion of which is cash held by foreign 
subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested.  Based on the Company’s historical ability to 
generate sufficient cash flows from its U.S. operations and unused and available U.S. credit capacity of $4.5 billion, the Company 
has asserted that these funds are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.  

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), which was enacted on December 22, 2017, reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 
35% to 21% and provides for a one-time transition tax on untaxed accumulated foreign earnings.  As a result, the Company recorded 
a transition tax liability of $270 million as of December 31, 2017 and expects to pay an estimated $43 million of this amount in 
2018 (see contractual obligations and other commitments table in Item 7).  In addition, due to the passage of the Act, the Company 
expects its effective tax rate before discrete item items to be between 20% to 23% in 2018. 

The Company has accounts receivable securitization programs (the “Programs”) with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers 
and committed purchasers.  The Programs provide the Company with up to $1.6 billion in funding against accounts receivable 
transferred into the Programs and expands the Company’s access to liquidity through efficient use of its balance sheet assets (see 
Note 19 in Item 8 for more information and disclosures on the Programs).  As of December 31, 2017, the Company utilized $1.4 
billion of its facility under the Programs.

On November 5, 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to 
repurchase up to 100,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock during the period commencing January 1, 2015 and ending 
December 31, 2019.  The Company has acquired approximately 86.2 million shares under this program as of December 31, 2017.

The Company expects capital expenditures of $0.8 billion during 2018.  In 2018, the Company expects additional cash outlays of 
approximately $0.8 billion in dividends.

The Company’s credit facilities and certain debentures require the Company to comply with specified financial and non-financial 
covenants including maintenance of minimum tangible net worth as well as limitations related to incurring liens, secured debt, 
and certain other financing arrangements.  The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2017.

The three major credit rating agencies have maintained the Company’s credit ratings at solid investment grade levels with stable 
outlooks. 

Contractual Obligations

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the Company to make 
payments in the future.  The following table sets forth the Company’s significant future obligations by time period.  Purchases 
include  commodity-based  contracts  entered  into  in  the  normal  course  of  business,  which  are  further  described  in  Item  7A, 
“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” energy-related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course 
of business, and other purchase obligations related to the Company’s normal business activities.  The following table does not 
include unrecognized income tax benefits of $56 million as of December 31, 2017 as the Company is unable to reasonably estimate 
the timing of settlement.  Where applicable, information included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and notes 
is cross-referenced in this table.

contributions beyond fiscal year 2018.  For more information concerning the Company’s pension and other postretirement plans, 
see Note 15 in Item 8.

At December 31, 2017, the Company estimates it will spend approximately $1.6 billion through fiscal year 2022 to complete 
currently approved capital projects which are not included in the table above.  

The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2017 which are not included 
in the table above.

The Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity-method investees, which could 
obligate the Company to make future payments.  The Company’s liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity 
fails to perform its contractual obligation.  The Company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

Accounts Receivable Securitization Programs

Since March 2012, the Company has had an accounts receivable securitization program with certain commercial paper conduit 
purchasers and committed purchasers.  In March 2014, the Company entered into a second accounts receivable securitization 
program with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers.  See Note 19 of Item 8 for more information 
about these programs.  

Synthetic Leasing Program

The Company is a party to lease agreements under synthetic leasing programs for certain of its U.S. barge and trucking assets for 
periods ranging from 5 to 7 years.  As of December 31, 2017, outstanding lease balances, including the value of the underlying 
assets of $164 million, were off-balance sheet.  These agreements provide the Company with the right to use these assets for 
specified periods in exchange for an obligation to make rental payments.  The agreements are accounted for as operating leases, 
such that the rent expense is recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings.  The future lease payments pertaining to these 
lease agreements are included in the contractual obligations table in Item 7.  These leasing programs are utilized primarily to 
diversify funding sources and to retain flexibility.  The Company recorded $10 million of rent expense pertaining to synthetic lease 
payments for year ended December 31, 2017 and $5 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
OPERATIONS (Continued)

Critical Accounting Policies

The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values 
of the Company’s assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses.  These estimates and judgments are 
based  on  the  Company’s  historical  experience  and  management’s  knowledge  and  understanding  of  current  facts  and 
circumstances.  Certain of the Company’s accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction 
of the Company’s financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management.  Management has discussed 
with  the  Company’s Audit  Committee  the  development,  selection,  disclosure,  and  application  of  these  critical  accounting 
policies.  Following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the Company’s financial statements.

Fair Value Measurements - Inventories and Commodity Derivatives

Certain of the Company’s inventory and commodity derivative assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017 are valued at estimated 
fair values, including $4.9 billion of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, $0.4 billion of derivative assets, $0.5 
billion of derivative liabilities, and $0.7 billion of inventory-related payables.  Commodity derivative assets and liabilities include 
forward fixed-price purchase and sale contracts for agricultural commodities.  Merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely 
traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing.  Management estimates fair value 
for its commodity-related assets and liabilities based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets.  The 
Company’s inventory and derivative commodity fair value measurements are mainly based on observable market quotations 
without  significant  adjustments  and  are  therefore  reported  as  Level  2  within  the  fair  value  hierarchy.  Level  3  fair  value 
measurements of approximately $1.6 billion of assets and $0.1 billion of liabilities represent fair value estimates where unobservable 
price components represent 10% or more of the total fair value price.  For more information concerning amounts reported as Level 
3, see Note 3 in Item 8.  Changes in the market values of these inventories and commodity contracts are recognized in the statement 
of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.  If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, 
amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially.  Additionally, if market conditions change 
subsequent to year-end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially.

Derivatives – Designated Hedging Activities

The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the purchase price of anticipated 
volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month, to hedge the purchase price of the Company’s anticipated 
natural gas requirements for certain production facilities, and to hedge the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol.  These 
designated hedging programs principally relate to the Company’s Corn Processing operating segment.  Assuming normal market 
conditions, the change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, 
highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item.  Gains and losses arising from open and closed 
hedging transactions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as 
a component of cost of products sold and revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized.  If it is 
determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then 
the changes in the market value of these exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts would 
be recorded immediately in the statement of earnings as a component of revenues and/or cost of products sold.  See Note 4 in Item 
8 for additional information.

Investments in Affiliates

The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments over which the Company has the ability to exercise 
significant influence.  These investments are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, 
for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee.  Generally, the 
minimum ownership threshold for asserting significant influence is 20% ownership of the investee.  However, the Company 
considers all relevant factors in determining its ability to assert significant influence including but not limited to, ownership 
percentage, board membership, customer and vendor relationships, and other arrangements.  If management used a different 
accounting method for these investments, then the amount of earnings from affiliates the Company recognizes may materially 
differ.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
OPERATIONS (Continued)

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for its income tax positions in accordance with the applicable accounting standards.  These standards 
prescribe a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements.    
The Company recognizes in its consolidated financial statements tax positions determined more likely than not to be sustained 
upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position.  The Company frequently faces challenges from U.S. and foreign 
tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due.  These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions 
and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.  In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, 
the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company.  For example, the Company has 
received tax assessments from tax authorities in Brazil and Argentina, challenging income tax positions taken by subsidiaries of 
the Company.  The Company evaluated its tax positions for these matters and concluded, based in part upon advice from legal 
counsel, that it was appropriate to recognize the tax benefits of these positions (see Note 13 in Item 8 for additional information).

Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns where the related tax benefit has 
already been recognized in the Company’s income statement.  The realization of the Company’s deferred tax assets is dependent 
upon future taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.  The Company evaluates 
all available positive and negative evidence including estimated future reversals of existing temporary differences, projected future 
taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial results.  Valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have 
been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not likely.  During 2017, the Company increased valuation 
allowances by approximately $48 million primarily related to certain foreign capital losses incurred and state tax credit utilization 
limitations.  To the extent the Company were to favorably resolve matters for which valuation allowances have been established 
or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned valuation allowances, the Company’s effective tax rate in a given 
financial statement period may be impacted.

Undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and the Company’s share of the undistributed earnings of affiliated 
corporate joint venture companies accounted for on the equity method amounting to approximately $9.4 billion at December 31, 
2017, are considered to be indefinitely reinvested.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted on December 22, 2017, reduces 
the U.S. federal corporate rate from 35% to 21% and provides for a one-time transition tax on untaxed accumulated foreign earnings.  
As a result, the Company recorded a provisional amount for the one-time transition tax liability of $149 million, net of foreign tax 
credits and prior year accruals of deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested.  The one-
time transition tax is based on the Company’s total post-1986 earnings and profits (E&P) previously deferred from U.S. income 
taxes.  The Company has not yet finalized its calculation of the total post-1986 E&P for these foreign subsidiaries.  Further, the 
transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets.  This amount may change 
when the calculation of post-1986 foreign E&P previously deferred from U.S. federal taxation and the amounts held in cash or 
other specified assets are finalized and is subject to further refinement if further guidance is issued by federal and state taxing 
authorities.  The Company has elected to pay the one-time transition tax over eight years.  No additional income taxes have been 
provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax or any additional outside basis difference 
inherent in these entities, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.  It is not practicable to 
determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to 
the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in these entities.

The Act also contains new provisions related to Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI).  The Company is currently refining 
its estimate of GILTI and will update the estimate for any additional guidance on the accounting for the effects of the GILTI 
provisions.  The Company has not made an accounting policy election at this time.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
OPERATIONS (Continued)

Property, Plant, and Equipment and Asset Abandonments and Write-Downs

The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural 
commodities and products.  This business is global in nature and is highly capital-intensive.  Both the availability of the Company’s 
raw materials and the demand for the Company’s finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government 
programs and policies, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive 
crops.  These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Company’s raw materials and 
finished products.  Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Company’s assets in 
terms of geographic location, size, and age of its facilities.  The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, 
technology, and companies related to new, value-added products produced from agricultural commodities and products.  These 
new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective.  Management evaluates 
the Company’s property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.  Assets are written down 
to fair value after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative 
uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value.  If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of 
these  assets,  then  the  Company  could  recognize  different  amounts  of  expense  over  future  periods.  During  the  years  ended 
December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, impairment charges for property, plant, and equipment were $101 million, $17 million, and 
$108 million, respectively (see Note 18 in Item 8 for additional information).

Business Combinations

The Company’s acquisitions are accounted for as purchases in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 
805, Business Combinations, as amended.  Assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on preliminary purchase price allocations, 
are recorded at fair values at acquisition date with the remainder of the purchase price, if any, recorded as goodwill.  When 
determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, 
especially with respect to intangible assets.  Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, 
future expected cash flows and discount rates.  Although management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed 
to be reasonable, actual results may differ.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests.  The 
Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on October 1 or whenever there are indicators 
that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles 
- Goodwill and Other, which permits, but does not require, a company to qualitatively assess indicators of a reporting unit's fair 
value.  If after completing the qualitative assessment, a company believes it is likely that a reporting unit is impaired, a discounted 
cash flow analysis is prepared to estimate fair value.  Critical estimates in the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows and discount rates.  Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over 
their estimated useful lives of 2 to 50 years and are reviewed for impairment whenever there are indicators that the carrying value 
of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  There were no impairment charges recorded for goodwill and intangible assets during 
the year ended December 31, 2017.  The Company recorded an impairment charge for goodwill and intangibles of $11 million
and $21 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively (see Note 18 in Item 8 for more information).  
If management used different estimates and assumptions in its impairment tests, then the Company could recognize different 
amounts of expense over future periods.

Employee Benefit Plans

The Company provides substantially all U.S. employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with retirement benefits 
including defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans.  The Company provides certain eligible U.S. employees 
who  retire  under  qualifying  conditions  with  subsidized  postretirement  health  care  coverage  or  Health  Care  Reimbursement 
Accounts.

45

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
OPERATIONS (Continued)

In order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and 
assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates 
of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs.  These 
estimates  and  assumptions  are  based  on  the  Company’s  historical  experience  combined  with  management’s  knowledge  and 
understanding of current facts and circumstances.  Management also uses third-party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense 
and funded status of these employee benefit plans.  If management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, 
the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future 
periods.

The Company uses the corridor approach when amortizing actuarial losses.  Under the corridor approach, net unrecognized actuarial 
losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets are amortized 
over future periods.  For plans with little to no active participants, the amortization period is the remaining average life expectancy 
of the participants.  For plans with active participants, the amortization period is the remaining average service period of the active 
participants.  The amortization periods range from 5 to 30 years for the Company's defined benefit pension plans and from 7 to 
24 years for the Company's postretirement benefit plans. 
Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The market risk inherent in the Company’s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse 
changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Company’s net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, 
and interest rates as described below.

Commodities

The availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as changes in weather 
conditions, crop disease, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand, changes in customer 
preferences and standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.

The Company manages its exposure to adverse price movements of agricultural commodities used for, and produced in, its business 
operations, by entering into derivative and non-derivative contracts which reduce the Company’s overall short or long commodity 
position.  Additionally, the Company uses exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts as 
components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins.  The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted 
by factors such as the correlation between the value of exchange-traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the 
underlying commodities, counterparty contract defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company, from time-
to-time, enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased 
and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and 
are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses 
arising from open and closed designated hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, 
and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized.

The Company’s commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sales 
contracts, energy and freight contracts, and exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts 
including contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements, net of sales.

The fair value of the Company’s commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing 
all of the commodity positions at quoted market prices for the period, where available, or utilizing a close proxy.  The Company 
has established metrics to monitor the amount of market risk exposure, which consist of volumetric limits, and value-at-risk (VaR) 
limits. VaR measures the potential loss, at a 95% confidence level, that could be incurred over a one year period.  Volumetric limits 
are monitored daily and VaR calculations and sensitivity analysis are monitored weekly.

In addition to measuring the hypothetical loss resulting from an adverse two standard deviation move in market prices (assuming 
no correlations) over a one year period using VaR, sensitivity analysis is performed measuring the potential loss in fair value 
resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in market prices.  The highest, lowest, and average weekly position for the years 
ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 together with the market risk from a hypothetical 10% adverse price change is as follows:

The change in fair value of the average position was principally the result of an increase in prices underlying the weekly commodity 
position and, to a lesser extent, an increase in quantities. 

Currencies

The Company has consolidated subsidiaries in more than 80 countries.  For the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries located 
outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency except certain significant subsidiaries in Switzerland and 
Brazil where the Euro and U.S. dollar are the functional currencies, respectively.  To reduce the risks associated with foreign 
currency exchange rate fluctuations, the Company enters into currency exchange contracts to minimize its foreign currency position 
related  to  transactions  denominated  primarily  in  Euro,  British  pound,  Canadian  dollar,  and  Brazilian  real  currencies.  These 
currencies represent the major functional or local currencies in which recurring business transactions occur.  The Company does 
not use currency exchange contracts as hedges against amounts indefinitely invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates.  The 
currency exchange contracts used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange-traded futures contracts, and over-the-counter 
options.  The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related 
transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in 
foreign currency exchange rates is not material.

The amount the Company considers indefinitely invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the 
year-end exchange rates is $8.2 billion and $7.3 billion ($9.4 billion and $9.3 billion at historical rates) at December 31, 2017 and 
2016, respectively.  The increase is due to the appreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar of $0.8 billion and the 
increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates of $0.1 billion.  The potential loss in fair value, which would 
principally be recognized in Other Comprehensive Income, resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign 
currency exchange rates is $820 million and $728 million for December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Actual results may differ.

Interest

The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future 
cash flows based on the Company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Such fair 
value exceeded the long-term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a 
hypothetical 50 basis points decrease in interest rates.  Actual results may differ.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Business

The Company is principally engaged in procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities 
and products.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany 
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  The Company consolidates all entities, including variable interest entities (VIEs), 
in which it has a controlling financial interest.  For VIEs, the Company assesses whether it is the primary beneficiary as defined 
under  the  applicable  accounting  standard.    Investments  in  affiliates,  including  VIEs  through  which  the  Company  exercises 
significant influence but does not control the investee and is not the primary beneficiary of the investee’s activities, are carried at 
cost plus equity in undistributed earnings since acquisition and are adjusted, where appropriate, for basis differences between the 
investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee.  The Company’s portion of the results of certain affiliates and 
results of certain VIEs are included using the most recent available financial statements.  In each case, the financial statements are 
within 93 days of the Company’s year end and are consistent from period to period.  

Use of Estimates

The  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires 
management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  amounts  reported  in  its  consolidated  financial  statements  and 
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

The  Company  classified  $64  million  of  U.S.  futures  commission  brokerage  fees  in  cost  of  products  sold  in  the  year  ended 
December 31, 2017.  Prior period amounts of $65 million and $54 million in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, 
respectively, have been reclassified from selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of earnings 
to conform to the current presentation.

The Company began presenting certain specified items separately from the individual business segments, as further described in 
Note 17.  Prior period amounts have been reclassified to separately identify specified items to conform to the current presentation.

In line with the futures brokerage industry practice, the Company classified $1.0 billion of segregated cash and cash equivalents 
as restricted cash and cash equivalents in its statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2017.  Prior period amounts 
have been restated to conform to the current presentation which resulted in an increase of $80 million and a decrease of $765 
million in total cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and an increase 
of $873 million and $793 million in the ending balance of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents 
as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all non-segregated, highly-liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase 
to be cash equivalents.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Segregated Cash and Investments

The Company segregates certain cash, cash equivalents, and investment balances in accordance with regulatory requirements, 
commodity exchange requirements, and insurance arrangements.  These balances represent deposits received from customers of 
the Company’s registered futures commission merchant and commodity brokerage services, cash margins and securities pledged 
to commodity exchange clearinghouses, and cash pledged as security under certain insurance arrangements.  Segregated cash and 
investments also include restricted cash collateral for the various insurance programs of the Company’s captive insurance business.    
To the degree these segregated balances are comprised of cash and cash equivalents, they are considered restricted cash and cash 
equivalents on the statement of cash flows.

Receivables

The Company records accounts receivable at net realizable value.  This value includes an allowance for estimated uncollectible 
accounts of $73 million and $72 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, to reflect any loss anticipated on the accounts 
receivable balances.  The Company estimates this allowance based on its history of write-offs, level of past-due accounts, and its 
relationships with, and the economic status of, its customers.  Portions of the allowance for uncollectible accounts are recorded in 
trade receivables, other current assets, and other assets.

Credit risk on receivables is minimized as a result of the large and diversified nature of the Company’s worldwide customer 
base.  The Company manages its exposure to counter-party credit risk through credit analysis and approvals, credit limits, and 
monitoring procedures.  Collateral is generally not required for the Company’s receivables.

Accounts receivable due from unconsolidated affiliates as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $343 million and $232 million, 
respectively.

Inventories

Inventories  of  certain  merchandisable  agricultural  commodities,  which  include  inventories  acquired  under  deferred  pricing 
contracts, are stated at market value.  In addition, the Company values certain inventories using the lower of cost, determined by 
either the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or last-in, first-out (LIFO) methods, or net realizable value.

The following table sets forth the Company’s inventories as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Note 1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Fair Value Measurements

The Company determines fair value based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company uses the market approach valuation 
technique to measure the majority of its assets and liabilities carried at fair value.  Three levels are established within the fair value 
hierarchy that may be used to report fair value:  Level 1:  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities.  Level 2:  Observable inputs, including Level 1 prices that have been adjusted; quoted prices for similar assets or 
liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are less active than traded exchanges; and other inputs that are observable or can be 
substantially corroborated by observable market data.  Level 3:  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market 
activity and that are a significant component of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  In evaluating the significance of fair value 
inputs, the Company generally classifies assets or liabilities as Level 3 when their fair value is determined using unobservable 
inputs that individually or when aggregated with other unobservable inputs, represent more than 10% of the fair value of the assets 
or liabilities.  Judgment is required in evaluating both quantitative and qualitative factors in the determination of significance for 
purposes of fair value level classification.  Level 3 amounts can include assets and liabilities whose value is determined using 
pricing  models,  discounted  cash  flow  methodologies,  or  similar  techniques,  as  well  as  assets  and  liabilities  for  which  the 
determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.

Based on historical experience with the Company’s suppliers and customers, the Company’s own credit risk and knowledge of 
current market conditions, the Company does not view nonperformance risk to be a significant input to fair value for the majority 
of its forward commodity purchase and sale contracts.  However, in certain cases, if the Company believes the nonperformance 
risk to be a significant input, the Company records estimated fair value adjustments, and classifies the contract in Level 3.

In many cases, a valuation technique used to measure fair value includes inputs from multiple levels of the fair value hierarchy.  The 
lowest level of input that is a significant component of the fair value measurement determines the placement of the entire fair value 
measurement in the hierarchy.  The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement 
requires judgment, and may affect the classification of fair value assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy levels.

The Company’s policy regarding the timing of transfers between levels, including both transfers into and transfers out of Level 3, 
is to measure and record the transfers at the end of the reporting period.  

Derivatives

The Company recognizes all of its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in its consolidated balance 
sheet.  Unrealized gains are reported as other current assets and unrealized losses are reported as accrued expenses and other 
payables.  The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has 
been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and on the type of hedging relationship.  The majority of the 
Company’s derivatives have not been designated as hedging instruments, and as such, changes in fair value of these derivatives 
are recognized in earnings immediately.  For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, 
the Company designates the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge.  

Beginning in 2017, for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to 
variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk), the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is 
reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and reclassified into earnings in the same line item 
affected by the hedged transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.  Hedge 
components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and gains and losses related to discontinued hedges are recognized in 
the consolidated statement of earnings during the current period.

Prior to 2017, gain or loss on the derivative instrument that is in excess of the cumulative change in the cash flows of the hedged 
item, if any (i.e., the ineffective portion) are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during the current period.
 
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument 
and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during the current period.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Marketable Securities

The Company classifies its marketable securities as available-for-sale.  Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with 
the unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes, reported as a component of AOCI.  The Company monitors its investments 
for impairment periodically, and recognizes an impairment charge when the decline in fair value of an investment is judged to be 
other-than-temporary.  The Company uses the specific identification method when securities are sold or reclassified out of AOCI 
into earnings.  The Company considers marketable securities maturing in less than one year as short-term.  All other marketable 
securities are classified as long-term.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is recorded at cost.  Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The Company generally 
uses the straight-line method in computing depreciation for financial reporting purposes and generally uses accelerated methods 
for income tax purposes. The annual provisions for depreciation have been computed principally in accordance with the following 
ranges of asset lives: buildings - 15 to 40 years; machinery and equipment - 3 to 40 years.  The Company capitalized interest on 
major construction projects in progress of $17 million, $20 million, and $11 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, 
and 2015, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for its income tax positions in accordance with the applicable accounting standards.  The liability method 
is used in accounting for income taxes.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax 
basis of assets and liabilities and reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using statutory rates in effect for the 
year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is 
recorded in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date under the law.  Applicable accounting standards 
prescribe a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements.    
The Company recognizes in its consolidated financial statements tax positions determined more likely than not to be sustained 
upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position.

The Company classifies interest on income tax-related balances as interest expense and classifies tax-related penalties as selling, 
general and administrative expenses.

Goodwill and other intangible assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment 
tests.  Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 2 to 50 years and are reviewed for impairment 
whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  The Company’s accounting policy 
is to evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on October 1 of each fiscal year or whenever 
there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  There were no impairment charges recorded 
for goodwill and intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2017.  The Company recorded impairment charges for 
goodwill and intangibles totaling $11 million related to computer software, and $21 million related to computer software, certain 
of the Company’s international Oilseeds Processing facilities, and a facility in its Corn Processing segment during the years ended 
December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
 
Asset Abandonments and Write-Downs

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.  Assets are written down to 
fair value after consideration of the Company’s ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose, employ the assets in alternative 
uses, or sell the assets to recover the carrying value.  Fair value is generally based on discounted cash flow analysis which relies 
on management’s estimate of market participant assumptions (a Level 3 measurement under applicable accounting standards).  
During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, impairment charges were $101 million, $17 million, and $108 million, 
respectively (see Note 18 for additional information).

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Payables to Brokerage Customers

Payables to brokerage customers represent the total of customer accounts at the Company’s futures commission merchant with 
credit or positive balances.  Customer accounts are used primarily in connection with commodity transactions and include gains 
and losses on open commodity trades as well as securities and other deposits made for margins or other purposes as required by 
the Company or the exchange-clearing organizations or counterparties.  Payables to brokerage customers have a corresponding 
balance in segregated cash and investments and customer omnibus receivable in other current assets.  

Revenues

The Company follows a policy of recognizing sales revenue at the time of delivery of the product and when all of the following 
have occurred: a sales agreement is in place, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.  The Company 
has sales contracts that allow for pricing to occur after title of the goods has passed to the customer.  In these cases, the Company 
continues to report the goods in inventory until it recognizes the sales revenue once the price has been determined.  Freight costs 
and handling charges related to sales are recorded as a component of cost of products sold.

Net sales to unconsolidated affiliates during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $6.0 billion, $4.2 billion, 
and $5.0 billion, respectively.

Stock Compensation

The Company recognizes expense for its stock compensation based on the fair value of the awards that are granted.  The Company’s 
stock compensation plans provide for the granting of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance stock units, and stock 
options.  The fair values of stock options and performance stock units are estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes 
option valuation model and a lattice valuation model, respectively.  These valuation models require the input of highly subjective 
assumptions.  Measured compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the related 
stock compensation award.

Research and Development

Costs associated with research and development are expensed as incurred.  Such costs incurred, net of expenditures subsequently 
reimbursed by government grants, were $129 million, $123 million, and $122 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 
2016, and 2015, respectively.

Per Share Data

Basic earnings per common share are determined by dividing net earnings attributable to controlling interests by the weighted 
average number of common shares outstanding.  In computing diluted earnings per share, average number of common shares 
outstanding is increased by common stock options outstanding with exercise prices lower than the average market price of common 
shares using the treasury share method.

Business Combinations

The Company’s acquisitions are accounted for as purchases in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, as amended.  
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on preliminary purchase price allocations, are recorded at fair values at acquisition 
date with the remainder of the consideration, if any, recorded as goodwill.  During the measurement period, which may take up 
to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments due to changes in the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed may be recorded as adjustments to the purchase price allocations.  Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or 
the final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any such adjustments are 
charged to the consolidated statements of earnings.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Adoption of New Accounting Standards

Effective January 1, 2017, the Company adopted the amended guidance of ASC Topic 330, Inventory, which simplifies the 
measurement of inventory.  The amended guidance requires an entity to measure its cost-based inventory at the lower of cost or 
net realizable value, where net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably 
predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.
 
Effective January 1, 2017, the Company adopted the amended guidance of ASC Topic 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint 
Ventures, which simplifies the transition to the equity method of accounting.  The amended guidance eliminates the requirement 
of an investor to adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively when an investment qualifies for 
equity method accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence.  The amendments 
require the investor to add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor’s previously 
held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting.  
The adoption of this amended guidance did not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial results.

Effective January 1, 2017, the Company adopted the amended guidance of ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, which affects reporting 
entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate a variable interest entity in certain situations involving entities 
under common control.  The amended guidance changes the evaluation of whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of 
a variable interest entity by changing how a reporting entity that is a single decision maker of a variable interest entity treats indirect 
interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity.  The Company was 
required to adopt the amended guidance using a retrospective transition approach to all periods presented.  The adoption of this 
amended guidance did not result in the deconsolidation of any of its variable interest entities.

Effective January 1, 2017, the Company adopted the amended guidance of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (ASU 2016-16), which 
requires entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs.  
Under the previous accounting rules, entities were prohibited from recognizing current and deferred income taxes for an intra-
entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party.  The amended guidance does not change the accounting for 
the pre-tax effects of an intra-entity asset transfer or for an intra-entity transfer of inventory.  The Company adopted the amended 
guidance on a modified retrospective approach basis through a $7 million cumulative effect adjustment to reinvested earnings as 
of January 1, 2017.

Effective October 1, 2017, the Company adopted the amended guidance of ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, which clarifies 
the definition of a business.  The amended guidance is intended to help companies and other organizations evaluate whether 
transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (disposals) of assets or businesses and provides a more robust framework to 
use in determining when a set of assets and activities is a business.  The adoption of this amended guidance did not have an impact 
on the Company’s financial results.   

Effective October 1, 2017, the Company adopted the amended guidance of ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation
(Topic 718), which provides clarity and reduces diversity in practice as well as cost and complexity when applying the guidance 
in Topic 718 to the modification of the terms and conditions of a share-based payment.  The amendments include guidance on 
determining which changes to the terms and conditions of share-based payment awards require an entity to apply modification 
accounting.  The adoption of this amended guidance did not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial results.

Effective October 1, 2017, the Company adopted the amended guidance of ASC Topic 350, Goodwill and Other, which simplifies 
the subsequent measurement of goodwill.  The amended guidance removes the second step of the goodwill impairment test and 
requires the application of a one-step quantitative test where the amount of goodwill impairment is the excess of a reporting unit's 
carrying amount over its fair value, but not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.  The new guidance 
does not amend the optional qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment.  The adoption of this amended guidance did not have 
an impact on the Company’s financial results.  

59

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Effective October 1, 2017, the Company adopted the amended guidance of ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), 
which expands and refines hedge accounting for both non-financial and financial risk components and aligns the recognition and 
presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the financial statements.  The amended guidance also 
simplifies the application of hedge accounting guidance and eases the administrative burden of hedge documentation requirements 
and assessing hedge effectiveness.  Under the amended guidance, amounts considered ineffective related to effective hedging 
relationships are now deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged item impacts earnings.  The Company 
adopted the amended guidance through an adjustment to reinvested earnings as of January 1, 2017, which was immaterial.  This 
adoption also had no material impact on the reported earnings for earlier quarters of 2017.

Pending Accounting Standards

Effective January 1, 2018, the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Subtopic 825-10, Financial 
Instruments - Overall, which is intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments.  The amended 
guidance requires an entity to measure equity investments, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or 
those that result in consolidation of the investee, at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income and simplify the 
impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by using a qualitative assessment to identify 
impairment.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this amended guidance to have a significant impact on the Company’s 
financial results.

Effective January 1, 2018, the Company will be required to adopt the new guidance of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers (Topic 606), which will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.  
Topic 606 requires the Company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an 
amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The new 
guidance requires the Company to apply the following steps:  (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance 
obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in 
the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.  The Company will adopt 
Topic 606 on a modified retrospective basis and will be required to provide additional disclosures of the amount by which each 
financial statement line item is affected in the current reporting period, as compared to the guidance that was in effect before the 
change, and an explanation of the reasons for significant changes.  The adoption of this new guidance will require expanded 
disclosures in the Company’s consolidated financial statements including separate quantitative disclosure of revenues within the 
scope of Topic 606 and revenues excluded from the scope of Topic 606.  Many of the Company’s sales contracts are considered 
derivatives under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and are therefore excluded from the scope of Topic 606.  The Company 
established a cross-functional implementation team consisting of representatives from all of its business segments.  The Company 
utilized surveys to validate all of its current revenue recognition streams and identify areas of its business where potential differences 
could result from applying the requirements of the new standard.  The Company also conducted workshops and performed contract 
reviews to gather more information about the nature, magnitude, and frequency of the underlying transactions that drove the survey 
responses.  In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company completed the final phase of its revenue recognition implementation plan 
which included quantification of the areas of accounting change, assessment of the financial impact of the new guidance on its 
consolidated financial statements, and finalization of its revenue recognition accounting policy and position papers.  Based on the 
results of the Company's quantification efforts, the adoption of this new guidance will result in an immaterial cumulative effect 
adjustment to reinvested earnings as of January 1, 2018.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this new guidance to have 
a significant ongoing impact on the Company’s financial results.

Effective January 1, 2018, the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Topic 715, Compensation - 
Retirement Benefits,  which  requires  that  an  employer  reports  the  service  cost  component  in  the  same  line  or  items  as  other 
compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period.  The other components of net 
benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal 
of income from operations, if one is presented.  The adoption of this amended guidance will require expanded disclosures and the 
reclassification of the other components of net benefit cost from cost of products sold and selling, general, and administrative 
expenses to other (income) expense - net in the Company’s consolidated statements of earnings but will not impact financial results.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Effective January 1, 2019, the Company will be required to adopt the new guidance of ASC Topic 842, Leases (Topic 842), which 
will supersede ASC Topic 840, Leases.  Topic 842 requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases.  The Company 
expects to adopt Topic 842 using a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the 
beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.  The adoption of this new guidance will require 
expanded  disclosures  in  the  Company’s  consolidated  financial  statements.   The  Company  has  established  a  cross-functional 
implementation team consisting of representatives from accounting, legal, procurement, and operations.  The Company utilized 
surveys to centrally gather more information about its existing leases and lease processes and to gather lease contracts.  To ensure 
completeness of the population of lease contracts, the results of the survey will be cross-referenced against other available lease 
information (i.e., year-end disclosures and general ledger).  The Company is also working with a vendor to implement a lease 
management system which will assist in delivering the required accounting changes and disclosures.  The next phase of the 
implementation plan is the abstraction of the relevant lease contract data points which is expected to be completed in the second 
half of 2018.  The impact of the new standard will be a significant increase to right of use assets and lease liabilities on the 
Company’s consolidated balance sheet, primarily as a result of operating leases currently not recognized on the balance sheet. The 
Company has not yet completed its assessment of the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated statement of earnings.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments 
- Credit Losses, which is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring more timely recording of credit losses on loans and 
other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations.  The amended guidance requires the measurement 
of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and 
reasonable and supportable forecasts.  Early adoption will be permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal 
years, beginning after December 15, 2018.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this amended guidance to have a 
significant impact on the Company’s financial results.

Note 2.     Acquisitions

Operating results of acquisitions are included in the Company’s financial statements from the date of acquisition.

Fiscal Year 2017 acquisitions

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company acquired Crosswind Industries, Inc., Chamtor SA, a 51% controlling 
interest in Industries Centers, and an 89% controlling interest in Biopolis SL for an aggregate consideration of $194 million in 
cash.  The aggregate purchase price of these acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $7 million, was preliminarily allocated as follows:

Note 2.     Acquisitions (Continued)

Fiscal Year 2016 acquisitions

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company acquired a 90% interest in Harvest Innovations, an industry leader in 
minimally processed, expeller-pressed soy proteins, oils, and gluten-free ingredients; a 50% interest in Cairo-based Medsofts 
Group,  a  joint  venture  that  owns  and  manages  merchandising  and  supply  chain  operations;  Caterina  Foods,  a  leading  toll 
manufacturer of specialty gluten-free and high-protein pastas; and a Casablanca, Morocco-based corn wet mill that produces 
glucose and native starch for an aggregate cost of $141 million in cash.  The aggregate purchase price of these acquisitions, net 
of cash acquired of $11 million, was preliminarily allocated as follows:

The remaining 10% interest in Harvest Innovations is recorded in other long-term liabilities and accounted for as a mandatorily 
redeemable interest which the Company has agreed to acquire following two years of operations.

The Company has an option three years from the date of acquisition to acquire the remaining 50% interest in Medsofts Group 
based on a fixed multiple of earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization for the last twelve months of this 
three-year period.  If the Company does not elect to exercise its option, the noncontrolling interest holder has the option to put the 
50% interest to the Company on similar, though discounted, terms.  The Company records the 50% remaining interest in temporary 
equity - redeemable noncontrolling interest.

The finalization of the purchase price allocations related to these acquisitions did not result in material adjustments in 2017.

Fiscal Year 2015 acquisitions

On November 2, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining 50 percent interest in Eaststarch C.V.  The 
acquisition includes corn wet mills in Bulgaria and Turkey and a 50 percent stake in a wet mill in Hungary enhancing the Company’s 
capabilities to serve customers around the world.   The 2015 post acquisition financial results of Eaststarch C.V. are reported in 
the Corn Processing segment.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company acquired four businesses, including the remaining interest in Eaststarch 
C.V. described above, for a total cost of $508 million.  The purchase price, net of cash acquired of $29 million, plus the acquisition-
date fair values of the Company’s previously held equity interests of $385 million in Eaststarch C.V. and $64 million in North Star 
Shipping and Minmetal included in Others below, were preliminarily allocated as follows:

In the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized pre-tax gains of $185 million on the Eaststarch C.V. transaction 
and $27 million on the North Star Shipping and Minmetal transaction included in Others above, representing the difference between 
the carrying values and acquisition-date fair values of the Company’s previously held equity interests.  The acquisition date fair 
value was determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis using market participant assumptions (a Level 3 measurement 
under applicable accounting standards).

Goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisitions is primarily attributable to the synergies expected to arise after the Company’s 
acquisition of the businesses.

The Company’s consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes the post acquisition results 
of the acquired businesses which were immaterial.

The 2016 finalization of the purchase price allocation related to the acquisition of Eaststarch C.V. resulted in increases in goodwill 
and other intangibles of $38 million and $4 million, respectively, with a corresponding decrease in other long-term liabilities.  The 
finalization of the purchase price allocations related to the other acquisitions did not result in material adjustments in 2016.

Estimated fair values for inventories carried at market are based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local 
markets, broker or dealer quotations or market transactions in either listed or over-the-counter (OTC) markets.  Market valuations 
for the Company’s inventories are adjusted for location and quality because the exchange-quoted prices represent contracts that 
have standardized terms for commodity, quantity, future delivery period, delivery location, and commodity quality or grade.  When 
unobservable inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the inventory is classified in Level 3.  Changes 
in the fair value of inventories are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.

Derivative contracts include exchange-traded commodity futures and options contracts, forward commodity purchase and sale 
contracts,  and  OTC  instruments  related  primarily  to  agricultural  commodities,  energy,  interest  rates,  and  foreign 
currencies.  Exchange-traded futures and options contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are 
classified in Level 1.  The majority of the Company’s exchange-traded futures and options contracts are cash-settled on a daily 
basis and, therefore, are not included in these tables.  Fair value for forward commodity purchase and sale contracts is estimated 
based on exchange-quoted prices adjusted for differences in local markets.  These differences are generally determined using inputs 
from broker or dealer quotations or market transactions in either the listed or OTC markets.  When observable inputs are available 
for substantially the full term of the contract, it is classified in Level 2.  When unobservable inputs have a significant impact (more 
than 10%) on the measurement of fair value, the contract is classified in Level 3.  Except for certain derivatives designated as cash 
flow hedges, changes in the fair value of commodity-related derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings 
as a component of cost of products sold.  Changes in the fair value of foreign currency-related derivatives are recognized in the 
consolidated statements of earnings as a component of revenues, cost of products sold, and other (income) expense - net, depending 
upon the purpose of the contract.  The changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as effective cash flow hedges are recognized 
in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) until the hedged 
items are recorded in earnings or it is probable the hedged transaction will no longer occur.

Note 3.      Fair Value Measurements (Continued)

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

The Company’s cash equivalents are comprised of money market funds valued using quoted market prices and are classified as 
Level 1.

The Company’s marketable securities are comprised of U.S. Treasury securities and corporate debt securities.  U.S. Treasury 
securities are valued using quoted market prices and are classified in Level 1.  Corporate debt securities are valued using third-
party pricing services and substantially all are classified in Level 2.  Unrealized changes in the fair value of available-for-sale 
marketable securities are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of AOCI unless a decline in value is deemed 
to be other-than-temporary at which point the decline is recorded in earnings.

The Company’s segregated investments are comprised of U.S. Treasury securities.  U.S. Treasury securities are valued using quoted 
market prices and are classified in Level 1.

The Company has deferred consideration under its accounts receivable securitization programs (the “Programs”) which represents 
notes receivable from the purchasers under the Programs (see Note 19).  This amount is reflected in other current assets on the 
consolidated balance sheet (see Note 6).  The Company carries the deferred consideration at fair value determined by calculating 
the expected amount of cash to be received.  The fair value is principally based on observable inputs (a Level 2 measurement) 
consisting mainly of the face amount of the receivables adjusted for anticipated credit losses and discounted at the appropriate 
market rate.  Payment of deferred consideration is not subject to significant risks other than delinquencies and credit losses on 
accounts receivable transferred under the Programs which have historically been insignificant.

The following tables present a rollforward of the activity of all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

For all periods presented, the Company had no transfers between Levels 1 and 2.   Transfers into Level 3 of assets and liabilities 
previously classified in Level 2 were due to the relative value of unobservable inputs to the total fair value measurement of certain 
products and derivative contracts rising above the 10% threshold.   Transfers out of Level 3 were primarily due to the relative 
value of unobservable inputs to the total fair value measurement of certain products and derivative contracts falling below the 10% 
threshold and thus permitting reclassification to Level 2.

In some cases, the price components that result in differences between exchange-traded prices and local prices for inventories and 
commodity purchase and sale contracts are observable based upon available quotations for these pricing components, and in some 
cases, the differences are unobservable.  These price components primarily include transportation costs and other adjustments 
required due to location, quality, or other contract terms.  In the table below, these other adjustments are referred to as Basis.  The 
changes in unobservable price components are determined by specific local supply and demand characteristics at each facility and 
the overall market.  Factors such as substitute products, weather, fuel costs, contract terms, and futures prices also impact the 
movement of these unobservable price components.

The following table sets forth the weighted average percentage of the unobservable price components included in the Company’s 
Level  3  valuations  as  of  December 31,  2017  and  2016.  The  Company’s  Level  3  measurements  may  include  Basis  only, 
transportation cost only, or both price components.  As an example, for Level 3 inventories with Basis, the unobservable component 
as of December 31, 2017 is a weighted average 12.8% of the total price for assets and 99.9% of the total price for liabilities.

Note 3.      Fair Value Measurements (Continued)

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

In certain of the Company’s principal markets, the Company relies on price quotes from third parties to value its inventories and 
physical  commodity  purchase  and  sale  contracts.  These  price  quotes  are  generally  not  further  adjusted  by  the  Company  in 
determining the applicable market price.  In some cases, availability of third-party quotes is limited to only one or two independent 
sources.  In these situations, absent other corroborating evidence, the Company considers these price quotes as 100% unobservable 
and, therefore, the fair value of these items is reported in Level 3.
 
Note 4.     Derivative Instruments & Hedging Activities

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments

The majority of the Company’s derivative instruments have not been designated as hedging instruments.  The Company uses 
exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts to manage its net position of merchandisable agricultural 
commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations in 
agricultural commodities and foreign currencies.  The Company also uses exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC 
options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins.  The results of these strategies can be 
significantly impacted by factors such as the correlation between the value of exchange-traded commodities futures contracts and 
the value of the underlying commodities, counterparty contract defaults, and volatility of freight markets.  Derivatives, including 
exchange  traded  contracts  and  physical  purchase  or  sale  contracts,  and  inventories  of  certain  merchandisable  agricultural 
commodities, which include amounts acquired under deferred pricing contracts, are stated at market value.  Inventory is not a 
derivative and therefore fair values of and changes in fair values of inventories are not included in the tables below.

Changes in the market value of inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities, forward cash purchase and sales 
contracts, exchange-traded futures, and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts are recognized in earnings immediately as a 
component of cost of products sold.

Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow or Fair Value Hedging Strategies

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had certain derivatives designated as cash flow and fair value hedges.

The Company uses interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to protect the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes 
in interest rates.  The changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps and the underlying fixed-rate debt are recorded in other 
(income) expense - net.   The terms of the interest rate swaps match the terms of the underlying debt.  At December 31, 2017, the 
Company had $1 million in other current liabilities representing the fair value of the interest rate swaps and a corresponding 
decrease in the underlying debt for the same amount with no impact to earnings.

Note 4.     Derivative Instruments & Hedging Activities (Continued)

For each of the commodity hedge programs described below, the derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.  Assuming normal 
market conditions, the changes in the market value of such derivative contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue 
to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item.  Once the hedged item is recognized in earnings, 
the gains/losses arising from the hedge are reclassified from AOCI to either revenues or cost of products sold, as applicable.  As 
of December 31, 2017, the Company had $8 million of after-tax losses in AOCI related to gains and losses from commodity cash 
flow hedge transactions.  The Company expects to recognize $8 million of these after-tax losses in its consolidated statement of 
earnings during the next 12 months.

The Company uses futures or options contracts to hedge the purchase price of anticipated volumes of corn to be purchased and 
processed in a future month.  The objective of this hedging program is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the 
Company’s forecasted purchases of corn.  The Company’s corn processing plants currently grind approximately 72 million bushels 
of corn per month.  During the past 12 months, the Company hedged between 22% and 50% of its monthly anticipated grind.  At 
December 31, 2017, the Company had designated hedges representing between 8% to 86% of its anticipated monthly grind of 
corn for the next 12 months.

The Company, from time to time, also uses futures, options, and swaps to hedge the sales price of certain ethanol sales contracts.  The 
Company has established hedging programs for ethanol sales contracts that are indexed to unleaded gasoline prices and to various 
exchange-traded ethanol contracts.  The objective of these hedging programs is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated 
with the Company’s sales of ethanol.  During the past 12 months, the Company hedged between 1 million and 28 million gallons 
of ethanol sales per month under these programs.  At December 31, 2017, the Company had designated hedges representing between 
0 to 135 million gallons of ethanol sales per month over the next 6 months.

The following table sets forth the fair value of derivatives designated as hedging instruments as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Note 4.     Derivative Instruments & Hedging Activities (Continued)

In 2017, the Company adopted the amended guidance of Topic 815.  As a result, hedge ineffectiveness related to effective hedging 
relationships are now deferred in AOCI until the hedged item impacts earnings.  Prior to 2017, gain or loss on the derivative 
instrument that is in excess of the cumulative change in the cash flows of the hedged item, if any (i.e., the ineffective portion) are 
recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during the current period.

Net Investment Hedging Strategies

On June 24, 2015, the Company issued  €500 million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes and €600 million aggregate 
principal amount of 1.75% Notes (collectively, the “Notes”).  The Company has designated €1.1 billion of the Notes as a hedge 
of its net investment in a foreign subsidiary.  As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $59 million of after-tax losses in AOCI 
related to gains and losses from the net investment hedge transaction.  The amount is deferred in AOCI until the underlying 
investment is divested.

Note 5.     Marketable Securities (Continued)

The $1 million in unrealized losses at December 31, 2017 arose within the last 12 months and is related to the Company’s investment 
in one available-for-sale debt security with a fair value of $37 million.  The contractual terms of this investment do not permit the 
issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost basis of the investment.  Because the Company does not intend 
to sell the investment and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized 
cost basis, which may be at maturity, the Company does not consider this investment to be other-than-temporarily impaired at 
December 31, 2017.  For information on other-than temporary impairment charges, see Note 18.

The Company’s share of the undistributed earnings of its unconsolidated affiliates as of December 31, 2017 is $2.1 billion.  The 
Company's investment in Wilmar has a carrying value of $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2017, and a market value of $3.6 billion
based on market quoted price converted to U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate at December 31, 2017.  The investment 
has been in an unrealized loss position for less than 12 months.  The Company evaluated the near-term prospects of the investee 
in relation to the severity and duration of the impairment.  Based on that evaluation, the Company does not consider this investment 
to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2017.

The Company provides credit facilities totaling $78 million to four unconsolidated affiliates.  Three facilities that are due on 
demand and bear interest between 3.74% and 4.74% have a total outstanding balance of $32 million.  The other facility has no
outstanding balance as of December 31, 2017.  The outstanding balance is included in other current assets in the accompanying 
consolidated balance sheet.

As of December 31, 2017, the Company received a $79 million advance payment from an unconsolidated affiliate for sales contracts 
expected to be executed in May 2018.  The amount, which bears interest at 3.26%, is included in accrued expenses and other 
payables in the accompanying balance sheet.

Note 10.     Debt Financing Arrangements (Continued)

At December 31, 2017, the fair value of the Company’s long-term debt exceeded the carrying value by $1.2 billion, as estimated 
using quoted market prices (a Level 2 measurement under applicable accounting standards).

The aggregate maturities of long-term debt for the five years after December 31, 2017, are $13 million, $618 million, $14 million, 
$670 million, and $8 million, respectively.

At December 31, 2017, the Company had lines of credit, including the accounts receivable securitization programs described 
below, totaling $7.7 billion, of which $5.5 billion was unused.  The weighted average interest rates on short-term borrowings 
outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016, were 2.35% and 5.66%, respectively.  Of the Company’s total lines of credit, $5.0 
billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there was $0.7 billion of commercial paper outstanding at 
December 31, 2017.
 
The Company’s credit facilities and certain debentures require the Company to comply with specified financial and non-financial 
covenants including maintenance of minimum tangible net worth as well as limitations related to incurring liens, secured debt, 
and certain other financing arrangements.  The Company is in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2017.

The Company had outstanding standby letters of credit and surety bonds at December 31, 2017 and 2016, totaling $1.2 billion and 
$1.1 billion, respectively.

The Company has accounts receivable securitization programs (the “Programs”).  The Programs provide the Company with up to 
$1.6 billion in funding resulting from the sale of accounts receivable.  As of December 31, 2017, the Company utilized $1.4 billion
of its facility under the Programs (see Note 19 for more information on the Programs).

Note 11.     Stock Compensation

The Company’s employee stock compensation plans provide for the granting of options to employees to purchase common stock 
of the Company pursuant to the Company’s 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan.  These options are issued at market value on the 
date of grant, vest incrementally over one to five years, and expire ten years after the date of grant.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes single option pricing model.  The 
volatility assumption used in the Black-Scholes single option pricing model is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s 
stock.  The volatility of the Company’s stock was calculated based upon the monthly closing price of the Company’s stock for the 
period immediately prior to the date of grant corresponding to the average expected life of the grant.  The average expected life 
represents the period of time that option grants are expected to be outstanding.  The risk-free rate is based on the rate of U.S. 
Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of option grants.  The assumptions used in the Black-
Scholes single option pricing model are as follows.

The Company’s 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan provides for the granting of restricted stock and restricted stock units (Restricted 
Stock Awards) at no cost to certain officers and key employees.  In addition, the Company’s 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan 
also provides for the granting of performance stock units (PSUs) at no cost to certain officers and key employees.  Restricted Stock 
Awards are made in common stock or stock units with equivalent rights and vest at the end of a three-year restriction period.  The 
awards for PSUs are made in common stock units and vest at the end of a three-year vesting period subject to the attainment of 
certain future service and performance criteria based on the Company’s adjusted return on invested capital (ROIC), adjusted 
earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and total shareholder return (TSR).  During the years 
ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, 2.2 million, 1.8 million, and 1.8 million common stock or stock units, respectively, 
were granted as Restricted Stock Awards and PSUs.  At December 31, 2017, there were 7.9 million shares available for future 
grants pursuant to the 2009 plan.

The fair value of Restricted Stock Awards is determined based on the market value of the Company’s shares on the grant date.  The 
fair value of PSUs is based on the weighted-average values of adjusted ROIC, adjusted EBITDA, and TSR.  The adjusted ROIC 
and adjusted EBITDA fair value is determined based on the market value of the Company's shares on the grant date while the TSR 
fair value is determined using the Monte Carlo simulation.  The weighted-average grant-date fair values of awards granted during 
the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $44.38, $33.31, and $46.73, respectively.

At December 31, 2017, there was $82 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to Restricted Stock Awards and 
PSUs.  Amounts to be recognized as compensation expense during the next three years are $35 million, $19 million, and $2 million, 
respectively.  The total grant-date fair value of Restricted Stock Awards that vested during the year ended December 31, 2017 was 
$51 million.

Compensation expense for option grants, Restricted Stock Awards, and PSUs granted to employees is generally recognized on a 
straight-line basis during the service period of the respective grant.  Certain of the Company’s option grants, Restricted Stock 
Awards, and PSUs continue to vest upon the recipient’s retirement from the Company and compensation expense related to option 
grants  and  Restricted  Stock  Awards  granted  to  retirement-eligible  employees  is  recognized  in  earnings  on  the  date  of 
grant.  Compensation expense for PSUs is based on the probability of meeting the performance criteria.

Total compensation expense for option grants, Restricted Stock Awards, and PSUs recognized during the years ended December 31, 
2017, 2016, and 2015 was $66 million, $72 million, and $70 million, respectively.

The reduction from the federal statutory rate related to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates resulted mostly from the Company’s 
foreign operations in Switzerland, Asia, and the Caribbean.  The Company’s foreign earnings, which were taxed at rates lower 
than the U.S. rate and were generated from these jurisdictions, were 59%, 47%, and 51% of its foreign earnings before taxes in 
fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017.  The income tax effects of changes in tax laws are 
recognized in the period when enacted.   The Act provides for numerous significant tax law changes and modifications with varying 
effective dates, which include reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, creating a territorial tax 
system (with a one-time transition tax on previously deferred foreign earnings), broadening the tax base, and allowing for immediate 
capital expensing of certain qualified property.  As of December 31, 2017, the Company has not yet completed the accounting for 
the tax effects of the Act; however, as described below, the Company has made a reasonable estimate of the effects on existing 
deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax, and recognized a net provisional tax benefit of $379 million, which is included 
as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations.  The Company will continue to refine its estimates and 
calculations as it completes its analysis of the tax effects of the Act in 2018.

The Company remeasured certain U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse 
in the future, which is generally 21%.  However, the Company is still analyzing certain aspects of the Act and refining its calculations, 
which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts.  The 
provisional amount recorded related to the remeasurement of deferred tax balance was a net tax benefit of $528 million. 

The Act also contains new provisions related to Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI).  The Company is currently refining  
its estimate of GILTI and will update the estimate for any additional guidance on the accounting for the effects of the GILTI 
provisions.  The Company has not made an accounting policy election at this time.

Note 13.     Income Taxes (Continued)

Undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and the Company’s share of the undistributed earnings of affiliated 
corporate joint venture companies accounted for on the equity method aggregated to approximately $9.4 billion at December 31, 
2017.  The Company recorded a provisional amount for the one-time transition tax liability of $149 million, net of foreign tax 
credits and prior year accruals of deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested.  The one-
time transition tax is based on the Company's total post-1986 earnings and profits (E&P) previously deferred from U.S. income 
taxes.  The Company has not yet finalized its calculation of the total post-1986 E&P for these foreign subsidiaries.  Further, the 
transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets.  This amount may change 
when the calculation of post-1986 foreign E&P previously deferred from U.S. federal taxation and the amounts held in cash or 
other specified assets are finalized and is subject to further refinement if further guidance is issued by federal and state taxing 
authorities.  The Company has elected to pay the one-time transition tax over eight years.  No additional income taxes have been 
provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax or any additional outside basis difference 
inherent in these entities, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.  It is not practicable to 
determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to 
the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in these entities.

It is likely that additional guidance will be issued providing further clarification on the application of the Act.  It is also reasonable 
to expect that global taxing authorities will be reviewing their current legislation for potential modifications in reaction to the 
implementation of the Act.  This additional guidance, along with the potential for additional global tax legislation changes, may 
affect significant deductions and income inclusions and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's net income or cash 
flow.

The Company had $254 million and $278 million of tax assets related to net operating loss carry-forwards of certain international 
subsidiaries at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  As of December 31, 2017, approximately $151 million of these assets 
have no expiration date, and the remaining $103 million expire at various times through fiscal 2025.  The annual usage of certain 
of these assets is limited to a percentage of taxable income of the respective foreign subsidiary for the year. The Company has 
recorded  a  valuation  allowance  of  $134  million  and  $126  million  against  these  tax  assets  at  December 31,  2017  and  2016, 
respectively, due to the uncertainty of their realization.

The  Company  had  $64  million  and  $57  million  of  tax  assets  related  to  foreign  and  domestic  capital  loss  carryforwards  at 
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $64 million and $41 million
against these tax assets at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The Company had $0 and $95 million of tax assets related to excess foreign tax credits at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  
There was no valuation allowance recorded against these assets at December 31, 2016.  The Company had $78 million and $62 
million of tax assets related to state income tax attributes (incentive credits and net operating loss carryforwards), net of federal 
tax benefit, at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which will expire at various times through fiscal 2037.  Due to the 
uncertainty of realization, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $65 million and $49 million related to state income tax 
assets net of federal tax benefit as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.    

The Company remains subject to federal examination in the U.S. for the calendar tax years 2016 and 2017.

The additions and reductions in unrecognized tax benefits shown in the table included effects related to net income and shareholders’ 
equity.  The changes in unrecognized tax benefits did not have a material effect on the Company’s net income or cash flow.  At 
December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits of $23 million and 
$26 million, respectively.

The Company is subject to income taxation and routine examinations in many jurisdictions around the world and frequently faces 
challenges regarding the amount of taxes due.  These challenges include positions taken by the Company related to the timing, 
nature, and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various jurisdictions.  In its routine evaluations of the 
exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company recognizes a liability, when necessary, for estimated potential 
tax owed by the Company in accordance with applicable accounting standards.  Resolution of the related tax positions, through 
negotiations with relevant tax authorities or through litigation, may take years to complete.  Therefore, it is difficult to predict the 
timing for resolution of tax positions and the Company cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these 
ongoing or future examinations.  However, the Company does not anticipate that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits 
will increase or decrease significantly in the next twelve months.  Given the long periods of time involved in resolving tax positions, 
the Company does not expect that the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits will have a material impact on the Company’s 
effective income tax rate in any given period.  If the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits were recognized by the Company 
at one time, there would be a reduction of $56 million on the tax expense for that period.

The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, ADM do Brasil Ltda. (ADM do Brasil), has received three separate tax assessments 
from the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service (BFRS) challenging the tax deductibility of commodity hedging losses and related 
expenses for the tax years 2004, 2006 and 2007.  As of December 31, 2017, these assessments, updated for estimated penalties, 
interest, and variation in currency exchange rates, totaled approximately $474 million.  The statute of limitations for tax years 
2005 and 2008 to 2011 has expired.  The Company does not expect to receive any additional tax assessments. 

ADM do Brasil enters into commodity hedging transactions that can result in gains, which are included in ADM do Brasil’s 
calculation of taxable income in Brazil, and losses, which ADM do Brasil deducts from its taxable income in Brazil.  The Company 
has evaluated its tax position regarding these hedging transactions and concluded, based upon advice from Brazilian legal counsel, 
that it was appropriate to recognize both gains and losses resulting from hedging transactions when determining its Brazilian 
income tax expense.  Therefore, the Company has continued to recognize the tax benefit from hedging losses in its financial 
statements and has not recorded any tax liability for the amounts assessed by the BFRS.

Archer-Daniels-Midland Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 13.     Income Taxes (Continued)

ADM do Brasil filed an administrative appeal for each of the assessments.  The appeal panel found in favor of the BFRS on these 
assessments and ADM do Brasil filed a second level administrative appeal.  The second administrative appeal panel continues to 
conduct customary procedural activities, including ongoing dialogue with the BFRS auditor.  If ADM do Brasil continues to be 
unsuccessful in the administrative appellate process, the Company intends to file appeals in the Brazilian federal courts.  While 
the Company believes its consolidated financial statements properly reflect the tax deductibility of these hedging losses, the ultimate 
resolution of this matter could result in the future recognition of additional payments of, and expense for, income tax and the 
associated interest and penalties.  

The Company intends to vigorously defend its position against the current assessments and any similar assessments that may be 
issued for years subsequent to 2011.

The Company’s subsidiaries in Argentina have received tax assessments challenging transfer prices used to price grain exports 
totaling $113 million (inclusive of interest and adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates) for the tax years 2004 through 
2010.  The Argentine tax authorities have been conducting a review of income and other taxes paid by large exporters and processors 
of cereals and other agricultural commodities resulting in allegations of income tax evasion.  While the Company believes that it 
has complied with all Argentine tax laws, it cannot rule out receiving additional assessments challenging transfer prices used to 
price grain exports for years subsequent to 2010, and estimates that these potential assessments would be approximately $203 
million  (as  of  December 31,  2017  and  subject  to  variation  in  currency  exchange  rates).    The  Company  believes  that  it  has 
appropriately evaluated the transactions underlying these assessments, and has concluded, based on Argentine tax law, that its tax 
position would be sustained, and accordingly, has not recorded a tax liability for these assessments.  The Company intends to 
vigorously defend its position against the current assessments and any similar assessments that may be issued for years subsequent 
to 2010.

In accordance with the accounting requirements for uncertain tax positions, the Company has not recorded an uncertain tax liability 
for these assessments because it has concluded that it is more likely than not to prevail on the Brazil and Argentina matters based 
upon their technical merits and because the taxing jurisdictions’ processes do not provide a mechanism for settling at less than the 
full amount of the assessment.  The Company’s consideration of these tax assessments requires judgments about the application 
of income tax regulations to specific facts and circumstances.  The final outcome of these matters cannot reliably be predicted, 
may take many years to resolve, and could result in financial impacts of up to the entire amount of these assessments.

The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary in the Netherlands, ADM Europe B.V., has received a tax assessment totaling $108 
million from the Netherlands tax authority challenging the transfer pricing aspects of a 2009 business reorganization which involved 
two of its subsidiary companies in the Netherlands.  The Company has appealed the assessment and carefully evaluated the 
underlying transactions and has concluded that the amount of the gain recognized on the reorganization for tax purposes was 
appropriate.  While the Company plans to vigorously defend its position against the assessment, it has accrued an amount it believes 
would be the likely outcome of the litigation.  The Company’s defense of the judicial appeal may take an extended period of time, 
and could result in additional financial impacts of up to the entire amount of this assessment.

The Company provides substantially all U.S. employees and employees at certain foreign subsidiaries with retirement benefits 
including defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans.  The Company provides certain eligible U.S. employees who 
retire under qualifying conditions with subsidized postretirement health care coverage or Health Care Reimbursement Accounts.

On July 31, 2017, the Company announced that all participants in the Company’s U.S. salaried pension plan and the Supplemental 
Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) will begin accruing benefits under the cash balance formula effective January 1, 2022.  Benefits 
for participants who were accruing under the final average pay formula will be frozen as of December 31, 2021, including pay and 
service through that date.  This change, along with other changes in participation associated with divestitures and restructuring, 
triggered a remeasurement of the salaried pension plan and the SERP resulting in decreases in the fiscal 2017 pension expense, 
accumulated other comprehensive loss, and underfunded status by $18 million, $164 million, and $182 million, respectively.  

The Company also changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and 
postretirement benefit costs for its U.S., Canadian, and U.K. plans.  The new method uses the spot rate yield curve approach to 
estimate the service and interest costs. Previously, those costs were determined using a single weighted-average discount rate applied 
to all future cash outflows. The change does not affect the measurement of the Company’s benefit obligations and was accounted 
for as a change in accounting estimate in accordance with the guidance of ASC Topic 250, Accounting Estimates and Error Corrections, 
thereby impacting the current and future periods.  The impact of this change on after-tax earnings and diluted earnings per share for 
the year ended December 31, 2017 was immaterial.

In December 2016, the Company announced a change to the U.S. retiree medical program which affected employees with less than 
30 years of service at January 1, 2017.  The change resulted in a curtailment gain of $38 million for the year ended December 31, 
2016.

Note 15.     Employee Benefit Plans (Continued)

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

The Company maintains 401(k) plans covering substantially all U.S. employees.  The Company contributes cash to the plans to 
match  qualifying  employee  contributions,  and  also  provides  a  non-matching  employer  contribution  of  1%  of  pay  to  eligible 
participants.  Under an employee stock ownership component of the 401(k) plans, employees may choose to invest in the Company's 
stock as part of their own investment elections.  The employer contributions are expensed when paid.  Assets of the Company’s       
401(k) plans consist primarily of listed common stocks and pooled funds.  The Company’s 401(k) plans held 11 million shares of 
Company common stock at December 31, 2017, with a market value of $422 million.  Cash dividends received on shares of Company 
common stock by these plans during the year ended December 31, 2017 were $14 million.

Included in AOCI for pension benefits at December 31, 2017, are the following amounts that have not yet been recognized in net 
periodic pension cost: unrecognized prior service credit of $171 million and unrecognized actuarial loss of $706 million.  The prior 
service credit and actuarial loss included in AOCI expected to be recognized in net periodic pension cost during 2018 is $19 million
and $60 million, respectively.

Included in AOCI for postretirement benefits at December 31, 2017, are the following amounts that have not yet been recognized 
in net periodic postretirement benefit cost: unrecognized prior service credit of $46 million and unrecognized actuarial loss of $35 
million.  Prior service credit of $15 million and actuarial loss of $3 million included in AOCI are expected to be recognized in net

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for the pension plans with projected 
benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $2.7 billion, $2.6 billion, and $2.0 billion, respectively as of December 31, 2017, 
and $2.7 billion, $2.3 billion, and $1.8 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2016.  The projected benefit obligation, accumulated 
benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for the pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets 
were $2.7 billion, $2.5 billion, and $1.9 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2017 and $2.6 billion, $2.3 billion, and $1.7 billion, 
respectively, as of December 31, 2016.  The accumulated benefit obligation for all pension plans as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, 
was $3.0 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively.

For postretirement benefit measurement purposes, a 7.70% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits 
was assumed for the year ended December 31, 2017.  The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5% by 2026 and remain at 
that level thereafter.

Plan Assets

The Company’s employee benefit plan assets are principally comprised of the following types of investments:

Common stock:
Equity securities are valued based on quoted exchange prices and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.

Mutual funds:
Mutual funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which they are traded and are classified within Level 
1 of the valuation hierarchy.

Common collective trust (CCT) funds:
The fair values of the CCTs are valued using net asset value (NAV).  The investments in CCTs are comprised of international equity 
and short-term investments.  The investments are valued at NAV provided by administrators of the funds.

Corporate debt instruments:
Corporate debt instruments are valued using third-party pricing services and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

U.S.  Treasury instruments:
U.S. Treasury instruments are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which they are traded and are classified 
within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.

U.S. government agency, state, and local government bonds:
U.S. government agency obligations and state and municipal debt securities are valued using third-party pricing services and are 
classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.  

The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of 
future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market 
participants’ methods, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments 
could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

(1)  The Company’s U.S. pension plans contain approximately 78% of the Company’s global pension plan assets.  The actual asset 
allocation for the Company’s U.S. pension plans as of the measurement date consists of 60% equity securities and 40% debt 
securities.  The target asset allocation for the Company’s U.S. pension plans is approximately the same as the actual asset 
allocation.  The actual asset allocation for the Company’s foreign pension plans as of the measurement date consists of 56%
equity securities, 43% debt securities, and 1% in other investments.  The target asset allocation for the Company’s foreign 
pension plans is approximately the same as the actual asset allocation.

(2)  The Company’s pension plans did not directly hold any shares of Company common stock as of the December 31, 2017 and 

2016 measurement dates. 

Investment objectives for the Company’s plan assets are to:

•  Optimize the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of risk.
•  Maintain a broad diversification across asset classes and among investment managers.
•  Maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset class.

Asset allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given the long-term time horizon for fulfilling 
the obligations of the pension plans.  Selection of the targeted asset allocation for plan assets was based upon a review of the expected 
return and risk characteristics of each asset class, as well as the correlation of returns among asset classes.  The U.S. pension plans 
target asset allocation is also based on an asset and liability study that is updated periodically.

Investment guidelines are established with each investment manager.  These guidelines provide the parameters within which the 
investment managers agree to operate, including criteria that determine eligible and ineligible securities, diversification requirements, 
and credit quality standards, where applicable.  In some countries, derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient 
and timely manner; however, derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of underlying investments.

The Company uses external consultants to assist in monitoring the investment strategy and asset mix for the Company’s plan assets.  To 
develop the Company’s expected long-term rate of return assumption on plan assets, the Company generally uses long-term historical 
return information for the targeted asset mix identified in asset and liability studies.  Adjustments are made to the expected long-
term rate of return assumption when deemed necessary based upon revised expectations of future investment performance of the 
overall investment markets.

Contributions and Expected Future Benefit Payments

Based  on  actuarial  calculations,  the  Company  expects  to  contribute  $28  million  to  the  pension  plans  and $12  million  to  the 
postretirement benefit plan during 2018.  The Company may elect to make additional discretionary contributions during this period.

Note 17.     Segment and Geographic Information

The Company is principally engaged in procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities, 
products,  and  ingredients.  The  Company’s  operations  are  organized,  managed,  and  classified  into  four  reportable  business 
segments:  Agricultural Services, Corn Processing, Oilseeds Processing, and Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients.  Each of 
these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered.  The Company’s remaining operations are not 
reportable segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard, and are classified as Other.

The Agricultural Services segment utilizes its extensive global grain elevator and transportation networks, and port operations to 
buy, store, clean, and transport agricultural commodities, such as oilseeds, corn, wheat, milo, oats, rice, and barley, and resells 
these commodities primarily as food and feed ingredients and as raw materials for the agricultural processing industry.  The 
Agricultural Services segment includes international agricultural commodities merchandising and handling activities managed 
through a global trade desk based in Rolle, Switzerland.  Agricultural Services’ grain sourcing, handling, and transportation network 
provides reliable and efficient services to the Company’s customers and agricultural processing operations.  Agricultural Services’ 
transportation network capabilities include barge, ocean-going vessel, truck, rail, and container freight services.  The Agricultural 
Services segment also includes the activities related to structured trade finance, the processing of wheat into wheat flour, and the 
Company’s share of the results of its Pacificor (formerly Kalama Export Company LLC) joint venture.  The Agricultural Services 
segment also included returns associated with the Company’s 19.8% investment in GrainCorp until its sale in December 2016.  In 
July  2017,  the  Company  completed  the  acquisition  of  a  51%  controlling  interest  in  Industries  Centers,  an  Israeli  company 
specializing in the import and distribution of agricultural feed products, which is now known as ADM Israel.

The Company’s Corn Processing segment is engaged in corn wet and dry milling and other activities, utilizing its asset base 
primarily located in the central part of the United States with additional facilities in China, Bulgaria, France, Morocco, Spain, and 
Turkey.  The Corn Processing segment converts corn into sweeteners, starches, and bioproducts.  Its products include ingredients 
used in the food and beverage industry including sweeteners, starch, syrup, glucose, and dextrose.  Dextrose and starch are used 
by the Corn Processing segment as feedstocks for its bioproducts operations.  By fermentation of dextrose, the Corn Processing 
segment produces alcohol, amino acids, and other food and animal feed ingredients.  Ethyl alcohol is produced by the Company 
for industrial use as ethanol or as beverage grade.  Ethanol, in gasoline, increases octane and is used as an extender and oxygenate.  
Bioproducts also include essential amino acids such as lysine and threonine used in swine and poultry diets to optimize performance.  
Corn gluten feed and meal, as well as distillers’ grains, are produced for use as animal feed ingredients.  Corn germ, a by-product 
of the wet milling process, is further processed into vegetable oil and protein meal.  The Corn Processing segment also includes 
activities related to the processing and distribution of formula feeds and animal health and nutrition products.  Other Corn Processing 
products include citric acids and glycols, all of which are used in various food and industrial products.  The Corn Processing 
segment also included the activities of the Company’s Brazilian sugarcane ethanol plant and related operations until the Company 
completed the sale of these operations in May 2016.  This segment also includes the Company’s share of the results of its equity 
investments in Almidones Mexicanos S.A., and Red Star Yeast Company LLC.  In February 2017, the Company acquired Crosswind 
Industries, Inc., an industry leader in the manufacture of contract and private label pet treats and foods and an 89% controlling 
interest in Biopolis SL, a leading provider of microbial technology with a strong portfolio of novel food ingredients.  In June 2017, 
the Company completed the acquisition of Chamtor SA, a French producer of wheat-based sweeteners and starches.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 17.     Segment and Geographic Information (Continued)

The  Oilseeds  Processing  segment  includes  global  activities  related  to  the  origination,  merchandising,  crushing,  and  further 
processing of oilseeds such as soybeans and soft seeds (cottonseed, sunflower seed, canola, rapeseed, and flaxseed) into vegetable 
oils and protein meals.  Oilseeds products produced and marketed by the Company include ingredients for the food, feed, energy, 
and industrial products industries.  Crude vegetable oils produced by the segment’s crushing activities are sold “as is” or are further 
processed by refining, blending, bleaching, and deodorizing into salad oils.  Salad oils are sold “as is” or are further processed by 
hydrogenating and/or interesterifying into margarine, shortening, and other food products. Partially refined oils are used to produce 
biodiesel or are sold to other manufacturers for use in chemicals, paints, and other industrial products.  Oilseed protein meals are 
principally sold to third parties to be used as ingredients in commercial livestock and poultry feeds.  In Europe and South America, 
the Oilseeds Processing segment includes origination and merchandising activities as adjuncts to its oilseeds processing assets.  
These activities include a network of grain elevators, port facilities, and transportation assets used to buy, store, clean, and transport 
grains and oilseeds.  The Oilseeds Processing segment is a major supplier of peanuts, tree nuts, and peanut-derived ingredients to 
both the U.S. and export markets.  In North America, cottonseed flour is produced and sold primarily to the pharmaceutical industry 
and cotton cellulose pulp is manufactured and sold to the chemical, paper, and filter markets.  The Oilseeds Processing segment 
also included activities related to its global chocolate and cocoa businesses until the sale of these businesses in July 2015 and 
October 2015, respectively.  The Oilseeds Processing segment also includes the Company’s share of the results of its equity 
investment in Wilmar and its share of the results of its Stratas Foods LLC and Edible Oils Limited, and Olenex joint ventures.  
During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company acquired additional shares in Wilmar increasing its ownership interest 
from 23.2% to 24.9%. 
 
The Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients (WFSI) segment engages in the manufacturing, sales, and distribution of specialty 
products  including  natural  flavor  ingredients,  flavor  systems,  natural  colors,  proteins,  emulsifiers,  soluble  fiber,  polyols, 
hydrocolloids, natural health and nutrition products, and other specialty food and feed ingredients.  The WFSI segment also includes 
the activities related to the procurement, processing, and distribution of edible beans.  

Other includes the Company’s remaining operations, primarily its financial business units, related to futures commission and 
insurance activities.  On May 1, 2017, the Company completed the sale of its crop risk services business to Validus Holdings, a 
global group of insurance and reinsurance companies.    

Intersegment sales have been recorded at amounts approximating market.  Operating profit for each segment is based on net sales 
less identifiable operating expenses.  Also included in segment operating profit is equity in earnings of affiliates based on the 
equity method of accounting.  Specified items included in total segment operating profit and certain corporate items are not allocated 
to  the  Company’s  individual  business  segments  because  operating  performance  of  each  business  segment  is  evaluated  by 
management exclusive of these items.  Corporate results principally include the impact of LIFO-related adjustments, unallocated 
corporate expenses, interest cost net of investment income, and the Company’s share of the results of its equity investment in 
Compagnie Industrialle et Financiere des Produits Amylaces SA (Luxembourg) (CIP).

(1) The gains in 2017 related to the sale of the crop risk services business and disposals of other individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business, 
partially offset by an adjustment of the proceeds of the 2015 sale of the cocoa business. The gains in 2016 primarily related to recovery of loss provisions and gain 
related to the sale of the Company’s Brazilian sugar ethanol facilities, realized contingent consideration on the December 2012 sale of the Company’s equity 
investment in Gruma S.A. de C.V., and revaluation of the remaining interest to settlement value in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interest in 
Amazon Flavors, partially offset by a loss on sale of asset.  The gains in 2015 related primarily to the sale of the cocoa, chocolate, and lactic businesses, revaluation 
of the Company’s previously held investments in North Star Shipping, Minmetal, and Eaststarch C.V. in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interests, 
and the sale of a 50% interest in the Barcarena export terminal facility in Brazil.

(2) The charges in 2017 consisted of asset impairments related to the closure of a facility in the WFSI segment and the reconfiguration of the Company’s Peoria, 
Illinois ethanol complex in the Corn Processing segment, settlement charges, and several individually insignificant asset impairments and restructuring charges.  
The charges in 2016 consisted of several individually insignificant asset impairments and restructuring charges.  The charges in 2015 consisted of asset impairments 
related primarily to certain international Oilseeds Processing facilities, asset impairments, loss provisions, and exit charges related to the sugar ethanol facilities 
in Brazil, goodwill impairment charges, an inventory writedown, and several individually insignificant asset impairments and restructuring charges.

(3) Hedge timing effects relate to hedge ineffectiveness associated with documented hedge programs.

Note 19.     Sale of Accounts Receivable

Since March 2012, the Company has had an accounts receivable securitization program (the “Program”) with certain commercial 
paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers (collectively, the “Purchasers”).  Under the Program, certain U.S.-originated 
trade  accounts  receivable  are  sold  to  a  wholly-owned  bankruptcy-remote  entity,  ADM  Receivables,  LLC  (“ADM 
Receivables”).  ADM Receivables in turn transfers such purchased accounts receivable in their entirety to the Purchasers pursuant 
to a receivables purchase agreement.  In exchange for the transfer of the accounts receivable, ADM Receivables receives a cash 
payment of up to $1 billion, as amended, and an additional amount upon the collection of the accounts receivable (deferred 
consideration).  The Program terminates on June 22, 2018, unless extended.

103

Note 19.     Sale of Accounts Receivable (Continued)

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

In March 2014, the Company entered into a second accounts receivable securitization program (the “Second Program”) with certain 
commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers (collectively, the “Second Purchasers”).  Under the Second 
Program, certain non-U.S.-originated trade accounts receivable are sold to a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote entity, ADM Ireland 
Receivables  Company  (“ADM  Ireland  Receivables”).   ADM  Ireland  Receivables  in  turn  transfers  such  purchased  accounts 
receivable in their entirety to the Second Purchasers pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement.    In exchange for the transfer 
of the accounts receivable, ADM Ireland Receivables receives a cash payment of up to $0.4 billion and an additional amount upon 
the collection of the accounts receivable (deferred consideration).  The Second Program terminates on March 16, 2018, unless 
extended.  

Under the Program and Second Program (collectively, the “Programs”), ADM Receivables and ADM Ireland Receivables use the 
cash proceeds from the transfer of receivables to the Purchasers and Second Purchasers (collectively, the "Purchasers") and other 
consideration to finance the purchase of receivables from the Company and the ADM subsidiaries originating the receivables.

The Company accounts for these transfers as sales.  The Company has no retained interests in the transferred receivables, other 
than collection and administrative responsibilities and its right to the deferred consideration.  At December 31, 2017 and 2016, 
the Company did not record a servicing asset or liability related to its retained responsibility, based on its assessment of the servicing 
fee, market values for similar transactions, and its cost of servicing the receivables sold. 

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the fair value of trade receivables transferred to the Purchasers under the Programs and 
derecognized from the Company’s consolidated balance sheet was $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively.  In exchange for the 
transfer as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company received cash of $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion and recorded a receivable 
for deferred consideration included in other current assets of $307 million and $540 million, respectively.  Cash collections from 
customers on receivables sold were $33.5 billion, $34.3 billion, and $40.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, 
and 2015, respectively.  Of this amount, $33.5 billion, $33.8 billion, and $40.3 billion pertain to cash collections on the deferred 
consideration for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  Deferred consideration is paid to the Company 
in cash on behalf of the Purchasers as receivables are collected; however, as this is a revolving facility, cash collected from the 
Company’s customers is reinvested by the Purchasers daily in new receivable purchases under the Programs.

The Company’s risk of loss following the transfer of accounts receivable under the Programs is limited to the deferred consideration 
outstanding.  The Company carries the deferred consideration at fair value determined by calculating the expected amount of cash 
to be received and is principally based on observable inputs (a Level 2 measurement under the applicable accounting standards) 
consisting mainly of the face amount of the receivables adjusted for anticipated credit losses and discounted at the appropriate 
market rate.  Payment of deferred consideration is not subject to significant risks other than delinquencies and credit losses on 
accounts receivable transferred under the Programs which have historically been insignificant.

Transfers of receivables under the Programs during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 resulted in an expense 
for the loss on sale of $10 million, $6 million, and $5 million, respectively, which is classified as selling, general, and administrative 
expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings.

The Company reflects all cash flows related to the Programs as operating activities in its consolidated statements of cash flows 
because the cash received from the Purchasers upon both the sale and collection of the receivables is not subject to significant 
interest rate risk given the short-term nature of the Company’s trade receivables.

Note 20.     Legal Proceedings, Guarantees, and Commitments

The Company is routinely involved in a number of actual or threatened legal actions, including those involving alleged personal 
injuries, employment law, product liability, intellectual property, environmental issues, alleged tax liability (see Note 13 for 
information on income tax matters), and class actions.  The Company also routinely receives inquiries from regulators and other 
government authorities relating to various aspects of our business, and at any given time, the Company has matters at various 
stages of resolution with the applicable government authorities.  The outcomes of these matters are not within our complete control 
and may not be known for prolonged periods of time.  In some actions, claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, including 
injunctive relief, that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues. In accordance with applicable accounting 
standards, the Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for material loss contingencies when a loss is 
known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable 
loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued.  
If a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated 
loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  When determining the estimated loss or 
range of loss, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded.  Estimates of probable 
losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly 
when the matters are in early procedural stages, with incomplete facts or legal discovery; involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate 
claims for damages; potentially involve penalties, fines, disgorgement, or punitive damages; or could result in a change in business 
practice.  

The Company is a party to numerous lawsuits pending in various U.S. state and federal courts arising out of Syngenta Corporation’s 
(Syngenta) marketing and distribution of genetically modified corn products, Agrisure Viptera and Agrisure Duracade, in the U.S.  
First,  the  Company  brought  a  state  court  action  in  Louisiana  against  Syngenta  in  2014,  alleging  Syngenta  was  negligent  in 
commercializing its products before the products were approved in China.  In December 2017, the Company and Syngenta reached 
a confidential settlement of this action.  Second, the Company is a party in a number of purported class actions filed beginning in 
2013 by farmers and other parties against Syngenta in federal and state courts, again alleging that Syngenta was negligent in 
commercializing its products.  The federal actions were consolidated for pretrial proceedings in a multidistrict litigation (MDL) 
proceeding in federal court in Kansas City, Kansas, and some state actions were consolidated for pretrial proceedings in MDL in 
Minnesota state court.  In the fourth quarter of 2015, Syngenta filed third-party claims against the Company and other grain 
companies in these MDLs seeking contribution in the event Syngenta is held liable in these lawsuits.  In September 2017, Syngenta 
filed similar third-party claims against the Company in Iowa state court.  In September 2017, Syngenta and the farmer plaintiffs 
reached a tentative settlement, subject to court approval, of all claims by those plaintiffs, and as noted above, in December 2017, 
the Company and Syngenta reached a confidential settlement of all claims.  Third, the Company and other grain companies have 
been named as defendants in numerous individual and purported class action suits filed by farmers and other parties in state and 
federal courts beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, alleging the Company and other grain companies were negligent in failing 
to screen for genetically modified corn.  On September 6, 2016, the court in the Minnesota state MDL dismissed all claims against 
the Company, and on January 4, 2017, a federal court in the Southern District of Illinois similarly dismissed all of the pending 
complaints against the Company in Southern Illinois.  Some parties are expected to appeal some or all of these dismissals.  Currently, 
the Company remains a defendant only in certain state court actions by farmers and other parties pending in Illinois state court, 
which the Company has moved to dismiss as well.  The Company denies liability in all of the actions in which it has been named 
as a third-party defendant or defendant and is vigorously defending itself in these cases.  All of these actions are in pretrial 
proceedings.  At this time, the Company is unable to predict the final outcome of this matter with any reasonable degree of certainty, 
but believes the outcome will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of Archer-Daniels-Midland  Company  (the  Company)  as  of 
December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ 
equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and financial 
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).  In our opinion, the 
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at December 31, 
2017 and 2016, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 
December 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) 
(PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 
(2013 Framework) and our report dated February 16, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on 
the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are 
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable 
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error 
or fraud.  Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a 
test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the 
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited Archer-Daniels-Midland Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based 
on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (the Company) 
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on the 
COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) 
(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the 
related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the 
three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at 
Item 15(a)(2), and our report dated February 16, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment 
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal 
Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial 
reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with 
respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities 
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material 
respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing 
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for 
our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain 
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets 
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that 
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also, 
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because 
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

As of December 31, 2017, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s 
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation 
of the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act)).  Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Financial Officer, concluded the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information 
required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, 
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) 
accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, 
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
The Company is implementing a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis as part of its ongoing 
business transformation program, which is expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of certain financial and business 
transaction processes.  The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years.  The Company has currently 
implemented changes to certain processes in corporate finance, two processing businesses, and in over 200 locations, and will 
continue to roll-out the ERP system over the next several years.  The Company has appropriately considered these changes in its 
design of and testing for effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and concluded, as part of the evaluation described 
in the above paragraph, that the implementation of the new ERP in these circumstances has not materially affected its internal 
control over financial reporting. 
  

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Archer-Daniels-Midland Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over 
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f).  The Company's internal control system is designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, 
the Company's management assessed the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2017 based on the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework).  Based on this assessment, management concluded 
that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017.

Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal 
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017.  That report is included herein.
