2017 Annual Report

ongoing enhancements to our technological capabilities, expansion of 
our geographic presence and further development of our associates so 
as to deliver value, for you, our shareholders.  

In the spirit of looking forward and continuing to position our leadership 
team on our defined succession path, Tom Bené will become our President 
and CEO effective January 1, 2018. Tom is a strong, accomplished leader 
who has contributed greatly to Sysco and brings a wealth of relevant 
experience to his new role. We are very excited about Sysco’s future 
prospects under Tom and his capable leadership. 

In addition, on behalf of the board of directors and everyone at Sysco, I 
would like to salute Bill DeLaney, our current CEO, for his many contributions 
over the span of his 30-year career of distinguished service at Sysco. 
Bill has been instrumental to Sysco’s success and has taken decisive 
actions to oversee transformative change. Under his leadership, Sysco 
has established itself as the global leader in selling, marketing and 
distributing food products and is well-positioned for continued success.

In closing, it is most appropriate that we recognize the capabilities and 
contributions of our 65,000 associates. We have an exceptional team, 
and it is their dedication, integrity and commitment to our customers 
that drove our success in fiscal 2017.

Thank you for your continued support.

Jackie Ward
Chairman

1  Each of these measures are non-GAAP financial measures.  See pages 29 and 
30 in the attached Form 10-K for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the 
corresponding GAAP results.  Adjusted measures include further adjustments 
described at pages 27 and 28 in the attached Form 10-K.

Dear Sysco Shareholders,

Fiscal 2017 was a great year for Sysco, as we delivered excellent financial 
results; sales grew 10% to $55.4 billion, adjusted operating income1 grew 
17% to $2.4 billion, and adjusted earnings per share1 grew 18% to $2.48. 
This strong performance reflects a consistently high level of execution 
on our customer-centric strategy, with a “One Sysco” approach, and 
further positions us to deliver disciplined, profitable and sustainable 
growth in the future. We are especially pleased with the significant 
progress achieved towards our three-year plan objectives of delivering 
accelerated case growth with an emphasis on local customers, while 
growing gross profit dollars faster than overall expense growth. 

Fiscal 2017 was marked by not only our strong operating performance, 
but also by some important highlights, which include:

 • Encouraging progress toward strengthening customer relationships, 

as evidenced by the improvement in our customer loyalty scores;

 • The addition of the Brakes business in Europe. We are excited about 

the long-term opportunities to create value in Europe; and

 • Advances with technology, especially enhanced customer facing tools.

At Sysco, we strive to be our customers’ most valued and trusted 
business partner, and we are committed to delivering on our targeted 
financial objectives for our Sysco shareholders. We are doing so by 
developing new, as well as refining current strategic initiatives -- such 
as category management, revenue management, enhanced customer-
facing technology and multiple productivity improvement measures -- all 
facilitating our goal of creating competitive advantage. We will continue 
accelerating, broadening and deepening our customer insights, while 
working to attract and develop highly capable and diverse associates 
who are critical to our future success. 

Additionally, we are highly committed to furthering progress in Corporate 
Social Responsibility (CSR). Throughout the past year, we have taken 
steps to enhance our CSR efforts. These initiatives assist us with the 
enhancement of customer service, attraction and retention of the best 
talent and support for the communities where we live and work.

And, while pleased with our progress and accomplishments in fiscal 
2017, we recognize that there is still much to accomplish. Looking 
ahead to fiscal 2018, we will continue to invest in our business through 

“

This strong performance 
reflects a consistently high 
level of execution on our 
customer-centric strategy, 
with a “One Sysco” approach, 
and further positions us to 
deliver disciplined, profitable 
and sustainable growth in 
the future.

ITEM 1  Business

Unless this Form 10-K indicates otherwise or the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “Sysco,” or “the company” as used in this Form 10-K 
refer to Sysco Corporation together with its consolidated subsidiaries and divisions.

Overview

Sysco Corporation, acting through its subsidiaries and divisions, is the largest global distributor of food and related products primarily to the foodservice 
or food-away-from-home industry. We provide products and related services to over 500,000 customer locations, including restaurants, healthcare and 
educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers.

Founded in 1969, Sysco commenced operations as a public company in March 1970 when the stockholders of nine companies exchanged their stock for 
Sysco common stock. Since our formation, we have grown from $115 million to $55.4 billion in annual sales, both through internal expansion of existing 
operations and through acquisitions.

Sysco’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to June 30th. This resulted in a 52-week year ending July 1, 2017 for fiscal 2017, a 53-week year ending 
July 2, 2016 for fiscal 2016, and a 52-week year ending June 27, 2015 for fiscal 2015. We will have a 52-week year ending June 30, 2018 for fiscal 2018.

Sysco Corporation is organized under the laws of Delaware. The address and telephone number of our executive offices are 1390 Enclave Parkway, Houston, 
Texas 77077-2099, (281) 584-1390. This annual report on Form 10-K, as well as all other reports filed or furnished by Sysco pursuant to Section 13(a) or 
15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, are available free of charge on Sysco’s website at www.sysco.com as soon as reasonably practicable after 
they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Acquisition of Brakes Group

In February 2016, Sysco entered into a share sale and purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) to acquire Cucina Lux Investments Limited, the 
parent holding company of the Brakes Group (the Brakes Acquisition). On July 5, 2016, following the end of fiscal year 2016, Sysco closed the Brakes 
Acquisition. The consideration paid by Sysco in connection with the Brakes Acquisition was approximately £2.3 billion (approximately $3.1 billion based on 
exchange rates on July 5, 2016), and included the repayment of approximately $2.3 billion of the Brakes Group’s then outstanding debt. The purchase price 
was paid primarily in cash using the proceeds from recent debt issuances and other cash on hand, and was subject to certain adjustments as provided 
in the Purchase Agreement. The Brakes Group is now wholly owned by Sysco.

The Brakes Group is a large European foodservice business supplying fresh, refrigerated and frozen food products, as well as non-food products and 
supplies, to foodservice customers ranging from large customers, including leisure, pub, restaurant, hotel and contract catering groups, to smaller 
customers, including independent restaurants, hotels, fast food outlets, schools and hospitals. The Brakes Group’s largest businesses are in the United 
Kingdom (U.K.), France, and Sweden, in addition to a presence in Ireland, Belgium, Spain, and Luxembourg. The Brakes Acquisition significantly strengthens 
Sysco’s position as the global leader in selling, marketing and distributing food products and offers attractive opportunities for organic growth and future 
expansion in European markets.

The Brakes Group supplies a broad variety of products, including a portfolio of privately branded products, which are generally delivered through its 
distribution networks, consisting of central distribution hubs, satellite depots and its fleet of delivery vehicles. The Brakes Group also has separate divisions 
specializing in catering supplies and equipment. Brakes Group companies include: Brakes, Brakes Catering Equipment, Brake France, Country Choice, 
Davigel, Fresh Direct, Freshfayre, M&J Seafood, Menigo Foodservice, Pauley’s, Wild Harvest and Woodward Foodservice.

reporting Segments

Sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers. 
Our primary operations are located in North America and Europe. Under the accounting provisions related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise, 
we have aggregated our operating segments into three reportable segments. “Other” financial information is attributable to the company’s other operating 
segments that do not meet the quantitative disclosure thresholds.

 • U.S. Foodservice Operations - primarily includes U.S. Broadline operations, custom-cut meat and seafood companies, FreshPoint (our specialty produce 

companies) and European Imports (a specialty import company);

 • International Foodservice Operations - includes broadline operations in Canada and Europe, including the Brakes Group (which was acquired in 

fiscal 2017), Bahamas, Mexico, Costa Rica and Panama, as well as a company that distributes to international customers;

 • SYGMA - our customized distribution subsidiary; and

 • Other - primarily our hotel supply operations and Sysco Labs, which includes our suite of technology solutions that help support the business needs 

of our customers and provides support for some of our business technology needs.

Broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to both traditional and chain restaurant 
customers, hospitals, schools, hotels, industrial caterers and other venues where foodservice products are served. SYGMA operating companies distribute 
a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to certain chain restaurant customer locations. Selected financial data for each of our 
reportable segments, as well as financial information concerning geographic areas, can be found in Note 21, “Business Segment Information,” in the Notes 
to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Customers and Products

Sysco’s customers in the foodservice industry include restaurants, hospitals and nursing homes, schools and colleges, hotels and motels, industrial caterers 
and other similar venues where foodservice products are served. Services to our customers are supported by similar physical facilities, vehicles, material 
handling equipment and techniques, and administrative and operating staffs.

The products we distribute include:

 • a full line of frozen foods, such as meats, seafood, fully prepared entrées, fruits, vegetables and desserts;
 • a full line of canned and dry foods;
 • fresh meats and seafood;
 • dairy products;
 • beverage products;
 • imported specialties; and
 • fresh produce.

We also supply a wide variety of non-food items, including:

 • paper products such as disposable napkins, plates and cups;
 • tableware such as china and silverware;
 • cookware such as pots, pans and utensils;
 • restaurant and kitchen equipment and supplies; and
 • cleaning supplies.
A comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below:

SYSCO CORPORATION - Form 10-KPArT I
ITEM 1 Business

Our distribution centers, which we refer to as operating companies, distribute branded merchandise, as well as products packaged under our private 
brands. Products packaged under our private brands have been manufactured for Sysco according to specifications that have been developed by our 
quality assurance team. In addition, our quality assurance team certifies the manufacturing and processing plants where these products are packaged, 
enforces our quality control standards and identifies supply sources that satisfy our requirements.

We believe that prompt and accurate delivery of orders, competitive pricing, close contact with customers and the ability to provide a full array of products 
and services to assist customers in their foodservice operations are of primary importance in the marketing and distribution of foodservice products to 
our customers. Our operating companies offer daily delivery to certain customer locations and have the capability of delivering special orders on short 
notice. Through the sales and marketing representatives and support staff of Sysco and our operating companies, we stay informed of the needs of our 
customers and acquaint them with new products and services. Our operating companies also provide ancillary services relating to foodservice distribution, 
such as providing customers with product usage reports and other data, menu-planning advice, food safety training and assistance in inventory control, 
as well as access to various third party services designed to add value to our customers’ businesses.

No single customer accounted for 10% or more of Sysco’s total sales for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2017.

We estimate that our sales by type of customer during the past three fiscal years were as follows:

of these types of customers, as a group, exceeded 5% of total sales in any of the years for which information is presented.

Sources of Supply

We purchase from thousands of suppliers, both domestic and international, none of which individually accounts for more than 10% of our purchases. These 
suppliers consist generally of large corporations selling brand name and private label merchandise, as well as independent regional brand and private label 
processors and packers. Purchasing is generally carried out through both centrally developed purchasing programs, domestically and internationally, and 
direct purchasing programs established by our various operating companies.

We administer a consolidated product procurement program designed to develop, obtain and ensure consistent quality food and non-food products. The 
program covers the purchasing and marketing of branded merchandise, as well as products from a number of national brand suppliers, encompassing 
substantially all product lines. Some of our products are purchased internationally within global procurement centers in order to build strategic relationships 
with international suppliers and to optimize our supply chain network. Sysco’s operating companies purchase product from the suppliers participating 
in these consolidated programs and from other suppliers, although Sysco Brand products are only available to the operating companies through these 
consolidated programs. We also focus on increasing profitability by lowering operating costs and by lowering aggregate inventory levels, which reduces 
future facility expansion needs at our Broadline operating companies, while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers.

Working Capital Practices

Our growth is funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, commercial paper issuances and long-term borrowings. See the discussion in 
Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources” regarding our liquidity, 
financial position and sources and uses of funds.

Credit terms we extend to our customers can vary from cash on delivery to 30 days or more based on our assessment of each customer’s credit worthiness. 
We monitor each customer’s account and will suspend shipments if necessary.

A majority of our sales orders are filled within 24 hours of when customer orders are placed. We generally maintain inventory on hand to be able to meet 
customer demand. The level of inventory on hand will vary by product depending on shelf-life, supplier order fulfillment lead times and customer demand. 
We also make purchases of additional volumes of certain products based on supply or pricing opportunities.

We take advantage of suppliers’ cash discounts where appropriate and otherwise generally receive payment terms from our suppliers ranging from weekly 
to 45 days or more.

SYSCO CORPORATION - Form 10-KPArT I
ITEM 1 Business

Corporate Headquarters and Shared Services Center

Our corporate staff makes available a number of services to our operating companies and our shared services center performs support services for 
employees, suppliers and customers. Members of these groups possess experience and expertise in, among other areas, customer and vendor contract 
administration, accounting and finance, treasury, legal, information technology, payroll and employee benefits, risk management and insurance, sales and 
marketing, human resources, strategy, and tax compliance services. The corporate office also makes available warehousing and distribution services, which 
provide assistance in operational best practices including space utilization, energy conservation, fleet management and work flow.

Capital Improvements

During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, approximately $686.4 million, $527.3 million and $542.8 million, respectively, were invested in delivery fleet, facilities, 
technology and other capital asset enhancements. From time to time, we dispose of assets in the normal course of business; we consider proceeds from 
these asset sales to be an offset to capital expenditures. During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets, 
were $662.7 million, $503.8 million and $518.4 million, respectively. Capital expenditures as a percentage of sales during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were 
1.2%, 1.0% and 1.1%, respectively. We estimate our capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets, in fiscal 2018 should be approximately 
1.3% to 1.4% of sales. During the three years ended July 1, 2017, capital expenditures were financed primarily by internally generated funds, our commercial 
paper program and bank and other borrowings. We expect to finance our fiscal 2018 capital expenditures from the same sources.

Employees

As of July 1, 2017, we had approximately 66,500 employees, approximately 15% of whom were represented by unions, primarily the International Brotherhood 
of Teamsters and unions in France and Sweden. Contract negotiations are handled by each individual operating company. Approximately 14% of our union 
employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements have or will have expired contracts during fiscal 2018, which contracts are subject to 
renegotiation. Since July 1, 2017, there have been 3 contract renegotiations. We consider our labor relations to be satisfactory. 

Competition

We believe there are a large number of companies engaged in the distribution of food and non-food products to the foodservice industry in the United States 
(U.S.). Our customers may also choose to purchase products directly from wholesale or retail outlets, including club, cash and carry and grocery stores, online 
retailers, or negotiate prices directly with our suppliers. Online retailers and e-commerce companies are also participants in the foodservice industry. While we 
compete primarily in the U.S. with local and regional distributors, some organizations compete with us on a multi-region basis. In addition, these local, regional 
and multi-regional distributors can create purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups to enhance their competitive abilities by expanding their product mix, 
improving purchasing power and extending their geographic capabilities. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the foodservice industry are effective 
customer contacts, the ability to deliver a wide range of quality products and related services on a timely and dependable basis and competitive prices. Our 
customers are accustomed to purchasing from multiple suppliers and channels concurrently. Product needs, service requirements and price are just a few of 
the factors they evaluate when deciding where to purchase. Customers can choose from many broadline foodservice distributors, specialty distributors that 
focus on specific categories such as produce, meat or seafood, other wholesale channels, club stores, cash and carry stores, grocery stores and numerous 
online retailers. Since switching costs are very low, customers can make supplier and channel changes very quickly. There are few barriers to market entry. 
Existing foodservice competitors can extend their shipping distances and add truck routes and warehouses relatively quickly to serve new markets or customers.

We estimate that we serve about 16% of an approximately $280 billion annual foodservice market in the U.S. based on a measurement as of the end of 
calendar 2016, based on industry data obtained from Technomic, Inc. We also serve certain international geographies that vary in size and amount of market 
share. We believe, based upon industry trade data, that our sales to the U.S. and Canada food-away-from-home industry were the highest of any foodservice 
distributor during fiscal 2017. While comprehensive industry statistics are not available, we believe that, in most instances, our operations in the U.S. and 
Canada are among the leading distributors of food and related non-food products to foodservice customers in those trading areas. We believe our competitive 
advantages include our marketing associates; our diversified product base, which includes quality-assured Sysco brand products; the suite of services we 
provide to our customers such as business reviews and menu analysis; and our multi-regional presence in North America and Europe, which mitigates some 
of the impact of regional economic declines that may occur over time. 

Through our acquisition of the Brakes Group, we are also a large distributor of food and non-food products to the foodservice sector in Europe. Our largest 
businesses in Europe are in the U.K., France, Sweden and Ireland, and we also have a presence in Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg. Foodservice distribution 
is highly competitive in the different European countries. Across Europe, we face competition from other national broadline distributors, as well as a large 
number of regional, local and specialty distributors.

SYSCO CORPORATION - Form 10-KPArT I
ITEM 1 Business

We believe our liquidity and access to capital provides us the ability to continuously invest in business improvements. There are a small number of companies 
competing in the food-away-from-home industry in the U.S. with publicly traded equity. While our public company status provides us with some advantages over 
many of our competitors, including access to capital, we believe it also puts us at a disadvantage, in that most of our competitors do not face the obligations 
and additional costs related to complying with regulatory requirements.

Government regulation

Our company is required to comply, and it is our policy to comply, with all applicable laws in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we 
do business.

In the U.S., as a marketer and distributor of food products, we are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated 
thereunder by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA regulates food safety and quality through various statutory and regulatory mandates, 
including manufacturing and holding requirements for foods through good manufacturing practice regulations, hazard analysis and critical control point 
(HACCP) requirements for certain foods, and the food and color additive approval process. The agency also specifies the standards of identity for certain 
foods, prescribes the format and content of information required to appear on food product labels, regulates food contact packaging and materials, and 
maintains a Reportable Food Registry for the industry to report when there is a reasonable probability that an article of food will cause serious adverse 
health consequences. For certain product lines, we are also subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Perishable 
Agricultural Commodities Act, the Packers and Stockyard Act and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to interpret 
and implement these statutory provisions. The USDA imposes standards for product safety, quality and sanitation through the federal meat and poultry 
inspection program. The USDA reviews and approves the labeling of these products and also establishes standards for the grading and commercial 
acceptance of produce shipments from our suppliers. We are also subject to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response 
Act of 2002, which imposes certain registration and record keeping requirements on facilities that manufacture, process, pack or hold food for human 
or animal consumption.

The recently published and pending rules under the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) will significantly expand our food safety requirements. Among 
other things, FDA regulations implementing the FSMA require us to establish and maintain comprehensive, prevention-based controls across the food 
supply chain that are both verified and validated. The FSMA further imposes new requirements for food products imported into the U.S. and provides 
the FDA with mandatory recall authority. In particular, the final rule on the sanitary transportation of food, which became effective for Sysco in the fourth 
quarter of fiscal 2017, required us to enhance certain of our systems to ensure that we met the rule’s new standards for maintaining the safety of food 
during transportation.

We and our products are also subject to state and local regulation through such measures as the licensing of our facilities; enforcement by state and local 
health agencies of state and local standards for our products; and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products. Our facilities 
are subject to regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act by the U.S. Department of Labor. These regulations require 
us to comply with certain manufacturing, health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents and to establish hazard communication 
programs to transmit information on the hazards of certain chemicals present in products we distribute.

Our processing and distribution facilities must be registered with the FDA biennially and are subject to periodic government agency inspections by the FDA 
and USDA. Our facilities are generally inspected at least annually by federal and/or state authorities. We also must establish communication programs 
to transmit information about the hazards of certain chemicals present in some of the products we distribute.

Our customers include several departments of the federal government, including the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs facilities, 
as well as certain state and local entities. These customer relationships subject us to additional regulations applicable to government contractors.

We are also subject to regulation by numerous federal, state and local regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Labor, 
which sets employment practice standards for workers, and the U.S. Department of Transportation, as well as its agencies, the Surface Transportation 
Board, the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 
which collectively regulate our trucking operations through the regulation of operations, safety, insurance and hazardous materials. We must comply with 
the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing 
and hours-of service. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment also fall under federal and state regulations. In addition, we are subject to the 
U.S. False Claims Act, and similar state statutes, which prohibit the submission of claims for payment to the government that are false and the knowing 
retention of overpayments.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits bribery of public officials to obtain or retain business in foreign jurisdictions. The FCPA also requires 
us to keep accurate books and records and to maintain internal accounting controls to detect and prevent bribery and to ensure that transactions are 
properly authorized. We have implemented and continue to develop a robust anti-corruption compliance program applicable to our global operations to 
detect and prevent bribery and to comply with these and other anti-corruption laws in countries where we operate.

ITEM 1 Business

Our business is subject to competition laws in the various jurisdictions where we operate, including the Sherman Antitrust Act and related federal and 
state antitrust laws in the U.S. These laws and regulations generally prohibit competitors from fixing prices, boycotting competitors, or engaging in other 
conduct that unreasonably restrains competition. In many jurisdictions, compliance with these competition laws is of special importance to us, and our 
operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities, due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions.

Outside the U.S., our business is subject to numerous similar statutes and regulations, as well as other legal and regulatory requirements. For example, 
as a result of our acquisition of the Brakes Group on July 5, 2016, we became subject to legal and regulatory requirements of the principal regions where 
Brakes conducts its business (including in the U.K., Ireland, France and Sweden (the Brakes Principal Regions), as well as those of the European Union, 
which requirements relate to, among other things, competition, product composition, packaging, labeling, advertisement and the safety of food products, 
as well as the health, safety and working conditions of employees. In addition, following the acquisition of the Brakes Group, our business became subject 
to the U.K. Modern Slavery Act 2015, which requires certain companies that operate in the U.K. to prepare a report describing steps taken to ensure 
that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in its supply chain or business, as well as the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, an anti-corruption law that 
restricts the offer or payment of anything of value to both government officials as well as to other non-governmental persons with the intent of gaining 
favorable government action, business or an advantage.

All of our company’s facilities and other operations in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world are subject to various environmental protection statutes 
and regulations, including those in the U.S., the European Union and the Brakes Principal Regions, relating to: (1) the use of water resources and the 
discharge of wastewater; (2) the discharge of pollutants into the air, including vehicle emissions; (3) proper handling, treatment and disposing of solid 
and hazardous wastes; and (4) protecting against and appropriately investigating and remediating spills and releases. Further, most of our distribution 
facilities have ammonia-based refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws 
regulating such systems and storage tanks (including the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination associated with the use of 
underground storage tanks). See “Item1A. Risk Factors - Business and Operational Risks - We may incur significant costs to comply with environmental 
laws and regulations, and we may be subject to substantial fines, penalties, or third-party claims for non-compliance.”

General

We have numerous trademarks that are of significant importance, including the SYSCO® and Brakes® trademarks, in addition to our privately branded 
product trademarks that include these trademarks. These trademarks and the private brands on which they are used are widely recognized within the 
foodservice industry. In North America, approximately half of our privately branded sales are from products labeled with our SYSCO® trademark without any 
other trademark. We believe the loss of the SYSCO® trademark would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In Europe, approximately 
25% of our privately branded European sales are from products labeled with the Brakes® trademark. Both our U.S. and European trademarks are effective 
for a ten-year period and the company generally renews its trademarks before their expiration dates unless a particular trademark is no longer in use. The 
company does not have any material patents or licenses.

We are not engaged in material research and development activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products.

Our sales do not generally fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis; therefore, the business of the company is not deemed to be seasonal.

As of July 1, 2017, we operated 324 distribution facilities throughout North America and Europe. 

ITEM 1A  risk Factors

The following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future 
financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this report. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive, but 
is designed to highlight what we believe are the most significant factors to consider when evaluating our business. These factors could cause our future 
results to differ from our expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements identified within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations,” and from historical trends.

ITEM 1A Risk Factors

Industry and General Economic risks

Periods of significant or prolonged inflation or deflation affect our product costs and may negatively impact our profitability

Volatile food costs have a direct impact on our industry. Periods of significant product cost inflation may have a negative impact on our results of operations 
to the extent that we are unable to pass on all or a portion of such product cost increases to our customers. In addition, periods of rapidly increasing 
inflation may negatively impact our business due to the timing needed to pass on such increases, the impact of such inflation on discretionary spending by 
consumers and our limited ability to increase prices in the current, highly competitive environment. Conversely, our business may be adversely impacted 
by periods of product cost deflation, because we make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell plus a 
percentage margin. As a result, our results of operations may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation, even though our gross profit 
percentage may remain relatively constant.

Unfavorable macroeconomic conditions in the U.S., Canada and Europe, as well as unfavorable conditions in particular 
local markets, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

The foodservice distribution industry, which is characterized by relatively low profit margins with limited demand growth expected in the near-term, is 
especially susceptible to negative trends and economic uncertainty. North America and Europe have each experienced an uneven economic environment 
over the past several years. In addition, our results of operations are substantially affected by regional operating and economic conditions, which can vary 
substantially by market. Economic conditions can affect us in the following ways:

 • Unfavorable conditions can depress sales and/or gross margins in a given market.

 • Food cost and fuel cost inflation experienced by the consumer can lead to reductions in the frequency of dining out and the amount spent by consumers 

for food-away-from-home purchases, which could negatively impact our business by reducing demand for our products.

 • Heightened uncertainty in the financial markets negatively affects consumer confidence and discretionary spending, which can cause disruptions with 

our customers and suppliers.

 • Liquidity issues and the inability of our customers to consistently access credit markets to obtain cash to support their operations can cause temporary 

interruptions in our ability to conduct day-to-day transactions involving the collection of funds from such customers.

 • Liquidity issues and the inability of our suppliers to consistently access credit markets to obtain cash to support their operations can cause temporary 

interruptions in our ability to obtain the foodservice products and supplies needed by us in the quantities and at the prices requested.

We believe that uncertainty in the economic environment over the past several years has adversely affected the rate of improvement in both business and 
consumer confidence and spending, and uncertainty about the long-term investment environment could further depress capital investment and economic 
activity in the future.

Economic and political instability and potential unfavorable changes in laws and regulations resulting from the U.K.’s exit 
from the European Union could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

The U.K.’s anticipated exit from the European Union (the EU) and the resulting significant change to the U.K.’s relationship with the EU and with countries 
outside the EU (and its laws and regulations impacting business conducted between them) could disrupt the overall stability of the U.K. and the EU given 
the diverse economic and political circumstances of the U.K. and individual EU countries and otherwise negatively impact our European operations, 
including the Brakes Group. If changes occur in laws and regulations impacting the flow of goods, services and workers between the U.K. and the EU, 
our European operations could also be negatively impacted. The completion of the U.K.’s exit from the EU could have less severe, but still significant, 
implications. Such exit could adversely affect the value of our euro- and pound-denominated assets and obligations. Exchange rates related to the British 
pound sterling have been more volatile since the U.K. announced it would exit the EU and such volatility may continue in the future. Future fluctuations in 
the exchange rate between the British pound sterling and the local currencies of our suppliers may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold 
in the U.K., which increases we may not be able to pass on to our customers. In addition, the U.K.’s exit from the EU could cause financial and capital 
markets within and outside the EU to constrict, thereby negatively impacting our ability to finance our business, and also could cause a substantial dip in 
consumer confidence and spending that could negatively impact the foodservice distribution industry. Any one of these impacts could have an adverse 
effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Competition in our industry may adversely impact our margins and our ability to retain customers, and makes it 
difficult for us to maintain our market share, growth rate and profitability

The foodservice distribution industry is fragmented and highly competitive, with local, regional, multi-regional distributors and specialty competitors. Local 
and regional companies often align themselves with other smaller distributors through purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups, with the goal of 
enhancing their geographic reach, private label offerings, overall purchasing power, cost efficiencies, and ability to meet customer distribution requirements. 
These suppliers may also rely on local presence as a source of competitive advantage, and they may have lower costs and other competitive advantages 
due to geographic proximity. Furthermore, barriers to entry by new competitors, or geographic or product line expansion by existing competitors, are low. 
Additionally, increased competition from non-traditional sources (such as club stores and commercial wholesale outlets with lower cost structures), cash 
and carry operations and group purchasing organizations have served to further increase pressure on the industry’s profit margins, and continued margin 

7

SYSCO CORPORATION - Form 10-KPArT I
ITEM 1A Risk Factors

pressure within the industry may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We are also experiencing growing competition from online 
direct food wholesalers. Finally, demand for food-away-from-home products is volatile and price sensitive, imposing limits on our customers’ ability to 
absorb cost increases. New and increasing competitive sources may result in increased focus on pricing and on limiting price increases, or may require 
increased discounting or other concessions. Such competition or other industry pressures may result in margin erosion and/or make it difficult for us to 
attract and retain customers.

If we are unable to effectively differentiate ourselves from our competitors, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. In addition, even if we are 
able to effectively differentiate ourselves, we may only be able to do so through increased expenditures or decreased prices, which could also adversely 
impact our results of operations.

We may not be able to fully compensate for increases in fuel costs, and fuel hedging arrangements intended to contain 
fuel costs could result in above market fuel costs

Volatile fuel prices have a direct impact on our industry. We require significant quantities of fuel for our delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risk 
associated with fluctuations in the market price for fuel. The price and supply of fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international, political and economic 
circumstances, as well as other factors outside our control, such as actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and 
other oil and gas producers, regional production patterns, weather conditions and environmental concerns. The cost of fuel affects the price paid by us 
for products, as well as the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers. Although we have been able to pass along a portion of increased fuel 
costs to our customers in the past, there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future. If fuel costs increase in the future, we may experience 
difficulties in passing all or a portion of these costs along to our customers, which may have a negative impact on our results of operations.

We routinely enter into fuel hedging arrangements, including fuel derivatives, to hedge our exposure to volatile fuel prices. There can be no assurance that 
our fuel hedging transactions will be effective to protect us from changes in fuel prices, and if fuel prices decrease significantly, these hedging arrangements 
would result in our paying higher than market costs for a portion of our diesel fuel. In addition, our future use of fuel derivatives would expose us to the risk 
that one of our counterparties fails to perform its obligations, whether due to its insolvency or otherwise, which could result in financial losses.

Business and Operational risks

Conditions beyond our control can interrupt our supplies and increase our product costs

We obtain substantially all of our foodservice and related products from third-party suppliers. Although our purchasing volume can provide benefits when 
dealing with suppliers, suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by us in the quantities and at the prices requested. 
We are also subject to delays caused by interruptions in production and increases in product costs based on conditions outside of our control. These 
conditions include work slowdowns, work interruptions, strikes or other job actions by employees of suppliers, short-term weather conditions or more 
prolonged climate change, crop and other agricultural conditions, water shortages, animal disease outbreaks, transportation interruptions, unavailability of 
fuel or increases in fuel costs, product recalls, competitive demands, terrorist attacks or international hostilities and natural disasters or other catastrophic 
events (including, but not limited to, food-borne illnesses). Further, increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair 
production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. Input costs could increase at any point in time for a large portion 
of the products that we sell for a prolonged period. Our inability to obtain adequate supplies of foodservice and related products as a result of any of the 
foregoing factors or otherwise could mean that we could not fulfill our obligations to customers, and customers may turn to other distributors.

In addition, as a foodservice distributor, it is necessary for us to maintain an inventory of products, and declines in product pricing levels between the 
time we purchase the product from our suppliers and the time we sell the product to our customers could reduce our margin on that inventory, adversely 
affecting our results of operations.

Adverse publicity about us or lack of confidence in our products could negatively impact our reputation and reduce 
earnings

Maintaining a good reputation and public confidence in the safety of the products we distribute is critical to our business. Sysco’s brand names, trademarks 
and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools, and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. Anything that 
damages our reputation or public confidence in our products, whether or not justified, including adverse publicity about the quality, safety, sustainability 
or integrity of our products or relating to illegal or unethical activities by our employees, suppliers or agents, could tarnish our reputation and diminish the 
value of our brand, which could adversely affect our results of operations.

Reports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses (such as e-coli, avian flu, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, hepatitis A, trichinosis, salmonella, 
listeria or swine flu) or injuries caused by food tampering could also severely injure our reputation or negatively impact public confidence in our products. 
If patrons of our restaurant customers become ill from food-borne illnesses, our customers could be forced to temporarily close restaurant locations and 
our sales and profitability would be correspondingly decreased. In addition, instances of food-borne illnesses or food tampering or other health concerns 
(even those unrelated to the use of Sysco products) or public concern regarding the safety of our products, can result in negative publicity about the 
food service distribution industry and cause our results of operations to decrease dramatically.

8

SYSCO CORPORATION - Form 10-KPArT I
ITEM 1A Risk Factors

Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our products and services. This reduction in demand, together with the 
dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation, would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as 
well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand. Our business prospects, financial condition and results 
of operations could be adversely affected if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity, including dissemination via print, 
broadcast or social media, or other forms of Internet-based communications. Adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage 
our reputation and image, undermine our customers’ confidence and reduce short-term or long-term demand for our products and services, even if 
the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of 
operations and financial condition.

Our relationships with long-term customers may be materially diminished or terminated

We have long-standing relationships with a number of our customers, many of whom could unilaterally terminate their relationship with us or materially 
reduce the amount of business they conduct with us at any time. Market competition, customer requirements, customer financial condition and customer 
consolidation through mergers or acquisitions also could adversely affect our ability to continue or expand these relationships. There is no guarantee 
that we will be able to retain or renew existing agreements, maintain relationships with any of our customers on acceptable terms, or at all, or collect 
amounts owed to us from insolvent customers. Our customer agreements are generally terminable upon advance written notice (typically ranging from 
30 days to six months) by either us or the customer, which provides our customers with the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us on less 
favorable terms or to award more business to our competitors. The loss of one or more of our major customers could adversely affect our business, 
financial condition, and results of operations.

Unfavorable changes to the mix of locally managed customers versus multi-unit customers could have a material 
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

Increasing the volume of our sales to locally managed customers is very important for our business and our results of operations. Gross margin from our 
multi-unit customers is generally lower than that of our locally managed customers because we typically sell higher volumes of products to these customers 
and provide a relatively lower level of value-added services than we do to locally managed customers. If sales to our locally managed customers do not 
grow at the same or a greater rate as sales to our multi-unit customers, our operating margins may decline.

Moreover, if sales to our multi-unit customers increase at a faster pace of growth than sales to our locally-managed customers, we will become more 
dependent on multi-unit customers as they begin to represent a greater proportion of our total sales. Additionally, the loss of sales to the larger of these 
multi-unit customers could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, as a result of our greater 
dependence on these customers, we could be pressured by them to lower our prices and/or offer expanded or additional services at the same prices. 
In that event, if we were unable to achieve additional cost savings to offset these price reductions and/or cost increases, our results of operations could 
be materially adversely affected. We may be unable to change our cost structure and pricing practices rapidly enough to successfully compete in such 
an environment.

Changes in consumer eating habits could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of 
operations

Changes in consumer eating habits (such as a decline in consuming food away from home, a decline in portion sizes, or a shift in preferences toward 
restaurants that are not our customers) could reduce demand for our products. Consumer eating habits could be affected by a number of factors, 
including changes in attitudes regarding diet and health or new information regarding the health effects of consuming certain foods. There is a growing 
consumer preference for sustainable, organic and locally grown products, and a shift towards plant-based proteins and/or animal proteins derived from 
animals that were humanely treated and anti-biotic free. Changing consumer eating habits also occur due to generational shifts. Millennials, the largest 
demographic group in terms of spend, seek new and different, as well as more ethnic, menu options and menu innovation. If consumer eating habits 
change significantly, we may be required to modify or discontinue sales of certain items in our product portfolio, and we may experience higher costs 
and/or supply shortages associated with our efforts to accommodate those changes as our suppliers adapt to the new eating preferences. Changing 
consumer eating habits may reduce the frequency with which consumers purchase meals outside of the home. Additionally, changes in consumer eating 
habits may result in the enactment or amendment of laws and regulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our food products, or 
laws and regulations requiring us to disclose the nutritional content of our food products. Compliance with these laws and regulations, as well as others 
regarding the ingredients and nutritional content of our food products, may be costly and time-consuming. We cannot make any assurances regarding 
our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health perceptions or resulting new laws or regulations or to adapt our menu offerings to trends 
in eating habits.

We may not be able to achieve our three-year financial targets by the end of fiscal year 2018

In fiscal 2016, we set new three-year financial targets to grow operating income, accelerate earnings per share growth faster than operating income 
growth and improve return on invested capital. Our ability to meet these financial targets depends largely on our successful execution of our business 
plan including various related initiatives. There are various risks related to these efforts, including the risk that these efforts may not provide the expected 
benefits in our anticipated time frame, if at all, and may prove costlier than expected; and the risk of adverse effects to our business, results of operations 
and liquidity if past and future undertakings, and the associated changes to our business, do not prove to be cost effective or do not result in the cost 

9

SYSCO CORPORATION - Form 10-KPArT I
ITEM 1A Risk Factors

savings and other benefits at the levels that we anticipate. Our intentions and expectations with regard to the execution of our business plan, and the 
timing of any related initiatives, are subject to change at any time based on management’s subjective evaluation of our overall business needs. If we are 
unable to successfully execute our business plan, whether due to our failure to realize the anticipated benefits from our various business initiatives in the 
anticipated time frame or otherwise, we may be unable to achieve our three-year financial targets.

Expanding into international markets and complementary lines of business presents unique challenges, and our 
expansion efforts with respect to international operations and complementary lines of business may not be successful

As demonstrated by our acquisition of the Brakes Group, an element of our strategy includes further expansion of operations into international markets 
and the establishment of international procurement organizations. Our ability to successfully operate in international markets may be adversely affected 
by political, economic and social conditions beyond our control, local laws and customs, and legal and regulatory constraints, including compliance 
with applicable anti-corruption and currency laws and regulations, of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the 
future. Risks inherent in our existing and future international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international 
operations, difficulties in identifying and gaining access to local suppliers, suffering possible adverse tax consequences from changes in tax laws or the 
unfavorable resolution of tax assessments or audits, maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights. Additionally, 
foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations thereof may have an adverse effect on the financial results of our international operations.

Another element of our strategy includes the possibility of expansion into businesses that are closely related or complementary to, but not currently part 
of, our core foodservice distribution business. Our ability to successfully operate in these complementary business markets may be adversely affected 
by legal and regulatory constraints, including compliance with regulatory programs to which we become subject. Risks inherent in branching out into 
such complementary markets also include the costs and difficulties of managing operations outside of our core business, which may require additional 
skills and competencies, as well as difficulties in identifying and gaining access to suppliers or customers in new markets.

We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities

As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. 
Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may 
have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. For example, the U.S. and many countries in the EU where we do business, are actively 
considering or have enacted changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable 
to corporate multinationals. In particular, reforming the taxation of international businesses has been a priority for U.S. politicians, and key members of 
the legislative and executive branches have proposed a wide variety of potential changes, some of which could have a significant adverse impact on our 
effective tax rate. Further, in the ordinary course of a global business, there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax 
determination could change if tax laws or tax rulings were to be modified. We are also subject to non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, 
value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Although we believe that our income 
and non-income based tax estimates are appropriate, there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different 
from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.

If the products distributed by us are alleged to have caused injury or illness, or to have failed to comply with 
governmental regulations, we may need to recall our products and may experience product liability claims

We, like any other foodservice distributor, may be subject to product recalls, including voluntary recalls or withdrawals, if the products we distribute are 
alleged to have caused injury or illness, to have been mislabeled, misbranded, or adulterated or to otherwise have violated applicable governmental 
regulations. We may also choose to voluntarily recall or withdraw products that we determine do not satisfy our quality standards, whether for taste, 
appearance, or otherwise, in order to protect our brand and reputation. Any future product recall or withdrawal that results in substantial and unexpected 
expenditures, destruction of product inventory, damage to our reputation, and/or lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time, 
could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We also face the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by Sysco are alleged to have caused injury or 
illness. We cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a health-related illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims 
or lawsuits relating to such matters. Further, even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any 
assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and 
brand image. With respect to product liability claims, we believe we have sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance. However, this insurance 
may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or, if available, may not be adequate to cover all of our liabilities. We generally seek contractual 
indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying our products, but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited, as a practical 
matter, to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers. If Sysco does not have adequate 
insurance or contractual indemnification available, product liability relating to defective products could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
and financial condition.

ITEM 1A Risk Factors

If we fail to comply with requirements imposed by applicable law or other governmental regulations, we could become 
subject to lawsuits, investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and 
adversely affect our business

We are subject to regulation by various federal, state, provincial, regional and local governments in the countries in which we operate with respect to many 
aspects of our business, such as food safety and sanitation, ethical business practices, transportation, minimum wage, overtime, wage payment, wage 
and hour and employment discrimination, immigration, human health and safety, and due to the services we provide in connection with governmentally 
funded entitlement programs. For a detailed discussion of the laws and regulations to which our business is subject, please refer to “Business - Government 
Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

From time to time, both federal and state governmental agencies have conducted audits of our billing practices as part of investigations of providers of 
services under governmental contracts, or otherwise. We also receive requests for information from governmental agencies in connection with these 
audits. While we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, we cannot represent that we are in full compliance with all applicable laws and 
regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws, regulations or interpretations 
of these laws and regulations.

If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or encounter disagreements with respect to our contracts subject to governmental regulations, 
including those referred to above, we may be subject to investigations, criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, prohibitions on 
exporting, or seizures or debarments from contracting with such government. The cost of compliance or the consequences of non-compliance, including 
debarments, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, governmental units may make changes in the regulatory frameworks 
within which we operate that may require us to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations.

We may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations, and we may be subject to 
substantial fines, penalties or third-party claims for non-compliance

Our operations are subject to various federal, state, provincial, regional and local laws, rules and regulations in the various countries in which we operate 
relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing:

 • the discharge of pollutants into the air, soil, and water;

 • the management and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes;

 • employee exposure to hazards in the workplace; and

 • the investigation and remediation of contamination resulting from releases of petroleum products and other regulated materials.

In the course of our operations, we operate, maintain, and fuel fleet vehicles; store fuel in on-site above and underground storage tanks; operate refrigeration 
systems, and use and dispose of hazardous substances and food wastes. We could incur substantial costs, including fines or penalties and third-party 
claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of any violations of environmental or workplace safety laws and regulations or releases of 
regulated materials into the environment. In addition, we could incur investigation, remediation or other costs related to environmental conditions at our 
currently or formerly owned or operated properties.

For example, most of our distribution facilities have ammonia-based refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum 
products, which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks (including the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater 
contamination associated with the use of underground storage tanks). Certain of these laws and regulations in the European Union and the Brakes 
Principal Regions may impose liability for costs (which could be material) of investigation or remediation of contamination regardless of fault or the legality 
of the original disposal, and even if such contamination was present prior to the commencement of Brakes’ operations at the site and was not caused 
by its activities. In addition, many of our facilities have propane and battery powered forklifts. Proposed or recently enacted legal requirements, such as 
those requiring the phase-out of certain ozone-depleting substances, and proposals for the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, may require us to 
upgrade or replace equipment, or may increase our transportation or other operating costs.

We must finance and integrate acquired businesses effectively

Historically, a portion of our growth has come through acquisitions. If we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully or realize anticipated 
economic, operational and other benefits and synergies in a timely manner, our earnings per share may be materially adversely affected. Integration of 
an acquired business may be more difficult when we acquire a business in a market in which we have limited expertise, or with a culture different from 
Sysco’s. A significant expansion of our business and operations, in terms of geography or magnitude, could strain our administrative and operational 
resources. Significant acquisitions may also require the issuance of material additional amounts of debt or equity, which could materially alter our debt-to-
equity ratio, increase our interest expense and decrease earnings per share, and make it difficult for us to obtain favorable financing for other acquisitions 
or capital investments. In addition, our failure to implement effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures with 
respect to a significant acquired business, such as the Brakes Group, could result in material weaknesses and/or a failure to file our periodic reports 
with the SEC on a timely basis.

ITEM 1A Risk Factors

We need access to borrowed funds to grow, and any default by us under our indebtedness could have a material 
adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity

A substantial part of our growth historically has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion. We anticipate additional acquisitions and capital 
expansion in the future. As a result, our inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict our ability to 
expand. Moreover, any default under the documents governing our indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows, as well as 
the market value of our common stock.

Our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and liquidity position

As described in Note 11, “Debt and Other Financing Arrangements,” as of July 1, 2017, we had approximately $8.2 billion of total indebtedness which 
included a commercial paper program allowing us to issue short-term unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed $2.0 billion; a revolving 
credit facility supporting our U.S. commercial paper program in the amount of $2.0 billion scheduled to expire on November 2, 2021, and various other 
smaller bank facilities. 

Our substantial amount of debt could have important consequences for us, including:

 • limiting our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or other purposes;

 • increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;

 • limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and

 • placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.

Our indebtedness may further increase from time to time for various reasons, including fluctuations in operating results, working capital needs, capital 
expenditures, potential acquisitions, joint ventures and/or share repurchase programs. Our increased level of indebtedness and the ultimate cost of such 
indebtedness could have a negative impact on our liquidity, cost of future debt financing and financial results, and our credit ratings may be adversely 
affected as a result of the incurrence of additional indebtedness. In the future, our cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for payments 
of interest on and principal of our debt, and any alternative financing measures available may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our 
scheduled debt service obligations.

We rely on technology in our business and any cybersecurity incident, other technology disruption or delay in 
implementing new technology could negatively affect our business and our relationships with customers

We use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations, and our ability to serve customers most effectively depends on the reliability of 
our technology systems. We use software and other technology systems, among other things, to generate and select orders, to load and route trucks, 
to make purchases, to manage our warehouses and to monitor and manage our business on a day-to-day basis. We also use mobile devices, social 
networking and other online platforms to connect with our employees, suppliers, business partners and customers. Further, our business involves the 
storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including customers’ and suppliers’ 
personal information, private information about employees, and financial and strategic information about the company and our business partners.

These technology systems and our uses thereof are vulnerable to disruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, power 
outages, systems failures, security breaches, espionage, cyber-attacks, viruses, theft and inadvertent release of information. Any such disruption to these 
software and other technology systems, or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, the failure of these systems to otherwise perform as 
anticipated, or the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, could result in 
business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability and competitive disadvantage, any or 
all of which would potentially adversely affect our customer service, decrease the volume of our business and result in increased costs and lower profits.

Further, as we pursue our strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure, we are also 
expanding and improving our information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. If 
we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks.

While Sysco has invested, and continues to invest, in technology security initiatives and other measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, 
as well as disaster recovery plans, these initiatives and measures may not be entirely effective to insulate us from technology disruption that could result 
in adverse effects on our results of operations. Additionally, information technology systems continue to evolve and, in order to remain competitive, we 
must implement new technologies in a timely and efficient manner. If our competitors implement new technologies more quickly or successfully than we 
do, such competitors may be able to provide lower cost or enhanced services of superior quality compared to those we provide, which could have an 
adverse effect on our results of operations.

We may be required to pay material amounts under multiemployer defined benefit pension plans

We contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering 
union-represented employees. Approximately 13% of our current U.S. employees are participants in such multiemployer plans. In fiscal 2017, our total 
contributions to these plans were approximately $44.6 million and, in May 2017, a Sysco subsidiary voluntarily withdrew from a multiemployer pension 

12

SYSCO CORPORATION - Form 10-KPArT I
ITEM 1A Risk Factors

plan and recorded a $35.6 million withdrawal liability. The costs of providing benefits through such plans have increased in recent years. The amount of 
any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multiemployer plans will depend upon many factors, including the outcome of collective 
bargaining, actions taken by trustees who manage the plans, government regulations, the actual return on assets held in the plans and the potential 
payment of a withdrawal liability if we choose to exit. Based upon the information available to us from plan administrators, we believe that several of these 
multiemployer plans are underfunded. The unfunded liabilities of these plans may result in increased future payments by us and the other participating 
employers. Underfunded multiemployer pension plans may impose a surcharge requiring additional pension contributions. Our risk of such increased 
payments may be greater if any of the participating employers in these underfunded plans withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and is not able to 
contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with its participants in the plan. We could also be treated as partially withdrawing 
from participation in one of these plans if the number of our employees participating in a given plan is reduced to a certain degree over a certain period 
of time. Such reductions in the number of employees participating in these plans could occur as a result of changes in our business operations, such as 
facility closures or consolidations. Based on the latest information available from plan administrators, we estimate our share of the aggregate withdrawal 
liability on the multiemployer plans in which we participate could have been as much as $147.9 million as of July 1, 2017. A significant increase to funding 
requirements could adversely affect the company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Our funding requirements for our company-sponsored qualified pension plan may increase should financial markets 
experience future declines

At the end of fiscal 2012, we decided to freeze future benefit accruals under the company-sponsored qualified pension plan (Retirement Plan) as of 
December 31, 2012 for all U.S. based salaried and non-union hourly employees. Effective January 1, 2013, these employees were eligible for additional 
contributions under an enhanced, defined contribution plan. While these actions will serve to limit future growth in our pension liabilities, we had a sizable 
pension obligation of $4.2 billion as of July 1, 2017; therefore, financial market factors could impact our funding requirements. Although recent pension 
funding relief legislation has served to defer some required funding, additional contributions may be required if our plan is not fully funded when the provisions 
that provided the relief are phased out. See Note 14, “Company-Sponsored Employee Benefit Plans” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 
for a discussion of the funded status of the Retirement Plan.

The amount of our annual contribution to the Retirement Plan is dependent upon, among other things, the returns on the Retirement Plan’s assets and 
discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability. Our Retirement Plan holds investments in both equity and fixed income securities. Fluctuations in asset 
values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase. The projected liability of the Retirement Plan will be impacted 
by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets as these are inputs in determining our minimum funding requirements. 
Specifically, decreases in these interest rates may have an adverse effect on our funding obligations. To the extent financial markets experience future declines 
similar to those experienced in fiscal 2008 through the beginning of fiscal 2010, and/or interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets decline, 
our required contributions may increase for future years as our funded status decreases, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.

Failure to successfully renegotiate union contracts could result in work stoppages

As of July 1, 2017, approximately 9,813 employees at 55 operating companies were members of 53 different local unions associated with the International 
Brotherhood of Teamsters and other labor organizations. Moreover, labor organizing activities could result in additional employees becoming unionized, 
which could increase our labor costs. In fiscal 2018, 12 agreements covering approximately 1,367 employees have expired or will expire. Failure of our 
operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages. Although our operating subsidiaries have not experienced 
any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date, and we believe they have satisfactory relationships with their unions, a work stoppage due to 
failure of multiple operating subsidiaries to renegotiate union contracts could have a material adverse effect on us.

A shortage of qualified labor could negatively affect our business and materially reduce earnings

The future success of our operations, including the achievement of our strategic objectives, depends on our ability to identify, recruit, develop and retain 
qualified and talented individuals, and any shortage of qualified labor could significantly affect our business. Our employee recruitment, development and 
retention efforts may not be successful, resulting in a shortage of qualified individuals in future periods. Any such shortage would decrease Sysco’s ability 
to effectively serve our customers and achieve our strategic objectives. Such a shortage would also likely lead to higher wages for employees and a 
corresponding reduction in our results of operations.

Our authorized preferred stock provides anti-takeover benefits that may not be viewed as beneficial to stockholders

Under our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Sysco’s Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 1,500,000 shares of preferred stock without 
stockholder approval. Issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire Sysco without approval of the Board of Directors, depending 
on the rights and preferences of the stock issued. In addition, if anyone attempts to acquire Sysco without approval of the Board of Directors of Sysco, 
the existence of this undesignated preferred stock could allow the Board of Directors to adopt a shareholder rights plan without obtaining stockholder 
approval, which could result in substantial dilution to a potential acquirer. As a result, hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of Sysco, 
which could otherwise have been financially beneficial to our stockholders, could be deterred.

All other shares were purchased pursuant to the publicly announced program described below.

In June 2015, our Board of Directors approved a program to repurchase, from time to time in the open market, through an accelerated share repurchase 
program or through privately negotiated transactions, shares of the company’s common stock in an amount not to exceed $3.0 billion during the two-year 
period ending July 1, 2017, in addition to amounts normally repurchased to offset benefit plan and stock option dilution. In August 2015, our Board of 
Directors approved the repurchase of up to 20,000,000 shares for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed $800 million. We repurchased all shares 
under the $3.0 billion authorization that expired on July 1, 2017. We also repurchased all $800 million in shares under the August 2015 authorization, which 
expired on August 21, 2017. In February 2017, our Board of Directors approved a separate repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of shares 
of the company’s common stock not to exceed $1.0 billion through the end of fiscal 2019. This share repurchase program was approved using a dollar

ITEM 7  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 

Financial Condition and results of Operations

Our discussion below of our results includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying 
business trends. Other than free cash flow, any non-GAAP financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures and exclude the impact from restructuring 
costs consisting of (1) expenses associated with our revised business technology strategy announced in fiscal 2016, as a result of which we recorded 
accelerated depreciation on our then-existing system and incurred costs to convert to a modernized version of our established platform, (2) professional fees 
related to our three-year strategic plan, (3) restructuring expenses within our Brakes Group operations, and (4) severance charges related to restructuring. 
Our results of operations are also impacted by the following acquisition-related items: (1) intangible amortization expense, (2) transaction costs, and 
(3) integration costs. All acquisition-related costs in fiscal 2017 that have been excluded relate to the Brakes Group acquisition (the Brakes Acquisition). 
Sysco’s results of operations are also impacted by multiemployer pension (MEPP) withdrawal charges. Fiscal 2016 acquisition-related costs, however, 
include (i) Brakes Acquisition related costs, (ii) termination costs in connection with the merger that had been proposed with US Foods, Inc. (US Foods) and 
(iii) financing costs related to the senior notes that were issued in fiscal 2015 to fund the proposed US Foods merger. These senior notes were redeemed 
in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, triggering a redemption loss of $86.5 million, and we incurred interest on these notes through the redemption date. The 
Brakes Acquisition also resulted in non-recurring tax expense in fiscal 2017, primarily from non-deductible transaction costs. Additionally, our results of 
operations were impacted by multiemployer pension plan withdrawal costs in fiscal 2017. These fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 items are collectively referred 
to as “Certain Items,” and they have been excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures. With respect to the adjusted return on invested capital targets, 
our invested capital is adjusted for the accumulation of debt incurred for the Brakes Acquisition that would not have been borrowed absent this acquisition.

Sysco’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to June 30th. This resulted in a 52-week year ending July 1, 2017 for fiscal 2017, a 53-week year ending 
July 2, 2016 for fiscal 2016, and a 52-week year ending June 27, 2015 for fiscal 2015. Because fiscal 2017 contained one fewer week as compared to fiscal 
2016, our Consolidated Results of Operations for fiscal 2017 are not directly comparable to the prior year. Management believes that adjusting the fiscal 
2016 Consolidated Results of Operations for the estimated impact of the additional week provides more comparable financial results on a year-over-year 
basis. Sysco’s results of operations and related metrics within this section will be disclosed on both a 52-week and 53-week basis for fiscal 2017 as 
compared to fiscal 2016. This is calculated by deducting one-fourteenth of the total metric for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.

Any metric within this section referred to as “adjusted” will reflect the applicable impact of both Certain Items and the extra week in fiscal 2016. More 
information on the rationale for the use of these measures and reconciliations to GAAP numbers can be found under “Non-GAAP Reconciliations.”

Overview

Sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers. 
Our primary operations are located in North America and Europe. The company has aggregated certain of its operating segments into three reportable 
segments. “Other” financial information is attributable to the company’s other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative disclosure thresholds.

 • U.S. Foodservice Operations - primarily includes U.S. Broadline, custom-cut meat and seafood companies, FreshPoint (our specialty produce companies) 

and European Imports (a specialty import company);

 • International Foodservice Operations - primarily includes broadline operations in Canada and Europe (including the Brakes Group, which was acquired 

in fiscal 2017), Bahamas, Mexico, Costa Rica and Panama, as well as a company that distributes to international customers;

 • SYGMA - our customized distribution subsidiary; and

 • Other - primarily our hotel supply operations and Sysco Labs, which includes our suite of technology solutions that help support the business needs 

of our customers and provides support for some of our business technology needs.

Broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to both traditional and chain restaurant 
customers, hospitals, schools, hotels, industrial caterers and other venues where foodservice products are served. SYGMA operating companies distribute 
a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to certain chain restaurant customer locations.

We estimate that we serve approximately 16% of the $280 billion annual foodservice market in the United States (U.S.) based on industry data obtained 
from Technomic, Inc. From time to time, Technomic may revise the methodology used to calculate the size of the foodservice market and, as a result, our 
percentage can change not only from our sales results, but also from such revisions. We also serve certain international geographies that vary in size and 
amount of market share.

According to industry sources, the foodservice, or food-away-from-home, market represents approximately 51% of the total dollars spent on food purchases 
made at the consumer level in the U.S. as of the end of calendar 2016. Industry sources estimate the total foodservice market in the U.S. experienced a 
real sales increase of approximately 1.4% in calendar year 2016 and 2.3% in calendar year 2015. Real sales changes do not include the impact of inflation 
or deflation.

Acquisition of Brakes Group

On July 5, 2016, Sysco consummated its acquisition of Cucina Lux Investments Limited (a private company limited by shares organized under the laws of 
England and Wales), a holding company of the Brakes Group, pursuant to an agreement for the sale and purchase of securities in the capital of the Brakes 
Group, dated as of February 19, 2016 (the Purchase Agreement), by and among Sysco, entities affiliated with Bain Capital Investors, LLC, and members 
of management of the Brakes Group. Following the closing of the Brakes Acquisition, the Brakes Group became a wholly owned subsidiary of Sysco.

The Brakes Group is a large European foodservice business, supplying fresh, refrigerated and frozen food products, as well as non-food products and 
supplies, to foodservice customers. The Brakes Group’s largest businesses are in the United Kingdom (U.K.), France, and Sweden, in addition to a presence 
in Ireland, Belgium, Spain, and Luxembourg. The Brakes Acquisition significantly strengthens Sysco’s position as the global leader in selling, marketing and 
distributing food products and offers attractive opportunities for organic growth and future expansion in European markets.

See “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” for an explanation of these non-GAAP financial measures.

The general foodservice market environment since the beginning of fiscal 2017 has reflected a modestly growing U.S. economy, disparate regional economic 
conditions in Canada, and mixed economic backdrops in the U.K., Ireland, France and Sweden. While we continue to transition some large contract 
customers in our U.S. Foodservice Operations, our case growth with local customers in that business segment improved during the second half of the 
year. Favorable consumer confidence throughout much of the U.S. contributed to restaurant check size increases, even though year-over-year traffic trends 
were unfavorable in certain customer segments. Throughout fiscal 2017, we provided our customers with excellent service, delivered case growth through 
a focus on local customers, improved our gross profit dollars and effectively managed overall expenses. These are all important steps towards achieving 
our three-year plan financial objectives. We also completed the Brakes Acquisition, which added positively to our results.

Our sales and gross profit performance can be influenced by multiple factors including price, volume and product mix. The modest level of growth in the 
foodservice market has created additional competitive pricing pressures, which can impact our profitability. The majority of our sales are to locally managed 
customers and multi-unit customers. Our locally managed customers, including independent restaurant customers, comprise a greater percentage of our 
profitability as compared to multi-unit customers. Case growth with our locally managed broadline business is important to drive gross profit dollar growth. 
Our sales to multi-unit customers, including chain restaurants and multi-locational restaurants, also comprise a significant portion of our overall volumes. 
Gross margin on sales to our multi-unit customers is generally lower than on sales to other types of customers due to the higher volumes we sell to these 
customers. In fiscal 2017, we grew our cases with local customers; however, case growth for our multi-unit customers declined due in part to our efforts 
to deliver disciplined, profitable growth. We will continue to focus on local customer growth by providing value through innovative product offerings and 
value-added services, along with improved e-commerce capabilities. We also expect case growth trends for multi-unit customers to begin to improve as 
we progress through fiscal 2018. We offer an assortment of Sysco-branded products that we can differentiate from privately branded products, which 
enables us to achieve higher gross profits. As a result, we focus on sales growth for these products, especially with locally managed customers. Inflation 
is a factor that contributes to the level of sales and gross profit growth and can be a factor that contributes to gross margin pressure. We experienced 
deflation at a rate of 0.6% for fiscal 2017. Deflation in fiscal 2017 occurred primarily in the meat, dairy and produce categories, partially offset by modest 
inflation in other categories. We saw modest overall inflation during the last quarter of the year, driven by poultry, produce, dairy and seafood categories. 
We expect inflation to continue for the balance of calendar 2017. Periods of high inflation, either overall or in certain product categories, can have an 
unfavorable effect on us and our customers, as high food costs can be difficult to pass on to our customers. 

We have experienced higher operating expenses in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, that are attributable to higher case volumes and the addition 
of the Brakes Group. While these costs are increasing, certain of our expenses declined, including fuel costs attributable to lower fuel prices in fiscal 2017, 
as compared to fiscal 2016. We expect operating expenses to increase in fiscal 2018, primarily driven by anticipated growth in case volume. We also 
expect transportation costs to increase due to higher fuel prices. We intend to make increased investments in the sales team, which will drive local case 
growth. We have also incurred Certain Items in fiscal 2017 for restructuring costs, currently consisting of the impact of changes to our business technology 
strategy, restructuring expenses within our Brakes Group operations, professional fees incurred related to our three-year strategic plan, and severance 
charges. Additionally, we incurred costs associated with a withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan in fiscal 2017. 

During the year, Brakes performed reasonably well amidst a challenging environment in the U.K., exceeding our expectations for earnings per share 
accretion by contributing $0.09 per share for fiscal 2017. On an adjusted basis, our Brakes Group operations contributed approximately $0.14 per share 
to our adjusted consolidated earnings per share for fiscal 2017. The Brakes Group is progressing in its supply chain transformational efforts as it moves to 
multi-temperature capability across the U.K. Growth in France remains steady. Additionally we continue to see long term opportunities for growth across 
our new European business. See “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” for an explanation of these non-GAAP financial measures.

Strategy

We are focused on optimizing our core foodservice business through our customer centric strategy with a “One Sysco” approach that is being executed 
at a high level and that positions us to deliver disciplined, profitable and sustainable growth moving forward. We aspire to be the most valued and trusted 
business partner for all of our customers and are committed to delivering on our targeted financial objectives for Sysco’s shareholders. We will continue 

19

SYSCO CORPORATION - Form 10-KPArT II – FINANCIAL INFOrMATION
ITEM 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

to develop and refine current key strategic initiatives, such as category management, revenue management, enhanced customer facing technology and 
multiple productivity improvement measures, in our ongoing effort to create competitive advantage. We will do this by deepening our customer insight 
work, continually enhancing our technology capabilities and by attracting and developing highly capable and increasingly diverse leaders and associates. 
We have identified five components of our strategy to help us achieve our mission and vision as follows:

 • Partnership - Profoundly enrich the experience of doing business with Sysco: Our primary focus is to help our customers succeed. We believe that by 
building on our current competitive advantages, we will be able to further differentiate our offering to customers. Our competitive advantages include 
our marketing associates; our diversified product base, which includes quality-assured Sysco brand products; the suite of services we provide to our 
customers such as business reviews and menu analysis; and our multi-regional presence in North America and Europe. In addition, we have a portfolio 
of businesses spanning broadline, chain restaurant distribution, specialty produce, specialty meat, hotel amenities, specialty import and export which 
serves our customers’ needs across a wide array of business segments. We believe this strategy of enriching the experience of doing business with 
Sysco will increase customer retention and profitably accelerate sales growth with both existing and new customers.

 • Productivity - Continuously improve productivity in all areas of our business: We continually strive to improve productivity and improve cost management. From 
modernizing software systems to leveraging the power of our end-to-end supply chain, we continue to invest in ways to improve our service to our customers.

 • Products - Enhance our portfolio of products and services by initiating a customer-centric innovation program: We continually explore opportunities to 

provide new and improved products, technologies and services to our customers. 

 • People - Leverage talent, structure, and culture to drive performance: Our ability to drive results and grow our business is directly linked to having the 
best talent in the industry. We are committed to the continued enhancement of our talent management programs in terms of how we recruit, select, 
train and develop our associates throughout Sysco, as well as succession planning. Our ultimate objective is to provide all of our associates with an 
inclusive environment and outstanding opportunities for professional growth and career development.

 • Portfolio - Explore, assess and pursue new businesses and markets: This strategy is focused on identifying opportunities to expand within our core 
business, which could include growth in new international markets, and in adjacent areas that complement our core foodservice distribution business. 
As a part of our ongoing strategic analysis, we regularly evaluate business opportunities, including potential acquisitions, joint ventures and sales of 
assets and businesses.

In fiscal 2016, we set three-year financial targets to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2018:

 • Improve adjusted operating income by at least $500 million using fiscal 2015 as the base year. This was subsequently increased to a range of  

$600 million to $650 million;

 • Grow adjusted earnings per share faster than operating income; and

 • Achieve 15% in return on invested capital improvement for existing businesses.

Because our original targets were set without the contemplation of the Brakes Acquisition, our Brakes Group operations are not included in our adjusted 
operating income improvement or earnings per share goals.

The key strategic levers of our three-year plan include delivering accelerated case growth through a focus on local customers, growing gross profit dollars 
and managing overall expenses. Our strategic focus on accelerating growth with local customers utilizes an insights-based, customer-centric approach 
that permeates everything we do. We have improved the capabilities of our sales force through investments made in training, technology and targeted 
specialized resources and, as a result, our marketing associates are spending more time working with our customers on value-added activities and 
consultative services, such as menu analysis, inventory management, and business reviews. These services foster a deeper relationship with our customers 
and further enforces the role that the sales force plays in helping our customers succeed. We have seen improvements in our return on invested capital, 
as net working capital performance continues to improve, driven by improvements in payables, receivables and inventory.

During fiscal 2017, we delivered the following results against these objectives, as compared to fiscal 2016:

 • Total sales grew 9.9%; and increased 1.6% on a comparable 52-week basis and excluding Brakes;

 • Gross profit dollars grew by 16.8% and expanded gross margin by 112 basis points; and adjusted gross profit dollars, on a comparable 52-week basis 

and excluding Brakes, grew by 4.1%, which included gross margin expansion of 43 basis points;

 • Operating expenses grew by 18.3%; and adjusted operating expenses, on a comparable 52-week basis and excluding Brakes, grew by 1.7%;

 • Operating income grew by 11.0%; and adjusted operating income, on a comparable 52-week basis and excluding Brakes, grew by 12.4%; and

 • Diluted earnings per share grew 26.8%; and adjusted diluted earnings per share, on a comparable 52-week basis and excluding Brakes, grew 13.6%.

Over this two-year period since establishing our three-year financial targets, we have grown our operating income by $823.8 million and our adjusted 
operating income by $416.9 million. The difference between our reported amount and adjusted amount includes the impact of the Brakes Acquisition. 
Additionally, our operating income goal was established on an adjusted basis given Certain Item charges that were applicable in fiscal 2015, which were 
primarily due to termination costs in connection with the merger that had been proposed with US Foods and financing costs related to the senior notes 
that were issued in fiscal 2015 to fund the proposed US Foods merger. We expect to continue to drive leverage between gross profit growth and expense 
growth and believe that we will achieve the high end of our $600 million to $650 million adjusted operating income goal.

See “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” for an explanation of these non-GAAP financial measures.

We have aggregated certain of our operating segments into three reportable segments. “Other” financial information is attributable to the company’s other 
operating segments that do not meet the quantitative disclosure thresholds.

 • U.S. Foodservice Operations - primarily includes U.S. Broadline operations, custom-cut meat and seafood companies, FreshPoint (our specialty produce 

companies) and European Imports (a specialty import company);

 • International Foodservice Operations - includes broadline operations in Canada and Europe, including the Brakes Group (which was acquired in fiscal 

2017), Bahamas, Mexico, Costa Rica and Panama, as well as a company that distributes to international customers;

 • SYGMA - our customized distribution subsidiary; and

 • Other - primarily our hotel supply operations and our Sysco Ventures platform, which includes our suite of technology solutions that help support the 

business needs of our customers.

Broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to both traditional and chain restaurant 
customers, hospitals, schools, hotels, industrial caterers and other venues where foodservice products are served. SYGMA operating companies distribute 
a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to certain chain restaurant customer locations.

Management evaluates the performance of each of our operating segments based on its respective operating income results. Corporate expenses generally 
include all expenses of the corporate office and Sysco’s shared services center. These also include all share-based compensation costs. While a segment’s 
operating income may be impacted in the short-term by increases or decreases in gross profits, expenses, or a combination thereof, over the long-term, 
each business segment is expected to increase its operating income at a greater rate than sales growth. This is consistent with our long-term goal of 
leveraging earnings growth at a greater rate than sales growth.

Based on information in Note 21, “Business Segment Information” in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, U.S. Foodservice Operations and International Foodservice 
Operations represented approximately 67.9% and 19.2%, respectively, of Sysco’s overall sales. In fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, U.S. Foodservice Operations 
and International Foodservice Operations collectively represented approximately 91.0% and 7.6%, respectively, of the total segment operating income. This 
illustrates that these segments represent a substantial majority of our total segment results when compared to other reportable segments.

Cost of sales primarily includes our product costs, net of vendor consideration, and includes in-bound freight. Operating expenses include the costs of 
facilities, product handling, delivery, selling and general and administrative activities. Fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross profit; fuel costs 
are reflected within operating expenses.

results of U.S. Foodservice Operations

In fiscal 2017, the U.S. Foodservice Operations operating results represented approximately 67.9% of Sysco’s overall sales and 91.0% of the aggregated 
operating income of Sysco’s reporting segments. There are several factors that contribute to these higher operating results as compared to the other operating 
segments. We have invested substantial amounts in assets, operating methods, technology and management expertise in this segment. The breadth of its 
sales force, geographic reach of its distribution area and its purchasing power enable this segment to generate its relatively stronger results of operations.

Sales were 0.5% lower in fiscal 2017 than in fiscal 2016. The largest driver of the 0.5% decrease was the extra week in fiscal 2016, which we estimate 
contributed 0.8% of the sales decline in fiscal 2017. Case volumes for the company’s U.S. Broadline operations including acquisitions within the last 
12 months declined 1.0% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. We estimate that the extra week contributed 2.0% of the 1.0% case decline. Absent the 
impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016, case volume grew primarily from locally managed customers. Other items impacting the change in sales, but to a 
lesser extent, were pricing management of product cost deflation and product mix.

Operating Income

Operating income increased by 4.3% in fiscal 2017 over fiscal 2016, primarily due to our gross profits growing at a faster pace than operating expenses. 
Higher gross profits were achieved as we managed the deflationary environment in the first part of the year and operating expense increases were limited, 
reflecting favorable expense management. We estimate that the extra week in fiscal 2016 partially offset, by 2.0%, the year-over-year operating income growth.

Gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to effective management of deflation, a more beneficial mix of local 
customer case growth and increased sales of Sysco branded products to local customers. Our case growth for Sysco branded sales to local customers 
increased 62 basis points for fiscal 2017. The change in product costs, an internal measure of inflation or deflation, was estimated as deflation of 0.4% 
during fiscal 2017 for our U.S. Broadline operations. Deflation in fiscal 2017 occurred primarily in the meat, dairy and produce categories, partially offset 
by modest inflation in other categories.

Operating expenses increased in 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to costs associated with multiemployer pension plan withdrawal costs 
in fiscal 2017 and indirect spend. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016, reduced fuel costs and pay-related 
expenses. Indirect spend includes costs such as fleet maintenance and supplies. For our U.S. Broadline operations, our cost per case and adjusted cost 
per case increased $0.02 per case and decreased $0.01 per case, respectively, in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. The decrease on an adjusted 
basis reflects improved productivity in the warehouse and execution of our functional standard organizational design, including a solid territory planning 
effort in sales. The portion of the decrease attributable to lower fuel prices was a $0.02 benefit per case. Additionally, the impact of the extra week in fiscal 
2016 was not large enough to produce a different result on a 52-week basis.

Operating income increased by 11.2% in fiscal 2016 over fiscal 2015, primarily due to the extra week in fiscal 2016 and higher gross profits, partially offset 
by higher operating expenses attributable to higher case volumes. We estimate that the extra week contributed 2.3% of the 11.2% operating income 
growth. Our gross profit grew at a faster pace than operating expenses, reflecting favorable expense management.

Gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the extra week in fiscal 2016, sales volumes, including a more 
beneficial mix of local customer case growth, higher sales of Sysco branded products to local customers, benefits of category management and revenue 
management and effective management of deflation. Our focus on center of plate categories, such as beef, pork and poultry, and our emphasis on fresh 
produce helped drive gross profit growth. Our case growth for Sysco brand sales to local customers increased 82 basis points for fiscal 2016. The change in 
product costs, an internal measure of inflation or deflation, was estimated as deflation of 0.9% during fiscal 2016 for our U.S. Broadline operations. Deflation 
in fiscal 2016 occurred primarily in the meat, seafood, dairy and poultry categories for both periods, partially offset by modest inflation in other categories.

Operating expenses increased in 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to the extra week in fiscal 2016 and expenses attributable to higher case 
volumes. These increases were partially offset by reduced indirect spend and fuel costs and administrative expense. Indirect spend includes costs such 
as fleet maintenance and supplies. For our U.S. Broadline operations, our cost per case and adjusted cost per case decreased $0.04 per case in fiscal 
2016 as compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2015. The decrease reflects progress in productivity improvements and cost reductions in our 
supply chain including reduced fuel costs and indirect spend. The decrease attributable to lower fuel prices was a $0.04 benefit per case. Adjustments to 
operating expenses were not large enough to produce a different result on an adjusted cost per case basis for fiscal 2016. Additionally, the impact of the 
extra week in fiscal 2016 was not large enough to produce a different result on a 52-week basis.

results of International Foodservice Operations

In fiscal 2017, the International Foodservice Operations operating results represented approximately 19.2% of Sysco’s overall sales and 7.6% of the 
aggregated operating income of Sysco’s segments, which excludes corporate expenses and adjustments.

Sales were 95.2% higher in fiscal 2017 than in fiscal 2016. The increase for fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the acquisition of the Brakes Group, which 
added $5.2 billion during the year. The increase was partially offset by the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016, a small decline in case volume, primarily 
in Canada, and unfavorable changes in exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into U.S. dollars. We had a modest decrease in sales in Canada 
due to softer market conditions.

Sales were 2.8% lower in fiscal 2016 than in fiscal 2015. The decrease for fiscal 2016 was primarily due to unfavorable changes in exchange rates used 
to translate our foreign sales into U.S. dollars, partially offset by the extra week within fiscal 2016. The consolidation of our joint venture in Mexico in the 
last half of fiscal 2016 also partially offset lower sales.

Operating Income

Operating income increased by 37.2% in fiscal 2017 from fiscal 2016, primarily attributable to the Brakes Acquisition. The Brakes Group is progressing in 
its supply chain transformational efforts as it moves to multi-temperature capability across the U.K. Growth in France remains steady. Excluding the Brakes 
Group, non-GAAP operating income, adjusted for the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016, increased 11.7% in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, 
primarily from managing costs effectively in Canada within a deflationary and somewhat softer market environment. Our joint venture in Costa Rica also 
experienced improved operating income performance. 

Gross profit dollars increased $1.3 billion in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to the Brakes Acquisition. Adjusted gross profit dollars, 
excluding the impact of Brakes and on a comparable 52 week basis, increased 2.4%. Adjusted gross profit dollar growth was higher due to improved sales 
execution and implementation of our customer focused initiatives, such as category management and revenue management in our Canadian operations.

Operating expenses increased $1.3 billion in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, largely due to the Brakes Acquisition. Adjusted operating expenses 
excluding Brakes were flat in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, as a result of our effectively managing costs by streamlining administrative expenses 
to improve productivity in the Canadian business.

SYSCO CORPORATION - Form 10-KPArT II – FINANCIAL INFOrMATION
ITEM 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Operating income increased by 3.7% in fiscal 2016 from fiscal 2015, primarily driven by improved operating performance, in addition to the impact of the 
extra week in fiscal 2016. 

Gross profit dollars decreased 3.1%, while operating expenses decreased 4.6% in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. Gross profit dollar growth 
was higher due to stronger relative mix of sales for our locally managed customers and case growth primarily in our Canadian operations; however, these 
improvements were more than offset by unfavorable changes in exchange rates used to translate our gross profit into U.S. dollars.

Operating expenses decreased in fiscal 2016 largely due to reduced general and administrative costs in our Canadian operations, in addition to the favorable 
impact of changes in exchange rates used to translate our operating expenses into U.S. dollars.

results of SYGMA and Other Segment

SYGMA operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to certain chain restaurant customer locations.

Sales

Sales were 1.3% higher in fiscal 2017 than in fiscal 2016. The increase for fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to case growth. Case growth was primarily 
the result of increased volume from existing customers, with additional new business also contributing to such growth.

Sales were 0.4% higher in fiscal 2016 than in fiscal 2015. The increase for fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the extra week within fiscal 2016, organic 
customer growth and the addition of new customers. Partially offsetting these increases were lost and strategically resigned business, product cost deflation 
and lower fuel surcharges. 

Operating Income

Operating income decreased by 15.2% in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily driven by operating expense growth exceeding gross profit 
dollar growth. Gross profit dollars increased 3.3%, while operating expenses increased 4.5% in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. Gross profit dollar 
growth was lower due to higher product margins. Operating expenses increased in fiscal 2017 largely due to higher pay-related expenses.

Operating income increased by 34.8% in fiscal 2016 from fiscal 2015, primarily driven by improved operating performance in addition to the impact of the 
extra week in fiscal 2016. Gross profit dollars decreased 3.2%, while operating expenses decreased 4.9% in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. Gross 
profit dollar growth was lower due to lower product margins and reduced fuel surcharges. Operating expenses decreased in fiscal 2016 largely due to 
reduced transportation costs reflecting improved retention of drivers and lower fuel costs. Both transportation and warehouse costs, including pay-related 
expenses, improved from improved expense management and improved productivity.

“Other” segment information is attributable to the company’s other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative disclosure thresholds, primarily 
including our hotel supply operations and Sysco Labs, which includes our suite of technology solutions that help support the business needs of our 
customers and provides support for some of our business technology needs.

Operating income decreased 37.8%, or $12.3 million, in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to the extra week 
applicable to fiscal 2016, partially offset by favorable results from our hotel supply operations.

Operating income increased 22.5%, or $6.0 million, in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to the extra week 
applicable to fiscal 2016 and favorable results from our hotel supply operations.

Corporate Expenses

Corporate expenses in fiscal 2017 decreased $33.5 million, or 2.9%, as compared to fiscal 2016, due primarily to lower pay-related expenses, partially 
offset by an increase in our estimates for our reserves for our self-insurance program (which covers portions of workers’ compensation, general and vehicle 
liability), resulting from wage increases and unfavorable claims developments.

Included in corporate expenses are Certain Items that totaled $159.2 million in fiscal 2017, as compared to $146.2 million in fiscal 2016. Certain Items 
impacting fiscal 2017 were primarily expenses associated with our revised business technology strategy announced in fiscal 2016, as a result of which 
we recorded accelerated depreciation on our existing system and incurred expenses of $111.3 million in fiscal 2017 to convert to a modernized version 
of our established platform. We incurred $48.0 million in expenses in fiscal 2017 related to Brakes Acquisition transaction costs, project costs to convert 
to a modernized version of our established platform in conjunction with our revised business technology strategy, professional fees on 3-year financial 
objectives, and severance charges. 

26

SYSCO CORPORATION - Form 10-KPArT II – FINANCIAL INFOrMATION
ITEM 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Corporate expenses in fiscal 2016 decreased $323.1 million or 21.8%, as compared to fiscal 2015, due primarily to the decrease in Certain Items. Certain 
Items for fiscal 2016 primarily related to costs associated with our revised business technology strategy, Brakes Acquisition transaction costs, professional 
fees on our three-year financial objectives and severance charges. Certain Items for fiscal 2015 consisted of $554.7 million related to integration planning 
and transaction costs incurred in conjunction with the merger that had been proposed with US Foods, including termination costs.

Interest Expense

Interest expense decreased $3.3 million for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016 due to Certain Item interest costs specific to fiscal 2016, partially offset 
by higher relative debt levels in fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2016 included a loss of $86.5 million in connection with the redemption of the notes issued in fiscal 
2015 to fund the merger that was proposed with US Foods. These items, along with interest expense incurred in fiscal 2016 through the date the senior 
notes were redeemed and interest cost incurred from financing the Brakes Acquisition, are included in our Certain Items. Excluding Certain Items, our 
interest expense increased $120.7 million for fiscal 2017 from fiscal 2016 due to higher debt balances from senior notes that were issued in fiscal 2016 
and commercial paper borrowings issued in fiscal 2017.

Interest expense increased $51.3 million for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to the redemption of the senior notes issued in fiscal 
2015 to fund the merger that had been proposed with US Foods. These senior notes were redeemed in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and triggered a 
redemption loss of $86.5 million. This increase was partially offset by lower average debt levels in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. We incurred 
interest costs from financing the Brakes Acquisition in the last half of fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2015, we incurred interest costs related to the proposed merger 
with US Foods. Interest costs related to these proposed acquisitions, as well as the redemption costs noted above are considered Certain Items. Our 
interest expense, excluding Certain Items, increased $61.8 million as compared to fiscal 2015, due to higher borrowing levels from senior notes that were 
issued in fiscal 2016 primarily for our accelerated share repurchase program.

Net Earnings

Net earnings increased 20.3% in fiscal 2017 as compared to the prior year due primarily to the items noted above, as well as items impacting our income 
taxes that are discussed in Note 19, “Income Taxes.” Adjusted net earnings increased 11.9% in fiscal 2017, primarily due to strong local case growth, 
gross profit growth with margin expansion, strong expense management and the results of the Brakes Group, partially offset by increased interest expense, 
which resulted in earnings growth that was lower than our operating income growth. Adjusted net earnings, on a comparable 52-week basis and excluding 
Brakes, increased 8.0% in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.

Net earnings increased 38.3% in fiscal 2016 from fiscal 2015 due primarily to the items noted above and the beneficial impact from the favorable resolution 
of tax contingencies. Items impacting our income taxes from effective tax rates are discussed in Note 19, “Income Taxes.” Adjusted net earnings increased 
8.0% in fiscal 2016 primarily from gross profit growth, strong expense management and the favorable resolutions of tax contingencies. An additional 
unfavorable impact on our net earnings and adjusted net earnings resulted from the strengthening U.S. dollar, which reduced both amounts by $11.5 
million for fiscal 2016 as we converted foreign earnings to U.S. dollars.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share in fiscal 2017 were $2.10, a 26.5% increase from the comparable prior year amount of $1.66 per share. Diluted earnings per 
share in fiscal 2017 were $2.08, a 26.8% increase from the fiscal 2016 amount of $1.64 per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2017 
were $2.48, an 18.1% increase from the fiscal 2016 amount of $2.10 per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, on a comparable 52-week basis and 
excluding Brakes, were $2.34, a 13.6% increase from the fiscal 2016 amount of $2.06 per share. These results were primarily attributable to the factors 
discussed above related to net earnings and a decrease in outstanding shares that resulted from our share repurchases in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016.

Basic earnings per share in fiscal 2016 were $1.66, a 43.1% increase from the fiscal 2015 amount of $1.16 per share. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 
2016 were $1.64, a 42.6% increase from the fiscal 2015 amount of $1.15. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2016 were $2.06, a 12.0% increase 
from the fiscal 2015 amount of $1.84. These results were primarily due to the factors discussed above related to net earnings and a decrease in outstanding 
shares that resulted from our accelerated share repurchase program.

Non-GAAP reconciliations

Sysco’s consolidated results of operations are impacted by restructuring costs consisting of (1) expenses associated with our revised business technology 
strategy announced in fiscal 2016, as a result of which we recorded accelerated depreciation on our prior ERP system and incurred costs to convert to a 
modernized version of our established platform, (2) professional fees related to our three-year strategic plan, (3) restructuring expenses within our Brakes 
Group operations, and (4) severance charges related to restructuring. Our results of operations are also impacted by the following acquisition-related items: 
(1) intangible amortization expense, (2) transaction costs, and (3) integration costs. All acquisition-related costs in fiscal 2017 that have been excluded relate 

27

SYSCO CORPORATION - Form 10-KPArT II – FINANCIAL INFOrMATION
ITEM 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

to the Brakes Acquisition. Additionally, our results of operations were impacted by multiemployer pension plan withdrawal costs in fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2016 
acquisition-related costs, however, include (i) Brakes Acquisition related costs, (ii) termination costs in connection with the merger that had been proposed 
with US Foods, Inc. (US Foods) and (iii) financing costs related to the senior notes that were issued in fiscal 2015 to fund the proposed US Foods merger. 
These senior notes were redeemed in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, triggering a redemption loss of $86.5 million, and we incurred interest on these notes 
through the redemption date. The Brakes Acquisition also resulted in non-recurring tax expense in fiscal 2017, primarily from non-deductible transaction 
costs. These fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 items are collectively referred to as “Certain Items.”

Management believes that adjusting its operating expenses, operating income, operating margin as a percentage of sales, interest expense, net earnings 
and diluted earnings per share to remove these Certain Items provides an important perspective with respect to our underlying business trends and results 
and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that (1) is indicative of the performance of the company’s underlying 
operations and facilitates comparisons on a year-over-year basis and (2) removes those items that are difficult to predict and are often unanticipated, and 
which as a result, are difficult to include in analysts’ financial models and our investors’ expectations with any degree of specificity. Sysco’s fiscal year ends 
on the Saturday nearest to June 30th. This resulted in a 52-week year ending June 27, 2017 for fiscal 2017 and a 53-week year ending July 2, 2016 for 
fiscal 2016. Because the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 contained an additional week as compared to fiscal 2017, our Consolidated Results of Operations 
for fiscal 2017, and any related case growth metrics, are not directly comparable to the prior year. Management believes that adjusting the fiscal 2016 
results for the estimated impact of the additional week provides more comparable financial results on a year-over-year basis. As a result, the case growth 
and operating metrics for fiscal 2017 presented in the tables below reflect a comparison to fiscal 2016 as adjusted by one-fourteenth of the total metric 
for the fourth quarter. Failure to make these adjustments causes the year-over-year changes in these metrics to be understated.

Although Sysco has a history of growth through acquisitions, the Brakes Group is significantly larger than the companies historically acquired by Sysco, 
with a proportionately greater impact on Sysco’s consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, Sysco is also excluding from certain of its non-GAAP 
financial measures for the relevant periods, solely those acquisition costs specific to the Brakes Acquisition. We believe this approach significantly enhances 
the comparability of Sysco’s adjusted results for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015. As the Brakes Acquisition took place at the beginning of fiscal 2017, and 
given the significance of the Brakes Acquisition, management believes that presenting Sysco’s adjusted financial measures, excluding the Brakes Group 
operating results (including, for this purpose, Brakes Group financing costs, which are not included in the Brakes Group GAAP operating results and are 
also not Certain Items), enhances comparability of the period over period financial performance of Sysco’s legacy business and allows investors to more 
effectively measure Sysco’s progress against the financial goals under Sysco’s three-year strategic plan.

Sysco’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to June 30th. This resulted in a 52-week year ending July 1, 2017 for fiscal 2017 and a 53-week year 
ending July 2, 2016 for fiscal 2016. Because the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 contained an additional week as compared to fiscal 2017, our consolidated 
results of operations for fiscal 2017 are not directly comparable to the prior year. Management believes that adjusting the fiscal 2016 consolidated results 
of operations for the estimated impact of the additional week provides more comparable financial results on a year-over-year basis. As a result, the metrics 
from the consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2016 presented in the table below are adjusted by one-fourteenth of the total metric for the fourth 
quarter. Failure to make these adjustments causes the year-over-year changes in certain metrics such as sales, operating expenses, operating income, 
net earnings and diluted earnings per share to be understated, whereas in certain cases, a metric may actually have increased on a more comparable 
year-over-year basis.

The company uses these non-GAAP measures when evaluating its financial results, as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes. These 
financial measures should not be used as a substitute for GAAP measures in assessing the company’s results of operations for periods presented. An 
analysis of any non-GAAP financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. As a result, in the table below, 
each period presented is adjusted for the impact described above. In the table below, individual components of diluted earnings per share may not add to 
the total presented due to rounding. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated using adjusted net earnings divided by diluted shares outstanding.

(2)  Fiscal 2017 includes $76 million related to intangible amortization expense from the Brakes Acquisition, which is included in the results of Brakes and $24 million in transaction costs. Fiscal 

2016 includes US Foods merger termination costs.
Includes Brakes Acquisition restructuring charges.
Individual components of diluted earnings per share may not add to the total presented due to rounding. Total diluted earnings per share is calculated using adjusted net earnings divided by 
diluted shares outstanding.

(3) 
(4) 

(5)  The tax impact of adjustments for Certain Items are calculated by multiplying the pretax impact of each Certain Item by the statutory rates in effect for each jurisdiction where the Certain Item 

was incurred. The adjustments also include $7 million in non-deductible transaction costs and $4 million in other one-time costs related to the Brakes Acquisition.

(6)  Sysco Corporation issued debt to fund the Acquisition. The interest expense arising from the debt issued is attributed to the incremental impact of Brakes operating results, even though it is not 

a direct obligation of the Brakes Group and is not considered a Certain Item.

NM represents that the percentage change is not meaningful.

Case Growth

Case growth is impacted by the extra week in fiscal 2016. This amount is adjusted out of case growth measures to remove the extra week for comparability 
purposes for the same underlying reasons the extra week is excluded from the measures presented above. The table that follows provides a reconciliation 
of case growth to remove the impact of the extra week.

Cost per case is an important metric management uses to measure our expense performance. This metric is calculated by dividing the total operating expense of our 
U.S. Broadline companies by the number of cases sold. Adjusted cost per case is calculated similarly; however, the operating expense component excludes Certain 
Items applicable to these companies, prior to dividing by the number of cases sold. In fiscal 2017, the U.S. Broadline operations represented approximately 92% of 
the U.S. Foodservice Operations segment’s sales and nearly 84% of its operating expenses. We seek to grow our sales and reduce our costs on a per-case basis.

In the table that follows, the change in adjusted cost per case is reconciled to costs per case for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016.

Sysco management considers adjusted ROIC to be a measure that provides useful information to management and investors in evaluating the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the company’s long-term capital investments. In addition, we have targets and expectations that are based on adjusted results, including 
an adjusted ROIC target of 15%. We cannot predict with certainty when we will achieve these results or whether the calculation of our ROIC in such future 
period will be on an adjusted basis due to the effect of Certain Items, which would be excluded from such calculation. Due to these uncertainties, to the 
extent our future calculation of ROIC is on an adjusted basis excluding Certain Items, we cannot provide a quantitative reconciliation of this non-GAAP 
measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure without unreasonable effort. However, we would expect to calculate adjusted ROIC, if applicable, 
in the same manner as we have calculated this historically. All components of our adjusted ROIC calculation would be impacted by Certain Items. We 
calculate adjusted ROIC as adjusted net earnings divided by (i) stockholders’ equity, computed as the average of adjusted stockholders’ equity at the 
beginning of the year and at the end of each fiscal quarter during the year; and (ii) long-term debt, computed as the average of the long-term debt at the 
beginning of the year and at the end of each fiscal quarter during the year.

Form of calculation:
Net earnings (GAAP)
Impact of Certain Items on net earnings
Adjusted net earnings (Non-GAAP)
Invested Capital (GAAP)
Adjustments to invested capital
Adjusted Invested capital (GAAP)
Return on investment capital (GAAP)
Return on investment capital (Non-GAAP)

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Highlights

Comparisons of the cash flows from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2016:

 • Cash flows from operations were $2.2 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to $1.9 billion in fiscal 2016;

 • Net capital expenditures totaled $662.7 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $503.8 million in fiscal 2016;

 • Free cash flow was $1.5 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2016 (see “Non-GAAP reconciliation” below under the heading “Free 

Cash Flow”);

 • Cash used for acquisition of businesses was $2.9 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to $219.2 million in fiscal 2016;

 • There were $119.7 million of net bank borrowings in fiscal 2017 compared to no net bank borrowings in fiscal 2016;

 • Dividends paid were $698.6 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $698.9 million in fiscal 2016; and

 • We repurchased $1.9 billion of shares in each of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016.

In addition, for our senior notes:

 • We issued an aggregate of $750.0 million and $5.1 billion in new senior notes in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively; and

 • We redeemed senior notes in the amount of $5.1 billion in fiscal 2016, using cash on hand and proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper 

program.

Sources and Uses of Cash

Sysco’s strategic objectives include continuous investment in our business; these investments are funded by a combination of cash from operations and access 
to capital from financial markets. Our operations historically have produced significant cash flow. Cash generated from operations is generally allocated to:

 • working capital requirements;

 • investments in facilities, systems, fleet, other equipment and technology;

 • return of capital to shareholders, including cash dividends and share repurchases;

 • acquisitions compatible with our overall growth strategy;

 • contributions to our various retirement plans; and

 • debt repayments.

Any remaining cash generated from operations may be invested in high-quality, short-term instruments. As a part of our ongoing strategic analysis, 
we regularly evaluate business opportunities, including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses, and our overall capital structure. Any 
transactions resulting from these evaluations may materially impact our liquidity, borrowing capacity, leverage ratios and capital availability.

We continue to generate substantial cash flows from operations and remain in a strong financial position; however, our liquidity and capital resources can 
be influenced by economic trends and conditions that impact our results of operations. We believe our mechanisms to manage working capital, such 
as credit monitoring, optimizing inventory levels and maximizing payment terms with vendors, and our mechanisms to manage the items impacting our 
gross profits have been sufficient to limit a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations. We believe these mechanisms will continue 
to prevent a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations. Seasonal trends also impact our cash flows from operations and free cash 
flow, as we use more cash earlier in the fiscal year and then see larger, sequential quarterly increases throughout the remainder of the year. As of July 1, 
2017, we had $869.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, approximately 79.0% of which was held by our international subsidiaries generated from 
our earnings of international operations. If these earnings were transferred among countries or repatriated to the U.S., such amounts may be subject to 
additional tax obligations; however, we do not currently anticipate the need to repatriate this cash.

We believe the following sources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months, while maintaining sufficient liquidity 
for normal operating purposes:

 • our cash flows from operations;

 • the availability of additional capital under our existing commercial paper programs, supported by our revolving credit facility and bank line of credit; and

 • our ability to access capital from financial markets, including issuances of debt securities, either privately or under our shelf registration statement filed 

with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Due to our strong financial position, we believe that we will continue to be able to effectively access the commercial paper market and long-term capital 
markets, if necessary.

Cash Flows

Operating Activities

Fiscal 2017 vs. Fiscal 2016

We generated $2.2 billion in cash flows from operations in fiscal 2017 compared to cash flow generation of $1.9 billion in fiscal 2016. This increase of 
$243.3 million year-over-year was largely attributable to higher operating results, improved working capital management and a favorable comparison on 
accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities. These were partially offset by an unfavorable comparison on accrued income taxes and deferred income 
taxes. The cash impact of our Certain Items decreased $193.9 million year-over-year. The cash impact of Certain Items will differ from the earnings impact 
of Certain Items, as the payments for these items may occur in a different period from the period in which the Certain Item charges were recognized in the 
Statement of Consolidated Results of Operations. 

The statement of cash flows included within this annual report reflects the correction of misclassifications from the statement of cash flows included in 
the earnings release furnished with our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 14, 2017. Specifically, in comparing the cash flow statement to the 
unaudited statement provided in our Form 8-K filed on August 14, 2017, “Net cash provided by operating activities” decreased by $65.5 million, “Net cash 
used in financing activities” increased $13.4 million and “Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents” decreased by $78.9 million. Additionally, 
a reclassification between goodwill, intangible assets and deferred taxes was made in the fiscal 2017 consolidated balance sheet. Goodwill increased by 
$26.4 million, intangible assets decreased by $31.8 million and deferred tax liabilities decreased by $5.3 million.

Changes in working capital, specifically accounts receivable and accounts payable, had a positive impact of $166.1 million on the period over period 
comparison of cash flow from operations, primarily from improvements in accounts payable management. This was partially offset by inventory. Sales 
growth impacted all components of working capital; however, deflation contributed to lower levels of increase in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. 

Included in the change in other long-term liabilities was a positive comparison primarily from pension contributions. Pension contributions were $57.6 million 
in fiscal 2017, including a $25.0 million contribution to our U.S. Retirement Plan in fiscal 2017, which resulted in a decrease to other long-term liabilities. 
Pension Contributions were $157.5 million in fiscal 2016, including a $130 million contribution to our Retirement Plan in fiscal 2016, which resulted in a 
decrease to other long-term liabilities. The level and timing of the contribution to our Retirement Plan in fiscal 2018 is still being determined. 

The positive comparison on accrued expenses was primarily due to $312.5 million in US Foods merger termination fees that were paid in fiscal 2016, 
partially offset by a $70.2 million decrease from incentive payments. Our annual incentive payments, for performance in the prior fiscal year, are paid in 
the first quarter of each succeeding fiscal year. Incentive payments paid in fiscal 2017 were higher than amounts paid in fiscal 2016 due to larger payouts 
achieved from fiscal 2016 performance.

Our tax payments in fiscal 2016 were lower than in fiscal 2017 due to changes in tax elections allowing us to accelerate tax deductions from method changes 
which, in turn, significantly reduced our estimated payments in fiscal 2016 by delaying the timing of these payments to future periods. Additionally, Sysco’s 
fourth quarter U.S. estimated federal tax payment for fiscal 2016 was deferred to the second quarter of fiscal 2017 due to a disaster area designation 
for companies located in the Houston area, the location of our corporate headquarters. We made tax payments of approximately $761.4 million in fiscal 
2017, including an approximate $120 million for the deferred tax payment from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. We expect future tax payments to grow 
with our earnings.

Fiscal 2016 vs. Fiscal 2015

We generated $1.9 billion in cash flows from operations in fiscal 2016 compared to cash flow generation of $1.6 billion in fiscal 2015. This increase of 
377.7 million year-over-year was largely attributable to tax payments deferred to future periods and improved working capital management, partially offset by 
an unfavorable comparison on accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities. The cash impact of our Certain Items increased $48.9 million year-over-year. 
The cash impact of Certain Items will differ from the earnings impact of Certain Items, as the payments for these items may occur in a different period from 
the period in which the Certain Item charges were recognized in the Statement of Consolidated Results of Operations. The extra week in fiscal 2016 also 
contributed to the increase in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.

Our tax payments in fiscal 2016 were lower than in fiscal 2015 due to changes in tax elections allowing us to accelerate tax deductions from method changes 
which, in turn, significantly reduced our estimated payments in fiscal 2016 by delaying the timing of these payments to future periods. Additionally, Sysco’s 
fourth quarter U.S. estimated federal tax payment was deferred to the second quarter of fiscal 2017 due to a disaster area designation for companies 
located in the Houston area, the location of our corporate headquarters.

The negative comparison on accrued expenses was primarily due to $312.5 million in US Foods merger termination payments and a $47.1 million decrease 
from incentive payments. Our annual incentive payments, for performance in the prior fiscal year, are paid in the first quarter of each succeeding fiscal year. 
Incentive payments paid in fiscal 2015 were lower than amounts paid in fiscal 2016 due to lower payouts achieved from fiscal 2014 performance. Also 
contributing to the negative comparison was lower payroll accruals due to timing and reduced accrued interest due to differing debt levels and interest 
payment dates.

SYSCO CORPORATION - Form 10-KPART II – FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Item 7 management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Included in the change in other long-term liabilities was a negative comparison primarily from pension contributions of $153.4 million. Pension contributions 
were $157.5 million in fiscal 2016, including a $130 million contribution to our Retirement Plan in fiscal 2016, which resulted in a decrease to other long-
term liabilities. Of this $130 million amount, $100 million represented funding that the company would have made in fiscal 2017, but chose to fund in the 
fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Pension Contributions were $75.1 million in fiscal 2015, including a $50 million contribution to our Retirement Plan in fiscal 
2015, which resulted in a decrease to other long-term liabilities.

Changes in working capital, specifically accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable, had a positive impact of $127.9 million on the period over 
period comparison of cash flow from operations primarily from improvements in inventory management. Sales growth impacted all components of working 
capital; however, deflation contributed to lower levels of increase in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. Additionally, favorable turnover drove positive 
comparisons on inventories.

Investing Activities

Fiscal 2017 capital expenditures included:

 • fleet replacements;

 • investments in technology;

 • replacement or significant expansion of facilities in Costa Rica, Georgia, Missouri, Maryland, and Texas; and

 • warehouse equipment.

Fiscal 2016 capital expenditures included:

 • fleet replacements;

 • investments in technology;

 • replacement or significant expansion of facilities in California, Maryland, Texas, and Virginia; and

 • construction of fold-out facilities in Ireland and Texas.

Fiscal 2015 capital expenditures included:

 • fleet replacements;

 • investments in technology;

 • replacement or significant expansion of facilities in Arizona, California, Iowa and Virginia; and

 • construction of fold-out facilities in Ireland.

The level of capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 increased $159.0 million as compared to fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to $131.9 million 
associated with the Brakes Group. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 decreased by $15.5 million.

We estimate our capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets, in fiscal 2018, to be approximately 1.3% to 1.4% of fiscal sales. Fiscal 2018 
expenditures will include facility, fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions; new facility construction, including fold-out facilities; and 
investments in technology.

During fiscal 2017, the company paid cash of $2.9 billion for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, including the Brakes Group and also acquired a small 
produce company in Sweden.

During fiscal 2016, the company paid cash of $219.2 million for acquisitions including a leading luxury personal care amenity provider in the hospitality 
industry, a distributor of high-quality fresh and frozen seafood based in Florida and an innovative e-commerce platform providing restaurant supplies and 
equipment exclusively to Sysco customers. During fiscal 2016, we paid $103.5 million and received $57.5 million for options to hedge against the impact 
of foreign currency fluctuations on the purchase price of the Brakes Acquisition.

 During fiscal 2015, in the aggregate, the company paid cash of $115.9 million for operations acquired during fiscal 2015 and for contingent consideration 
related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years. We also acquired a broadline company in Ontario, Canada; a joint venture interest in a foodservice 
distribution company in Mexico; a joint venture interest in a foodservice distribution company in Costa Rica and a specialty seafood company in New Jersey. 

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow represents net cash provided from operating activities less purchases of plant and equipment plus proceeds from sales of plant and 
equipment. Sysco considers free cash flow to be a non-GAAP liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the 
amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases and sales of buildings, fleet, equipment and technology, which may potentially be used 
to pay for, among other things, strategic uses of cash, including dividend payments, share repurchases and acquisitions. However, free cash flow may 

38

SYSCO CORPORATION - Form 10-KPART II – FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Item 7 management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

not be available for discretionary expenditures, as it may be necessary that we use it to make mandatory debt service or other payments. As a result 
of increased cash provided by operating activities, free cash flow for fiscal 2017 increased 5.9%, or $84.5 million, to $1.5 billion, as compared to fiscal 
2016. Our cash requirements for our Certain Items were $193.9 million lower in fiscal 2017 than in fiscal 2016. As a result of increased cash provided 
by operating activities, decreased capital spending and decreased proceeds from sale of plant and equipment, free cash flow for fiscal 2016 increased 
37.8%, or $392.2 million, to $1.4 billion, as compared to fiscal 2015.

Free cash flow should not be used as a substitute for the most comparable GAAP measure in assessing the company’s liquidity for the periods presented. 
An analysis of any non-GAAP financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. In the table that follows, 
free cash flow for each period presented is reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities.

Proceeds from exercises of share-based compensation awards were $204.8 million in fiscal 2017, $282.5 million in fiscal 2016 and $240.2 million in fiscal 
2015. The level of option exercises, and thus proceeds, will vary from period to period and is largely dependent on movements in our stock price and the 
time remaining before option grants expire.

We routinely engage in share repurchase programs. The number of shares acquired and their cost during fiscal 2017 were 35,744,589 shares for $1.9 billion, 
with 44,716,180 shares repurchased in fiscal 2016 for $1.9 billion. No shares were acquired in fiscal 2015 due to the proposed US Foods merger. In June 
2015, our Board of Directors approved a program to repurchase, from time to time in the open market, through an accelerated share repurchase program 
or through privately negotiated transactions, shares of the company’s common stock in an amount not to exceed $3.0 billion during the two-year period 
ending July 1, 2017, in addition to amounts normally repurchased to offset benefit plan and stock option dilution. We executed all $3.0 billion of this 
authorization in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. In addition to the share repurchase program approved in June 2015, in August 2015, our Board of Directors 
approved the repurchase of up to 20,000,000 shares for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed $800 million. The authorization expired on August 21, 
2017. We executed all $800 million under this authorization and purchased 6,859,399 shares through July 1, 2017. In February 2017, our Board of Directors 
approved a separate repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of shares of the company’s common stock not to exceed $1.0 billion through the 
end of fiscal 2019. We repurchased 232,685 shares for $11.6 million under this authorization through July 1, 2017. We repurchased 3,026,737 additional 
shares for $154.0 million through August 11, 2017. We intend to continue purchasing shares under our current repurchase program in fiscal 2018 through 
open market purchases to align with our capital allocation strategy, which will involve opportunistic purchases and purchases to offset dilution resulting 
from shares issued under the company’s benefit plans.

We have made dividend payments to our shareholders in each fiscal year since our company’s inception over 40 years ago. Dividends paid were 
$698.6 million, or $1.28 per share, in fiscal 2017, $698.9 million, or $1.22 per share, in fiscal 2016, and $695.3 million, or $1.17 per share, in fiscal 2015. 
In May 2017, we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 of $0.33 per share, which was paid in July 2017. We expect 
to continue to grow our dividend in fiscal 2018.

 In August 2015, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and 
sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. The specific terms of any securities we issue under this registration statement 
will be provided in the applicable prospectus supplements.

In November 2000, we filed with the SEC a shelf registration statement covering 30,000,000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in 
connection with acquisitions. As of August 11, 2017, 29,477,835 shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement.

and payout periods.

(2)  The estimated contributions through fiscal 2027 to meet ERISA minimum funding requirements based on actuarial assumptions include the extension of funding relief included in the Highway and 

Transportation Funding Act of 2014 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.
Includes estimated contributions to the unfunded SERP and other postretirement benefit plans made in amounts needed to fund benefit payments for vested participants in these plans through 
fiscal 2027, based on actuarial assumptions.

(3) 

(4)  Unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions recorded under accounting standards related to uncertain tax positions. As of July 1, 2017, we had a liability of $16.3 million for 
unrecognized tax benefits for all tax jurisdictions and $10.7 million for related interest that could result in cash payment. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments or the 
amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time. Accordingly, the related balances have not been reflected in the “Payments Due by Period” section of the table.
Includes payments on floating rate debt based on rates as of July 1, 2017, assuming amount remains unchanged until maturity, and payments on fixed rate debt based on maturity dates. The 
impact of our outstanding fixed-to-floating interest rate swap on the fixed rate debt interest payments is included as well based on the floating rates in effect as of July 1, 2017.

(5) 

(6)  For purposes of this table, purchase obligations include agreements for purchases of product in the normal course of business, for which all significant terms have been confirmed, including 
minimum quantities resulting from our category management initiative. As we progress with this initiative, our purchase obligations are increasing. Such amounts included in the table above are 
based on estimates. Purchase obligations also includes amounts committed with various third-party service providers to provide information technology services for periods up to fiscal 2022 (see 
discussion under Note 20, “Commitments and Contingencies,” to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8). Purchase obligations exclude full requirements electricity contracts 
where no stated minimum purchase volume is required.

Certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration, typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding 
contingencies are resolved. Aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of July 1, 2017 were $15.3 million. This amount is not included 
in the table above.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets, liabilities, sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements. Significant accounting policies employed by Sysco are presented in the 
notes to the financial statements.

40

SYSCO CORPORATION - Form 10-KPART II – FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Item 7 management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations. These 
policies require our most subjective or complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. 
We have reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and 
this related disclosure. Our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the company-sponsored pension plans, income taxes, goodwill and 
intangible assets and share-based compensation.

Company-Sponsored Pension Plans

Amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis. Two of the more critical assumptions 
in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits and the expected rate of return on plan assets. Our 
U.S. Retirement Plan is largely frozen and is only open to a small number of employees. Our SERP is frozen and is not open to any employees. Our U.K. 
Retirement Plan is also frozen to new participants. Due to the low level of active employees in our Retirement Plans, our assumption for the rate of increase 
in future compensation is not a critical assumption.

For guidance in determining the discount rates for our U.S. pension plans, we calculate the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of high-quality 
fixed-income investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plan. The discount rates 
for our international pension plans were calculated using annualized corporate bond yield and spread curves that are similar to the respective expected 
cash flows of each plan. The discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The discount rate for determining fiscal 
2017 net pension costs for the U.S. Retirement Plan decreased 77 basis points to 4.07% as of the July 2, 2016 measurement date. The discount rate 
for determining fiscal 2017 net pension costs for the SERP decreased 72 basis points to 3.91% as of the July 2, 2016 measurement date. The combined 
effect of these discount rate changes increased our net company-sponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal 2017 by an estimated $8 million. The 
discount rate for determining fiscal 2018 net pension costs for the U.S. Retirement Plan increased 12 basis points to 4.19% as of the July 1, 2017 
measurement date. The discount rate for determining fiscal 2018 net pension costs for the SERP increased 17 basis points to 4.08% as of the July 1, 
2017 measurement date. The combined effect of these discount rate changes will increase our net company-sponsored pension costs for all plans for 
fiscal 2018 by an estimated $1 million. A 100 basis point increase (or decrease) in the discount rates for fiscal 2017 would decrease (or increase) Sysco’s 
net company-sponsored pension cost by approximately $10 million. Sysco’s pension plans are primarily frozen, therefore, the net company-sponsored 
pension cost is not as sensitive to discount rate changes as compared to an active plan.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. Retirement Plan was 7.25% for both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. The expected long-term 
rate of return on plan assets of the U.K. Retirement Plan was 4.15% for fiscal 2017. The expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical 
asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns, reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis and the forward-
looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on bonds, historical returns of the major stock markets and returns on alternative investments. 
Although not determinative of future returns, the effective annual rate of return on the U.S. Retirement Plan assets, developed using geometric/compound 
averaging, was approximately 6.9%, 5.6%, 9.6%, and 11.5%, over the 20-year, 10-year, 5-year and 1-year periods ended U.S. Plan, respectively. In addition, 
in four of the last 15 years, the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 10%. The effective annual rate of return on the U.K. Retirement Plan assets, 
developed using geometric/compound averaging, was approximately 18% over the 1-year period ended June 30, 2017. The rate of return assumption is 
reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate.

The expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. 
and U.K. Retirement Plans are 7.00% and 4.55%, respectively, for fiscal 2018. A 100 basis point increase (decrease) in the assumed rate of return in each 
Plan for fiscal 2018 would decrease (increase) Sysco’s net company-sponsored pension costs for fiscal 2017 by approximately $36 million.

Pension accounting standards require the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position, with a 
corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. The amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related 
to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of July 1, 2017 was a charge, net of tax, of $974.2 million. The amount reflected in 
accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of July 2, 2016 was a charge, net 
of tax, of $1.1 billion.

We made cash contributions to our company-sponsored pension plans of $57.6 million and $157.5 million in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our 
contributions in fiscal 2017 include a $25 million contribution to the U.S. Retirement Plan that was voluntary, as there was no minimum required contribution 
for the calendar 2017 plan year to meet ERISA minimum funding requirements. There are no required contributions to the U.S. Retirement Plan to meet 
ERISA minimum funding requirements in fiscal 2018. The estimated fiscal 2018 contributions to fund benefit payments for the SERP plan are approximately 
$30.5 million. The estimated fiscal 2018 contributions to fund benefit payments for the international retirement plans are approximately $9.2 million.

Income Taxes

The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex 
tax laws. Our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various U.S. federal and state, as well as foreign

jurisdictions. Jurisdictional tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, accruals or adjustments of 
accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances, and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall 
effective tax rate.

Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment in estimating 
the exposures associated with our various filing positions. We believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable; however, actual 
results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been 
established, or pay amounts in excess of recorded liabilities, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. 
An unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. 
A favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that, once control of a business is obtained, 100% of 
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. We use multiple valuation methods to 
determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we generally use the income method, which uses a forecast of 
the expected future net cash flows associated with each asset. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount 
rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income 
method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows and the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in 
the future cash flows. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment, as different types of intangible assets will have different 
useful lives. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. More information on our 
acquisitions can be found in Note 4, “Acquisitions” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Annually in our fourth quarter, we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles by determining whether the fair values exceed the 
carrying values of these assets. Impairment reviews, outside our annual review time frame, are performed if events or circumstances occur that include 
changes in macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, other relevant entity-specific events, 
specific events affecting the reporting unit or sustained decrease in share price.

For fiscal 2017, we tested 21 reporting units from our 15 operating segments as described in Note 21, “Business Segment Information” to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements in Item 8. Certain of our operating segments are disaggregated into components for testing purposes, while other components with 
similar economic characteristics are aggregated and tested at the operating segment level. Our testing may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or 
quantitative assessment; however, if a qualitative assessment is performed and we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not 
(i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, a quantitative test is performed.

When using a quantitative test, we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings or revenue multiple 
models. The results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for each reporting unit. We generally 
use a higher weighting for our discounted cash flow valuation compared to the earnings multiple models because the forecasted operating results that 
serve as a basis for the analysis incorporate management’s outlook and anticipated changes for the businesses consistent with a market participant. When 
reporting units represent recently acquired operations, we generally use a higher weighting for our earnings multiple models than our discounted cash flow 
valuation as we believe this aligns with how acquired operations are valued in the market place. The primary assumptions used in these various models 
include estimated earnings multiples of comparable acquisitions in the industry, including control premiums, earnings or revenue multiples on acquisitions 
completed by Sysco in the past, future cash flow estimates of the reporting units, which are dependent on internal forecasts and projected growth rates, 
and weighted average cost of capital, along with working capital and capital expenditure requirements. When possible, we use observable market inputs 
in our models to arrive at the fair values of our reporting units. We update our projections used in our discounted cash flow model based on historical 
performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units.

Our estimates of fair value contain uncertainties requiring management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors 
and the profitability of future business strategies. Actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections, resulting in the company revising its 
assumptions and, if required, recognizing an impairment loss. There were no impairments of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles recorded as a result of 
assessment in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015. Our past estimates of fair value for fiscal 2016 and 2015 would not have been materially different when revised 
to include subsequent years’ actual results. Sysco has not made any material changes in its impairment assessment methodology during the past three 
fiscal years, with the exception of introducing a qualitative assessment in fiscal 2017 for seven reporting units. We do not believe the estimates used in 
the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future, but we will continue to assess the estimates in the future based on the expectations 
of the reporting units. In the fiscal 2017 assessment, our estimates of fair value did not require additional analysis. However, we would have performed 
additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for our Brakes U.K. broadline, Fresh Direct specialty, Sweden broadline, Ireland broadline, Mexico 
broadline and Costa Rica broadline reporting units if our estimates of fair value were decreased by an amount in the range of 5% and 28%, with goodwill 
of $1.7 billion in the aggregate as of July 1, 2017, recorded for these reporting units.

SYSCO CORPORATION - Form 10-KPART II – FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Item 7 management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Certain reporting units (such as those noted above) have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the U.S. Broadline, 
Canada Broadline or SYGMA reporting units. This is primarily due to these businesses having been more recently acquired, and as a result there has been 
less history of organic growth than in the U.S. Broadline, Canadian Broadline and SYGMA reporting units. In addition, these businesses also have lower 
levels of cash flow than the U.S. Broadline reporting unit. As such, these reporting units have a greater risk of future impairment if their operations were 
to suffer a significant downturn.

Share-Based Compensation

Sysco provides compensation benefits to employees and non-employee directors under several share-based payment arrangements including various 
employee stock option plans, a non-employee director plan and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP).

As of July 1, 2017, there was $95.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based compensation arrangements. That cost is 
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years.

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility is based on historical 
volatility of Sysco’s stock, implied volatilities from traded options on Sysco’s stock and other factors. We utilize historical data to estimate option exercise 
and employee termination behavior within the valuation model; separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered 
separately for valuation purposes. Expected dividend yield is estimated based on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for the year 
preceding the option grant. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

The fair value of each restricted stock unit award and performance share unit award granted with a dividend equivalent is based on the company’s stock 
price as of the date of grant. For restricted stock units and performance share units granted without dividend equivalents, the fair value is reduced by the 
present value of expected dividends during the vesting period. Expense recognized on performance share unit awards is subsequently adjusted based on 
forecasted performance compared to planned targets until the performance period concludes and the actual number of shares of Sysco common stock 
to be received upon the vesting of the performance share units is known.

The fair value of the stock issued under the ESPP is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price.

The fair value of restricted stock granted to employees or non-employee directors is based on the stock price on grant date. The application of a discount 
to the fair value of a restricted stock grant is dependent upon whether or not each individual grant contains a post-vesting restriction.

The compensation cost related to these share-based awards is recognized over the requisite service period. The requisite service period is generally the 
period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. The compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting 
from employee purchases of stock under the ESPP is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made.

Our share-based awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period. We will recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis over 
the requisite service period for the entire award.

In addition, certain of our share-based awards provide that the awards continue to vest as if the award holder continued to be an employee or director if 
the award holder meets certain age and years of service thresholds upon retirement. In these cases, we will recognize compensation cost for such awards 
over the period from the grant date to the date the employee or director first becomes eligible to retire with the options continuing to vest after retirement.

Our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes. In the period the compensation cost related to incentive 
stock options is recorded, a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive 
stock options. We may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock 
option. In such cases, we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation 
cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate.

Forward-Looking Statements

Statements made herein that look forward in time or express management’s expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are 
forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management’s current expectations 
and estimates. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does 
not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” 
“estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” “projected,” “continuously,” variations of such terms, and similar 
terms and phrases denoting anticipated or expected occurrences or results.

Item 7 management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about our liquidity and our possible or assumed future results of operations 
or economic performance, as well as descriptions of our plans, projections and strategies, including those described in the following paragraph, and our 
ability to meet those goals and expectations. Such statements in this document include, but are not limited to, projections of future performance under our 
three-year strategic financial plan, including, for example, our expectation to drive leverage between gross profit and expense growth, our goal of leveraging 
earnings growth at a greater rate than sales growth, and our projections of adjusted operating income for fiscal 2018; statements regarding expected 
improvements in case growth trends; statements regarding increased investments in the sales team; our estimates of anticipated capital expenditures for 
fiscal 2018, including estimates provided net of estimated proceeds from sales of assets, and our ability to fund them; our discussions of various types 
of market risks, including interest rate risks, floating rate debt projections and the effectiveness of our interest rate swaps; discussions about trends in 
transportation costs, including fuel pricing, our projected fuel requirements and the effectiveness of fuel hedging arrangements; statements regarding the 
adequacy and anticipated amounts and uses of our cash flows, including our future ability to effectively access the commercial paper market and long-
term capital market; statements regarding our intentions to continuously improve productivity and competitiveness, including by modernizing software and 
improving our e-commerce and other technological capabilities; statements regarding our expectation that we will increase customer retention and profitably 
accelerate sales growth with existing and new customers; projections regarding the rate of return on retirement plan assets; statements regarding expected 
contributions for the SERP plan and the international retirement plans; and statements regarding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in our forward-
looking statements. Important factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K 
under the heading “Risk Factors.” Additional forward-looking statements and some important risks that could cause outcomes to vary materially from 
those expected include the following: The success of our three-year strategic financial objectives could be affected by conditions in the economy and 
the industry as well as internal factors, such as the ability to control expenses, including fuel costs. Our expectations for the Brakes Acquisition could be 
impacted by unfavorable economic conditions in Europe. Our expectations regarding case growth and cost per case may be impacted by factors beyond 
our control, including actions by our competitors and/or customers. Our expectations for deflation and inflation could be impacted by market events and 
supplier costs. Company-sponsored pension plan liabilities are impacted by a number of factors including the discount rate for determining the current 
value of plan benefits and the expected rate of return on plan assets. The amount of shares repurchased in a given period is subject to a number of 
factors, including available cash and our general working capital needs at the time. Meeting our dividend target objectives depends on our level of earnings, 
available cash and the success of our various strategic initiatives. Our expectations regarding earnings per share and various items impacting earnings is 
subject to a number of factors, including our ability to manage operating expenses and the impact of Certain Items. Our plans with respect to growth in 
international markets and adjacent areas that complement our core business are subject to our other strategic initiatives, the allocation of resources, and 
plans and economic conditions generally. Legal proceedings and the adequacy of insurance are impacted by events, circumstances and individuals beyond 
our control. Expectations of cash tax payments can be impacted by our performance. The need for additional borrowing or other capital is impacted by 
various factors, including capital expenditures or acquisitions in excess of those currently anticipated, levels of share repurchases, or other unexpected 
cash requirements. Plans regarding the repayment of debt are subject to change at any time based on management’s assessment of the overall needs 
of the company. Capital expenditures may vary from those projected based on changes in business plans and other factors, including risks related to 
the timing and successful completion of acquisitions, construction schedules and the possibility that other cash requirements could result in delays or 
cancellations of capital spending. Our ability to finance capital expenditures as anticipated may be influenced by our results of operations, our borrowing 
capacity, share repurchases, dividend levels and other factors. Expectations regarding tax rates and the transfer of cash held in foreign jurisdictions are 
subject to various factors beyond our control and decisions of management throughout the fiscal year that are subject to change based on our business 
needs. The anticipated impact of compliance with laws and regulations also involves the risk that estimates may turn out to be materially incorrect, and 
laws and regulations, as well as methods of enforcement, are subject to change.

Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about market Risk

ITEM 7A  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures  

about Market Risk

Our market risks consist of interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, fuel price risk and investment risk.

Interest Rate Risk

We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes. Our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk. Floating rate debt, where the interest 
rate fluctuates periodically, exposes us to short-term changes in market interest rates. Fixed rate debt, where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the 
instrument, exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing 
debt with new debt at higher rates.

We manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that 
position. The major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments, potential increases 
in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions.

At July 1, 2017, there were $119.7 million in commercial paper issuances outstanding. Total debt as of July 1, 2017 was $8.2 billion, of which approximately 
71% was at fixed rates of interest, including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements.

At July 2, 2016, there were no commercial paper issuances outstanding. Total debt as of July 2, 2016 was $7.4 billion, of which approximately 68% was 
at fixed rates of interest, including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

The majority of our foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency. To the extent that business transactions are not denominated 
in a foreign subsidiary’s functional currency, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We will also incur gains and losses within our 
shareholders’ equity due to the translation of our financial statements from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. Our largest currency exposures are with 
Canadian dollars, British pound sterling and Euro currencies. Our income statement trends may be impacted by the translation of the income statements 
of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. The exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into U.S. dollars positively impacted sales by 0.1% in 
fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016. The exchange rate used to translate our foreign sales into U.S. dollars negatively impacted sales by 1.3% in 
fiscal 2016 when compared to fiscal 2015. The impact to our operating income, net earnings and earnings per share was not material in fiscal 2017 or 
fiscal 2016. A 10% unfavorable change in the fiscal 2017 weighted year-to-date exchange rate and the resulting impact on our financial statements would 
have negatively impacted fiscal 2017 sales by 1.8% and would not have materially impacted our operating income, net earnings and earnings per share. 
We do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks.

Our Brakes Acquisition created additional foreign currency exposure. In fiscal 2017, we designated €500 million of Euro notes issued in June 2016 and 
various cross currency swaps as hedges of a portion of our net investment in Euro-denominated and Sterling-denominated foreign operations to reduce 
foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations. Changes in the value of these items resulting from fluctuations in the underlying 
exchange rates to U.S. Dollar exchange rates are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within Accumulated other comprehensive income 
(loss). In fiscal 2017, we entered into various cross currency swaps to mitigate the risk of exchange rate changes for an intercompany loan that is not in the 
functional currency of one of our subsidiaries. These have been designated as cash flow hedges with changes recorded within foreign currency translation 
adjustments within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 

Fuel Price Risk

Due to the nature of our distribution business, we are exposed to potential volatility in fuel prices. The price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due 
to changes in production, seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control. Increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our 
results of operations in three areas. First, the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce 
the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food-away-from-home purchases. Second, the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for 
product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers. Third, increased fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver 
product to our customers. Fuel costs related to outbound deliveries represented approximately 0.5% of sales during both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016.

Our activities to mitigate fuel costs include routing optimization with the goal of reducing miles driven, improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and 
maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges. During fiscal 2017, we began entering into diesel fuel swaps for fiscal 2018 for a portion of our projected 
monthly diesel fuel requirements. As of July 1, 2017, we had diesel fuel swaps with a total notional amount of approximately $78.0 million through June 
2018. These swaps will lock in the price of approximately 55% to 60% of our projected fuel purchase needs for fiscal 2018. Our remaining fuel purchase 
needs will occur at market rates unless contracted for a fixed price or hedged at a later date. Using current, published quarterly market price projections 
for diesel and estimates of fuel consumption, a 10% unfavorable change in diesel prices from the market price would result in a potential increase of 
approximately $8.6 million in our fuel costs on our non-contracted volumes.

Investment Risk

Our company-sponsored qualified pension plans (U.S. Retirement Plan and U.K. Retirement Plan) hold various investments, including public and private 
equity, fixed income securities and real estate funds. The amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon, among other things, the return 
on the plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability. Fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future 
contributions to the plan to increase and can result in a reduction to shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of fiscal year-end, which is when this plan’s 
funded status is measured. Also, the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public 
markets. To the extent the financial markets experience declines, our anticipated future contributions and funded status will be affected for future years. 
A 10% unfavorable change in the value of the investments held by our company-sponsored Retirement Plans at the plan’s fiscal year end (December 31, 
2016) would not have a material impact on our anticipated future contributions for fiscal 2018; however, such an unfavorable change would increase our 
pension expense for fiscal 2018 by $34.0 million and would reduce our shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of July 1, 2017 by $334.2 million. 
An unfavorable change in the fair value of our U.K. Plan assets would increase our pension expense for fiscal 2018 by $2.1 million and would reduce our 
shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet, as of July 1, 2017, by $25.9 million.

Report of Management on Internal Control  
Over Financial Reporting

The management of Sysco Corporation (“Sysco”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the 
company. Sysco’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and 
fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those 
systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Sysco’s management assessed the effectiveness of Sysco’s internal control over financial reporting as of July 1, 2017. In making this assessment, management 
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013). 
Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of July 1, 2017, Sysco’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those 
criteria. This assessment did not include the internal controls over financial reporting related to the Brakes Group, because it was acquired by Sysco on 
July 5, 2016. The Brakes Group’s total assets represented 25.2% of Sysco’s consolidated total assets as of July 1, 2017, and sales and net earnings 
constituted 9.3% and 4.2%, respectively, of Sysco’s consolidated sales and net earnings for the year-ended July 1, 2017. This exclusion is in accordance 
with the general guidance issued by the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be 
omitted from our scope in the year of acquisition, if specified conditions are satisfied. 

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the company’s consolidated financial statements included in this report, 
has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of Sysco’s internal control over financial reporting as of July 1, 2017.

Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

PART II – FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Sysco Corporation

We have audited Sysco Corporation (a Delaware Corporation) and subsidiaries’ (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of July 1, 2017, 
based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 
(2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Sysco Corporation and subsidiaries’ management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial 
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on 
Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on 
our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require 
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all 
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures 
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over 
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect 
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation 
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on 
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the business that the company acquired in the acquisition 
of Cucina Lux Investments Limited (the “Brakes Group”), which is included in the 2017 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 
25.2% of total assets as of July 1, 2017 and 9.3% and 4.2% of revenues and net income, respectively, for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control 
over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the Brakes Group.

In our opinion, Sysco Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 1, 2017, 
based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance 
sheets of the Company as of July 1, 2017 and July 2, 2016, and the related consolidated results of operations, and statements of comprehensive income, 
changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flow for each of the three years in the period ended July 1, 2017 of Sysco Corporation and subsidiaries and our 
report dated August 29, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting 
Firm on Consolidated Financial Statements

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Sysco Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sysco Corporation (a Delaware Corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of 
July 1, 2017 and July 2, 2016, and the related consolidated results of operations and statements of comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ 
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 1, 2017. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s 
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require 
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit 
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the 
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe 
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of 
July 1, 2017 and July 2, 2016, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 1, 2017, 
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control 
over financial reporting as of July 1, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated August 29, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

SYSCO CORPORATION - Form 10-KNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements

PART II – FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Unless this Form 10-K indicates otherwise or the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “Sysco,” or “the company” as used in this Form 
10-K refer to Sysco Corporation together with its consolidated subsidiaries and divisions.

NOTE 1 

Summary of Accounting Policies

Business and Consolidation

Sysco Corporation, acting through its subsidiaries and divisions (Sysco or the company), is engaged in the marketing and distribution of a wide range of 
food and related products primarily to the foodservice or food-away-from-home industry. These services are performed for over 500,000 customers from 
324 distribution facilities located throughout North America and Europe.

Sysco’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to June 30th. This resulted in a 52-week year ended July 1, 2017 for fiscal 2017, a 53-week year ended 
July 2, 2016 for fiscal 2016, and a 52-week year ended June 27, 2015 for fiscal 2015.

The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of Sysco and its consolidated subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and 
account balances have been eliminated.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates that affect 
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses. Actual results could differ from the estimates used.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash includes cash equivalents such as time deposits, certificates of deposit, short-term investments and all highly liquid instruments with original maturities 
of three months or less, which are recorded at fair value.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable consist primarily of trade receivables from customers and receivables from suppliers for marketing or incentive programs. Sysco 
determines the past due status of trade receivables based on contractual terms with each customer. Sysco evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable 
and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors. The company utilizes specific criteria to determine 
uncollectible receivables to be written off including whether a customer has filed for or been placed in bankruptcy, has had accounts referred to outside 
parties for collection or has had accounts past due over specified periods. In these instances, a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to 
reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected. Allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on an analysis of 
historical trends of write-offs and recoveries.

Inventories

Inventories consisting primarily of finished goods include food and related products and lodging products held for resale and are valued at the lower of 
cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Elements of costs include the purchase price of the product and freight charges to deliver the product to the 
company’s warehouses and are net of certain cash or non-cash consideration received from vendors (see “Vendor Consideration”).

Plant and Equipment
Capital additions, improvements and major replacements are classified as plant and equipment and are carried at cost. Depreciation is recorded using the 
straight-line method, which reduces the book value of each asset in equal amounts over its estimated useful life, and is included within operating expenses in 
the consolidated results of operations. Maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are charged to earnings when they are incurred. Upon the disposition 
of an asset, its accumulated depreciation is deducted from the original cost, and any gain or loss is reflected in current earnings.

Certain internal and external costs related to the acquisition and development of internal use software are capitalized within plant and equipment during 
the application development stages of the project. Costs related to the acquisition and development of internal use software for the past three fiscal years 
was $23.5 million in fiscal 2017, $82.1 million in fiscal 2016 and $25.0 million in fiscal 2015.

SYSCO CORPORATION - Form 10-KITEM 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataPART II – FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Applicable interest charges incurred during the construction of new facilities and development of software for internal use are capitalized as one of the 
elements of cost and are amortized over the assets’ estimated useful lives. Interest capitalized for the past three fiscal years was $2.0 million in each of 
fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, and $0.9 million in fiscal 2015.

Long-Lived Assets

Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not 
be recoverable. Cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the asset’s useful life based on updated projections on an 
undiscounted basis. For assets held for use, Sysco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If the 
evaluation indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable, the potential impairment is measured using fair value. Impairment losses 
for assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.

Goodwill and Intangibles

Goodwill and intangibles represent the excess of cost over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired. Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are 
not amortized. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of a business combination. The recoverability of 
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles is assessed annually, or more frequently as needed when events or changes have occurred that would suggest an 
impairment of carrying value, by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed their carrying values. This annual testing may 
be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment; however, if a qualitative assessment is performed and it is determined that the fair 
value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, a quantitative test is performed.

For fiscal 2017, the company analyzed its 15 operating segments as defined in Note 21, “Business Segment Information.” and determined that 21 reporting 
units existed for purposes of evaluating for goodwill impairment. For seven reporting units, the company utilized a qualitative assessment. For the remaining 
reporting units, Sysco performed a quantitative test using a combination of the income and market approaches. The evaluation of fair value requires the 
use of projections, estimates and assumptions as to the future performance of the operations in performing a discounted cash flow analysis, as well 
as assumptions regarding sales and earnings multiples that would be applied in comparable acquisitions. The company does not believe the estimates 
used in the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future, but Sysco will continue to assess the estimates in the future based on the 
expectations of the reporting units. In the fiscal 2017 assessment, our estimates of fair value did not require additional analysis. However, the company 
would have performed additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for our Brakes U.K. broadline, Fresh Direct specialty, Sweden broadline, 
Ireland broadline, Mexico broadline and Costa Rica broadline reporting units if our estimates of fair value were decreased by an amount in the range of 5% 
and 28%, with goodwill of $1.7 billion in the aggregate as of July 1, 2017, recorded for these reporting units.

Intangibles with definite lives are amortized over their useful lives in a manner consistent with underlying cash flow, which generally ranges from two to 
fifteen years. Management reviews finite-lived intangibles for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable. Cash flows expected to be generated by the finite-lived intangibles are estimated over the intangible asset’s useful 
life based on updated projections on an undiscounted basis. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying value of the finite-lived intangible asset may not 
be recoverable, the potential impairment is measured at fair value.

Restricted Cash

Sysco is required by its insurers to collateralize a part of the self-insured portion of its workers’ compensation and liability claims. Sysco has chosen to satisfy 
these collateral requirements by depositing funds in insurance trusts or by issuing letters of credit. Sysco chose to satisfy these collateral requirements by 
issuing letters of credit in fiscal 2017 and 2016.

Derivative Financial Instruments

All derivatives are recognized as assets or liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets at fair value at their gross values. Gains or losses on derivative 
financial instruments designated as fair value hedges are recognized immediately in the consolidated results of operations, along with the offsetting gain 
or loss related to the underlying hedged item.

Gains or losses on derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a separate component of shareholders’ equity from 
inception of the hedges and are reclassified to the Consolidated Results of Operations in conjunction with the recognition of the underlying hedged item.

For net investment hedges, the remeasurement gain or loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be subsequently reclassified 
to net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated.

Investments in Corporate-Owned Life Insurance

Investments in corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) policies are recorded at their cash surrender values as of each balance sheet date. Changes in the 
cash surrender value during the period are recorded as a gain or loss within operating expenses. Sysco has the ability and intent to hold certain of its COLI 
policies to maturity; therefore, the company does not record deferred tax balances related to cash surrender value gains or losses for these policies. Deferred 
tax balances are recorded for those policies that Sysco intends to redeem prior to maturity. The total amounts related to the company’s investments in COLI 
policies included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets were $163.7 million and $163.3 million at July 1, 2017 and July 2, 2016, respectively.

Treasury Stock

The company records treasury stock purchases at cost. Shares removed from treasury are valued at cost using the average cost method. Sysco routinely 
repurchases shares in the normal course of business, however, in fiscal 2016, Sysco executed a $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase program, under 
which it repurchased a total of 34,716,180 shares. 

Foreign Currency Translation

The assets and liabilities of all foreign subsidiaries are translated at current exchange rates. Related translation adjustments are recorded as a component 
of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Revenue Recognition

The company recognizes revenue from the sale of a product when it is considered to be realized or realizable and earned. The company determines these 
requirements to be met at the point at which the product is delivered to the customer. The company grants certain customers sales incentives such as 
rebates or discounts and treats these as a reduction of sales at the time the sale is recognized. Sales tax collected from customers is not included in 
revenue but rather recorded as a liability due to the respective taxing authorities. Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are 
entered into in contemplation of one another are considered to be a single nonmonetary transaction. As such, the company records the net effect of such 
transactions in the consolidated results of operations within sales.

Vendor Consideration

Sysco recognizes consideration received from vendors as a reduction to cost of sales when the services performed in connection with the monies 
received are completed and when the related product has been sold by Sysco. There are several types of cash consideration received from vendors. In 
many instances, the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound. In these instances, Sysco will recognize the vendor 
consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold. In the situations in which the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific 
product purchases, Sysco will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete, the related service is performed 
and the amounts are realized.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs include costs associated with the selection of products and delivery to customers. Included in operating expenses are shipping 
and handling costs of approximately $3.4 billion in fiscal 2017 and $2.6 billion each in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. 

Insurance Program

Sysco maintains a self-insurance program covering portions of workers’ compensation, general and vehicle liability and property insurance costs. The 
amounts in excess of the self-insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers. The company also maintains a fully self-insured group medical program. 
Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, medical cost trends, demographic factors, severity 
factors and other actuarial assumptions.

Share-Based Compensation

Sysco recognizes expense for its share-based compensation based on the fair value of the awards that are granted. The fair value of performance share 
unit awards is determined based on the target number of shares of common stock and the company’s stock price on the date of grant and subsequently 
adjusted based on actual and forecasted performance compared to planned targets. The fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the 
Black-Scholes option pricing model. Option pricing methods require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. 
The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards are based on the company’s stock price on the date of grant. Measured compensation 
cost is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the related share-based compensation award. Cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of 
the compensation cost recognized for those options (excess tax benefits) are classified as financing cash flows on the consolidated cash flows statements.

Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Income Taxes

Sysco recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial 
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured pursuant to tax 
laws using rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The impact 
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances 
are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized.

The determination of the company’s provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application 
of complex tax laws. The company’s provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various U.S. federal 
and state, as well as various foreign jurisdictions. Jurisdictional tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax 
items, accruals or adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or valuation allowances, and the company’s change in the mix of earnings from these 
taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate.

Acquisitions

Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and the financial statements include the results of the acquired 
operations from the respective dates of acquisition.

The purchase price of the acquired entities is preliminarily allocated to the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair value 
at the dates of acquisition, with any excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired, including intangibles, recognized as goodwill. Subsequent 
changes to preliminary amounts are made prospectively.

Basis of Presentation

The financial statements include consolidated balance sheets, consolidated results of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
and consolidated cash flows. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which consist of normal recurring adjustments, except as otherwise 
disclosed, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows for all periods presented 
have been made.

Sysco has interests in various jointly-owned foodservice operations in Mexico, Costa Rica and Panama for which it consolidates the results of the 
operations; therefore, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for this company have been included in Sysco’s consolidated financial 
statements. The value of the noncontrolling interest in each entity is considered redeemable due to certain features of the investment agreement and 
has therefore been presented as mezzanine equity, which is outside of permanent equity, in the consolidated balance sheets. The income attributable 
to the noncontrolling interest is located within Other expense (income), net, in the consolidated results of operations, as this amount is not material. The 
non-cash add back for the change in the value of the noncontrolling interest is located within Other non-cash items on the consolidated cash flows.

Reclassifications

Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.

NOTE 2 

Changes in Accounting

In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about 
an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (Topic 205-40). This ASU required management to evaluate, for each annual and interim reporting 
period, whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern within one year after the date of the consolidated financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. If substantial doubt is raised, 
additional disclosures around the company’s plan to alleviate these doubts are required. The adoption of this standard did not have any effect on the 
company’s consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 3 

New Accounting Standards

Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement 
Benefit Cost

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and 
Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, requiring that an employer report the service cost component of pension and postretirement benefits in the same 
line item or items as other compensation costs. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately 
from the service cost component and outside of a subtotal of income from operations. In addition, only the service cost component will be eligible for 
capitalization as applicable. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those annual periods, 
which is the first quarter of fiscal 2019 for Sysco, with early adoption permitted. The company is currently reviewing the provisions of the new standard.

Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment

In January 2017, the FASB ASU 2017-04, Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the subsequent 
measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The amendments also eliminate the requirements for any reporting unit with 
a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. An 
entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. This guidance 
is effective for the annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, which is the first quarter of fiscal 2021 for 
Sysco. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The fair value of the company’s 
reporting units exceeded its carrying value in its fiscal 2017 impairment analysis for goodwill and, therefore, early adoption was not considered in fiscal 2017.

Guidance in Presentation of Cash Flows - Restricted Cash

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, which clarifies the presentation of restricted 
cash on the statement of cash flows. Amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash 
equivalents when reconciling the beginning and ending cash balances on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for fiscal years-and interim 
periods within those fiscal years-beginning after December 15, 2017, which is the first quarter of fiscal 2019 for Sysco, with early adoption permitted. The 
company is currently reviewing the provisions of the new standard.

Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16 amending the accounting for income taxes. The new guidance requires the recognition of the income 
tax consequences of an intercompany asset transfer, other than transfers of inventory, when the transfer occurs. For intercompany transfers of inventory, 
the income tax effects will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning 
after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact and expect the ASU will not have a material impact on 
our consolidated financial statements.

Guidance in Presentation of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and 
Cash Payments

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, to 
address eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The eight specific issues are: (1) Debt Prepayment or 
Debt Extinguishment Costs; (2) Settlement of Zero-Coupon Debt Instruments or Other Debt Instruments with Coupon Interest Rates That Are Insignificant in 
Relation to the Effective Interest Rate of the Borrowing; (3) Contingent Consideration Payments Made after a Businesses Combination; (4) Proceeds from the 
Settlement of Insurance Claims; (5) Proceeds from the Settlement of Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies, including Bank-Owned Life Insurance Policies; 
(6) Distributions Received from Equity Method Invitees; (7) Beneficial Interests in Securitization Transactions; and (8) Separately Identifiable Cash and Application 
of the Predominance Principle. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those annual periods, 
which is the first quarter of fiscal 2019 for Sysco, with early adoption permitted. The company is currently reviewing the provisions of the new standard.

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, 
which introduces a forward-looking approach, based on expected losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including 
trade receivables. The estimate of expected credit losses will require entities to incorporate considerations of historical information, current information 
and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This ASU also expands the disclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to understand the 
entity’s assumptions, models and methods for estimating expected credit losses. This guidance is effective for fiscal years-and interim periods within those 

59

SYSCO CORPORATION - Form 10-KITEM 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataPART II – FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

fiscal years-beginning after December 15, 2019, which is the first quarter of fiscal 2021 for Sysco, with early adoption permitted. The company is currently 
reviewing the provisions of the new standard.

Stock Compensation

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment 
Accounting, as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards. The areas for simplification involve several aspects of the accounting for 
employee share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification 
on the statement of cash flows. In addition, the amendments eliminate the guidance in Topic 718 that was indefinitely deferred shortly after the issuance 
of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 
2016, which is fiscal 2018 for Sysco. The company will adopt this ASU in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 by including excess tax benefits and deficiencies 
as a component of our income tax expense. This will increase volatility within our provision for income taxes as the amount of excess tax benefits or 
deficiencies from stock-based compensation awards are dependent on our stock price at the date the awards vest.

Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), specifying the accounting for leases, which supersedes the leases requirements in 
Topic 840, Leases. The objective of Topic 842 is to establish the principles that lessees and lessors shall apply to report useful information to users of financial 
statements about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from a lease. Lessees are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not 
recognize the asset and liability for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lessors’ accounting is largely unchanged from the previous accounting standard. 
In addition, Topic 842 expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements. Lessees and lessors will use a modified retrospective transition approach, 
which includes a number of practical expedients. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 
15, 2018, which is fiscal 2020 for Sysco, with early adoption permitted. The company is currently reviewing the provisions of the new standard. The company 
does engage in leasing assets, so it does expect additional assets and liabilities to be recognized on its balance sheet upon implementation of this new standard.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and has issued subsequent amendments to this guidance. 
This new standard will replace all current guidance on this topic and eliminate all industry-specific guidance. The new revenue recognition standard provides 
a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of 
promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or 
services. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, which is fiscal 2019 for Sysco, and could be early adopted 
in fiscal 2018. The standard may be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.

The company’s impact assessment of the standard is ongoing and the company does not intend to early adopt this standard in fiscal 2018. Enhanced 
disclosures, including revenue recognition policies to identify performance obligations to customers and significant judgments in measurement and recognition, 
are required. We will continue our assessment, which may identify other impacts of the adoption of ASC 606. The company will adopt the standard in the 
first quarter of fiscal 2019 and preliminarily expects to use the modified retrospective method. However, our adoption method is subject to change as we 
continue to evaluate the impact of the standard.

NOTE 4 

Acquisitions

During fiscal 2017, the company paid cash of $2.9 billion for acquisitions, net of cash acquired. Certain prior year acquisitions involved contingent 
consideration that included earnout agreements that are typically payable over periods of up to three years in the event that certain operating results are 
achieved. As of July 1, 2017, aggregate contingent consideration outstanding was $15.3 million, of which $5.3 million was recorded as earnout liabilities.

Brakes Group

On July 5, 2016, Sysco consummated its acquisition of Cucina Lux Investments Limited (a private company limited by shares organized under the laws of England 
and Wales), a holding company of the Brakes Group, pursuant to an agreement for the sale and purchase of securities in the capital of such holding company, 
dated as of February 19, 2016 (the Purchase Agreement), by and among Sysco, entities affiliated with Bain Capital Investors, LLC, and members of management 
of the Brakes Group (the Brakes Acquisition). Following the closing of the Brakes Acquisition, the Brakes Group became a wholly owned subsidiary of Sysco.

The Brakes Group is a large European foodservice business supplying fresh, refrigerated and frozen food products, as well as non-food products and 
supplies, to foodservice customers ranging from large customers, including leisure, pub, restaurant, hotel and contract catering groups, to smaller customers, 
including independent restaurants, hotels, fast food outlets, schools and hospitals. Brakes Group businesses include: Brakes, Brakes Catering Equipment, 
Brake France, Country Choice, Davigel, Fresh Direct, Freshfayre, M&J Seafood, Menigo Foodservice, Pauley’s, Wild Harvest and Woodward Foodservice. 
The Brakes Group’s largest businesses are in the U.K., France, and Sweden, in addition to a presence in Ireland, Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg. The 

60

SYSCO CORPORATION - Form 10-Kprincipal reason for the Brakes Acquisition was the ability to expand Sysco’s footprint and infrastructure in Europe and profitably grow Sysco’s business. 
These contributed to a purchase price that resulted in recognition of goodwill.

The assets, liabilities and operating results of the Brakes Group are reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with ASC 
Topic No. 805, Business Combinations, commencing from the acquisition date.

NOTE 5 

Fair Value Measurements

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
at the measurement date (i.e., an exit price). The accounting guidance includes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used 
to measure fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

 • Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;

 • Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially 

the full term of the asset or liability; and

 • Level 3 – Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which include management’s own assumption about the assumptions market participants would 

use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk.

Sysco’s policy is to invest in only high-quality investments. Cash equivalents primarily include time deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, 
high-quality money market funds and all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less. Restricted cash consists of investments 
in high-quality money market funds.

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value:

 • Time deposits and commercial paper included in cash equivalents are valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. These are included 

within cash equivalents as a Level 2 measurement in the tables below.

 • Money market funds are valued at the closing price reported by the fund sponsor from an actively traded exchange. These are included within cash 

equivalents as Level 1 measurements in the tables below.

 • The interest rate swap agreements are valued using a swap valuation model that utilizes an income approach using observable market inputs including 

interest rates, LIBOR swap rates and credit default swap rates. These are included as Level 2 measurements in the tables below.

 • The foreign currency swap agreements, including cross-currency swaps, are valued using a swap valuation model that utilizes an income approach 
applying observable market inputs, including interest rates, LIBOR swap rates for U.S. dollars, pound sterling and Euro currencies, and credit default 
swap rates. These are included as Level 2 measurements in the tables below.

 • Foreign currency forwards are valued based on exchange rates quoted by domestic and foreign banks for similar instruments. These are included as 

Level 2 measurements in the tables below.

 • Fuel swap contracts are valued based on observable market transactions of forward commodity prices. These are included as Level 2 measurements 

in the tables below.

The following tables present the company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of July 1, 2017 and July 2, 2016:

The carrying values of accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated their respective fair values due to their short-term maturities. The fair value 
of Sysco’s total debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issue or on the current rates offered to the company for debt 
of the same remaining maturities and is considered a Level 2 measurement. The fair value of total debt was approximately $8.6 billion and $7.9 billion as of 
July 1, 2017 and July 2, 2016, respectively. The carrying value of total debt was $8.2 billion and $7.4 billion as of July 1, 2017 and July 2, 2016, respectively.

Depreciation expense, including amortization of capital leases, was $765.4 million in 2017, $608.7 million in 2016 and $495.8 million in 2015.

In fiscal 2016, Sysco announced its revised business technology strategy focused on improving the customer experience. In refocusing its technology approach, 
Sysco created plans to modernize and add new capability and functionality to its existing SUS Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. In connection with this 
strategy, Sysco created plans to remove the SAP ERP platform then used by 12 of its operating companies by the end of fiscal 2017. At the time of the decision, the 
company had $31.6 million recorded as construction in progress for incomplete projects for the SAP ERP platform and $251.1 million in net book value for internal

use software for the SAP ERP platform, with a remaining life of three years. These are included within “computer hardware and software” in the table above. Sysco 
concluded that the projects under development would not be completed and expensed the $31.6 million in construction in progress in fiscal 2016 within operating 
expense in the consolidated results of operations. The company tested the internal use software for the SAP ERP platform for impairment on an undiscounted 
cash flow basis and concluded that those cash flows would be sufficient to recover the full asset value for the remaining period the asset is planned to be in use. 
Sysco shortened the remaining life of the internal use assets to be fully amortized by the end of fiscal 2017, concurrent with the expected time frame to fully migrate 
the 12 operating companies to the SUS ERP system, which was completed as of July 1, 2017. For fiscal years 2017 and 2016, Sysco recognized an additional 
$111.3 million and $41.9 million, respectively, in amortization expense as a result of shortening the useful lives of these assets.

Hedging of foreign currency risk

In fiscal 2017, Sysco entered into cross-currency swap contracts to hedge the foreign currency transaction risk of certain pound sterling-denominated 
intercompany loans with a total notional value of £234.2 million. These swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges and mature at the same time as 
the related loans in July 2021. There are no credit-risk-related contingent features associated with these swaps. These intercompany loans are considered 
to be of a long-term investment nature, therefore, the effective portion of the derivative gain or loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
and will be subsequently reclassified to earnings when the loan balances are no longer considered to be of a long-term investment nature.

The company entered into cross currency swap contracts to hedge the foreign currency exposure of our net investment in certain foreign operations. The 
effective portion of the derivative gain or loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be subsequently reclassified to earnings 
when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. Sysco designated its Euro-denominated debt of €500 million issued in June 
2016 as a net investment hedge. Sysco also designated its cross currency swap contracts entered into in August 2016 as a net investment hedge with 
a total notional value of €534 million. The remeasurement gain or loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be subsequently 
reclassified to net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated.

Sysco’s operations in the U.K. and Sweden have inventory purchases denominated in currencies other than their functional currency, such as the Euro, U.S. 
dollar, Polish zloty and Danish krone. These inventory purchases give rise to foreign currency exposure between the functional currency of each entity and 
these currencies. The company enters into foreign currency forward swap contracts to sell the applicable entity’s functional currency and buy currencies 
matching the inventory purchase, which operate as cash flow hedges of the company’s foreign currency-denominated inventory purchases. These swap 
contracts are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and within accumulated other comprehensive income. The amount of ineffectiveness, if any, is 
recorded in earnings. Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged 
forecasted transactions affect earnings, which is the period in which the company recognizes the sales associated with the specified foreign currency-
denominated inventory purchases.

Hedging of fuel price risk

In fiscal 2017, Sysco began utilizing fuel commodity swap contracts to hedge against the risk of the change in the price of diesel on anticipated future 
purchases. These swaps, with a total notional value of $78 million, have maturity dates extending into June 2018 and have been designated as cash flow 
hedges. These swap contracts are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and the effective portion of any derivative gain or loss is initially recorded in 
accumulated other comprehensive income. The amount of ineffectiveness, if any, is recorded in earnings. Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive 
income are reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged forecasted transactions occur, which is when the fuel is consumed.

For fair value hedges of interest rate risk, hedge ineffectiveness represents the difference between the changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments 
and the changes in fair value of the fixed rate debt attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. For cash flow hedges, hedge ineffectiveness is 
the difference of the change in the fair value of the derivative compared to the change in the hedged transaction. Hedge ineffectiveness is recorded directly 
in earnings within interest expense for interest rate swaps, other income and expense, net for hedging of the foreign exchange risk on intercompany loans, 
cost of sales for foreign exchange risk on inventory purchases and operating expense for fuel hedging. All amounts were immaterial for fiscal 2017, 2016 
and 2015. None of the instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features.

Sysco has a commercial paper program allowing the company to issue short-term unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed $2 billion. As 
of July 1, 2017, there were $119.7 million in commercial paper issuances outstanding. Any outstanding amounts are classified within long-term debt, as 
the program is supported by a long-term revolving credit facility. During the first 52 weeks of 2017, aggregate outstanding commercial paper issuances 
and short-term bank borrowings ranged from zero to approximately $1.6 billion.

Senior notes offering related to repayment of commercial paper borrowings

On June 19, 2017, Sysco issued 3.25% senior notes totaling $750 million in principal amount. Sysco used the net proceeds from the offering to pay off a 
portion of its outstanding commercial paper borrowings. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Sysco’s direct and indirect wholly owned 
subsidiaries that guarantee Sysco’s other senior notes. Interest on the senior notes maturing in 2027 will be paid semi-annually in arrears on January 15 
and July 15, commencing on January 15, 2018. At Sysco’s option, any or all of the senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time prior 
to maturity. If Sysco elects to redeem the notes before the date that is three months prior to the maturity date, Sysco will pay an amount equal to the 
greater of 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal 
and interest on the notes to be redeemed that would be due if such notes matured on the applicable date described above. If Sysco elects to redeem 
the notes on or after the date described in the preceding sentence, Sysco will pay an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be 
redeemed. Sysco will pay accrued and unpaid interest on the notes redeemed to the redemption date.

Interest expense on redemption of senior notes related to US Foods Merger

On June 26, 2015, Sysco terminated the US Foods merger agreement, triggering the redemption of the senior notes that had been issued in contemplation 
of the proposed merger at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal of the senior notes. The repayment of these senior notes in July 2015 triggered 
a redemption loss of $86.5 million included in interest expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2016.

At the time of the offering of notes, the company entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted $500 million of senior notes maturing 
in fiscal 2018 and $750 million of senior notes maturing in fiscal 2020 to floating rate debt. These transactions were designated as fair value hedges against 
the changes in fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates. The company terminated the swaps in fiscal 2016 for proceeds of 
$14.5 million in connection with the redemption of these senior notes.

Interest expense for fiscal 2016 includes the following amounts from these transactions:

Redemption premium payment
Debt issuance cost write-off
Bond discount write-off

Loss on extinguishment of debt

Sysco has company-sponsored defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans for its employees. Also, the company provides certain health 
care benefits to eligible retirees and their dependents.

Defined Contribution Plans

The company operates a defined contribution 401(k) Plan as a Safe Harbor Plan, which is a plan that treats all employees’ benefits equally within the 
plan, under Sections 401(k) and 401(m) of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to non-union employees and those union employees whose unions 
adopted the Safe Harbor Plan provisions. The company will make a non-elective contribution each pay period equal to 3% of a participant’s compensation. 
Additionally, the company will make matching contributions of 50% of a participant’s pre-tax contribution on the first 5% of the participant’s compensation 
contributed by the participant. Certain employees are also eligible for a transition contribution, and the company may also make discretionary contributions. 
For union employees who are members of unions that did not adopt the Safe Harbor Plan provisions, the plan provides that under certain circumstances 
the company may make matching contributions of up to 50% of the first 6% of a participant’s compensation.

The company also has a nonqualified, unfunded Management Savings Plan (MSP) available to key management personnel who are participants in the 
Management Incentive Plan. Participants may defer up to 50% of their annual salary and up to 100% of their annual bonus. The company will make a 
non-elective contribution each pay period equal to 3% of a participant’s compensation. Additionally, the company will make matching contributions of 
50% of a participant’s pre-tax contribution on the first 5% of the participant’s eligible compensation that is deferred. Certain employees are also eligible for 
a transition contribution, and the company may also make discretionary contributions. All company contributions to the MSP are limited by the amounts 
contributed by the company to the participant’s 401(k) account.

Sysco’s expense related to its defined contribution plans was $141.2 million in fiscal 2017, $135.5 million in fiscal 2016, and $125.4 million in fiscal 2015.

Defined Benefit Plans

Sysco maintains various qualified pension plans (Retirement Plans) that pays benefits to participating employees at retirement, using formulas based on a 
participant’s years of service and compensation. The U.S. plan is frozen for all U.S.-based salaried and non-union hourly employees, as these employees 
are eligible for benefits under the company’s defined contribution 401(k) plan. In connection with the Brakes Acquisition, Sysco assumed the obligations 
of various defined benefit pension plans that were maintained by the Brakes Group that cover certain employees, primarily in the U.K., France and 
Sweden; however, the U.K. defined benefit plan is frozen to plan participants. The funding policy for each plan complies with the requirements of relevant 
governmental laws and regulations.

In addition to receiving benefits upon retirement under the company’s Retirement Plan, certain key management personnel who were participants in the 
Management Incentive Plan (MIP) are entitled to receive benefits under a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). This plan is a nonqualified, 
unfunded supplementary retirement plan. This plan is frozen to all participants, and current MIP participants are eligible to participate in the MSP.

The company also provides certain health care benefits to eligible retirees and their dependents. These health care benefits represent Sysco’s unfunded 
other postretirement medical plans. The plan had benefit obligations of $13.6 million as of July 1, 2017 and $13.4 million as of July 2, 2016.

In order to meet a portion of its obligations under the SERP, Sysco has contributed to a rabbi trust, COLI policies on the lives of participants and interests 
in corporate-owned real estate assets. These assets are not included as plan assets or in the funded status amounts in the tables above and below. The 
life insurance policies on the lives of the participants had carrying values of $95.3 million as of July 1, 2017 and $97.0 million as of July 2, 2016. Sysco is 
the sole owner and beneficiary of such policies.

The company made cash contributions to its company-sponsored pension plans of $57.6 million and $157.5 million in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, 
respectively. The $25 million contribution to the U.S. Retirement Plan in fiscal 2017 was voluntary, as there were no required contributions to meet ERISA 
minimum funding requirements in fiscal 2017. There are no required contributions to the Retirement Plan to meet ERISA minimum funding requirements 
in fiscal 2018. The company’s contributions to the SERP plan are made in the amounts needed to fund current year benefit payments. The estimated 
aggregate fiscal 2018 contribution to fund benefit payments for the SERP plan is $30.5 million. The estimated fiscal 2018 contributions to fund benefit 
payments for the international retirement plans are $9.2 million.

For guidance in determining the discount rate for U.S. defined benefit plans, Sysco calculates the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of 
high-quality fixed-income investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the company-sponsored 
pension plans. Sysco uses an annualized corporate bond yield curve to estimate the rate at which pension benefits could effectively be settled to estimate 
a discount rate for the U.K. Retirement Plan. The discount rate assumption is updated annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The discount rates 
to be used for the calculation of fiscal 2018 net company-sponsored benefit costs for the U.S. Retirement Plan and U.K. Retirement Plan are 4.19% and 
2.60%, respectively. The discount rate to be used for the calculation of fiscal 2018 net company-sponsored benefit costs for the SERP is 4.08%.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption for the Retirement Plans are net return on assets assumption, representing gross return 
on assets less plan expenses. The expected return for the U.S. Retirement Plan is derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions 
as to the various asset class returns, reflecting a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and the forward-looking views of the financial 
markets regarding the yield on bonds, the historical returns of the major stock markets and returns on alternative investments. The expected return for the 
U.K. Retirement Plan is derived from a long-term swap yield time horizon adjusted for the expected return based on the plan’s current asset allocation and 
historical results. The rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The expected long-term rate of return to be used in 
the calculation of fiscal 2018 net company-sponsored benefit costs for the U.S. Retirement Plan and U.K. Retirement Plan are 7.0% and 4.55%, respectively.

Plan Assets

Investment Strategy

The company’s overall strategic investment objectives for the U.S. Retirement Plan are to preserve capital for future benefit payments and to balance risk and 
return commensurate with ongoing changes in the valuation of plan liabilities. Over time, the company intends to decrease the risk of the U.S. Retirement 
Plan’s investments in order to preserve the U.S. Retirement Plan’s funded status. In order to accomplish these objectives, the company oversees the U.S. 
Retirement Plan’s investment objectives and policy design, decides proper plan asset class strategies and structures, monitors the performance of plan 
investment managers and investment funds and determines the proper investment allocation of pension plan contributions. The company has created 
an investment structure for the U.S. Retirement Plan that takes into account the nature of the U.S. Retirement Plan’s liabilities. This structure ensures the 
U.S. Retirement Plan’s investments are diversified within each asset class, in addition to being diversified across asset classes with the intent to build asset 

71

Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

class portfolios that are structured without strategic bias for or against any subcategories within each asset class. The company has also created a set of 
investment guidelines for the U.S. Retirement Plan’s investment managers to specify prohibited transactions, including borrowing of money except for real 
estate, private equity or hedge fund portfolios where leverage is a key component of the investment strategy and permitted in the investments’ governing 
documents, the purchase of securities on margin unless fully collateralized by cash or cash equivalents or short sales, pledging, mortgaging or hypothecating 
of any securities, except for loans of securities that are fully collateralized, market timing transactions and the direct purchase of the securities of Sysco or 
the investment manager. The purchase or sale of derivatives for speculation or leverage is also prohibited; however, investment managers are allowed to 
use derivative securities so long as they do not increase the risk profile or leverage of the manager’s portfolio.

The U.S. Retirement Plan’s target and actual investment allocation as of July 1, 2017 is as follows:

Sysco’s U.S. Retirement Plan investment strategy is implemented through a combination of balanced and specialized investment managers, passive investment 
funds and actively managed investment funds. U.S. equity consists of both large-cap and small-to-mid-cap securities. Long duration fixed income investments 
include U.S. government and agency securities, corporate bonds from diversified industries, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, other 
debt securities and derivative securities. High yield fixed income consists of below investment grade corporate debt securities and may include derivative 
securities. Alternative investments may include private equity, private real estate, hedge funds, timberland, and commodities investments. Investment funds 
are selected based on each fund’s stated investment strategy to align with Sysco’s overall target mix of investments. Actual asset allocation is regularly 
reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the target allocation when considered appropriate.

The primary objective for the U.K. Retirement Plan is to provide sufficient assets to pay benefits as they fall due. The Retirement Plan has a return objective 
that aims to achieve a return on plan assets of 2.9% in excess of the return on the liability benchmark over rolling five year periods. The liability benchmark 
is the portfolio of swaps that best matches the liability profile of the Retirement Plan. The investment objective includes a risk statement that allows for the 
active risk within the plan asset portfolio to be below 12% per year, which may fluctuate over time as the composition of the portfolio changes and the levels 
of risk in markets change. The Retirement Plan’s Trustee and Solvency Manager seeks to achieve the Plan’s investment objectives by investing in a suitably 
diversified mix of assets. The company allows the Trustee and Solvency Manager to use derivatives such as forwards, futures, swaps and options for risk 
management and for the efficient implementation of the investment strategy. 

The company’s target and actual investment allocation as of July 1, 2017 is as follows:

The U.K. plan’s investment strategy is implemented primarily through a bespoke common contractual investment fund and liability hedging assets. The 
pooled investment fund consists of investment types including (1) equity investments covering a range of geographies and including investment managers 
that hold long and short positions, (2) credit investments including global investment grade and high yield bonds, loans and other debt and derivative 
securities, (3) property investments including global direct or indirect real estate holdings, (4) macro-oriented funds that seek to generate return by going 
long and short in a variety of markets and operate strategies which focus on markets rather than individual stocks and often use derivatives rather than 
physical assets, and (5) multi-strategy funds which combine a range of different credit, equity and macro-orientated ideas and dynamically allocate funds 
across asset classes. Actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the target allocation when considered appropriate.

As discussed above, the Retirement Plans’ investments in equities, debt instruments and alternative investments provide a range of returns and also expose 
the plan to investment risk. However, the investment policies put in place by the company require diversification of plan assets across issuers, industries 
and countries. As such, the Retirement Plans do not have significant concentrations of risk in plan assets.

Fair Value of Plan Assets

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
at the measurement date (i.e. an exit price). See Note 5, “Fair Value Measurements,” for a description of the fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities held by Sysco’s 
Retirement Plans measured at fair value.

Cash and cash equivalents: Valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these investments. Cash and cash 
equivalents is included as a Level 1 measurement in the table below.

Equity securities: Valued at the closing price reported on the exchange market. If a stock is not listed on a public exchange, such as an American Depository 
Receipt or some preferred stocks, the stock is valued using an evaluated bid price based on a compilation of observable market information. Inputs used 
include yields, the underlying security “best price”, adjustments for corporate actions and exchange prices of underlying and common stock of the same 
issuer. Equity securities valued at the closing price reported on the exchange market are classified as a Level 1 measurement in the table below.

Fixed income securities: Valued using evaluated bid prices based on a compilation of observable market information or a broker quote in a non-active market. 
Inputs used vary by type of security, but include spreads, yields, rate benchmarks, rate of prepayment, cash flows, rating changes and collateral performance 
and type. All fixed income securities are included as a Level 2 measurement in the table below.

Investment funds: Represents collective trust and funds holding debt, equity, hedge funds, private equity funds, exchange-traded real estate securities, and 
common contractual funds which are valued at the net asset value (NAV) provided by the manager of each fund. The NAV is calculated as the underlying 
net assets owned by the fund, divided by the number of shares outstanding. The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying securities within the fund. 
Non-exchange traded real estate funds are valued based on the proportionate interest held by the U.S. Retirement Plan, which is based on the valuations 
of the underlying real estate investments held by each fund. Each real estate investment is valued on the basis of a discounted cash flow approach. Inputs 
used include future rental receipts, expenses and residual values from a market participant view of the highest and best use of the real estate as rental 
property. The private equity funds are valued based on the proportionate interest held by the U.S. Retirement Plan, which is based on the valuations of the 
underlying private equity investments held by each fund. The hedge funds are valued based on the hedge funds’ proportionate share of the net assets of 
the underlying private investment fund as determined by the underlying private investment fund’s general partner. Indirectly held investments are valued 
utilizing the latest financial reports supplied by the fund’s portfolio investments. Directly held investments are valued initially based on transaction price and 
are adjusted utilizing available market data and investment-specific factors, such as estimates of liquidation value, prices of recent transactions in the same or 
similar issuer, current operating performance and future expectations of the particular investment, changes in market outlook and the financing environment.

Derivatives: Valuation method varies by type of derivative security.

 • Credit default and interest rate swaps: Valued using evaluated bid prices based on a compilation of observable market information. Inputs used for credit 
default swaps include spread curves and trade data about the credit quality of the counterparty. Inputs used for interest rate swaps include benchmark 
yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, and interdealer broker rates. Credit default and interest rate swaps are included as a Level 2 measurement in 
the table below.

 • Foreign currency contracts: Valued using a standardized interpolation model that utilizes the quoted prices for standard-length forward foreign currency 
contracts and adjusts to the remaining term outstanding on the contract being valued. Foreign currency contracts are included as a Level 2 measurement 
in the table below.

 • Futures and option contracts: Valued at the closing price reported on the exchange market for exchange-traded futures and options. Over-the-counter 
options are valued using pricing models that are based on observable market information. Exchange-traded futures and options are included as a 
Level 1 measurement in the table below; over-the-counter options are included as a Level 2 measurement.

NOTE 15  Multiemployer Employee Benefit Plans

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

Sysco participates in several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements 
covering union-represented employees. Expense is recognized at the time the contribution is made. Sysco does not directly manage these multiemployer 
plans, which are generally managed by boards of trustees, half of whom are appointed by the unions and the other half appointed by employers contributing 
to the plan. Approximately 13% of Sysco’s current employees in the U.S. are participants in such multiemployer plans as of July 1, 2017.

The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects:

 • Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.

 • If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.

 • If Sysco chooses to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans in the U.S, Sysco may be required to pay those plans an amount based on 

the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.

Based upon the information available from plan administrators, management believes that several of these multiemployer plans are underfunded. In addition, 
pension-related legislation in the U.S. requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of 
their underfunding. As a result, Sysco expects its contributions to these plans to increase in the future. In addition, if a U.S. multiemployer defined benefit 
plan fails to satisfy certain minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may impose a nondeductible excise tax of 5% on the amount 
of the accumulated funding deficiency for those employers contributing to the fund. Under current law regarding multiemployer defined benefit plans, a 
plan’s termination, Sysco’s voluntary withdrawal, or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any underfunded multiemployer defined benefit 
plan would require Sysco to make payments to the plan for Sysco’s proportionate share of the multiemployer plan’s unfunded vested liabilities.

Sysco’s Albany operating company withdrew from the New York State Teamsters Conference Pension and Retirement Fund in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
2017. As a result, a withdrawal liability of $35.6 million was accrued in the fourth quarter of 2017. 

Individually Significant Plans

The information in the following tables relates to multiemployer defined benefit pension plans which Sysco has determined to be individually significant to the 
company. To determine individually significant plans, the company evaluated several factors, including Sysco’s significance to the plan in terms of employees 
and contributions, the funded status of the plan and the size of the company’s potential withdrawal liability if it were to voluntarily withdraw from the plan.

The following table provides information about the funded status of individually significant plans:

 • The “EIN-PN” column provides the Employer Identification Number (EIN) and the three-digit plan number (PN).

 • The “Pension Protection Act Zone Status” columns provide the two most recent Pension Protection Act zone statuses available from each plan. The zone 
status is based on information that the company received from the plan’s administrators and is certified by each plan’s actuary. Among other factors, 
plans in the red zone are generally less than 65% funded, plans in the orange zone are both less than 80% funded and have an accumulated funding 
deficiency or are expected to have a deficiency in any of the next six plan years, plans in the yellow zone are less than 80% funded and plans in the 
green zone are at least 80% funded. The Multiemployer Protection Act of 2014 created a new zone called “critical and declining.” Plans are generally 
considered “critical and declining” if they are projected to become insolvent within 15 years. 

 • The “FIP/RP Status” column indicates whether a financial improvement plan (FIP) for yellow/orange zone plans or a rehabilitation plan (RP) for red zone 
plans is pending or implemented in the current year or was put in place in a prior year. A status of “Pending” indicates a FIP/RP has been approved 
but actual period covered by the FIP/RP has not begun. A status of “Implemented” means the period covered by the FIP/RP began in the current year 
or is ongoing.

 • The “Surcharge Imposed” column indicates whether a surcharge was paid during the most recent annual period presented for the company’s contributions 
to each plan in the red zone. If the company’s current collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with a plan satisfies the requirements of a pending but 
not yet implemented RP, then the payment of surcharges is not required and “No” will be reflected in this column. If the company’s current CBA with 
a plan does not yet satisfy the requirements of a pending but not yet implemented RP, then the payment of surcharges is required and “Yes” will be 
reflected in this column.

Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

In addition to the contributions to the defined benefit pension plans described above, Sysco also contributes to several multiemployer plans that provide 
other postretirement benefits in the U.S. and Canada based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering union-represented 
employees. These plans may provide medical, pharmacy, dental, vision, mental health and other benefits to active employees and retirees as determined 
by the trustees of each plan. Sysco contributed to these plans $25.8 million in fiscal 2017, $25.9 million in fiscal 2016 and $28.5 million in fiscal 2015. 
There have been no significant changes that affect the comparability of fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 contributions.

employee stock long-term incentive plans, a non-employee director plan and the Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP).

Stock Incentive Plans

In November 2013, Sysco’s Long-term Incentive Plan (2013 Plan) was adopted and reserved up to 55,600,000 shares of Sysco common stock for share-
based awards to employees, non-employee directors and key advisors. Of the 55,600,000 authorized shares, the full 55,600,000 shares may be issued as 
options or stock appreciation rights and up to 17,500,000 shares may be issued as restricted stock, restricted stock units or other types of stock-based 
awards. To date, Sysco has issued options, restricted stock units and performance share units under the 2013 Plan. Vesting requirements for awards under 
the 2013 Plan vary by individual grant and may include either time-based vesting or time-based vesting subject to acceleration based on performance 
criteria for fiscal periods of at least one year. The contractual life of all options granted under the 2013 Plan are and will be no greater than ten years. As of 
July 1, 2017, there were 32,457,613 remaining shares authorized and available for grant in total under the 2013 Plan, of which the full 32,457,613 shares 
may be issued as options or stock appreciation rights, or as a combination of up to 12,611,851 shares that may be issued as restricted stock, restricted 
stock units or other types of stock-based awards, with the remainder available for issuance as options or stock appreciation rights.

Sysco has also granted employee options under several previous employee stock option plans for which previously granted options remain outstanding 
as of July 1, 2017. No new options will be issued under any of the prior plans, as future grants to employees will be made through the 2013 Plan or 
subsequently adopted plans. Awards under these plans are subject to time-based vesting with vesting periods that vary by individual grant. The contractual 
life of all options granted under these plans is seven years.

In November 2009, Sysco’s 2009 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan (2009 NED Plan) was adopted and provided for the issuance of up to 750,000 shares 
of Sysco common stock as share-based awards to non-employee directors. The authorized shares were granted as restricted stock, restricted stock units, 
elected shares or additional shares. Vesting requirements for awards under the 2009 NED Plan varied by individual grant and include either time-based vesting 
or vesting based on performance criteria. As of July 1, 2017, there were no remaining shares authorized and available for grant under the 2009 NED Plan.

Performance Share Units

During fiscal 2017, 829,460 performance share units (PSUs) were granted to employees. Based on the jurisdiction in which the employee resides, some 
of these PSUs were granted with forfeitable dividend equivalents. The fair value of each PSU award granted with a dividend equivalent is based on the 
company’s stock price as of the date of grant. For PSUs granted without dividend equivalents, the fair value was reduced by the present value of expected 
dividends during the vesting period. The weighted average grant-date fair value per performance share unit granted during fiscal 2017 was $52.17. The 
PSUs will convert into shares of Sysco common stock at the end of the performance period based on financial performance targets consisting of Sysco’s 
earnings per share, compound annual growth rate and adjusted return on invested capital. 

Stock Options

Sysco’s option awards are subject to graded vesting over a requisite service period with compensation cost recognized on a straight-line basis over the 
requisite service period over the duration of the award.

In addition, certain of Sysco’s options provide that the options continue to vest as if the optionee continued as an employee or director if the optionee meets 
certain age and years of service thresholds upon retirement. In these cases, Sysco will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from 
the grant date to the date the employee or director first becomes eligible to retire with the options continuing to vest after retirement.

The fair value of each option award is estimated as of the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected dividend yield is estimated 
based on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for the year preceding the option grant. Expected volatility is based on historical 
volatility of Sysco’s stock, implied volatilities from traded options on Sysco’s stock and other factors. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option 
is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Sysco utilizes historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination 
behavior within the valuation model; separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately in determining 
the expected life of awards for valuation purposes.

The weighted average assumptions discussed above are noted in the table below for relevant periods as follows:

The total number of employee options granted was 4,990,396, 4,367,764 and 4,497,954 in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

During fiscal 2017, 1,529,997 and 3,460,399 options were granted to 9 executive officers and approximately 187 other key employees, respectively. During 
fiscal 2016, 1,495,351 and 2,872,413 options were granted to 8 executive officers and approximately 169 other key employees, respectively.  
During fiscal 2015, 1,286,533 and 3,211,421 options were granted to 6 executive officers and 173 other key employees, respectively.

The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $6.05, $5.99 and $5.78, respectively. The total intrinsic 
value of options exercised during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $22.1 million, $36.1 million and $21.6 million, respectively.

Restricted Stock Units

During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, restricted stock units of 631,281, 1,257,889 and 1,198,588 were granted to employees, respectively, the majority 
of which will vest ratably over a three-year period. Some of these restricted stock units were granted with dividend equivalents. The fair value of each 
restricted stock unit award granted with a dividend equivalent is based on the company’s stock price as of the date of grant. For restricted stock 
unit awards granted without dividend equivalents, the fair value was reduced by the present value of expected dividends as of the date of grant date 
during the vesting period. The weighted average grant date fair value per share of restricted stock units granted during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 
was $50.04, $42.78 and $37.59, respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock units vested during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $46.0 million, 
$43.4 million and $52.5 million, respectively.

Non-Employee Director Awards

During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, restricted awards of 40,498, 43,362 and 37,035 were granted to non-employee directors (NEDs), respectively, that 
will vest over a one-year period. NEDs may elect to receive these awards in restricted stock shares that will vest at the end of the award stated vesting 
period or as deferred units that convert into shares of Sysco common stock on a date subsequent to the award stated vesting date selected by the NED. 
The fair value of the restricted awards is based on the company’s stock price as of the date of grant. The weighted average grant date fair value of the 
shares granted during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $53.49, $40.59 and $38.89, respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock shares vested and 
deferred units distributed during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $2.0 million, $1.6 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Restricted stock shares are valued 
on their vesting date. Vested deferred units are valued on their subsequent conversion and distribution date.

NEDs may elect to receive up to 100% of their annual directors’ fees in Sysco common stock on either an annual or deferred basis. Sysco provides a 
matching grant of 50% of the number of shares received for the stock election subject to certain limitations. As a result of such elections, a total of 22,094, 
25,185 and 23,949 shares with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $51.46, $39.31 and $38.26 per share were issued in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 
2015, respectively, in the form of fully vested common stock or deferred units. The total fair value of common stock issued as a result of election shares 
and deferred units distributed during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $1.1 million, $1.0 million and $0.9 million, respectively. Common stock shares are 
valued on their vesting date. Vested deferred units are valued on their subsequent conversion and distribution date.

As of July 1, 2017, there were 112,779 fully vested deferred units outstanding that will convert into shares of Sysco common stock upon dates selected 
by the respective NED.

The Sysco ESPP permits employees to invest in Sysco common stock by means of periodic payroll deductions at a discount of 15% from the closing price 
on the last business day of each calendar quarter. The total number of shares which may be sold pursuant to the ESPP may not exceed 79,000,000 shares, 
of which 8,303,783 remained available as of July 1, 2017.

During fiscal 2017, 1,103,995 shares of Sysco common stock were purchased by the participants, as compared to 1,275,765 shares purchased in fiscal 
2016 and 1,243,275 shares purchased in fiscal 2015. The weighted average fair value of employee stock purchase rights issued pursuant to the ESPP 
was $7.73, $6.04 and $5.73 per share during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The fair value of the stock purchase rights was calculated as the 
difference between the stock price at date of issuance and the employee purchase price.

All Share-Based Payment Arrangements

The total share-based compensation cost included in operating expenses in the consolidated results of operations was $83.9 million, $79.5 million and 
$73.8 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The total income tax benefit for share-based compensation arrangements was $30.0 million, 
$30.7 million and $27.4 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

As of July 1, 2017, there was $95.4 million of total unrecognized share-based compensation cost, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-
average period of 2.07 years.

Cash received from option exercises and purchases of shares under the ESPP was $204.8 million, $282.4 million and $240.2 million during fiscal 2017, 
2016 and 2015, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from option exercises totaled $38.9 million, $42.5 million and $20.7 million 
during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The company’s deferred tax asset for net operating loss carryforwards as of July 1, 2017 consisted of state and foreign net operating tax loss carryforwards, 
whereas the deferred tax asset as of July 2, 2016 consisted primarily of state net operating tax loss carryforwards. The state net operating loss carryforwards 
outstanding as of July 1, 2017 expire in fiscal years 2018 through 2036. The foreign net operating loss carryfoward periods vary by jurisdiction, from 
17 years to unlimited.

The company assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets each period by considering whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of 
the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The company considers all available evidence (both positive and negative) in determining whether a valuation 
allowance is required. As a result of the company’s analysis, it was concluded that as of July 1, 2017 a valuation allowance of $114.2 million should be 
established through acquisition accounting against the portion of the deferred tax asset attributable to net operating losses of the Brakes Group. The 
company will continue to monitor facts and circumstances in the reassessment of the likelihood that net operating loss carryforwards will be realized.

The effective tax rate of 35.3% for fiscal 2017 was favorably impacted by tax credits allowed against U.S. Federal and State income tax liabilities, as well 
as a reduction of the statutory tax rate in certain foreign jurisdictions. Indefinitely reinvested earnings taxed at foreign statutory rates less than our domestic 
tax rate also had the impact of reducing the effective tax rate.

The effective tax rate of 33.7% for fiscal 2016 was favorably impacted by the favorable resolution of tax contingencies resulting in tax benefits of $29.6 million 
($10.6 million in tax and $19.0 million in interest). Costs associated with the redemption of the senior notes that had been issued in contemplation of the 
proposed merger with US Foods and charges incurred from the revision to the Company’s business technology strategy resulted in lower state taxes. 
Indefinitely reinvested earnings taxed at foreign statutory rates less than our domestic tax rate also had the impact of reducing the effective tax rate.

The effective tax rate of 31.9% for fiscal 2015 was favorably impacted by lower earnings in the U.S. primarily from the termination of the US Foods merger 
agreement, litigation costs, merger integration planning costs and interest expense attributable to the proposed merger of $693 million for the fiscal year. 
These costs were attributed to the company’s U.S. earnings, which has the highest tax rate of all of the jurisdictions where it remits taxes. These losses 
created low levels of earnings in the U.S. and generated net operating losses in certain states, making the company’s indefinitely reinvested earnings 
in its foreign operations a more predominant factor in its effective tax rate because those operations have lower tax rates. Additionally, Sysco made the 
decision to amend a prior U.S. tax return in order to maximize a foreign tax credit as opposed to a foreign tax deduction which also created benefit in our 
effective tax rate.

 As of July 1, 2017, the gross amount of liability for accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits was $10.7 million. As of July 2, 2016, 
the gross amount of liability for accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits was $14.9 million. The expense recorded for interest 
and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in fiscal 2017 was not material.

If Sysco were to recognize all unrecognized tax benefits recorded as of July 1, 2017, approximately $10.8 million of the $16.3 million reserve would reduce 
the effective tax rate. If Sysco were to recognize all unrecognized tax benefits recorded as of July 2, 2016, approximately $16.9 million of the $24.6 million 
reserve would reduce the effective tax rate. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits with respect to certain of the company’s 
unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease in the next twelve months either because Sysco’s positions are sustained on audit or because the 
company agrees to their disallowance. Items that may cause changes to unrecognized tax benefits primarily include the consideration of various filing 
requirements in various states and the allocation of income and expense between tax jurisdictions. In addition, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits 
recognized within the next twelve months may decrease due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain years in various jurisdictions; however, 
it is possible that a jurisdiction may open an audit on one of these years prior to the statute of limitations expiring. At this time, an estimate of the range of 
the reasonably possible change cannot be made.

Sysco’s federal tax returns for 2012 and subsequent tax years have been audited and/or have statutes of limitations that remain open for audit. As of 
July 1, 2017, Sysco’s tax returns in the majority of the state and local jurisdictions and Canada are no longer subject to audit for the years before 2009. 
However, in Canada, the company remains open to transfer pricing adjustments back to 2003 for some entities. Certain tax jurisdictions require partial 
to full payment on audit assessments or the posting of letters of credit in order to proceed to the appeals process. Although the outcome of tax audits 
is generally uncertain, the company believes that adequate amounts of tax, including interest and penalties, have been accrued for any adjustments that 
may result from those open years.

Other

Undistributed income of certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries at July 1, 2017 amounted to $1.4 billion, for which no deferred U.S. income tax provision has 
been recorded because Sysco intends to indefinitely reinvest such income in those foreign operations. An estimate of any U.S. income or foreign withholding 
taxes that may be applicable upon actual or deemed repatriation is not practical due to the complexities associated with the hypothetical calculation.

NOTE 20  Commitments And Contingencies 

Legal Proceedings

Sysco is engaged in various legal proceedings which have arisen but have not been fully adjudicated. The likelihood of loss for these legal proceedings, 
based on definitions within contingency accounting literature, ranges from remote to reasonably possible to probable. When probable and reasonably 
estimable, the losses have been accrued. Based on estimates of the range of potential losses associated with these matters, management does not believe 
the ultimate resolution of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the consolidated financial position 
or results of operations of the company. However, the final results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, and if the company failed to 
prevail in one or more of these legal matters, and the associated realized losses were to exceed the company’s current estimates of the range of potential 
losses, the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations could be materially adversely affected in future periods.

Other Commitments

Sysco has committed to aggregate product purchases for resale in order to benefit from a centralized approach to purchasing. A majority of these 
agreements expire within one year; however, certain agreements have terms through fiscal 2021. These agreements commit the company to a minimum 
volume at various pricing terms, including fixed pricing, variable pricing or a combination thereof. Minimum amounts committed to as of July 1, 2017 totaled 
approximately $1.9 billion. Minimum amounts committed to by year are as follows:

Sysco has contracts with various third-party service providers to receive information technology services. The services have been committed for periods 
up to fiscal 2022 and may be extended. As of July 1, 2017, the total remaining cost of the services over that period is expected to be approximately 
$445.1 million. A portion of this committed amount may be reduced by Sysco utilizing less than estimated resources and can be increased by Sysco 
utilizing more than estimated resources. Certain agreements allow adjustments for inflation. Sysco may also cancel a portion or all of the services provided 
subject to termination fees that decrease over time. If Sysco were to terminate all of the services in fiscal 2018, the estimated termination fees incurred in 
fiscal 2018 would be approximately $70.5 million.

NOTE 21  Business Segment Information

The Acquisition, combined with a change in how the chief operating decision maker assesses performance and allocates resources, resulted in a change 
in Sysco’s segment reporting in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Sysco has aggregated certain of its operating companies into three reportable segments. 
“Other” financial information is attributable to the company’s other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative disclosure thresholds.

 • U.S. Foodservice Operations - primarily includes U.S. Broadline operations, custom-cut meat and seafood companies, FreshPoint (our specialty produce 

companies) and European Imports (a specialty import company);

 • International Foodservice Operations - primarily includes broadline operations in Canada and Europe (including the Brakes Group, which was acquired 

in fiscal 2017), Bahamas, Mexico, Costa Rica and Panama, as well as a company that distributes to international customers;

 • SYGMA - our customized distribution subsidiary; and

 • Other - primarily our hotel supply operations and Sysco Labs, which includes our suite of technology solutions that help support the business needs 

of our customers and provides support for some of our business technology needs.

Broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to both traditional and chain restaurant 
customers, hospitals, schools, hotels, industrial caterers and other venues where foodservice products are served. SYGMA operating companies distribute 
a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to certain chain restaurant customer locations.

The accounting policies for the segments are the same as those disclosed by Sysco for its consolidated financial statements. Management evaluates the 
performance of each of our operating segments based on its respective operating income results. Corporate expenses generally include all expenses of 
the corporate office and Sysco’s shared services center. These also include all share-based compensation costs. While a segment’s operating income may 
be impacted in the short-term by increases or decreases in gross profits, expenses, or a combination thereof, over the long-term each business segment 
is expected to increase its operating income at a greater rate than sales growth. This is consistent with our long-term goal of leveraging earnings growth 
at a greater rate than sales growth.

NOTE 22  Supplemental Guarantor Information - Subsidiary Guarantees

On January 19, 2011, the wholly owned U.S. Broadline subsidiaries of Sysco Corporation entered into full and unconditional guarantees of all outstanding 
senior notes and debentures of Sysco Corporation. Borrowings under the company’s revolving credit facility supporting the company’s U.S. and Canadian 
commercial paper programs are also covered under these guarantees. As of July 1, 2017, Sysco had a total of $8.2 billion in senior notes, debentures 
and commercial paper outstanding that was covered by these guarantees.

All subsidiary guarantors are 100% owned by the parent company, all guarantees are full and unconditional and all guarantees are joint and several, 
except that the guarantee of any subsidiary guarantor with respect to a series of senior notes or debentures may be released under certain customary 
circumstances. If we exercise our defeasance option with respect to the senior notes or debentures of any series, then any subsidiary guarantor effectively 
will be released with respect to that series. Further, each subsidiary guarantee will remain in full force and effect until the earliest to occur of the date, if 
any, on which (1) the applicable subsidiary guarantor shall consolidate with or merge into Sysco Corporation or any successor of Sysco Corporation or 
(2) Sysco Corporation or any successor of Sysco Corporation consolidates with or merges into the applicable subsidiary guarantor.

The following condensed consolidating financial statements present separately the financial position, comprehensive income and cash flows of the parent 
issuer (Sysco Corporation), the guarantors (the majority of the company’s U.S. Broadline subsidiaries), and all other non-guarantor subsidiaries of Sysco 
(Other Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries) on a combined basis with eliminating entries.

ITEM 9 Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

ITEM 9  Changes in and Disagreements with 

Accountants on Accounting and Financial 
Disclosure

None.

ITEM 9A  Controls and Procedures

Sysco’s management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls 
and procedures as of July 1, 2017. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, 
means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports 
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and 
Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that 
information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the 
company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding the required 
disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance 
of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
Sysco’s disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Based on the evaluation 
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of July 1, 2017, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, Sysco’s 
disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Management’s evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures did 
not include the internal controls of the Brakes Group, which the company acquired on July 5, 2016. The Brakes Group’s total assets represented 25.2% 
of Sysco’s consolidated total assets as of July 1, 2017, and sales and net earnings constituted 9.3% and 4.2%, respectively, of Sysco’s consolidated sales 
and net earnings for the year-ended July 1, 2017. As the Acquisition occurred in the first quarter of 2017, we excluded the internal control over financial 
reporting of the Brakes Group entities from the scope of our assessment of the effectiveness of Sysco’s disclosure controls and procedures. This exclusion 
is in accordance with the general guidance issued by the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that an assessment of a recently acquired 
business may be omitted from our scope in the year of acquisition, if specified conditions are satisfied.

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting is included in the financial statement pages at page 48.

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange 
Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter ended July 1, 2017, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control 
over financial reporting.
