Fiscal 2018 Net Sales

$15.7 Billion

Total Company Net Sales by Product Platform

Total Company Net Sales by Reporting Segment

Our portfolio is focused on ﬁve global growth
platforms. We have leading positions in our
categories and compete with some of the most
iconic brands in the world. In addition, our platforms
are aligned with consumer food trends, giving them
attractive global growth outlooks.

In ﬁscal 2018, we reported net sales in four
operating segments. The majority of our 
business is focused in North America through
our North America Retail and Convenience 
Stores & Foodservice segments. We have great
opportunities outside of North America to grow our
business as well, leveraging the scale and resources 
of our global organization.

Fiscal 2018 
Joint Venture 
Net Sales

$1.1 Billion

In addition to $15.7 billion of consolidated net sales, 
our proportionate share of non-consolidated joint
venture net sales was $0.9 billion from Cereal Partners
Worldwide and $0.2 billion from Häagen-Dazs Japan.

In April 2018 we meaningfully reshaped our portfolio by acquiring 
Blue Buffalo, a high-growth, mission-driven natural pet food business 
that generated $1.3 billion in net sales in ﬁscal 2018. BLUE is one of 
the strongest and most recognizable pet food brands in the U.S., and 
is the undisputed leader in Wholesome Natural pet food, the fastest-
growing segment of the market. The business has enjoyed consistent 
double-digit top- and bottom-line growth in recent years, and we see 
tremendous growth opportunities ahead as we leverage General Mills’ 
capabilities to help Blue Buffalo achieve its objective of reaching more 
pet parents and feeding more pets.

2018 ANNUAL REPORT(cid:18) 1

Dear Fellow Shareholders,

This year we established three global growth 
priorities that are critical to restoring sustainable 
topline growth for General Mills:

1. Compete effectively across all our brands 
and geographies with compelling innovation and 
consumer news.

2. Accelerate our four differential growth platforms: 
Häagen-Dazs ice cream, snack bars, Old El Paso 
Mexican food, and our portfolio of natural and 
organic food brands.

3. Reshape our portfolio for stronger growth 
through strategic acquisitions and divestitures.

In ﬁscal 2018 we made important progress against 
these priorities. We competed more effectively, with
strong innovation, marketing, and in-store execution 
driving positive organic net sales growth in each of 
our last three ﬁscal quarters. As a result, our full-year
organic net sales growth rate ﬁnished ahead of our 
target and improved by 400 basis points versus the 
prior year. We developed new strategic growth plans
for the four platforms that comprise our Accelerate 
businesses and began to execute against them in the 
latter part of the ﬁscal year. And we moved to reshape
our portfolio with the acquisition of Blue Buffalo, a fast-
growing, highly proﬁtable business that is leading the 
transformation of the U.S. pet food category.

We continued to drive efficiency in our operations 
in ﬁscal 2018, generating substantial savings from
Holistic Margin Management and other cost-reduction
initiatives. However, these results were not enough to 
offset a marked increase in input cost inﬂation and 
other cost headwinds, leading to operating proﬁt
results that ﬁnished below our plan. Our disciplined 
focus on cash and success in reducing core working
capital resulted in free cash ﬂow of $2.2 billion, an 
increase of 28 percent over the prior year.

As we turn to ﬁscal 2019, we’ll continue to follow 
our Consumer First strategy and execute against
our global growth priorities to further improve our 
topline momentum. We’ll compete effectively across
our portfolio, including on our large global platforms
like cereal and yogurt. We’ll increase investments
to accelerate our differential growth platforms. And 
we’ll continue to reshape our portfolio by maximizing 

2(cid:2) GENERAL MILLS

Jeffrey L. Harmening 
Chief Executive Officer

the growth opportunities for Blue Buffalo and
assessing opportunities to divest businesses that
are growth dilutive.

We’ll also beneﬁt from key capabilities that we’ve
built recently, including E-commerce and Strategic
Revenue Management. These capabilities will drive
growth for our brands in ﬁscal 2019, and they’re 
critical to our ability to generate consistent sales 
growth in the years to come. In addition, we’re keenly
focused on maintaining our efficiency in this more
inﬂationary cost environment, and we have initiatives 
underway to help protect our proﬁtability.

I want to close by thanking our talented team of 
40,000 employees around the world, who remain 
committed to our company and passionate about our
purpose of serving the world by making food people 
love. I also want to thank you, our shareholders, for
your investment in General Mills. We appreciate your 
conﬁdence in our business, and we look forward to
delivering on our goals and driving growth and returns 
for you in the years to come.

Sincerely,

Jeff Harmening 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

PART I

ITEM 1 Business

General Mills, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1928. The terms “General Mills,” “Company,” “registrant,”
“we,” “us,” and “our” mean General Mills, Inc. and all subsidiaries included in the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 of this report unless the context indicates otherwise.

Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report.

COMPANY OVERVIEW

We are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer foods sold through retail stores. We
also are a leading supplier of branded and unbranded food products to the North American foodservice and
commercial baking industries. Following our acquisition of Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc. (Blue Buffalo) in
fiscal 2018, we are also a leading manufacturer and marketer in the wholesome natural pet food category. We
manufacture our products in 13 countries and market them in more than 100 countries. In addition to our
consolidated operations, we have 50 percent interests in two strategic joint ventures that manufacture and market
food products sold in more than 130 countries worldwide.

On April 24, 2018, we acquired Blue Buffalo for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 billion. We financed the
transaction with a combination of $6.0 billion in debt, $1.0 billion in equity, and cash on hand. The consolidated
results of Blue Buffalo will be reported as our Pet operating segment in future periods on a one-month lag.
Accordingly, in fiscal 2018, our Consolidated Statements of Earnings do not include Pet operating segment
results. For further information on the acquisition of Blue Buffalo, please see Note 3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

We manage and review the financial results of our business under five operating segments: North America
Retail; Convenience Stores & Foodservice; Europe & Australia; Asia & Latin America; and Pet. See
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) in Item 7 of
this report for a description of our segments and certain changes made to our segments in fiscal 2017. For
financial information by segment and geographic area, please see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 of this report.

We offer a variety of food products that provide great taste, nutrition, convenience and value for consumers
around the world, with a focus on six large global categories:

•

•

•

•

•

•

snacks, including grain, fruit and savory snacks, nutrition bars, and frozen hot snacks;

ready-to-eat cereal;

convenient meals, including meal kits, ethnic meals, pizza, soup, side dish mixes, frozen breakfast, and
frozen entrees;

yogurt;

pet food; and

super-premium ice cream.

Other significant product categories include:

•

•

baking mixes and ingredients; and

refrigerated and frozen dough.

3

Our Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW) joint venture with Nestlé S.A. (Nestlé) competes in the ready-to-eat
cereal category in markets outside North America, and our Häagen-Dazs Japan, Inc. (HDJ) joint venture
competes in the super-premium ice cream category in Japan. For net sales contributed by each class of similar
products, please see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

Customers. Our primary customers are grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food
chains, drug, dollar and discount chains, e-commerce retailers, commercial and noncommercial foodservice
distributors and operators, restaurants, convenience stores, and pet specialty stores. We generally sell to these
customers through our direct sales force. We use broker and distribution arrangements for certain products and to
serve certain types of customers. For further information on our customer credit and product return practices,
please refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. During fiscal 2018,
Walmart Inc. and its affiliates (Walmart) accounted for 21 percent of our consolidated net sales and 30 percent of
net sales of our North America Retail segment. No other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our
consolidated net sales. For further information on significant customers, please refer to Note 7 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

Competition. The packaged foods categories are highly competitive, with numerous manufacturers of varying
sizes in the United States and throughout the world. The categories in which we participate also are very
competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers, as well as retailers with their own
branded products. Competitors market and sell their products through brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce.
All of our principal competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. Competition in our
product categories is based on product
innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty,
effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer, and the
ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. Our principal strategies for competing in each of our
segments include unique consumer insights, effective customer relationships, superior product quality, innovative
advertising, product promotion, product innovation aligned with consumers’ needs, an efficient supply chain, and
price. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised, branded products, but also
with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices.
Internationally, we compete with both multi-national and local manufacturers, and each country includes a
unique group of competitors.

Raw materials, ingredients, and packaging. The principal raw materials that we use are grains (wheat, oats, and
corn), dairy products, sugar, fruits, vegetable oils, meats, nuts, vegetables, and other agricultural products. We
also use substantial quantities of carton board, corrugated, plastic and metal packaging materials, operating
supplies, and energy. Most of these inputs for our domestic and Canadian operations are purchased from
suppliers in the United States. In our other international operations, inputs that are not locally available in
adequate supply may be imported from other countries. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to
external conditions such as weather, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations,
currency fluctuations, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. We have
some long-term fixed price contracts, but the majority of our inputs are purchased on the open market. We
believe that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of needed inputs. Occasionally and where possible, we
make advance purchases of items significant to our business in order to ensure continuity of operations. Our
objective is to procure materials meeting both our quality standards and our production needs at price levels that
allow a targeted profit margin. Since these inputs generally represent the largest variable cost in manufacturing
our products, to the extent possible, we often manage the risk associated with adverse price movements for some
inputs using a variety of risk management strategies. We also have a grain merchandising operation that provides
us efficient access to, and more informed knowledge of, various commodity markets, principally wheat and oats.
This operation holds physical inventories that are carried at net realizable value and uses derivatives to manage
its net inventory position and minimize its market exposures.

4

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Our research and development resources are focused on new product development, product improvement,
process design and improvement, packaging, and exploratory research in new business and technology areas.
Research and development expenditures were $219 million in fiscal 2018, $218 million in fiscal 2017, and
$222 million in fiscal 2016.

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS

Our products are marketed under a variety of valuable trademarks. Some of the more important trademarks used
in our global operations (set forth in italics in this report) include Annie’s, Betty Crocker, Bisquick, Blue Buffalo,
BLUE Basics, BLUE Freedom, BLUE Wilderness, Bugles, Cascadian Farm, Cheerios, Chex, Cinnamon Toast
Crunch, Cocoa Puffs, Cookie Crisp, EPIC, Fiber One, Food Should Taste Good, Fruit by the Foot, Fruit
Gushers, Fruit Roll-Ups, Gardetto’s, Go-Gurt, Gold Medal, Golden Grahams, Häagen-Dazs, Helpers, Jeno’s,
Jus-Rol, Kitano, Kix, La Salteña, Lärabar, Latina, Liberté, Lucky Charms, Muir Glen, Nature Valley, Oatmeal
Crisp, Old El Paso, Pillsbury, Progresso, Raisin Nut Bran, Total, Totino’s, Trix, Wanchai Ferry, Wheaties, Yoki,
and Yoplait. We protect
these marks as appropriate through registrations in the United States and other
jurisdictions. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use or their
registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of
trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely for as long as the trademarks are in use.

Some of our products are marketed under or in combination with trademarks that have been licensed from others
for both long-standing products (e.g., Reese’s Puffs for cereal, Green Giant for vegetables in certain countries,
and Cinnabon for refrigerated dough, frozen pastries, and baking products) and shorter term promotional
products (e.g., fruit snacks sold under various third party equities).

Our cereal trademarks are licensed to CPW and may be used in association with the Nestlé trademark. Nestlé
licenses certain of its trademarks to CPW, including the Nestlé and Uncle Toby’s trademarks. The Häagen-Dazs
trademark is licensed royalty-free and exclusively to Nestlé for ice cream and other frozen dessert products in the
United States and Canada. The Häagen-Dazs trademark is also licensed to HDJ. The J. M. Smucker Company
holds an exclusive royalty-free license to use the Pillsbury brand and the Pillsbury Doughboy character in the
dessert mix and baking mix categories in the United States and under limited circumstances in Canada and
Mexico.

The Yoplait trademark and other related trademarks are owned by Yoplait Marques SNC, an entity in which we
own a 50 percent interest. These marks are licensed exclusively to Yoplait SAS, an entity in which we own a
51 percent interest. Yoplait SAS licenses these trademarks to its franchisees. The Liberté trademark and other
related trademarks are owned by Liberté Marques Sàrl, an entity in which we own a 50 percent interest.

We continue our focus on developing and marketing innovative, proprietary products, many of which use
proprietary expertise, recipes and formulations. We consider the collective rights under our various patents,
which expire from time to time, a valuable asset, but we do not believe that our businesses are materially
dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents.

SEASONALITY

In general, demand for our products is evenly balanced throughout the year. However, within our North America
Retail segment demand for refrigerated dough, frozen baked goods, and baking products is stronger in the fourth
calendar quarter. Demand for Progresso soup is higher during the fall and winter months. Internationally, within
our Europe & Australia and Asia & Latin America segments, demand for Häagen-Dazs ice cream is higher
during the summer months and demand for baking mix and dough products increases during winter months. Due
to the offsetting impact of these demand trends, as well as the different seasons in the northern and southern
hemispheres, our international segments’ net sales are generally evenly balanced throughout the year.

5

BACKLOG

Orders are generally filled within a few days of receipt and are subject to cancellation at any time prior to
shipment. The backlog of any unfilled orders as of May 27, 2018, was not material.

WORKING CAPITAL

A description of our working capital is included in the Liquidity section of MD&A in Item 7 of this report. Our
product return practices are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

EMPLOYEES

As of May 27, 2018, we had approximately 40,000 full- and part-time employees.

QUALITY AND SAFETY REGULATION

The manufacture and sale of consumer and pet food products is highly regulated. In the United States, our
activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies, including the Food and Drug
Administration, Department of Agriculture, Federal Trade Commission, Department of Commerce, and
Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. Our business is also regulated by
similar agencies outside of the United States.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

As of May 27, 2018, we were involved with two active cleanup sites associated with the alleged or threatened
release of hazardous substances or wastes located in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Moonachie, New Jersey.

Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act,
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, and the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, and all similar state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations
applicable to the jurisdictions in which we operate.

Based on current facts and circumstances, we believe that neither the results of our environmental proceedings
nor our compliance in general with environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect upon
our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.

ITEM 1A Risk Factors

Our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks described below could materially,
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The categories in which we participate are very competitive, and if we are not able to compete effectively,
our results of operations could be adversely affected.

The consumer and pet food categories in which we participate are very competitive. Our principal competitors in
these categories are manufacturers, as well as retailers with their own branded and private label products.
Competitors market and sell their products through brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce. All of our principal
competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. In most product categories, we compete
not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with regional brands and with generic and
private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition in our product categories is based on
product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional
activity, convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer
preferences. If our large competitors were to seek an advantage through pricing or promotional changes, we
could choose to do the same, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability. If we did not do the

8

same, our revenues and market share could be adversely affected. Our market share and revenue growth could
also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing
consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors. If we are unable to build and sustain
brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing
over generic and private label products.

We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment.

There has been significant consolidation in the grocery industry, resulting in customers with increased
purchasing power. In addition, large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability
through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand name products, increased
emphasis on generic and other economy brands, and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to use our
scale, marketing expertise, product
innovation, knowledge of consumers’ needs, and category leadership
positions to respond to these demands, our profitability and volume growth could be negatively impacted. In
addition, the loss of any large customer could adversely affect our sales and profits. In fiscal 2018, Walmart
accounted for 21 percent of our consolidated net sales and 30 percent of net sales of our North America Retail
segment. In its fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, PetSmart (including Chewy.com as of June 1, 2017) and
Petco accounted for 41 percent and 18 percent, respectively, of Blue Buffalo’s net sales. National pet superstore
chains have experienced reduced store traffic. If national pet superstore chains continue to experience reduced
store traffic, or experience any operational difficulties, our Pet segment operating results may be adversely
affected. For more information on significant customers, please see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 of this report.

Price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials, packaging, and energy may adversely
affect our profitability.

The principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external
conditions such as weather, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations, currency
fluctuations, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. Commodity price
changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material, packaging, and energy costs. If we are unable to
increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices, we may experience reduced margins
and profitability. We do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and the risk management
procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend.

Volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity
prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings.

We utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs, including
grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principally soybean), dairy products, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Changes in
the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently, resulting in volatility in both gross margin and
net earnings. These gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and
in unallocated corporate items outside our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our
manufacturing process, at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit. We also
record our grain inventories at net realizable value. We may experience volatile earnings as a result of these
accounting treatments.

If we are not efficient in our production, our profitability could suffer as a result of the highly competitive
environment in which we operate.

Our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and
manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets. Gaining additional efficiencies may become more
difficult over time. Our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs

9

resulting from acquisitions or divestitures could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive
position. Many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and production
lines. Such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production, which may negatively impact
product volume and margins. We are currently pursuing several multi-year restructuring and cost savings
initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and reduce expenses. If we are unable to execute those initiatives
as planned, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our business
and results of operations.

Disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business.

Our ability to make, move, and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to raw material
supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, including any potential effects of
climate change, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, cyber-attack, pandemic, strikes, import/export restrictions, or
other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Many of our product lines are
manufactured at a single location. Our suppliers’ policies and practices can damage our reputation and the quality
and safety of our products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such
events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single
supplier or location, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as require additional
resources to restore our supply chain.

Concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoid certain food
products or ingredients.

We could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of
certain food products or ingredients. Adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may
discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.

If our products become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled, we might need to recall those items and
may experience product liability claims if consumers or their pets are injured.

We may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled. A
widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product
inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses
from a significant product liability judgment against us. A significant product recall or product liability case
could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our
products, which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands.

We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends, which may result in
decreased demand for our products.

Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes, eating habits and purchasing behaviors of
consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences in channels where they shop. Consumer
preferences and category-level consumption may change from time to time and can be affected by a number of
different trends and other factors. If we fail to anticipate, identify or react to these changes and trends, such as
adapting to emerging e-commerce channels, or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, we
may experience reduced demand for our products, which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to
suffer. Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of
ingredients such as sodium, trans fats, genetically modified organisms, sugar, processed wheat, or other product
ingredients or attributes.

10

We may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more
profitable categories.

The food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth. Our success depends in part on our
ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve. One way to achieve
that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable
categories. Our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product
categories. If we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories, our growth
may slow, which could adversely affect our profitability.

Economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products.

The willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions. In periods
of economic uncertainty, consumers may purchase more generic, private label, and other economy brands and
may forego certain purchases altogether. In those circumstances, we could experience a reduction in sales of
higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings. In addition, as a result of
economic conditions or competitive actions, we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins.
Consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase
products from our Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment. Any of these events could have an adverse effect
on our results of operations.

Our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our
brands.

Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our
business. The value of our brands is based in large part on the degree to which consumers react and respond
positively to these brands. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including
consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, our
failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive
consumer experiences, concerns about food safety, or our products becoming unavailable to consumers.
Consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional
support. The use of social and digital media by consumers, us, and third parties increases the speed and extent
that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our
brands, or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not
maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our business results could be negatively impacted.

Our international operations are subject to political and economic risks.

In fiscal 2018, 29 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the United States. We are
accordingly subject
to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally, any of which could
significantly harm our business. These risks include:

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

political and economic instability;
exchange controls and currency exchange rates;
tariffs on products and ingredients that we import and export;
nationalization of operations;
compliance with anti-corruption regulations;
foreign tax treaties and policies; and
restriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries,
consequences.

including potentially negative tax

Our financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange
rates. These fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations. Our principal exposures are

11

to the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese
yen, Mexican peso, and Swiss franc. From time to time, we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the
effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations, but these agreements may not be effective in significantly
reducing our exposure.

New regulations or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect our business.

Our facilities and products are subject
to many laws and regulations administered by the United States
Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the production,
packaging, labelling, storage, distribution, quality, and safety of food products and the health and safety of our
employees. Our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative
penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls of our products. We advertise our products
and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreign
laws and regulations. We may also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our
products, including restrictions on the audience to whom products are marketed. Changes in laws or regulations
that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our
actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.

We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Our failure to
comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil
remedies. We are currently party to a variety of environmental remediation obligations. Due to regulatory
complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation, and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former
properties of ours, the potential exists for remediation, liability, indemnification, and compliance costs to differ
from our estimates. We cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters, or compliance with
environmental laws in general, will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on
our business and results of operations.

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit financing and other options and in some
cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends.

As of May 27, 2018, we had total debt, redeemable interests, and noncontrolling interests of $16.9 billion. The
agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured
indebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness may limit our:

•

•

ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes,
particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and
flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a
downturn in general economic conditions.

There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests.
If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness (and other unrelated indebtedness)
could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative
financing may also be adversely affected.

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our
operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial,
business, and other factors beyond our control.

12

Global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of
borrowing, and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers.

We depend on stable, liquid, and well-functioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations. Although we
believe that our operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital and credit markets, and revolving credit
agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that
future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs
of borrowing. We also utilize interest rate derivatives to reduce the volatility of our financing costs. If we are not
effective in hedging this volatility, we may experience an increase in our costs of borrowing. Our business could
also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital
and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy.

Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase our
defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit costs.

We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the United States, Canada, and various foreign
locations, including defined benefit pension, retiree health and welfare, severance, and other postemployment
plans. Our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified
portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early
retirement rates, investment returns, and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our
defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the
plans. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on
our results of operations and cash flows from operations.

Our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform
adequately or are breached.

Information technology serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business. We rely
on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic
information to manage a variety of business processes and to comply with regulatory,
legal, and tax
requirements. Our information technology systems and infrastructure are critical to effectively manage our key
business processes including digital marketing, order entry and fulfillment, supply chain management, finance,
administration, and other business processes. These technologies enable internal and external communication
among our locations, employees, suppliers, customers, and others and include the receipt and storage of personal
information about our employees, consumers, and proprietary business information. Our information technology
systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, may be vulnerable to damage,
interruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events, natural disasters, fires, power
outages, systems failures, telecommunications failures, security breaches, computer viruses, hackers, employee
error or malfeasance, and other causes. Increased cyber-security threats pose a potential risk to the security and
viability of our information technology systems, as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the
data stored on those systems. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate
could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, data loss, legal claims or
proceedings, regulatory penalties, and the loss of sales and customers. Any interruption of our information
technology systems could have operational, reputational, legal, and financial impacts that may have a material
adverse effect on our business.

A change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-
average cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinite-lived intangible assets could
negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.

As of May 27, 2018, we had $20.9 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill for each of
our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate

13

that impairment may have occurred. We compare the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to
the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the
reporting unit, including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on
a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range
planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables,
and other factors. Our Latin America and U.S. Yogurt reporting units have experienced declining business
performance and we continue to monitor these businesses. While we currently believe that our goodwill is not
impaired, different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant
impairment losses.

We evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets, primarily intangible assets associated with the Blue Buffalo,
Pillsbury, Totino’s, Progresso, Yoplait, Old El Paso, Yoki, Häagen-Dazs, and Annie’s brands, to determine if
they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and
assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as
the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or
changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels),
the level of required
maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.

Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Our estimate of the fair value of the
brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projected revenues from our long-range
plan, assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. Our Yoki,
Mountain High, Progresso, Food Should Taste Good, and Green Giant brands have experienced declining
business performance, and we will continue to monitor these businesses. For further information on goodwill and
intangible assets, please refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Blue Buffalo acquisition or those benefits may
take longer to realize than expected.

Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Blue Buffalo acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our
ability to integrate Blue Buffalo, which is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. We have never
operated in the pet food sector and our lack of experience in this sector may hinder our ability to manage Blue
Buffalo successfully following the acquisition.

The integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, could restrict the realization
of the full expected benefits. The failure to meet the challenges involved in the integration process and to realize
the anticipated benefits of the Blue Buffalo acquisition could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in,
our operations and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, the integration of Blue Buffalo may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities,
competitive responses, and loss of customers and other business relationships. Additional integration challenges
include:

•
•

•
•

•
•

diversion of management’s attention to integration matters;
difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects
from the acquisition;
difficulties in the integration of operations and systems;
difficulties in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business
cultures and compensation structures;
difficulties in the assimilation of employees;
challenges in keeping existing customers, including Blue Buffalo’s largest customer that accounted for
41% of its fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 net sales and obtaining new customers;

14

•
•
•
•

difficulties in building and operating new and existing manufacturing facilities;
challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel;
the impact of potential liabilities we may be inheriting from Blue Buffalo; and
coordinating a geographically dispersed organization.

Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs,
decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and result in us becoming subject to
litigation. In addition, even if Blue Buffalo is integrated successfully, the full anticipated benefits of the
acquisition may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are
anticipated. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional
unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process. All of these factors could cause reductions in our
earnings per share and decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition. As a result, it cannot be
assured that the Blue Buffalo acquisition will result in the realization of the full or any anticipated benefits.

Blue Buffalo may underperform relative to our expectations.

The business and financial performance of Blue Buffalo are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. We may
not be able to maintain the growth rate, levels of revenue, earnings, or operating efficiency that we and Blue
Buffalo have achieved or might achieve separately. Our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition and results of operations.

Our failure to successfully integrate other acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect
our financial results.

From time to time, we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives.
Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate acquired and existing operations. If we are unable to
successfully integrate acquisitions, our financial results could suffer. Additional potential risks associated with
acquisitions include additional debt leverage, the loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business,
the assumption of unknown liabilities, the inherent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of
business in which we have no or limited prior experience, failure to achieve anticipated synergies, and the
impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets.

ITEM 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

We are a global packaged foods company. We develop distinctive value-added food products and market them
under unique brand names. We work continuously to improve our core products and to create new products that
meet consumers’ evolving needs and preferences. In addition, we build the equity of our brands over time with
strong consumer-directed marketing, innovative new products, and effective merchandising. We believe our
brand-building strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe.

Our fundamental financial goal is to generate superior returns for our shareholders over the long term. We
believe that increases in net sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share (EPS), free cash flow, cash return
to shareholders, and return on average total capital are key drivers of financial performance for our business.

Our long-term growth objectives are to consistently deliver:

low single-digit annual growth in organic net sales;

•
• mid single-digit annual growth in total segment operating profit;
•
•
•
•

high single-digit annual growth in diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability;
improvement in adjusted return on average total capital;
free cash flow conversion averaging above 95 percent of adjusted net earnings after tax; and
cash return to shareholders averaging above 90 percent of free cash flow, including an attractive dividend
yield.

We believe that this financial performance should result in long-term value creation for shareholders.

Fiscal 2018 represented an important step in returning our business to sustainable topline growth. We made
significant progress toward competing more effectively, with strong innovation, marketing, and in-store
execution driving positive organic sales growth in each of our last three fiscal quarters. We also moved to
reshape our portfolio for future growth with the acquisition of Blue Buffalo, a fast-growing, highly profitable pet
food business. While our full-year profit results fell short of our initial plans, we finished fiscal 2018, delivering
growth in net sales, total segment operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, and adjusted diluted EPS in
the fourth quarter. We maintained a disciplined focus on cash generation, resulting in significant growth in free
cash flow this year. We generated substantial Holistic Margin Management (HMM) savings, and we reached our
expected annualized savings goal of $700 million in fiscal 2018, compared to the fiscal 2015 base, from recent
restructuring actions. However, these results were not enough to offset heightened input cost inflation, increases
in other costs impacting cost of sales, and higher merchandising expense. Importantly, we made investments to
accelerate our differential growth platforms and expanded our capabilities in e-commerce and Strategic Revenue
Management (SRM), which are critical to future growth.

Net sales growth rates for our North American Retail operating segment improved significantly compared to
fiscal 2017 as good consumer marketing support, strong innovation, and improved in-store execution helped
restore momentum. Our Convenience Stores & Foodservice operating segment’s net sales increased on
innovation behind Focus 6 platforms and market-index pricing on flour. Our Europe & Australia segment’s net
sales increased on favorable foreign currency exchange and successful innovation and distribution expansion for
ice cream and snack bars. In our Asia & Latin America segment, improved in-market execution in Asia was
overshadowed by a difficult general ledger implementation and a comparison to fiscal 2017 that included an
extra month of results reported for Brazil. All of our segments’ operating profit results were impacted by higher
than expected input cost inflation that was not fully offset by our HMM initiatives.

Our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2018 rose 1 percent to $15.7 billion. On an organic basis, net sales
essentially matched year-ago levels. Operating profit of $2.5 billion decreased 2 percent. Total segment operating

19

profit of $2.8 billion declined 5 percent and declined 6 percent on a constant-currency basis. Diluted EPS of
$3.64 was up 31 percent compared to fiscal 2017. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting
comparability of results, was up 1 percent to $3.11 per share and was flat on a constant-currency basis. Our
return on average total capital was 12.7 percent, and adjusted return on average total capital decreased 190 basis
points to 9.7 percent and decreased 200 basis points on a constant-currency basis (See the “Non-GAAP
Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP)).

Net cash provided by operations totaled $2.8 billion in fiscal 2018 representing a conversion rate of 131 percent
of net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. This cash generation
supported capital investments totaling $623 million, and our resulting free cash flow was $2.2 billion at a
conversion rate of 120 percent of adjusted net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and
noncontrolling interests. We also returned significant cash to shareholders through dividends totaling $1.1 billion
and share repurchases totaling $602 million.

A detailed review of our fiscal 2018 performance appears below in the section titled “Fiscal 2018 Consolidated
Results of Operations.”

As we turn to fiscal 2019, we remain focused on our Consumer First strategy and our global growth priorities to
further improve our topline momentum. We plan to compete effectively across all our brands and geographies,
increase investments to accelerate our differential growth platforms, and maximize the growth opportunities for
Blue Buffalo as we integrate the business into the General Mills portfolio. We also plan to maintain our
efficiency in this more inflationary cost environment, and we have initiatives underway to help protect our
profitability. We expect the operating environment in fiscal 2019 to continue to be dynamic, requiring us to
increase our agility while remaining focused on delivering on consumers’ expectations. Our fiscal 2019 targets
reflect the investments we are making to enhance our capabilities and accelerate our growth, as well as the
impact of adding Blue Buffalo to our portfolio. We believe that these initiatives will drive strong returns over the
long term and further advance us toward our goal of consistently delivering profitable growth and top-tier returns
for our shareholders.

Our key full-year fiscal 2019 targets include:

•

•

•

Organic net sales are expected to be in a range between flat and up 1 percent. Including the impact of the
Blue Buffalo acquisition, net sales are expected to increase 9 to 10 percent.
Constant-currency adjusted operating profit
$2.7 billion reported in fiscal 2018.
Constant-currency adjusted diluted EPS are expected to range between flat and down 3 percent from the base
of $3.11 earned in fiscal 2018. This estimate includes a 4-cent headwind related to the Blue Buffalo
acquisition, driven by the impact of purchase accounting.

is expected to increase 6 to 9 percent from the base of

We continue to pursue our Consumer First strategy and execute against our three key growth priorities: 1)
competing effectively on all brands and across all geographies through strong innovation, effective consumer
marketing, and excellent in-store execution; 2) accelerating growth on our four differential growth platforms
including Häagen-Dazs ice cream, snack bars, Old El Paso Mexican food, and our portfolio of natural and
organic food brands; and 3) reshaping our portfolio through growth-enhancing transactions, including the recent
acquisition of Blue Buffalo. We also intend to pursue divestitures of growth-dilutive businesses to further
reshape our portfolio. By focusing on these priorities, we expect to generate consistent topline growth, which,
when balanced with a disciplined focus on margin expansion, cash conversion, and cash returns, should create
significant value for our shareholders.

FISCAL 2018 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

On April 24, 2018, we acquired Blue Buffalo, which became our Pet operating segment. We are reporting the Pet
operating segment results on a one-month lag and accordingly, in fiscal 2018, our results do not include Pet
segment operating results.

In fiscal 2018, net sales increased 1 percent compared to last year. Operating profit margin of 15.9 percent was
down 50 basis points from year-ago levels primarily driven by lower segment operating profit results partially
offset by a decrease in restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs and favorable mark-to-market valuation of
certain commodity positions. Adjusted operating profit margin decreased 90 basis points to 17.2 percent,
primarily driven by higher input costs including currency-driven inflation on imported products in certain
markets partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative expenses. Diluted earnings per share of
$3.64 increased 31 percent compared to fiscal 2017, and adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items
affecting comparability, essentially matched year-ago levels on a constant-currency basis (see the “Non-GAAP
Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).

The 1 percent increase in net sales in fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by favorable net price realization and mix
and favorable foreign currency exchange, partially offset by lower contributions from volume growth. The
Convenience Stores & Foodservice and Europe & Australia segments contributed to the increase in net sales in
fiscal 2018 compared to the same period last year, while the North America Retail and Asia & Latin America
segments decreased.

Organic net sales in fiscal 2018 were flat compared to fiscal 2017, with contributions from organic volume
growth in the Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment offset by organic volume declines in the Europe &
Australia and Asia & Latin America segments.

Cost of sales increased $257 million in fiscal 2018 to $10,313 million. The increase included a $452 million
increase attributable to product rate and mix and a $116 million decrease attributable to lower volume. We
recorded a $32 million net decrease in cost of sales related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity
positions and grain inventories as described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this
report, compared to a net decrease of $14 million in fiscal 2017. In fiscal 2018, we recorded $14 million of
restructuring charges in cost of sales compared to $42 million in fiscal 2017. We also recorded $11 million of
restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2018 compared to $44 million in fiscal 2017
(please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report).

Gross margin declined 2 percent in fiscal 2018 versus fiscal 2017. Gross margin as a percent of net sales of
34 percent decreased 110 basis points compared to fiscal 2017.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased $49 million to $2,753 million in fiscal 2018
compared to fiscal 2017. The decrease in SG&A expenses primarily reflects savings from cost management
initiatives and an 8 percentage point decrease in media and advertising expense. In addition, we recorded
$34 million of transaction and integration costs related to our acquisition of Blue Buffalo. SG&A expenses as a
percent of net sales in fiscal 2018 decreased 40 basis points compared to fiscal 2017.

Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $166 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $183 million
in fiscal 2017.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we executed our fiscal 2019 planning process and preliminary long-
range planning process, which resulted in lower future sales and profitability projections in our plans for our
businesses supporting the Yoki, Mountain High, and Immaculate Baking brand intangible assets. As a result, we
recorded a $97 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.

In fiscal 2018, we approved global cost savings initiatives designed to reduce administrative costs and align
resources behind high growth initiatives. We recorded $49 million of restructuring charges relating to this action
in fiscal 2018.

Please refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information
regarding our restructuring activities.

Interest, net for fiscal 2018 totaled $374 million, $79 million higher than fiscal 2017, primarily driven by
$36 million of charges related to the bridge term loan credit facility that provided backup financing for the Blue
Buffalo acquisition, higher average debt balances, and $14 million of charges related to the repurchase of
medium term notes, partially offset by changes in the mix of debt.

Our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 2.7 percent compared to 28.8 percent in fiscal 2017. The
26.1 percentage point decrease was primarily due to the provisional net benefit of $524 million recorded in fiscal
2018 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Our effective tax rate excluding certain items affecting
comparability was 25.7 percent in fiscal 2018 compared to 29.2 percent in fiscal 2017 (see the “Non-GAAP
Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). The 3.5 percentage
point decrease in the effective tax rate excluding certain items affecting comparability was primarily due to the
lower U.S. federal blended statutory rate for fiscal 2018 as a result of the TCJA, partially offset by certain
discrete events recorded during fiscal 2017.

On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law. The TCJA significantly revised the U.S. corporate
income tax system, including a reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate, implementation of a territorial
system, and a one-time deemed repatriation tax on untaxed foreign earnings. The TCJA also resulted in a U.S.
federal blended statutory rate of 29.4 percent for us in fiscal 2018. Generally, the impacts of the new legislation
would be required to be recorded in the period of enactment, which for us was the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
However, Accounting Standards Update 2018-05: Income Taxes (Topic 740) (ASU 2018-05) was issued with
guidance allowing for the recognition of provisional amounts in the event that the accounting is not complete and

23

a reasonable estimate can be made. The guidance allows for a measurement period of up to one year from the
enactment date to finalize the accounting related to the TCJA. Please see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information.

After-tax earnings from joint ventures of $85 million in fiscal 2018 was flat compared to fiscal 2017, as
favorable foreign currency exchange for CPW was offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange and lower
net sales for HDJ and our $2 million after-tax share of a restructuring charge at CPW. On a constant-currency
basis, after-tax earnings from joint ventures decreased 3 percent, including the CPW restructuring charge (see the
“Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). The
components of our joint ventures’ net sales growth are shown in the following table:

Average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 12 million in fiscal 2018 from fiscal 2017 due to share
repurchases, partially offset by the issuance of 22.7 million shares of stock to finance a portion of the Blue
Buffalo acquisition and option exercises.

refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report).

In fiscal 2017, operating results reflected challenging net sales performance. However, we continued to make
progress against our cost savings and margin expansion initiatives. The net sales decline of 6 percent was driven
by declining contributions from volume in the North America Retail and Europe & Australia segments including
the impact of the divestiture of the North American Green Giant product lines in fiscal 2016, which were
partially offset by favorable net price realization and mix. Operating profit margin of 16.4 percent was up 10
basis points from fiscal 2016 levels primarily driven by benefits from cost savings and spending optimization
initiatives and favorable net price realization, partially offset by the gain from the Green Giant
divestiture. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 130 basis points to 18.1 percent, driven by benefits from
cost savings and spending optimization initiatives and favorable net price realization. Diluted EPS of $2.77 was
flat to fiscal 2016 and adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability, on a constant-
currency basis increased 6 percent compared to fiscal 2016 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a
description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).

The 6 percent decline in net sales primarily reflected lower organic net sales, unfavorable foreign currency
exchange, and the Green Giant divestiture in fiscal 2016 (please refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 of this report).

Organic net sales declined 4 percent driven by volume declines in the North America Retail and Europe &
Australia segments which were partially offset by positive net price realization and mix.

Cost of sales decreased $678 million in fiscal 2017 to $10,056 million. The decrease included an $814 million
decrease attributable to lower volume and a $137 million increase attributable to product rate and mix. We

25

recorded a $14 million net decrease in cost of sales related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity
positions and grain inventories as described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this
report, compared to a net decrease of $63 million in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2017, we recorded $42 million of
restructuring charges in cost of sales compared to $78 million in fiscal 2016. We also recorded $44 million of
restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2017 compared to $58 million in fiscal 2016
(please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report).

Gross margin declined 5 percent in fiscal 2017 versus fiscal 2016. Gross margin as a percent of net sales of
36 percent increased 40 basis points compared to fiscal 2016.

SG&A expenses decreased $318 million to $2,801 million in fiscal 2017 versus fiscal 2016 primarily due to a 17
percentage point decrease in media and advertising expense and cost savings initiatives. SG&A expenses as a
percent of net sales decreased 90 basis points compared to fiscal 2016.

During fiscal 2017, we recorded a $14 million divestiture loss from the sale of our Martel, Ohio manufacturing
facility. Divestiture net gain totaled $148 million in fiscal 2016 primarily from the sale of Green Giant (please
refer to Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report).

Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $183 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $151 million
in fiscal 2016.

Total charges associated with our restructuring initiatives recognized in fiscal 2017 and 2016 consisted of the

regarding our restructuring activities.

Interest, net for fiscal 2017 totaled $295 million, $9 million lower than fiscal 2016, primarily driven by lower
rates and changes in the mix of debt, partially offset by higher average debt balances.

26

Our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 28.8 percent compared to 31.4 percent in fiscal 2016. The
2.6 percentage point decrease was primarily due to non-deductible expenses related to the Green Giant
divestiture in fiscal 2016. Our effective tax rate excluding certain items affecting comparability was 29.2 percent
in fiscal 2017 compared to 29.8 percent in fiscal 2016 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a
description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).

After-tax earnings from joint ventures for fiscal 2017 decreased to $85 million compared to $88 million in
fiscal 2016 primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange and an asset write-off for CPW, partially
offset by contributions from volume growth and favorable foreign currency exchange for HDJ. On a constant-
currency basis, after-tax earnings from joint ventures decreased 6 percent (see the “Non-GAAP Measures”
section below for a description of our use of these measures not defined by GAAP). The components of our joint

RESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS

On April 24, 2018, we acquired Blue Buffalo, which became our Pet operating segment. Our businesses are now
organized into five operating segments: North America Retail; Convenience Stores & Foodservice; Europe &
Australia; Asia & Latin America; and Pet. We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag
and accordingly, in fiscal 2018, our results do not include Pet segment operating results.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we announced a new global organization structure to streamline our
leadership, enhance global scale, and drive improved operational agility to maximize our growth capabilities. We
restated our fiscal 2016 net sales by segment and segment operating profit amounts to reflect our new operating
segments. These segment changes had no effect on previously reported consolidated net sales, operating profit,
net earnings attributable to General Mills, or earnings per share.

Segment operating profit excludes unallocated corporate items, net gain/loss on divestitures, and restructuring,
impairment, and other exit costs because these items affecting operating profit are centrally managed at the
corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by our executive
management.

NORTH AMERICA RETAIL SEGMENT

Our North America Retail operating segment reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass
merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, drug, dollar and discount chains, and e-commerce
grocery providers. Our product categories in this business segment are ready-to-eat cereals, refrigerated yogurt,
soup, meal kits, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza and pizza snacks,
grain, fruit and savory snacks, and a wide variety of organic products including refrigerated yogurt, nutrition
bars, meal kits, salty snacks, ready-to-eat cereal, and grain snacks.

North America Retail organic net sales decreased 1 percentage point in fiscal 2018, compared to fiscal 2017,
driven by unfavorable organic net price realization and mix. North America Retail organic net sales decreased 5
percentage points in fiscal 2017 which reflects the impact of reduced marketing and higher pricing as a result of
lower promotional spending.

Segment operating profit decreased 4 percent to $2,217 million in fiscal 2018, compared to $2,304 million in
fiscal 2017, driven primarily by higher input costs and increased merchandising, partially offset by lower SG&A
expenses, including a 10 percent decline in media and advertising expense. Segment operating profit decreased
4 percent on a constant-currency basis in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures”
section below for our use of this measure not defined by GAAP).

Segment operating profit of $2,304 million in fiscal 2017 decreased $48 million, or 2 percent, from fiscal 2016.
The decrease was primarily driven by declining contributions from volume growth, currency-driven inflation on
products imported into Canada, and the impact of the Green Giant divestiture, partially offset by benefits from
cost savings initiatives, favorable net price realization, and a decrease in SG&A expenses, including a 16
percentage point decline in media and advertising expense. Segment operating profit decreased 2 percent on a
constant-currency basis in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for
our use of this measure not defined by GAAP).

CONVENIENCE STORES & FOODSERVICE SEGMENT

Our major product categories in our Convenience Stores & Foodservice operating segment are ready-to-eat
cereals, snacks, refrigerated yogurt, frozen meals, unbaked and fully baked frozen dough products, and baking
mixes. Many products we sell are branded to the consumer and nearly all are branded to our customers. We sell
to distributors and operators in many customer channels including foodservice, convenience stores, vending, and
supermarket bakeries in the United States.

operating profit was $401 million, an increase of 6 percent from $379 million in fiscal 2016 primarily driven by
lower input costs and benefits from cost savings initiatives.

EUROPE & AUSTRALIA SEGMENT

Our Europe & Australia operating segment reflects retail and foodservice businesses in the greater Europe and
Australia regions. Our product categories include refrigerated yogurt, meal kits, super-premium ice cream,
refrigerated and frozen dough products, shelf stable vegetables, grain snacks, and dessert and baking mixes. We

and South America regions. Our product categories include super-premium ice cream and frozen desserts,
refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, meal kits, salty and grain snacks, wellness
beverages, and refrigerated yogurt. We also sell super-premium ice cream and frozen desserts directly to
consumers through owned retail shops. Our Asia & Latin America segment also includes products manufactured
in the United States for export, mainly to Caribbean and Latin American markets, as well as products we
manufacture for sale to our international joint ventures. Revenues from export activities and franchise fees are
reported in the region or country where the end customer or franchisee is located. Fiscal 2017 includes an

The 2 percent decrease in Asia & Latin America organic net sales in fiscal 2018 was driven by a 10 percent
decrease in contributions from organic volume growth partially offset by an 8 percent increase in organic net
price realization and mix. The 10 percent decrease in contributions from organic volume growth reflects lower

to an enterprise reporting system implementation at Yoki, partially offset by higher contributions in Asia
markets.

The 3 percent increase in Asia & Latin America organic net sales in fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by a 5

in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for our use of this measure
not defined by GAAP).

Segment operating profit for fiscal 2017 increased 21 percent to $84 million from $69 million in fiscal 2016,
primarily driven by growth in the Häagen-Dazs business in China and the impact of an additional month of
results from Yoki in fiscal 2017. Asia & Latin America segment operating profit increased 20 percent on a
constant-currency basis in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for
our use of this measure not defined by GAAP).

PET SEGMENT

Our Pet operating segment includes pet food products sold primarily in the United States in specialty channels,
including national pet superstore chains, regional pet store chains, neighborhood pet stores, and farm and feed
stores; e-commerce retailers; military outlets; hardware stores; veterinary clinics and hospitals; and grocery and
mass merchandisers. Our product categories include dog and cat food (dry foods, wet foods, and treats) made
with whole meats, fruits and vegetables, and other high-quality natural ingredients. Our tailored pet product
offerings address specific dietary, lifestyle, and life-stage needs and spans different product types, diet types,
breed sizes for dogs, lifestages, flavors, product functions and textures, and cuts for wet foods. We are reporting
the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag and accordingly, in fiscal 2018, our results do not include
Pet segment operating results.

UNALLOCATED CORPORATE ITEMS

Unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee
benefits and incentives, contributions to the General Mills Foundation, asset and liability remeasurement impact
of hyperinflationary economies, restructuring initiative project-related costs, and other items that are not part of
our measurement of segment operating performance. This includes gains and losses from the mark-to-market
valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments in accordance with our
policy as discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

For fiscal 2018, unallocated corporate expense totaled $117 million compared to $190 million last year. In fiscal
2018, we recorded a $32 million net decrease in expense related to mark-to-market valuation of certain
commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a $14 million net decrease in expense in the prior year.
In addition, we recorded $14 million of restructuring charges, and $11 million of restructuring initiative project-
related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2018, compared to $42 million of restructuring charges and $44 million of
restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2017. We also recorded $34 million of
transaction and integration costs related to our acquisition of Blue Buffalo.

For fiscal 2017, unallocated corporate expense totaled $190 million compared to $289 million in fiscal 2016. In
fiscal 2017, we recorded a $14 million net decrease in expense related to mark-to-market valuation of certain
commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a $63 million net decrease in expense in the prior year.
In addition, we recorded $42 million of restructuring charges, and $44 million of restructuring initiative project-
related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2017, compared to $78 million of restructuring charges and $58 million of
restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2016. The decrease in unallocated corporate
expense also reflects lower incentive expense in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

We experienced input cost inflation of 4 percent in fiscal 2018, 1 percent in fiscal 2017, and 2 percent in fiscal
2016, primarily on commodity inputs. We expect input cost inflation of approximately 5 percent in fiscal 2019.
We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through HMM, planning, and operating practices. Our risk
management practices are discussed in Item 7A of this report.

LIQUIDITY

The primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations. Over the most recent three-year period, our
operations have generated $8.0 billion in cash. A substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned
to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We also use cash from operations to fund our capital
expenditures and acquisitions. We typically use a combination of cash, notes payable, and long-term debt and
occasionally issue shares of stock to finance significant acquisitions and major capital expansions.

As of May 27, 2018, we had $383 million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions. As a result
of the TCJA, the historic undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will be taxed in the U.S. via the
one-time repatriation tax in fiscal 2018. We are re-evaluating our indefinite reinvestment assertions in connection
with the TCJA. As of the end of fiscal 2018, we have recorded a provisional estimate for local country
withholding taxes related to certain entities from which we expect to begin repatriating undistributed earnings.
As a result of the transition tax, we may repatriate our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries
without such funds being subject to further U.S. income tax liability. In fiscal 2018, we repatriated a portion of
our foreign cash holdings to finance part of the Blue Buffalo acquisition, to reduce commercial paper, and for
general corporate purposes. Please see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this
report for further information on our indefinite reinvestment assertion.

In fiscal 2018, cash provided by operations was $2.8 billion compared to $2.4 billion in fiscal 2017. The
$426 million increase was primarily driven by the $462 million increase in net earnings and the $736 million
change in current assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $688 million change in deferred income taxes. The
change in deferred income taxes was primarily related to the $638 million provisional benefit from revaluing our
net U.S. deferred tax liabilities to reflect the new U.S. corporate tax rate as a result of the TCJA. The
$736 million change in current assets and liabilities was primarily due to changes in accounts payable of
$476 million related to the extension of payment terms and timing of payments, and $264 million of changes in
other current liabilities primarily driven by changes in income taxes payable, trade and advertising accruals, and
incentive accruals.

We strive to grow core working capital at or below the rate of growth in our net sales. For fiscal 2018, core
working capital decreased 27 percent, compared to a net sales increase of 1 percent. In fiscal 2017, core working
capital increased 9 percent, compared to a net sales decline of 6 percent, and in fiscal 2016, core working capital
decreased 41 percent, compared to net sales decline of 6 percent.

In fiscal 2017, our operations generated $2.4 billion of cash, compared to $2.8 billion in fiscal 2016. The
$349 million decrease was primarily driven by a $493 million change in current assets and liabilities. The
$493 million change in current assets and liabilities was primarily due to changes in other current liabilities
driven by changes in income taxes payable, a decrease in incentive accruals, and changes in trade and advertising
accruals due to reduced spending. The change in current assets and liabilities was also impacted by the timing of
accounts payable. Additionally, we recorded a $14 million loss on a divestiture during fiscal 2017, compared to a
$148 million net gain on divestitures during fiscal 2016, and classified the related cash flows as investing
activities.

In fiscal 2018, we used $8.7 billion of cash through investing activities compared to $647 million in fiscal 2017.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we acquired Blue Buffalo for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 billion,
including $103 million of consideration for net debt repaid. We invested $623 million in land, buildings, and
equipment in fiscal 2018, $62 million less than last year.

In fiscal 2017, we used $647 million of cash through investing activities compared to generating $93 million in
fiscal 2016. We invested $684 million in land, buildings, and equipment in fiscal 2017, $45 million less than
fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2016, we received proceeds of $828 million from the divestitures of certain businesses,
primarily Green Giant.

We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $745 million in fiscal 2019. These expenditures will fund
initiatives that are expected to fuel international growth, support innovative products, and continue HMM
initiatives throughout the supply chain.

Financing activities provided $5.4 billion of cash in fiscal 2018 compared to a use of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2017.
Financing activities used $2.4 billion of cash in fiscal 2016. We had $5.2 billion more net debt issuances in fiscal
2018 than the prior year, primarily related to bonds issued to fund a portion of the Blue Buffalo acquisition. In
fiscal 2017 we had $1.8 billion more net debt issuances than in fiscal 2016. For more information on our debt
issuances and payments, please refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

During fiscal 2018, we received $970 million of net proceeds from common stock issued to fund a portion of the
Blue Buffalo acquisition. In addition, we received $99 million in proceeds from common stock issued on
exercised options compared to $113 million in fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2016, we received $172 million in
proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options.

During fiscal 2018, we repurchased 11 million shares of our common stock for $602 million. During fiscal 2017,
we repurchased 25 million shares of our common stock for $1,652 million. During fiscal 2016, we repurchased
11 million shares of our common stock for $607 million.

Dividends paid in fiscal 2018 totaled $1,140 million, or $1.96 per share, a 2 percent per share increase from
fiscal 2017. Dividends paid in fiscal 2017 totaled $1,135 million, or $1.92 per share, an 8 percent per share
increase from fiscal 2016 dividends of $1.78 per share.

In February 2018, we entered into a fee-paid commitment letter with certain lenders, pursuant to which such
lenders committed to provide a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan credit facility (the “Bridge Facility”)
in an aggregate principal amount of up to $8.5 billion to provide the financing for the acquisition of Blue
Buffalo. The Bridge Facility expired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.

To ensure availability of funds, we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding notes payable.
Commercial paper is a continuing source of short-term financing. We have commercial paper programs available
to us in the United States and Europe. We also have uncommitted and asset-backed credit lines that support our
foreign operations. The credit facilities contain several covenants, including a requirement to maintain a fixed
charge coverage ratio of at least 2.5 times.

Certain of our long-term debt agreements, our credit facilities, and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive
covenants. As of May 27, 2018, we were in compliance with all of these covenants.

We have $1,600 million of long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current, including
$1,150 million of 5.65 percent notes due February 2019, €300.0 million euro-denominated floating-rate notes due
March 20, 2019, and $100 million of 6.59 percent fixed rate medium term notes due for remarketing in October
2018. We believe that cash flows from operations, together with available short- and long-term debt financing,
will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months.

As of May 27, 2018, our total debt, including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges, was
73 percent in fixed-rate and 27 percent in floating-rate instruments, compared to 67 percent in fixed-rate and
33 percent in floating-rate instruments on May 28, 2017.

We believe that our fixed charge coverage ratio and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt are important
measures of our financial strength. Our fixed charge coverage ratio in fiscal 2018 was 5.89 compared to 7.26 in
fiscal 2017. The measure decreased from fiscal 2017 as earnings before income taxes and after-tax earnings from
joint ventures decreased by $136 million and interest expense increased by $83 million in fiscal 2018. Our
operating cash flow to debt ratio decreased 7.5 percentage points to 18.0 percent in fiscal 2018, primarily driven
by an increase in long-term debt.

We have a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplait SAS and a 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and
Liberté Marques Sàrl. Sodiaal holds the remaining interests in each of these entities. We consolidate these
entities into our consolidated financial statements. We record Sodiaal’s 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques
SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl as noncontrolling interests, and its 49 percent interest in Yoplait SAS as a
redeemable interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These euro- and Canadian dollar-denominated interests
are reported in U.S. dollars on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of
its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three times before December 2024. As of May 27,
2018, the redemption value of the redeemable interest was $776 million which approximates its fair value.

The third-party holder of the General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred
distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate to the holder’s
capital account balance established in the most recent mark-to-market valuation (currently $252 million). For
fiscal 2018, the floating preferred return rate on GMC’s Class A Interests was equal to the sum of three-month
LIBOR plus 125 basis points. The preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated
agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction. On June 1, 2018, subsequent to our
fiscal year-end, the floating preferred return rate on the Class A Interests was reset to the sum of three-month
LIBOR plus 142.5 basis points.

We have an option to purchase the Class A Interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account
value, plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed make-whole amount. If we purchase these interests,
any change in the third-party holder’s capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained
earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate EPS in that period.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

As of May 27, 2018, we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of $541 million for the debt and other
obligations of consolidated subsidiaries, and guarantees and comfort letters of $167 million for the debt and other

38

obligations of non-consolidated affiliates, mainly CPW. In addition, off-balance sheet arrangements are generally
limited to the future payments under non-cancelable operating leases, which totaled $559 million as of May 27,
2018.

As of May 27, 2018, we had invested in five variable interest entities (VIEs). None of our VIEs are material to
our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity as of and for the fiscal year ended May 27, 2018.

Our defined benefit plans in the United States are subject to the requirements of the Pension Protection Act
(PPA). In the future, the PPA may require us to make additional contributions to our domestic plans. We do not
expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2019.

(b) Operating leases represents the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases.
(c) The majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw material and packaging to be utilized
in the normal course of business and for consumer marketing spending commitments that support our brands.
For purposes of this table, arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all
significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure, and approximate
timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short
notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as accounts payable and
accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above.

(d) The fair value of our foreign exchange, equity, commodity, and grain derivative contracts with a payable
position to the counterparty was $16 million as of May 27, 2018, based on fair market values as of that date.
Future changes in market values will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received to settle those
instruments in the future. Other long-term obligations mainly consist of liabilities for accrued compensation
and benefits, including the underfunded status of certain of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement
benefit, and postemployment benefit plans, and miscellaneous liabilities. We expect to pay $20 million of
benefits from our unfunded postemployment benefit plans and $18 million of deferred compensation in fiscal
2019. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of these payments beyond fiscal 2019. As of May 27,
2018, our total liability for uncertain tax positions and accrued interest and penalties was $223.6 million.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, please see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 of this report. Our significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact

39

on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. These estimates include our accounting for
promotional expenditures, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, redeemable interest, stock-based
compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment
benefit plans.

Promotional Expenditures
Our promotional activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers.
These activities include: payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf, such as
advertising or in-store displays; discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices; payments to gain
distribution of new products; coupons, contests, and other incentives; and media and advertising expenditures.
The recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels. These
estimates are based on the forecasted customer sales, the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities,
and other factors. Differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are recognized as a change in
management estimate in a subsequent period. Our accrued trade, coupon, and consumer marketing liabilities
were $500 million as of May 27, 2018, and $483 million as of May 28, 2017. Because our total promotional
expenditures (including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues) are significant, if our estimates are
inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a significant effect on our
results of operations.

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets
We estimate the useful lives of long-lived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to
review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
(or asset group) may not be recoverable. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent
appraisals, as appropriate.

Intangible Assets
Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment
annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our
estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model.
We use inputs from our long-range planning process to determine growth rates for sales and profits. We also
make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors.

life requires significant

We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or
indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful
judgments and assumptions
regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability
of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing
regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance
expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have
definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years.
Our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which
include projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not
own the brands, and a discount rate.

As of May 27, 2018, we had $20.9 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. While we currently
believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified
will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially different assumptions regarding future performance of
our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital could result in material impairment losses and
amortization expense. We performed our fiscal 2018 assessment of our intangible assets as of August 28, 2017.
As of our annual assessment date, there was no impairment of any of our intangible assets as their related fair
values were substantially in excess of the carrying values except for the Yoki and Progresso brand intangible

40

assets and the Latin America reporting unit. The excess fair value as of the fiscal 2018 test date of
the Yoki and Progresso brand intangible assets and the Latin America reporting unit was as follows:

In addition, while having significant coverage as of our fiscal 2018 assessment date, the Food Should Taste Good
and Green Giant brand intangible assets and U.S. Yogurt reporting unit had risk of decreasing coverage. We will
continue to monitor these businesses, as well as the businesses supporting the Yoki and Progresso brand
intangible assets and the Latin America reporting unit for potential impairment.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we executed our fiscal 2019 planning process and preliminary long-
range planning process, which resulted in lower future sales and profitability projections in our plans for our
businesses supporting the Yoki, Mountain High, and Immaculate Baking brand intangible assets. As a result of
this triggering event, we performed an interim impairment assessment of these assets as of May 27, 2018, and
determined that the fair value of these brand assets no longer exceeded the carrying values of the respective
assets. Significant assumptions used in that assessment included our updated long-range cash flow projections for
the businesses, royalty rates, weighted average cost of capital rates, and tax rates. We recorded a $97 million
impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 related to these assets.

Redeemable Interest
In fiscal 2018, we adjusted the redemption value of Sodiaal’s redeemable interest in Yoplait SAS based on a
discounted cash flow model. The significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include projected
revenue growth and profitability from our long-range plan, capital spending, depreciation and taxes, foreign
currency exchange rates, and a discount rate. As of May 27, 2018, the redemption value of the redeemable
interest was $776 million.

Stock-based Compensation
The valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and
assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements. Annually, we make predictive
assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture
rate. For more information on these assumptions, please see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8 of this report.

The estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model were as follows:

The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury
zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant. An increase in the expected term by 1 year, leaving all
other assumptions constant, would increase the grant date fair value by 20 percent. If all other assumptions are
held constant, a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2018 volatility assumption would increase the grant
date fair value of our fiscal 2018 option awards by 8 percent.

To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair
value-based expense to final intrinsic values. Historical data has a significant bearing on our forward-looking
assumptions. Significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in
our assumptions, which could then significantly impact
the year-over-year comparability of stock-based
compensation expense.

Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously
recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows as an operating cash flow. The actual impact on future years’ cash flows will depend, in part, on the
volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise-
date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant-date fair value previously determined for
financial reporting purposes.

Realized windfall tax benefits and shortfall tax deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based
awards are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Because employee stock option exercise
behavior is not within our control, it is possible that significantly different reported results could occur if
different assumptions or conditions were to prevail.

Income Taxes
We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions.
Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being
ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of
uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change. For more information on income taxes,
please see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemployment Benefit Plans
We have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, Switzerland,
France, and the United Kingdom. We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees
in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits,
primarily severance, to former and inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Please see Note
13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for a description of our defined benefit
pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans.

We recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active
working lives. Accordingly, we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many
years prior to the settlement of our obligations. Assumptions that require significant management judgment and
have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated
benefit obligations include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the interest rates used to discount the
obligations for our benefit plans, and health care cost trend rates.

Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets
Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term
investment performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries,
investment services, and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption
annually for each plan; however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself,
significantly influence our evaluation.

42

Our historical investment returns (compound annual growth rates) for our United States defined benefit pension
and other postretirement benefit plan assets were 8.5 percent, 8.5 percent, 6.5 percent, 9.1 percent, and
8.0 percent for the 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 year periods ended May 27, 2018.

On a weighted-average basis, the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 7.88 percent for fiscal
2018, 8.17 percent for fiscal 2017, and 8.53 percent for fiscal 2016. For fiscal 2019, we lowered our weighted-
average expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement
plans in the United States to 7.35 percent due to asset changes that decreased investment risk in the portfolio.

Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and
postretirement expense by $67 million for fiscal 2019. A market-related valuation basis is used to reduce
year-to-year expense volatility. The market-related valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a
five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference
between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the
market-related value of assets. Our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of
annual expense or income.

Discount Rates

Beginning in fiscal 2017, we changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the
net periodic benefit expense for our United States and most of our international defined benefit pension, other
postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans. We adopted a full yield curve approach to estimate
service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the
benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. This method provides a more precise measurement of
service and interest costs by correlating the timing of the plans’ liability cash flows to the corresponding rate on
the yield curve. Previously, we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weighted-average discount
rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. This
change does not affect the measurement of our benefit obligations related to these plans. We have accounted for
this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.

Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of May 31 for our defined benefit pension, other
postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We work with our outside actuaries to
determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above
Median corporate bond yield, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on
our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our
discount rate assumptions.

Our weighted-average discount rates were as follows:

Effective rate for fiscal 2019 service costs
Effective rate for fiscal 2019 interest costs
Obligations as of May 31, 2018
Effective rate for fiscal 2018 service costs
Effective rate for fiscal 2018 interest costs
Obligations as of May 28, 2017

Lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension, other
postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2019 by approximately $55 million.
All obligation-related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the average
remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan
participants if the plan is viewed as “all or almost all” inactive participants.

Health Care Cost Trend Rates
We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care
claims experience and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience,
plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations.
Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent
experiences, and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 7.0 percent for
retirees age 65 and over and 6.7 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2018. Rates are graded down
annually until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5 percent is reached in 2029 for all retirees. The trend rates are
applicable for calculations only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate
trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term
inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an
important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans.

A one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects:

Any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected
future claims. Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the
average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the
remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as “all or almost all” inactive participants.

Financial Statement Impact
In fiscal 2018, we recorded net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment
benefit plan expense of $23 million compared to $56 million of expense in fiscal 2017 and $163 million of
expense in fiscal 2016. As of May 27, 2018, we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of $1.8 billion
on our defined benefit pension plans and cumulative unrecognized actuarial net gains of $40 million on our
postretirement and postemployment benefit plans, mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest
rates, partially offset by recent increases in the values of plan assets. These unrecognized actuarial net losses will
result in increases in our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses because they currently exceed the
corridors defined by GAAP.

Actual future net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income
or expense will depend on investment performance, changes in future discount rates, changes in health care cost
trend rates, and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new hedge accounting requirements.
The new standard amends the hedge accounting recognition and presentation requirements to better align an
entity’s risk management activities and financial reporting. The new standard also simplifies the application of
hedge accounting guidance. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first
quarter of fiscal 2020. Early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of analyzing the impact of this standard
on our results of operations and financial position.

In March 2017, the FASB issued new accounting requirements related to the presentation of net periodic defined
benefit pension expense, net periodic postretirement benefit expense, and net periodic postemployment benefit
expense. The new standard requires the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense to be recorded in
the same line items as other employee compensation costs within our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Other
components of net periodic benefit expense must be presented separately outside of operating profit in our
Consolidated Statements of Earnings. In addition, the new standard requires that only the service cost component
of net periodic benefit expense is eligible for capitalization. We recognized net periodic benefit expense of
$23 million in fiscal 2018, $56 million in fiscal 2017, and $163 million in fiscal 2016 of which $123 million,
$141 million, and $161 million, respectively, related to service cost. These amounts may not necessarily be
indicative of future amounts that may be recognized subsequent to the adoption of this new standard. The new
standard requires retrospective adoption of the presentation of net periodic benefit expense and prospective
application of the capitalization of the service cost component. The requirements of the new standard are
effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those
annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2019.

In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting requirements for accounting, presentation and classification
of leases. This will result in most leases being capitalized as a right of use asset with a related liability on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first
quarter of fiscal 2020. We are in the process of implementing lease accounting software and analyzing the impact
of this standard on our results of operations and financial position. Based on our assessment to date, we expect
this guidance will have a material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets due to the amount of our lease
commitments but we are unable to quantify the impact at this time.

In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with
customers. Under the new guidance, companies will apply a principles-based five step model to recognize
revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers and in an amount that reflects the
consideration for which the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods and services. The
requirements of the new standard and its subsequent amendments are effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first
quarter of fiscal 2019. We will adopt these requirements using the cumulative effect approach. We have
evaluated and documented the impact of the guidance on our current accounting policies and practices and have
not identified any material differences resulting from applying the new requirements to our revenue contracts.
Additionally, we did not identify any significant changes to our business processes, systems, and controls to
support recognition and disclosure requirements under the new guidance. This guidance will not have a material
impact on our results of operations or financial position.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

We have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. We believe
that these measures provide useful information to investors, and include these measures in other communications
to investors.

45

For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences
between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure, an explanation of why our
management or the Board of Directors believes the non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors
and any additional purposes for which our management or Board of Directors uses the non-GAAP measure.
These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure.

Organic Net Sales Growth Rates

This measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the Board of Directors’
measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. We provide organic net sales growth
rates for our consolidated net sales and segment net sales. We believe that organic net sales growth rates provide
useful information to investors because they provide transparency to underlying performance in our net sales by
excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as acquisitions, divestitures, and a
53rd week, when applicable, have on year-to-year comparability. A reconciliation of these measures to reported
net sales growth rates, the relevant GAAP measures, are included in our Consolidated Results of Operations and
Results of Segment Operations discussions in the MD&A above.

Total Segment Operating Profit and Total Segment Operating Profit as a Percent of Net Sales

Total segment operating profit is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the
Board of Directors’ measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. Management and the
Board of Directors believe that

Diluted EPS Excluding Certain Items Affecting Comparability (Adjusted Diluted EPS) and Related Constant-

This measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the Board of Directors’
measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that this measure provides
useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate earnings performance on
a comparable year-over-year basis. The adjustments are either items resulting from infrequently occurring events
or items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the year-over-year assessment of operating results.

Forward-Looking Financial Measures

Our fiscal 2019 outlook for organic net sales growth and constant-currency total segment operating profit and
adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude, or have otherwise been adjusted for, items
impacting comparability, including the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, restructuring
charges and project-related costs, acquisition integration costs, and commodity mark-to-market effects. Our fiscal
2019 outlook for organic net sales growth also excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestitures. We are not
able to reconcile these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable
forward-looking GAAP financial measures without unreasonable efforts because we are unable to predict with a
reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity
prices or the timing of acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring actions throughout fiscal 2019. The unavailable
information could have a significant impact on our fiscal 2019 GAAP financial results.

For fiscal 2019, we currently expect: foreign currency exchange rates (based on blend of forward and forecasted
rates and hedge positions), acquisitions, and divestitures to increase net sales growth by high single digits;
foreign currency exchange rates to have an immaterial impact on adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted
EPS growth; and restructuring charges and project-related costs related to actions previously announced to total
approximately $13 million.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION FOR THE
PURPOSE OF “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION
REFORM ACT OF 1995

This report contains or incorporates by reference forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are based on our current expectations and assumptions. We also
may make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in our filings with the SEC
and in our reports to shareholders.

The words or phrases “will likely result,” “are expected to,” “will continue,” “is anticipated,” “estimate,” “plan,”
“project,” or similar expressions identify “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from historical results and those currently anticipated or projected. We
wish to caution you not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements.

In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are
identifying important factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results in
future periods to differ materially from any current opinions or statements.

Our future results could be affected by a variety of factors, such as: competitive dynamics in the consumer foods
industry and the markets for our products, including new product introductions, advertising activities, pricing
actions, and promotional activities of our competitors; economic conditions, including changes in inflation rates,
interest rates, tax rates, or the availability of capital; product development and innovation; consumer acceptance
of new products and product improvements; consumer reaction to pricing actions and changes in promotion
levels; acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or assets, including our acquisition of Blue Buffalo and issues in
the integration of Blue Buffalo and retention of key management and employees; unfavorable reaction to our
acquisition of Blue Buffalo by customers, competitors, suppliers, and employees; changes in capital structure;
changes in the legal and regulatory environment, including tax legislation, labeling and advertising regulations,
and litigation; impairments in the carrying value of goodwill, other intangible assets, or other long-lived assets,
or changes in the useful lives of other intangible assets; changes in accounting standards and the impact of
significant accounting estimates; product quality and safety issues, including recalls and product liability;
changes in consumer demand for our products; effectiveness of advertising, marketing, and promotional
programs; changes in consumer behavior, trends, and preferences, including weight loss trends; consumer
perception of health-related issues,
including obesity; consolidation in the retail environment; changes in
purchasing and inventory levels of significant customers; fluctuations in the cost and availability of supply chain
resources, including raw materials, packaging, and energy; disruptions or inefficiencies in the supply chain;
effectiveness of restructuring and cost saving initiatives; volatility in the market value of derivatives used to
manage price risk for certain commodities; benefit plan expenses due to changes in plan asset values and
discount rates used to determine plan liabilities; failure or breach of our information technology systems; foreign
economic conditions, including currency rate fluctuations; and political unrest in foreign markets and economic
uncertainty due to terrorism or war.

You should also consider the risk factors that we identify in Item 1A of this report, which could also affect our
future results.

We undertake no obligation to publicly revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances
after the date of those statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.

Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and
equity prices. Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. In the normal

54

course of business, we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging
transactions, authorized under established policies that place clear controls on these activities. The counterparties
in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions. We establish credit limits for each counterparty. Our
hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments. For information
on interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity price, and equity instrument risk, please see Note 7 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

VALUE AT RISK

The estimates in the table below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one
day from adverse changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices
under normal market conditions. A Monte Carlo value-at-risk (VAR) methodology was used to quantify the
market risk for our exposures. The models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence
level.

The VAR calculation used historical interest and foreign exchange rates, and commodity and equity prices from
the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future. The market data were
drawn from the RiskMetrics™ data set. The calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value
that we expect to incur. Further, since the hedging instrument (the derivative) inversely correlates with the
underlying exposure, we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be
generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposure. The positions included in
the calculations were: debt; investments; interest rate swaps; foreign exchange forwards; commodity swaps,
futures, and options; and equity instruments. The calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and
commodities or equity-related positions that are offset by these market-risk-sensitive instruments.

The table below presents the estimated maximum potential VAR arising from a one-day loss in fair value for our
interest rate, foreign currency, commodity, and equity market-risk-sensitive instruments outstanding as of
May 27, 2018 and May 28, 2017, and the average fair value impact during the year ended May 27, 2018.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the stockholders and board of directors
General Mills, Inc.:

Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of General Mills, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of May 27, 2018 and May 28, 2017,
the related consolidated statements of earnings,
comprehensive income, total equity and redeemable interest, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the
three-year period ended May 27, 2018, and the related notes (collectively,
the “consolidated financial
statements”). In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we have audited the
accompanying financial statement schedule. We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of May 27, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of May 27, 2018 and May 28, 2017, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended May 27, 2018, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the accompanying financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 27, 2018, based on criteria established in
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.

The Company acquired Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc. (“Blue Buffalo”) during fiscal 2018, and management
excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
May 27, 2018, Blue Buffalo internal control over financial reporting associated with 29% of total assets and 0%
of net sales included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the fiscal year ended
May 27, 2018. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation
of the internal control over financial reporting of Blue Buffalo.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9a Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent
with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are
free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts

57

and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

GENERAL MILLS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND RECLASSIFICATIONS

Basis of Presentation
Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of General Mills, Inc. and all subsidiaries in which
we have a controlling financial interest. Intercompany transactions and accounts, including any noncontrolling
and redeemable interests’ share of those transactions, are eliminated in consolidation.

Our fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in May.

Certain reclassifications to our previously reported financial information have been made to conform to the
current period presentation.

Change in Reporting Period
As part of a long-term plan to conform the fiscal year ends of all our operations, in fiscal 2017 we changed the
reporting period of General Mills Brasil Alimentos Ltda (Yoki) within our Asia & Latin America segment from
an April fiscal year-end to a May fiscal year-end to match our fiscal calendar. Accordingly, in fiscal 2017, our
results included 13 months of results from the affected operations. The impact of these changes was not material
to our consolidated results of operations. Our General Mills India business and Pet operating segment are on an
April fiscal year end.

In fiscal 2016 we changed the reporting period of Yoplait SAS and Yoplait Marques SNC within our Europe &
Australia segment and Annie’s, Inc. (Annie’s) within our North America Retail segment from an April fiscal
year-end to a May fiscal year-end to match our fiscal calendar. Accordingly, in fiscal 2016, our results included
13 months of results from the affected operations. The impact of these changes was not material to our
consolidated results of operations.

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Inventories
All inventories in the United States other than grain are valued at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first-out
(LIFO) method, or market. Grain inventories are valued at net realizable value, and all related cash contracts and
derivatives are valued at fair value, with all net changes in value recorded in earnings currently.

Inventories outside of the United States are generally valued at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out
(FIFO) method, or net realizable value.

Shipping costs associated with the distribution of finished product to our customers are recorded as cost of sales,
and are recognized when the related finished product is shipped to and accepted by the customer.

Land, Buildings, Equipment, and Depreciation
including capitalized interest and internal
Land is recorded at historical cost. Buildings and equipment,
engineering costs, are recorded at cost and depreciated over estimated useful lives, primarily using the straight-
line method. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to cost of sales. Buildings are usually depreciated
over 40 years, and equipment, furniture, and software are usually depreciated over 3 to 10 years. Fully
depreciated assets are retained in buildings and equipment until disposal. When an item is sold or retired, the
accounts are relieved of its cost and related accumulated depreciation and the resulting gains and losses, if any,
are recognized in earnings. As of May 27, 2018, assets held for sale were insignificant.

64

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized
when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less
than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have identifiable cash flows and are largely
independent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the
carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using a discounted cash flow model
or independent appraisals, as appropriate.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. In fiscal 2016, we changed the date of our annual
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment from the first day of the third quarter to the
first day of the second quarter to more closely align with the timing of our annual long-range planning process.
Impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units. We compare the carrying value of a reporting
unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities
associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items
among reporting units. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, impairment has occurred.
We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds
its fair value up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Our estimates of fair value are
determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using
inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth
assumptions, market comparables, and other factors.

We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or
indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful
judgments and assumptions
regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability
of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing
regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance
expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have
definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years.

life requires significant

Our indefinite-lived intangible assets, mainly intangible assets primarily associated with the Blue Buffalo,
Pillsbury, Totino’s, Progresso, Yoplait, Old El Paso, Yoki, Häagen-Dazs, and Annie’s brands, are also tested for
impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not
be recoverable. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs
which included projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we
did not own the brands, and a discount rate.

Our finite-lived intangible assets, primarily acquired franchise agreements and customer relationships, are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash
flows from the operation and disposition of the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset. Assets
generally have identifiable cash flows and are largely independent of other assets. Measurement of an
impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. Fair value is
measured using a discounted cash flow model or other similar valuation model, as appropriate.

Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
Our investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence are stated at cost
plus our share of undistributed earnings or losses. We receive royalty income from certain joint ventures, incur
various expenses (primarily research and development), and record the tax impact of certain joint venture
operations that are structured as partnerships. In addition, we make advances to our joint ventures in the form of
loans or capital investments. We also sell certain raw materials, semi-finished goods, and finished goods to the
joint ventures, generally at market prices.

65

In addition, we assess our investments in our joint ventures if we have reason to believe an impairment may have
occurred including, but not limited to, as a result of ongoing operating losses, projected decreases in earnings,
increases in the weighted average cost of capital, or significant business disruptions. The significant assumptions
used to estimate fair value include revenue growth and profitability, royalty rates, capital spending, depreciation
and taxes, foreign currency exchange rates, and a discount rate. By their nature,
these projections and
assumptions are uncertain. If we were to determine the current fair value of our investment was less than the
carrying value of the investment, then we would assess if the shortfall was of a temporary or permanent nature
and write down the investment to its fair value if we concluded the impairment is other than temporary.

Redeemable Interest
We have a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplait SAS, a consolidated entity. Sodiaal International (Sodiaal)
holds the remaining 49 percent interest in Yoplait SAS. Sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its
redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three times before December 2024. This put option
requires us to classify Sodiaal’s interest as a redeemable interest outside of equity on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets for as long as the put is exercisable by Sodiaal. When the put is no longer exercisable, the redeemable
interest will be reclassified to noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We adjust the value
of the redeemable interest through additional paid-in capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets quarterly to the
redeemable interest’s redemption value, which approximates its fair value. During the second quarter of fiscal
2018, we adjusted the redeemable interest’s redemption value based on a discounted cash flow model. The
significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include projected revenue growth and profitability
from our long-range plan, capital spending, depreciation, taxes, foreign currency exchange rates, and a discount
rate.

Revenue Recognition
We recognize sales revenue when the shipment is accepted by our customer. Sales include shipping and handling
charges billed to the customer and are reported net of consumer coupon redemption, trade promotion and other
costs, including estimated allowances for returns, unsalable product, and prompt pay discounts. Sales, use, value-
added, and other excise taxes are not recognized in revenue. Coupons are recorded when distributed, based on
estimated redemption rates. Trade promotions are recorded based on estimated participation and performance
levels for offered programs at the time of sale. We generally do not allow a right of return. However, on a limited
case-by-case basis with prior approval, we may allow customers to return product. In limited circumstances,
product returned in saleable condition is resold to other customers or outlets. Receivables from customers
generally do not bear interest. Terms and collection patterns vary around the world and by channel. The
allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of probable non-payments and credit losses in our
existing receivables, as determined based on a review of past due balances and other specific account data.
Account balances are written off against the allowance when we deem the amount is uncollectible.

Environmental
Environmental costs relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or
future revenues are expensed. Liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis
when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or
our commitment to a plan of action.

Advertising Production Costs
We expense the production costs of advertising the first time that the advertising takes place.

Research and Development
All expenditures for research and development (R&D) are charged against earnings in the period incurred. R&D
includes expenditures for new product and manufacturing process innovation, and the annual expenditures are
comprised primarily of internal salaries, wages, consulting, and supplies attributable to R&D activities. Other
costs include depreciation and maintenance of research facilities, including assets at facilities that are engaged in
pilot plant activities.

66

Foreign Currency Translation
For all significant foreign operations, the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these
operations are translated at the period-end exchange rates. Income statement accounts are translated using the
average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments are reflected within accumulated
other comprehensive loss (AOCI) in stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions
are included in net earnings for the period, except for gains and losses on investments in subsidiaries for which
settlement is not planned for the foreseeable future and foreign exchange gains and losses on instruments
designated as net investment hedges. These gains and losses are recorded in AOCI.

Derivative Instruments
All derivatives are recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value based on quoted market prices or
our estimate of their fair value, and are recorded in either current or noncurrent assets or liabilities based on their
maturity. Changes in the fair values of derivatives are recorded in net earnings or other comprehensive income,
based on whether the instrument is designated and effective as a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge
transaction. Gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings in the period
the hedged item affects earnings. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, any associated amounts
reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings at that time. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings in the
current period.

Stock-based Compensation
We generally measure compensation expense for grants of restricted stock units using the value of a share of our
stock on the date of grant. We estimate the value of stock option grants using a Black-Scholes valuation model.
Stock-based compensation is recognized straight line over the vesting period. Our stock-based compensation
expense is recorded in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and cost of sales in our Consolidated
Statements of Earnings and allocated to each reportable segment in our segment results.

Certain equity-based compensation plans contain provisions that accelerate vesting of awards upon retirement,
termination, or death of eligible employees and directors. We consider a stock-based award to be vested when the
employee’s retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service. Accordingly, the
related compensation cost
is generally recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible
individuals or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved, if less than the
stated vesting period.

We report the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost as an operating cash flow.

Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemployment Benefit Plans
We sponsor several domestic and foreign defined benefit plans to provide pension, health care, and other welfare
benefits to retired employees. Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily
severance, to former or inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. We recognize an
obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service. Postemployment benefits that do not
vest or accumulate with service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service) are
charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded.

We recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension plan as an asset or liability and
recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through AOCI.

In fiscal 2018, we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and the
supplemental pension plans that resulted in the spinoff of a portion of the General Mills Pension Plan (the Plan)
and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan and the Supplemental Retirement Plan (Grandfathered) (together,
the Supplemental Plans) into new plans effective May 31, 2018. The benefits offered to the plans’ participants
were unchanged. The result of the reorganization was the creation of the General Mills Pension Plan I (Plan I)
and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan I and the Supplemental Retirement Plan I (Grandfathered) (together,

67

the Supplemental Plans I). The reorganization was made to facilitate a targeted investment strategy over time and
to provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. Actuarial gains and
losses associated with the Plan and the Supplemental Plans are amortized over the average remaining service
period of the active participants. Actuarial gains and losses associated with the Plan I and the Supplemental Plans
I are amortized over the average remaining life of the participants. Please refer to Note 13 for a description of our
defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans.

Use of Estimates
Preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include our accounting for
promotional expenditures, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, redeemable interest, stock-based
compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit and postemployment
benefit plans. Actual results could differ from our estimates.

Other New Accounting Standards
In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted new accounting requirements that codify Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 118, as it relates to allowing for recognition of
provisional amounts related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in the event that the accounting is not
complete and a reasonable estimate can be made. Where necessary information is not available, prepared, or
analyzed to determine a reasonable estimate, no provisional amount should be recorded. The guidance allows for
a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to finalize the accounting related to the TCJA.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted new accounting requirements that provide the option to reclassify
stranded income tax effects resulting from the TCJA from AOCI to retained earnings. We elected to reclassify
the stranded income tax effects of the TCJA of $329.4 million from AOCI to retained earnings. This
reclassification consists of deferred taxes originally recorded in AOCI that exceed the newly enacted federal
corporate tax rate. The new accounting requirements allow for adjustments to reclassification amounts in
subsequent periods as a result of changes to the provisional amounts recorded.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted new requirements for the accounting and presentation of stock-
based payments. The adoption of this guidance resulted in the prospective recognition of realized windfall and
shortfall tax benefits related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards in our Consolidated Statements of
Earnings instead of additional paid-in capital within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recognized a windfall
tax benefit in income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings of $25.2 million in fiscal 2018. We
retrospectively adopted the guidance related to reclassification of realized windfall
tax benefits in our
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. This resulted in reclassifications of $25.2 million, $64.1 million, and
$94.1 million of cash provided by financing activities to operating activities for fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, and
fiscal 2016, respectively. Additionally, we retrospectively adopted the guidance related to reclassification of
employee tax withholdings in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. This resulted in reclassifications of
$26.8 million, $37.8 million, and $40.3 million of cash used by operating activities to financing activities for
fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2016, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense continues to reflect
estimated forfeitures.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted new accounting requirements which permit reporting entities to
measure a goodwill impairment loss by the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds the
reporting unit’s fair value. Previously, goodwill impairment losses were required to be measured by determining
the implied fair value of goodwill. Our annual goodwill impairment test was performed as of the first day of the
second quarter of fiscal 2018, and the adoption of this guidance did not impact our results of operations or
financial position.

68

In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we adopted new accounting requirements for the presentation of certain
investments using the net asset value, providing a practical expedient to exclude such investments from
categorization within the fair value hierarchy and separate disclosure. We adopted the guidance retrospectively
and restated the fiscal 2016 fair value of plan asset tables in Note 13. The adoption of this guidance did not
impact our results of operations or financial position.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we adopted new accounting requirements which permit reporting entities with a
fiscal year-end that does not coincide with a month-end to apply a practical expedient that permits the entity to
measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the month-end that is closest to the entity’s fiscal
year-end and apply such practical expedient consistently to all plans. The adoption of this guidance did not have
a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we adopted new accounting requirements for the presentation of deferred tax
assets and liabilities, requiring noncurrent classification for all deferred tax assets and liabilities on the statement
of financial position. This presentation change has been implemented retroactively. The adoption of this guidance
did not have a material impact on our financial position.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we adopted new accounting requirements for the classification of debt issuance
costs presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability. This
presentation change has been implemented retroactively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material
impact on our financial position.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURES

On April 24, 2018, we acquired Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc. (“Blue Buffalo”) for an aggregate purchase price
of $8.0 billion, including $103.0 million of consideration for net debt repaid at the time of the acquisition. In
accordance with the definitive agreement and plan of merger, a subsidiary of General Mills merged into Blue
Buffalo, with Blue Buffalo surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of General Mills. In accordance
with the merger agreement, equity holders of Blue Buffalo received $40.00 per share in cash. We financed the
transaction with a combination of $6.0 billion in debt, $1.0 billion in equity, and cash on hand. The acquisition
accelerates our portfolio reshaping strategy. In fiscal 2018, we recorded acquisition transaction and integration
costs of $34.0 million recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses and $49.9 million in interest, net
related to the debt issued to finance the acquisition.

We consolidated Blue Buffalo into our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recorded goodwill of $5.3 billion, an
indefinite lived intangible asset for the Blue Buffalo brand of $2.7 billion, and a finite lived customer relationship
asset of $269.0 million. The goodwill was primarily attributable to future growth opportunities and any
intangible assets that did not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill is included in the Pet reporting unit
and is not deductible for tax purposes. We have conducted a preliminary assessment of certain assets and
liabilities related to the acquisition of Blue Buffalo. We are continuing our review of these items during the
measurement period, and if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the
acquisition date, the acquisition accounting will be revised to reflect the resulting adjustments to current
estimates of these items.

The consolidated results of Blue Buffalo will be reported as our Pet operating segment in future periods on a
one-month lag. Accordingly, in fiscal 2018, our Consolidated Statements of Earnings do not include Pet
operating segment results.

forma amounts include interest expense of $238.7 million on the debt issued to finance the transaction and
amortization expense of $13.5 million based on the estimated fair value and useful life of the customer
relationships intangible asset. Additionally, the pro forma amounts include an increase to cost of sales by
$1.6 million in fiscal 2017 and $5.1 million in fiscal 2018 to reflect the impact of using the LIFO method of
inventory valuation on Blue Buffalo’s historical operating results. Pro forma amounts include related tax effects
of $125.1 million in fiscal 2017 and $14.5 million in fiscal 2018. Unaudited pro forma amounts are not

During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we sold our Martel, Ohio manufacturing facility in our Convenience
Stores & Foodservice segment and simultaneously entered into a co-packing agreement with the purchaser. We
received $17.5 million in cash, and recorded a pre-tax loss of $13.5 million.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we sold our General Mills de Venezuela CA subsidiary to a third party
and exited our business in Venezuela. As a result of this transaction, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $37.6 million.
In addition, we sold our General Mills Argentina S.A. foodservice business in Argentina to a third party and
recorded a pre-tax loss of $14.8 million.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we sold our North American Green Giant product
lines for
$822.7 million in cash, and we recorded a pre-tax gain of $199.1 million. We received net cash proceeds of
$788.0 million after transaction related costs. After the divestiture, we retained a brand intangible asset on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets of $30.1 million related to our continued use of the Green Giant brand in certain
markets outside of North America.

NOTE 4. RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT, AND OTHER EXIT COSTS

INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT

In fiscal 2018, we recorded a $96.9 million charge related to the impairment of our, Yoki, Mountain High and
Immaculate Baking brand intangible assets in restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs. Please see Note 6
for additional information.

RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES

We view our restructuring activities as actions that help us meet our long-term growth targets. Activities we
undertake must meet internal rate of return and net present value targets. Each restructuring action normally takes
one to two years to complete. At completion (or as each major stage is completed in the case of multi-year
programs), the project begins to deliver cash savings and/or reduced depreciation. These activities result in
various restructuring costs, including asset write-offs, exit charges including severance, contract termination fees,
and decommissioning and other costs. Accelerated depreciation associated with restructured assets, as used in the
context of our disclosures regarding restructuring activity, refers to the increase in depreciation expense caused
by shortening the useful life or updating the salvage value of depreciable fixed assets to coincide with the end of
production under an approved restructuring plan. Any impairment of the asset is recognized immediately in the
period the plan is approved.

We are currently pursuing several multi-year restructuring initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and
focus our business behind our key growth strategies. Charges recorded in fiscal 2018 related to these initiatives
were as follows:

In Millions

Global cost savings initiatives
Global reorganization
Closure of Melbourne, Australia plant

Closure of Vineland, New Jersey plant

In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we approved restructuring actions designed to better align our organizational
structure with our strategic initiatives. These actions affected 600 positions and we incurred $69.9 million of net
expenses relating to these actions, most of which was cash. Restructuring charges relating to these actions were
reduced by $2.2 million in fiscal 2018. We recorded $72.1 million of restructuring charges relating to these
actions in fiscal 2017. These actions were completed in fiscal 2018.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we notified the employees and their representatives of our decision to close
our pasta manufacturing facility in Melbourne, Australia in our Europe & Australia segment to improve our
margin structure. This action will affect approximately 350 positions, and we expect to incur approximately
$40 million of net expenses relating to this action, most of which will be non-cash. We recorded $15.7 million of
restructuring charges relating to this action in fiscal 2018 and $21.9 million in fiscal 2017. We expect this action
to be completed by the end of fiscal 2019.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we announced a plan to restructure certain product lines in our Asia & Latin
America segment. To eliminate excess capacity, we closed our snacks manufacturing facility in Marília, Brazil
and ceased production operations for meals and snacks at our facility in São Bernardo do Campo, Brazil. We also
ceased production of certain underperforming snack products at our facility in Nanjing, China. These and other
actions will affect approximately 420 positions in our Brazilian operations and approximately 440 positions in
our Greater China operations. We expect to incur approximately $46 million of net expenses related to these
actions, most of which will be non-cash. Restructuring charges relating to these actions were reduced by
$0.1 million in fiscal 2018. We recorded $45.1 million of restructuring charges relating to these actions in fiscal
2017. We expect these actions to be completed by the end of fiscal 2019.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we approved Project Compass, a restructuring plan designed to enable our
international operations to accelerate long-term growth through increased organizational effectiveness and

72

reduced administrative expense. In connection with this project, we eliminated 749 positions. We incurred
$54.7 million of net expenses, most of which was cash. We recorded $0.4 million of restructuring charges
relating to this action in fiscal 2018, restructuring charges were reduced by $0.4 million in fiscal 2017, and we
incurred $54.7 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2016. This action was completed in fiscal 2018.

In fiscal 2015, we announced Project Century (Century) which initially involved a review of our North American
manufacturing and distribution network to streamline operations and identify potential capacity reductions. In
fiscal 2016, we broadened the scope of Century to identify opportunities to streamline our supply chain outside
of North America.

As part of Century, in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we approved a restructuring plan to close manufacturing
facilities in our Europe & Australia segment supply chain located in Berwick, United Kingdom and East Tamaki,
New Zealand. These actions affected 287 positions and we incurred $31.8 million of net expenses related to these
actions, of which $12 million was cash. We recorded $1.8 million of restructuring charges relating to these
actions in fiscal 2017 and $30.0 million in fiscal 2016. These actions were completed in fiscal 2017.

As part of Century, in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we approved a restructuring plan to close our West
Chicago, Illinois cereal and dry dinner manufacturing plant in our North America Retail segment supply chain.
This action affected 484 positions, and we incurred $109.3 million of net expenses relating to this action, of
which $21 million was cash. We recorded $6.9 million of restructuring charges relating to this action in fiscal
2018, $23.2 million in fiscal 2017 and $79.2 million in fiscal 2016. This action was completed in fiscal 2018.

As part of Century, in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we approved a restructuring plan to close our Joplin,
Missouri snacks plant in our North America Retail segment supply chain. This action affected 125 positions, and
we incurred $8.0 million of net expenses relating to this action, of which less than $1 million was cash. We
recorded $1.4 million of restructuring charges relating to this action in fiscal 2018, $0.3 million in fiscal 2017,
and $6.3 million in fiscal 2016. This action was completed in fiscal 2018.

We paid cash related to restructuring initiatives of $53.6 million in fiscal 2018, $107.8 million in fiscal 2017, and
$122.6 million in fiscal 2016.

In addition to restructuring charges, we expect to incur approximately $130 million of project-related costs,
which will be recorded in cost of sales, all of which will be cash. We recorded project-related costs in cost of
sales of $11.3 million in fiscal 2018, $43.9 million in fiscal 2017, and $57.5 million in fiscal 2016. We paid cash
for project-related costs of $10.9 million in fiscal 2018, $46.9 million in fiscal 2017, and $54.5 million in fiscal
2016. We expect these activities to be completed in fiscal 2019.

While having significant coverage as of our fiscal 2018 assessment date, the Food Should Taste Good and Green
Giant brand intangible assets and U.S. Yogurt reporting unit had risk of decreasing coverage. We will continue to
monitor these businesses for potential impairment.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we executed our fiscal 2019 planning process and preliminary long-
range planning process, which resulted in lower future sales and profitability projections in our plans for the
businesses supporting our Yoki, Mountain High, and Immaculate Baking brand intangible assets. As a result of
this triggering event, we performed an interim impairment assessment of these assets as of May 27, 2018, and
determined that the fair value of these brand assets no longer exceeded the carrying values of the respective
assets. Significant assumptions used in that assessment included our updated long-range cash flow projections for
the businesses, royalty rates, weighted average cost of capital rates, and tax rates. We recorded a $96.9 million
impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 related to these assets as follows:

We realized $6.8 million of gains from the sale of available-for-sale marketable securities. Gains and losses are
determined by specific identification. Classification of marketable securities as current or noncurrent
is
dependent upon our intended holding period and the security’s maturity date. The aggregate unrealized gains and
losses on available-for-sale securities, net of tax effects, are classified in AOCI within stockholders’ equity.

As of May 27, 2018, we did not any have cash and cash equivalents pledged as collateral for derivative contracts.
As of May 27, 2018, $0.9 million of certain accounts receivable were pledged as collateral against a foreign
uncommitted line of credit.

The fair value and carrying amounts of long-term debt, including the current portion, were $14,169.7 million and
$14,268.8 million, respectively, as of May 27, 2018. The fair value of long-term debt was estimated using market
quotations and discounted cash flows based on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of
instruments. Long-term debt is a Level 2 liability in the fair value hierarchy.

RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

As a part of our ongoing operations, we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest and foreign
currency exchange rates and commodity and equity prices. To manage these risks, we may enter into various
derivative transactions (e.g., futures, options, and swaps) pursuant to our established policies.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

Many commodities we use in the production and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks.
We utilize derivatives to manage price risk for our principal ingredients and energy costs, including grains (oats,
wheat, and corn), oils (principally soybean), dairy products, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Our primary objective
when entering into these derivative contracts is to achieve certainty with regard to the future price of
commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. We manage our exposures through a combination of
purchase orders, long-term contracts with suppliers, exchange-traded futures and options, and over-the-counter
options and swaps. We offset our exposures based on current and projected market conditions and generally seek
to acquire the inputs at as close to our planned cost as possible.

We use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in commodity prices. We do not perform the assessments
required to achieve hedge accounting for commodity derivative positions. Accordingly, the changes in the values
of these derivatives are recorded currently in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Although we do not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, we believe that these instruments are
effective in achieving our objective of providing certainty in the future price of commodities purchased for use in
our supply chain. Accordingly, for purposes of measuring segment operating performance these gains and losses
are reported in unallocated corporate items outside of segment operating results until such time that the exposure
we are managing affects earnings. At that time we reclassify the gain or loss from unallocated corporate items to
segment operating profit, allowing our operating segments to realize the economic effects of the derivative
without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in unallocated corporate items.

78

Unallocated corporate items for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 included:

As of May 27, 2018,
the net notional value of commodity derivatives was $238.8 million, of which
$147.9 million related to agricultural inputs and $90.9 million related to energy inputs. These contracts relate to
inputs that generally will be utilized within the next 12 months.

INTEREST RATE RISK

We are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed-rate debt, and existing and
future issuances of floating-rate debt. Primary exposures include U.S. Treasury rates, LIBOR, Euribor, and
commercial paper rates in the United States and Europe. We use interest rate swaps, forward-starting interest rate
swaps, and treasury locks to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes, to reduce the volatility of our financing
costs, and to achieve a desired proportion of fixed rate versus floating-rate debt, based on current and projected
market conditions. Generally under these swaps, we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference
between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount.

Floating Interest Rate Exposures — Floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges,
as are all hedges of forecasted issuances of debt. Effectiveness is assessed based on either the perfectly effective
hypothetical derivative method or changes in the present value of interest payments on the underlying debt.
Effective gains and losses deferred to AOCI are reclassified into earnings over the life of the associated debt.
Ineffective gains and losses are recorded as net interest. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was a $2.6 million
loss in fiscal 2018, and less than $1 million in fiscal 2017 and 2016.

Fixed Interest Rate Exposures — Fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges with
effectiveness assessed based on changes in the fair value of the underlying debt and derivatives, using
incremental borrowing rates currently available on loans with similar terms and maturities. Ineffective gains and
losses on these derivatives and the underlying hedged items are recorded as net interest. The amount of hedge
ineffectiveness was a $3.4 million loss in fiscal 2018, a $4.3 million gain in fiscal 2017, and less than $1 million
in fiscal 2016.

In advance of planned debt financing related to the acquisition of Blue Buffalo, we entered into $3,800.0 million
of treasury locks due April 19, 2018, with an average fixed rate of 2.9 percent, of which $2,300.0 million were
entered into in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and $1,500.0 million were entered into in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2018. All of these treasury locks were cash settled for $43.9 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal
2018, concurrent with the issuance of our $850.0 million 5.5-year fixed-rate notes, $800.0 million 7-year fixed-
rate notes, $1,400.0 million 10-year fixed-rate notes, $500.0 million 20-year fixed-rate notes, and $650.0 million
30-year fixed-rate notes.

In advance of planned debt financing, in fiscal 2018, we entered into $500.0 million of treasury locks due
October 15, 2017 with an average fixed rate of 1.8 percent. All of these treasury locks were cash settled for
$3.7 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, concurrent with the issuance of our $500.0 million 5-year
fixed-rate notes.

79

In advance of planned debt financing, in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we
entered into $100.0 million and $400.0 million, respectively, of treasury locks due February 15, 2017 with an
average fixed rate of 2.0 percent. All of these treasury locks were cash settled for $17.2 million during the third
quarter of fiscal 2017, concurrent with the issuance of our $750.0 million 10-year fixed-rate notes.

As of May 27, 2018, the pre-tax amount of cash-settled interest rate hedge gain or loss remaining in AOCI,
which will be reclassified to earnings over the remaining term of the related underlying debt, follows:

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

Foreign currency fluctuations affect our net investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency cash flows
related to third party purchases, intercompany loans, product shipments, and foreign-denominated debt. We are
also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. Our principal exposures are to the
Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen,
Mexican peso, and Swiss franc. We primarily use foreign currency forward contracts to selectively hedge our
foreign currency cash flow exposures. We also generally swap our foreign-denominated commercial paper
borrowings and nonfunctional currency intercompany loans back to U.S. dollars or the functional currency of the
entity with foreign exchange exposure. The gains or losses on these derivatives offset the foreign currency
revaluation gains or losses recorded in earnings on the associated borrowings. We generally do not hedge more
than 18 months in advance.

As of May 27, 2018, the net notional value of foreign exchange derivatives was $899.5 million. The amount of
hedge ineffectiveness was less than $1 million in each of fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016.

80

We also have many net investments in foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in euros. We previously hedged
a portion of these net investments by issuing euro-denominated commercial paper and foreign exchange forward
contracts. As of May 27, 2018, we hedged a portion of these net investments with €2,200.0 million of euro
denominated bonds. As of May 27, 2018, we had deferred net foreign currency transaction losses of
$142.3 million in AOCI associated with net investment hedging activity.

EQUITY INSTRUMENTS
Equity price movements affect our compensation expense as certain investments made by our employees in our
deferred compensation plan are revalued. We use equity swaps to manage this risk. As of May 27, 2018, the net
notional amount of our equity swaps was $165.3 million. These swap contracts mature in fiscal 2019.

CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES

Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain an investment grade credit rating on
our debt from each of the major credit rating agencies. If our debt were to fall below investment grade, the
counterparties to the derivative instruments could request full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability
positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in
a liability position on May 27, 2018, was $7.2 million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts. If the credit-
risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered on May 27, 2018, we would have been
required to post $7.2 million of collateral to counterparties.

No customer other than Walmart accounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated net sales.

We enter into interest rate, foreign exchange, and certain commodity and equity derivatives, primarily with a
diversified group of highly rated counterparties. We continually monitor our positions and the credit ratings of the
counterparties involved and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure to any one party. These transactions may
expose us to potential losses due to the risk of nonperformance by these counterparties; however, we have not incurred
a material loss. We also enter into commodity futures transactions through various regulated exchanges.

The amount of loss due to the credit risk of the counterparties, should the counterparties fail to perform according to
the terms of the contracts, is $15.2 million against which we do not hold collateral. Under the terms of our swap
agreements, some of our transactions require collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to
threshold levels of exposure and counterparty credit risk. Collateral assets are either cash or U.S. Treasury instruments
and are held in a trust account that we may access if the counterparty defaults.

We offer certain suppliers access to third party services that allow them to view our scheduled payments online. The
third party services also allow suppliers to finance advances on our scheduled payments at the sole discretion of the
supplier and the third party. We have no economic interest in these financing arrangements and no direct relationship
with the suppliers, the third parties, or any financial institutions concerning this service. All of our accounts payable
remain as obligations to our suppliers as stated in our supplier agreements. As of May 27, 2018, $936.6 million of our
accounts payable is payable to suppliers who utilize these third party services.

In February 2018, we entered into a fee-paid commitment letter with certain lenders, pursuant to which such
lenders committed to provide a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan credit facility (the “Bridge Facility”)
in an aggregate principal amount of up to $8.5 billion to provide the financing for the acquisition of Blue
Buffalo. The Bridge Facility expired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.

The credit facilities contain covenants, including a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at
least 2.5 times. We were in compliance with all credit facility covenants as of May 27, 2018.

Long-Term Debt

In April 2018, we issued $4,800.0 million principal amount of fixed-rate notes. Interest on the notes is payable
semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the notes in whole, or in part, at any time at the applicable redemption
price. The notes are senior unsecured obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision. The net
proceeds were used to finance a portion of the Blue Buffalo acquisition. The principal amounts of these fixed-
rate notes were as follows:

1.4 percent fixed-rate notes.

In March 2017, we issued €300.0 million principal amount of floating-rate notes due March 20, 2019. Interest on
the notes is payable quarterly in arrears. The notes are not generally redeemable prior to maturity. These notes
are senior unsecured obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision. The net proceeds were
used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper.

In February 2017, we repaid $1.0 billion of 5.7 percent fixed-rate notes.

In January 2017, we issued $750.0 million principal amount of 3.2 percent fixed-rate notes due February 10,
2027. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the notes in whole or in part at
any time at the applicable redemption price. The notes are senior unsecured obligations that include a change of

Principal payments due on long-term debt and capital leases in the next five years based on stated contractual
maturities, our intent to redeem, or put rights of certain note holders are $1,600.1 million in fiscal 2019,
$1,082.9 million in fiscal 2020, $2,039.9 million in fiscal 2021, $1,232.9 million in fiscal 2022, and
$1,082.6 million in fiscal 2023.

Certain of our long-term debt agreements contain restrictive covenants. As of May 27, 2018, we were in
compliance with all of these covenants.

As of May 27, 2018, the $54.2 million pre-tax loss recorded in AOCI associated with our previously designated
interest rate swaps will be reclassified to net interest over the remaining lives of the hedged transactions. The
amount expected to be reclassified from AOCI to net interest in fiscal 2019 is a $9.1 million pre-tax loss.

NOTE 9. REDEEMABLE AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

Our principal redeemable and noncontrolling interests relate to our Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, Liberté
Marques Sàrl, and General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) subsidiaries. In addition, we have 4 foreign subsidiaries
that have noncontrolling interests totaling $12.6 million as of May 27, 2018.

We have a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplait SAS and a 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and
Liberté Marques Sàrl. Sodiaal holds the remaining interests in each of the entities. On the acquisition date, we
recorded the $904.4 million fair value of Sodiaal’s 49 percent euro-denominated interest in Yoplait SAS as a
redeemable interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its
redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three times before December 2024. We adjust the
value of the redeemable interest through additional paid-in capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets quarterly
to the redeemable interest’s redemption value, which approximates its fair value. Yoplait SAS pays dividends
annually if it meets certain financial metrics set forth in its shareholders agreement. As of May 27, 2018, the
redemption value of the euro-denominated redeemable interest was $776.2 million.

On the acquisition dates, we recorded the $281.4 million fair value of Sodiaal’s 50 percent euro-denominated
interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and 50 percent Canadian dollar-denominated interest in Liberté Marques Sàrl as
noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Yoplait Marques SNC earns a royalty stream
through a licensing agreement with Yoplait SAS for the rights to Yoplait and related trademarks. Liberté
Marques Sàrl earns a royalty stream through licensing agreements with certain Yoplait group companies for the
rights to Liberté and related trademarks. These entities pay dividends annually based on their available cash as of
their fiscal year end.

We paid dividends of $37.7 million in fiscal 2018 and $48.6 million in fiscal 2017 to Sodiaal under the terms of
the Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, and Liberté Marques Sàrl shareholder agreements.

A subsidiary of Yoplait SAS has entered into an exclusive milk supply agreement for its European operations
with Sodiaal at market-determined prices through July 1, 2021. Net purchases totaled $230.8 million for fiscal
2018 and $186.4 million for fiscal 2017.

The holder of the GMC Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income
based on the application of a floating preferred return rate to the holder’s capital account balance established in
the most recent mark-to-market valuation (currently $251.5 million). On June 1, 2015, the floating preferred
return rate on GMC’s Class A interests was reset to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 125 basis points. The
preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest holder
or through a remarketing auction. On June 1, 2018, subsequent to our year-end, the floating preferred return rate
on GMC’s Class A Interests was reset to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 142.5 basis points.

For financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows of our non-wholly
owned consolidated subsidiaries are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The third-party

88

investor’s share of the net earnings of these subsidiaries is reflected in net earnings attributable to redeemable
and noncontrolling interests in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 27, 2018, we were in compliance with all
of these covenants.

NOTE 10. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Cumulative preference stock of 5.0 million shares, without par value, is authorized but unissued.

On May 6, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of our common
stock. Purchases under the authorization can be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions,
including the use of call options and other derivative instruments, Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, and accelerated
repurchase programs. The authorization has no specified termination date.

On March 27, 2018, we issued 22.7 million shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.10 per share, at
a public offering price of $44.00 per share for total proceeds of $1.0 billion. We paid $30.1 million in issuance
costs that were recorded in additional paid-in capital. The net proceeds of $969.9 million were used to finance a
portion of the acquisition of Blue Buffalo.

stranded income tax effects resulting from the TCJA from AOCI to retained earnings. We elected to reclassify

14 for additional information.

NOTE 11. STOCK PLANS

We use broad-based stock plans to help ensure that management’s interests are aligned with those of our
shareholders. As of May 27, 2018, a total of 34.9 million shares were available for grant in the form of stock
options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and shares of unrestricted stock under the 2017 Stock
Compensation Plan (2017 Plan). The 2017 Plan also provides for the issuance of cash-settled share-based units,
stock appreciation rights, and performance-based stock awards. Stock-based awards now outstanding include
some granted under the 2007, 2009, and 2011 stock plans and the 2006 and 2011 compensation plans for
non-employee directors, under which no further awards may be granted. The stock plans provide for potential
accelerated vesting of awards upon retirement, termination, or death of eligible employees and directors.

Stock Options
The estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model were as follows:

We estimate the fair value of each option on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which
requires us to make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior,
dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. We estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility
over the expected term of the option, excluding time periods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant
would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility. We also have considered, but did not use, implied
volatility in our estimate, because trading activity in options on our stock, especially those with tenors of greater
than 6 months, is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility.

Our expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on
historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model. Separate

91

groups of employees have similar historical exercise behavior and therefore were aggregated into a single pool
for valuation purposes. The weighted-average expected term for all employee groups is presented in the table
above. The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S.
Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously
recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows as an operating cash flow. Realized windfall tax benefits and shortfall tax deficiencies related to the
exercise or vesting of stock-based awards are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.

Options may be priced at 100 percent or more of the fair market value on the date of grant, and generally vest
four years after the date of grant. Options generally expire within 10 years and one month after the date of grant.

Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Share Units
Stock and units settled in stock subject to a restricted period and a purchase price, if any (as determined by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors), may be granted to key employees under the 2017 Plan.

92

Restricted stock and restricted stock units generally vest and become unrestricted four years after the date of
grant. Performance share units are earned primarily based on our future achievement of three-year goals for
average organic net sales growth and cumulative free cash flow. Performance share units are settled in common
stock and are generally subject to a three year performance and vesting period. The sale or transfer of these
awards is restricted during the vesting period. Participants holding restricted stock, but not restricted stock units
or performance share units, are entitled to vote on matters submitted to holders of common stock for a vote.
These awards accumulate dividends from the date of grant, but participants only receive payment if the awards
vest.

NOTE 13. RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

Defined Benefit Pension Plans
We have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, Switzerland,
France, and the United Kingdom. Benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final
average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees include various monthly amounts for each year of credited
service. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws. We made no voluntary
contributions to our principal U.S. plans in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016. We do not expect to be required to make
any contributions in fiscal 2019. Our principal domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a
provision that any excess pension assets would be allocated to active participants if the plan is terminated within
five years of a change in control. All salaried employees hired on or after June 1, 2013, are eligible for a
retirement program that does not include a defined benefit pension plan.

In fiscal 2018, we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and the
supplemental pension plans that resulted in the spinoff of a portion of the General Mills Pension Plan (the Plan)
and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan and the Supplemental Retirement Plan (Grandfathered) (together,
the Supplemental Plans) into new plans effective May 31, 2018. The benefits offered to the plans’ participants
were unchanged. The result of the reorganization was the creation of the General Mills Pension Plan I (Plan I)
and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan I and the Supplemental Retirement Plan I (Grandfathered) (together,
the Supplemental Plans I). The reorganization was made to facilitate a targeted investment strategy over time and
to provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. Actuarial gains and
losses associated with the Plan and the Supplemental Plans are amortized over the average remaining service life
of the active participants. Actuarial gains and losses associated with the Plan I and the Supplemental Plans I are
amortized over the average remaining life of the participants.

In May 2017, we announced changes to the United States pension plans. The Company will freeze the pay and
service amounts used to calculate pension benefits for active employees who participate in the United States

94

pension plans as of December 31, 2027. Beginning January 1, 2028, active employees in the United States will
not accrue additional benefits for future service and eligible compensation received under these plans. These
changes resulted in a $130.9 million decline in the projected benefit obligation as of May 28, 2017, due to the
decrease in expected future compensation.

Other Postretirement Benefit Plans
We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and
Brazil. The United States salaried health care benefit plan is contributory, with retiree contributions based on
years of service. We make decisions to fund related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis.
We made no voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2018 and $20.0 million in fiscal 2017.

Health Care Cost Trend Rates
Assumed health care cost trends are as follows:

Health care cost trend rate for next year
Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline

(ultimate rate)

Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate

Fiscal Year
2018
6.7% and 7.0%

2017
7.0% and 7.3%

4.5%
2029

5.0%
2024

We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care
claims experience and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience,
plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations.
Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent
experiences, and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 7.0 percent for
retirees age 65 and over and 6.7 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2018. Rates are graded down
annually until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5 percent is reached in 2029 for all retirees. The trend rates are
applicable for calculations only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate
trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term
inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an
important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans.

A one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects:

Postemployment Benefit Plans
Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former or inactive
employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. We recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that
vest or accumulate with service. Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as
severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our
postemployment benefit plans are unfunded.

95

In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we adopted new accounting requirements which permit reporting entities with a
fiscal year-end that does not coincide with a month-end to apply a practical expedient to measure defined benefit
plan assets and obligations using the month-end that is closest to the entity’s fiscal year-end and apply such
practical expedient consistently to all plans. We measured the plan assets and obligations for our defined benefit
pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans as of May 31, 2018, and May 31, 2017.

Discount Rates
Beginning in fiscal 2017, we changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the
net periodic benefit expense for our United States and most of our international defined benefit pension, other
postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans. We adopted a full yield curve approach to estimate
service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the
benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. This method provides a more precise measurement of
service and interest costs by correlating the timing of the plans’ liability cash flows to the corresponding rate on
the yield curve. Previously, we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weighted-average discount
rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. This
change does not affect the measurement of our benefit obligations related to these plans. We have accounted for
this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.

Beginning in fiscal 2017, our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of May 31 for our defined benefit
pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We also use discount rates as of
May 31 to determine defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income
and expense for the following fiscal year. We work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of
expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above Median corporate bond yield, to develop a
forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is
applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions.

There were no material changes in our level 3 investments in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.

Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets
Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term
investment performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries,
investment services, and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption
annually for each plan; however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself,
significantly influence our evaluation.

Weighted-average asset allocations for the past two fiscal years for our defined benefit pension and other
postretirement benefit plans are as follows:

The investment objective for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the
benefit obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us. Our goal is to optimize the long-term return on plan
assets at a moderate level of risk. The defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan
portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes. Within asset classes, the portfolios are further diversified
across investment styles and investment organizations. For the defined benefit pension plans, the long-term
investment policy allocation is: 20 percent to equities in the United States; 15 percent to international equities;
10 percent to private equities; 40 percent to fixed income; and 15 percent to real assets (real estate, energy, and
infrastructure). For other postretirement benefit plans, the long-term investment policy allocations are: 15 percent
to equities in the United States; 10 percent to international equities; 5 percent to private equities; 65 percent to
fixed income; and 5 percent to real assets (real estate, energy, and timber). The actual allocations to these asset
classes may vary tactically around the long-term policy allocations based on relative market valuations.

Contributions and Future Benefit Payments
We do not expect to be required to make contributions to our defined benefit pension, other postretirement
benefit, and postemployment benefit plans in fiscal 2019. Actual fiscal 2019 contributions could exceed our
current projections, as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts and
future changes in regulatory requirements. Estimated benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as
appropriate, are expected to be paid from fiscal 2019 to 2028 as follows:

Defined Contribution Plans
The General Mills Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan that covers domestic salaried, hourly, nonunion,
and certain union employees. This plan is a 401(k) savings plan that includes a number of investment funds,
including a Company stock fund and an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). We sponsor another money
purchase plan for certain domestic hourly employees with net assets of $23.9 million as of May 27, 2018, and
$23.0 million as of May 28, 2017. We also sponsor defined contribution plans in many of our foreign locations.
Our total recognized expense related to defined contribution plans was $49.2 million in fiscal 2018, $54.1 million
in fiscal 2017, and $61.2 million in fiscal 2016.

We match a percentage of employee contributions to the General Mills Savings Plan. The Company match is
directed to investment options of the participant’s choosing. The number of shares of our common stock
allocated to participants in the ESOP was 5.6 million as of May 27, 2018, and 6.3 million as of May 28, 2017.
The ESOP’s only assets are our common stock and temporary cash balances.

The Company stock fund and the ESOP collectively held $392.1 million and $598.7 million of Company
common stock as of May 27, 2018 and May 28, 2017, respectively.

We have established a valuation allowance against certain of the categories of deferred tax assets described
above as current evidence does not suggest we will realize sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character
(e.g., ordinary income versus capital gain income) within the carryforward period to allow us to realize these
deferred tax benefits.

102

Of the total valuation allowance of $176.0 million, the majority relates to a deferred tax asset for losses recorded
as part of the Pillsbury acquisition in the amount of $108.0 million, $54.0 million relates to various state and
foreign loss carryforwards, and $12.9 million relates to various foreign capital loss carryforwards. As of May 27,
2018, we believe it is more-likely-than-not that the remainder of our deferred tax assets are realizable.

We have $174.1 million of tax loss carryforwards. Of this amount, $159.8 million is foreign loss carryforwards,
$13.6 million is state operating loss carryforwards, and $0.7 million is federal operating loss carryforwards. The
carryforward periods are as follows: $115.2 million do not expire; $6.0 million expire in fiscal 2019 and 2020;
and $52.9 million expire in fiscal 2021 and beyond.

On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law. The TCJA results in significant revisions to the U.S.
corporate income tax system, including a reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate, implementation of a
territorial system, and a one-time deemed repatriation tax on untaxed foreign earnings. The TCJA also results in
a U.S. federal blended statutory rate of 29.4 percent for us in fiscal 2018. Generally, the impacts of the new
legislation would be required to be recorded in the period of enactment which for us was the third quarter of
fiscal 2018. However, Accounting Standards Update 2018-05: Income Taxes (Topic 740) (ASU 2018-05) was
issued with guidance allowing for the recognition of provisional amounts in the event that the accounting is not
complete and a reasonable estimate can be made. The guidance allows for a measurement period of up to one
year from the enactment date to finalize the accounting related to the TCJA.

As of May 27, 2018, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA. During fiscal 2018,
we recorded a provisional net benefit using reasonable estimates for those tax effects based on analysis and
information available to date. The provisional net benefit is subject to revisions as we complete our analysis of
the TCJA, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury
Department, Internal Revenue Service, Financial Accounting Standards Board, and other standard setting and
regulatory bodies. Adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the
period in which the adjustments are made. Our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA will be completed
during the measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date.

During fiscal 2018, we recorded an estimated net discrete benefit of $523.5 million. This net benefit consists
primarily of a $637.5 million provisional deferred tax benefit from revaluing our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities
to reflect the new U.S. corporate tax rate, partially offset by an $83.9 million provisional charge for the estimated
transition tax and an additional $30.1 million provisional deferred tax liability related to changes in our assertion
that we will reinvest unremitted foreign earnings indefinitely.

Our estimate of the deferred tax benefit due to the revaluation of our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities is a
provisional amount. Due to the newly enacted U.S. tax rate change, timing differences that are estimated
balances as of the date of enactment will result in changes to our estimate of the deferred rate change when those
estimates are finalized with the filing of our fiscal 2018 income tax return. This is a result of the different federal
income tax rates of 29.4 percent and 21.0 percent for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, respectively. Since many of
the deferred tax balances in the period of enactment include estimates of events that have not yet occurred, we
are unable to determine the final impact of the tax rate change at this time.

As of May 27, 2018, we have not recognized a deferred tax liability for unremitted earnings of approximately
$2.4 billion from our foreign operations because we currently believe our subsidiaries have invested or will
invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely, or the earnings will be remitted in a tax-neutral transaction.
Deferred taxes are recorded for earnings of our foreign operations when we determine that such earnings are no
longer indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the TCJA, we are re-evaluating our assertion regarding the indefinite
reinvestment of foreign earnings for most legal entities owned directly by our U.S. subsidiaries, and as such, we
may need to accrue additional deferred taxes related to any future changes in our assertion. As of May 27, 2018,
we have recorded a provisional estimate for local country withholding taxes related to certain entities from which
we expect to repatriate undistributed earnings. However, we do not have the necessary information gathered,

103

prepared and analyzed to make a reasonable estimate of any deferred taxes related to the rest of our foreign
subsidiaries where we may change our indefinite reinvestment assertion. We will gather the information
necessary for those subsidiaries and record any new deferred taxes in future periods after the analysis is
complete.

In general, the transition tax is a result of the deemed repatriation imposed by the new legislation that results in
the taxation of our accumulated foreign earnings and profits (E&P) at a 15.5 percent rate on liquid assets (i.e.
cash and other specified assets) and 8 percent on the remaining unremitted foreign E&P, both net of foreign tax
credits. At this time, we have not yet gathered, prepared and analyzed the information necessary to complete the
complex calculations required to finalize the amount of our transition tax. We believe that our provisional
calculations result in a reasonable estimate of the transition tax and related foreign tax credit, and as such have
included those amounts in our provisional estimate in fiscal 2018. As we complete the analysis of accumulated
foreign E&P and related foreign taxes paid on an entity by entity basis and finalize the amounts held in cash or
other specified assets, we will update our provisional estimate of the transition tax and related foreign tax credit
in a future period.

The legislation also includes provisions that will affect our fiscal 2019 results, including but not limited to, a
reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate on domestic operations; the creation of a new minimum tax called the
base erosion anti-abuse tax; a new provision that taxes U.S. allocated expenses as well as currently taxes certain
income from foreign operations (Global Intangible Low Tax Income or GILTI); a new limitation on deductible
interest expense; the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction; and limitations on the deductibility of
certain executive compensation.

While the new legislation generally eliminates U.S. federal income tax on dividends from foreign subsidiaries
going forward, certain income earned by certain subsidiaries must be included currently in our U.S. taxable
income under the new GILTI inclusion rules. Because of the complexity of the new GILTI rules, we are
evaluating this provision and the application of U.S. GAAP. Under U.S. GAAP, we are allowed to make an
accounting policy election and record the taxes as a period cost as incurred or factor such amounts into the
measurement of deferred taxes. We have made an accounting policy election to record these taxes as a period
cost.

In addition, in fiscal 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update 2018-02: Income Statement – Reporting
Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) (ASU 2018-02), which provides the option to reclassify stranded income tax
effects resulting from TCJA from AOCI to retained earnings. We elected to reclassify the stranded income tax
effects of the TCJA of $329.4 million from AOCI to retained earnings. This reclassification consists of deferred
taxes originally recorded in AOCI that exceed the newly enacted federal corporate tax rate. The new accounting
requirements allow for adjustments to reclassification amounts in subsequent periods as a result of changes to the
provisional amounts recorded.

We are subject to federal income taxes in the United States as well as various state, local, and foreign
jurisdictions. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved.
While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax
position, we believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjust these
liabilities, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any
particular position would usually require the use of cash.

The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions
include the United States (federal and state) and Canada. Various tax examinations by United States state taxing
authorities could be conducted for any open tax year, which vary by jurisdiction, but are generally from 3 to 5
years.

Several state and foreign examinations are currently in progress. We do not expect these examinations to result in
a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.

104

During fiscal 2017, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concluded its field examination of our federal tax returns
for fiscal 2013 and 2014. The audit closure and related adjustments did not have a material impact on our results
of operations or financial position. In fiscal 2018, we recorded an adjustment related to a prior year which
increased income tax expense by $40.9 million. We have notified and are working with the IRS to resolve the
issue. We determined the adjustment to be immaterial to our Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the fiscal
year ended May 27, 2018. We have effectively settled all issues with the IRS for fiscal years 2014 and prior.

During fiscal 2017, the Brazilian tax authority, Secretaria da Receita Federal do Brasil (RFB), concluded audits
of our 2012 and 2013 tax return years. These audits included a review of our determinations of amortization of
certain goodwill arising from the acquisition of Yoki. The RFB has proposed adjustments that effectively
eliminate the goodwill amortization benefits related to this transaction. We believe we have meritorious defenses
and intend to contest the disallowance.

We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions.
Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being
ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of
uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the period of such change.

The following table sets forth changes in our total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, excluding accrued
interest, for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017. Approximately $135 million of this total in fiscal 2018 represents the
amount that, if recognized, would affect our effective income tax rate in future periods. This amount differs from
the gross unrecognized tax benefits presented in the table because certain of the liabilities below would impact
deferred taxes if recognized. We also would record a decrease in U.S. federal income taxes upon recognition of
the state tax benefits included therein.

As of May 27, 2018, we expect to pay approximately $40.8 million of unrecognized tax benefit liabilities and
accrued interest within the next 12 months. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash
flows beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. The remaining amount of our
unrecognized tax liability was classified in other liabilities.

We report accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefit liabilities in income tax expense. For
fiscal 2018, we recognized $3.1 million of tax-related net interest and penalties, and had $27.3 million of accrued
interest and penalties as of May 27, 2018. For fiscal 2017, we recognized a net benefit of $5.6 million of
tax-related net interest and penalties, and had $23.1 million of accrued interest and penalties as of May 28, 2017.

NOTE 15. LEASES, OTHER COMMITMENTS, AND CONTINGENCIES

Our leases are generally for warehouse space and equipment. Rent expense under all operating leases from
continuing operations was $189.4 million in fiscal 2018, $188.1 million in fiscal 2017, and $189.1 million in
fiscal 2016.

105

Some operating leases require payment of property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs in addition to the rent
payments. Contingent and escalation rent in excess of minimum rent payments and sublease income netted in
rent expense were insignificant.

other obligations of non-consolidated affiliates, mainly CPW. In addition, off-balance sheet arrangements are
generally limited to the future payments under non-cancelable operating leases, which totaled $559.3 million as
of May 27, 2018.

NOTE 16. BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

We operate in the packaged foods industry. On April 24, 2018, we acquired Blue Buffalo, which became our Pet
operating segment. In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we announced a new global organization structure to
streamline our leadership, enhance global scale, and drive improved operational agility to maximize our growth
capabilities. This global reorganization required us to reevaluate our operating segments. Under our new
organization structure, our chief operating decision maker assesses performance and makes decisions about
resources to be allocated to our operating segments as follows: North America Retail; Convenience Stores &
Foodservice; Europe & Australia; Asia & Latin America; and Pet.

Our North America Retail operating segment reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass
merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, drug, dollar and discount chains, and e-commerce
grocery providers. Our product categories in this business segment are ready-to-eat cereals, refrigerated yogurt,
soup, meal kits, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza and pizza snacks,
grain, fruit and savory snacks, and a wide variety of organic products including refrigerated yogurt, nutrition
bars, meal kits, salty snacks, ready-to-eat cereal, and grain snacks.

Our major product categories in our Convenience Stores & Foodservice operating segment are ready-to-eat
cereals, snacks, refrigerated yogurt, frozen meals, unbaked and fully baked frozen dough products, and baking
mixes. Many products we sell are branded to the consumer and nearly all are branded to our customers. We sell
to distributors and operators in many customer channels including foodservice, convenience stores, vending, and
supermarket bakeries in the United States.

Our Europe & Australia operating segment reflects retail and foodservice businesses in the greater Europe and
Australia regions. Our product categories include refrigerated yogurt, meal kits, super-premium ice cream,
refrigerated and frozen dough products, shelf stable vegetables, grain snacks, and dessert and baking mixes. We

106

also sell super-premium ice cream directly to consumers through owned retail shops. Revenues from franchise
fees are reported in the region or country where the franchisee is located.

Our Asia & Latin America operating segment consists of retail and foodservice businesses in the greater Asia
and South America regions. Our product categories include super-premium ice cream and frozen desserts,
refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, meal kits, salty and grain snacks, wellness
beverages, and refrigerated yogurt. We also sell super-premium ice cream and frozen desserts directly to
consumers through owned retail shops. Our Asia & Latin America segment also includes products manufactured
in the United States for export, mainly to Caribbean and Latin American markets, as well as products we
manufacture for sale to our international joint ventures. Revenues from export activities and franchise fees are
reported in the region or country where the end customer or franchisee is located. Fiscal 2017 includes an
additional month of results from Yoki (please refer to note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8
of this report).

Our Pet operating segment includes pet food products sold primarily in the United States in specialty channels,
including national pet superstore chains, regional pet store chains, neighborhood pet stores, and farm and feed
stores; e-commerce retailers; military outlets; hardware stores; veterinary clinics and hospitals; and grocery and
mass merchandisers. Our product categories include dog and cat food (dry foods, wet foods, and treats) made
with whole meats, fruits and vegetables, and other high-quality natural ingredients. Our tailored pet product
offerings address specific dietary, lifestyle, and life-stage needs and spans different product types, diet types,
breed sizes for dogs, lifestages, flavors, product functions and textures, and cuts for wet foods. We are reporting
the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag and accordingly, in fiscal 2018, our results do not include
Pet segment operating results.

Operating profit for these segments excludes unallocated corporate items, gain or loss on divestitures, and
restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs. Unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses,
variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, contributions to the General Mills Foundation,
asset and liability remeasurement impact of hyperinflationary economies, restructuring initiative project-related
costs, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. These include
gains and losses arising from the revaluation of certain grain inventories and gains and losses from
mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments. These
items affecting operating profit are centrally managed at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure
of segment profitability reviewed by executive management. Under our supply chain organization, our
manufacturing, warehouse, and distribution activities are substantially integrated across our operations in order to
maximize efficiency and productivity. As a result, fixed assets and depreciation and amortization expenses are
neither maintained nor available by operating segment.

AOCI. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Adjusted average total capital. Notes payable, long-term debt including current portion, redeemable interest,

Constant currency. Financial results translated to United States dollars using constant foreign currency
exchange rates based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. To present this information,
current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are translated into
United States dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal
year, rather than the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year. Therefore, the foreign
currency impact is equal to current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign
currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.

Core working capital. Accounts receivable plus inventories less accounts payable, all as of the last day of our

Fair value hierarchy. For purposes of fair value measurement, we categorize assets and liabilities into one of
three levels based on the assumptions (inputs) used in valuing the asset or liability. Level 1 provides the most
reliable measure of fair value, while Level 3 generally requires significant management judgment. The three
levels are defined as follows:

Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar
assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive
markets.

Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting management’s assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset

or liability.

Gross margin. Net sales less cost of sales.

Hedge accounting. Accounting for qualifying hedges that allows changes in a hedging instrument’s fair value to
offset corresponding changes in the hedged item in the same reporting period. Hedge accounting is permitted for
certain hedging instruments and hedged items only if the hedging relationship is highly effective, and only
prospectively from the date a hedging relationship is formally documented.

Holistic Margin Management (HMM). Company-wide initiative to use productivity savings, mix management,
and price realization to offset input cost inflation, protect margins, and generate funds to reinvest in sales-

ITEM 9 Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

ITEM 9A Controls and Procedures

We, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the 1934 Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of May 27, 2018, our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or

115

submit under the 1934 Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in applicable rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, in a manner that allows timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the
1934 Act) during our fiscal quarter ended May 27, 2018, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of General Mills, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the 1934 Act. The Company’s internal
control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and the Board of Directors
regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Under the supervision and with
the participation of management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we
conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 27, 2018.
In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013).

Under guidelines established by the SEC, companies are allowed to exclude an acquired business from
management’s report on internal control over financial reporting for the first year subsequent to the acquisition.
Accordingly, management has excluded the Blue Buffalo acquisition from its annual report on internal control
over financial reporting as of May 27, 2018. Blue Buffalo represents 29 percent of the consolidated total assets
and none of the consolidated net sales of General Mills, Inc as of and for the year ended May 27, 2018.

Based on our assessment using the criteria set forth by COSO in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
(2013), management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 27,
2018.

KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued a report on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
