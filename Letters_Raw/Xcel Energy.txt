LEADING THE ENERGY FUTURE

ANNUALREPORT

Some sections in this annual report, including the letter to shareholders, contain forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors 
that could affect operating results, please see management’s discussion and analysis listed in the table of contents of the Form 10-K. 

Dear Fellow Shareholders:
I am proud of the advancements we have made to lead 
the clean energy transition while we continue to deliver 
excellent reliability and tremendous value for our customers. 
Xcel Energy’s forward-looking strategy positions us well for 
short- and long-term success.

From a financial, operational and strategic perspective, 2017 
was a strong year for Xcel Energy. In addition to delivering 
safe, clean, reliable energy to millions of customers, we kept 
bills low, enhanced the customer experience and once again 
delivered significant shareholder value. Our one-year Total 
Shareholder Return of 22 percent in 2017 easily outpaced 
our peer group average of 9 percent. 

For the 13th consecutive year, we met or exceeded our 
earnings guidance. We delivered 2017 GAAP earnings of 
$2.25 per share, compared to $2.21 per share in 2016, and 
ongoing earnings of $2.30 per share, compared to $2.21  
per share in 2016. 

Xcel Energy also increased your dividend 5.9 percent in 
2017, marking the 14th consecutive year of dividend growth. 
We maintained our dividend growth guidance in the 5 to 7 
percent range, a reflection of our confidence to deliver in 
2018 and beyond.

In late 2017, Congress passed major tax reform legislation 
for the first time in 30 years. Tax reform will help lower our 
customers’ energy bills and, over time, enable us to invest 
more in our gas and electric system, boosting our earnings 
power while providing our customers with better energy 
service. While we see tax reform as positive in the long 
term, it has an immediate impact on our credit ratings, a 
challenge faced by most regulated utilities. We are working 
with our regulators to develop implementation plans that 
balance protection of our credit rating with customer benefit. 

Tax reform also required us to take a one-time charge to EPS 
of $0.05 per share in 2017. Despite these challenges, I am 
very pleased with the outcome of the tax reform debate in 
Washington. Through our hard work with other companies in 
our industry, we were able to preserve interest deductibility 
and help to ensure that the final tax reform legislation will 
be positive for both our customers and our company.  

Holding the line on costs — 2017 was the third consecutive 
year that O&M expenses have decreased — contributed  
to solid earnings growth. We expect our strong momentum 
to continue as we initiated 2018 earnings guidance of $2.37 
to $2.47 per share.

Leading the Energy Future
We chose the theme “Leading the Energy Future” for this 
report because it encapsulates our track record of reducing 
carbon emissions as we successfully transition from fossil 
fuels to renewable energy and delivering more energy 
options for our customers — all while keeping bills at or 
below the rate of inflation. 

In 2017, we announced the largest multi-state wind 
expansion in the country. Our proposal to add 12 wind 
farms across seven states is the latest example of how 
we continue to execute our Steel for Fuel growth strategy 
that delivers economic and environmental benefits. As 
we add more intermittent wind generation to our system, 
our engineers and operators have employed advanced 
technologies and new operating strategies that enable us  
to do so reliably. Our customers appreciate energy service 
that is both clean and reliable.  

The ability to develop such a large wind proposal in a short 
time frame was significant because it secured the full 
production tax credit before it begins to expire — helping 
to keep customers’ bills low. In addition to the projects that 
were approved, we are also asking for approval to move 
forward with Dakota Range, the first wind project expected 
to come online under the phasedown of the federal tax 
credit, taking advantage of ever-improving technologies and 
driving continued efficiencies.  

Steel for Fuel is a strategy that has strong appeal with all 
of our stakeholders. Wind energy is a key factor in Xcel 
Energy’s 35 percent reduction in carbon emissions since 

Xcel Energy 2017

32005. Our goal is to reduce carbon emissions 60 percent by 
2030 — and we have aspirations to do even more. We are 
engaging with stakeholders to make this aspiration a reality.

Investing in wind also provides tremendous economic 
value to our customers because there are no fuel charges. 
With wind energy at historic low prices and continued 
technological advancements, we can secure savings that will 
benefit customers now and for decades to come. 
Enhancing the customer experience
In 2017, we not only set a record for power plant reliability 
across our eight-state territory, but also significantly 
improved how we communicate with customers during 
outages. We created a new storm center on our website 
and launched an award-winning mobile app that was 
downloaded more than 160,000 times, exceeding 
expectations. These efforts clearly paid off as the perception 
of our outage communications leapt over almost 20 of our 
industry peers.

Foundational work began on our Advanced Grid Intelligence 
and Security initiative that will upgrade our infrastructure, 
improve security and reliability and leverage smart meters to 
provide customers more choices for managing their energy 
use. The rollout started in Colorado and will extend to 
Minnesota in subsequent years, pending regulatory approval.

One of the growing threats against the electric grid is the 
increased sophistication of cyber criminals across the globe. 

I am working to help shape national cybersecurity policy 
through my membership on the National Infrastructure 
Advisory Council, which advises the President on federal 
policies that can enhance infrastructure protection. More 
importantly, we are ever vigilant at home in our efforts to 
protect our customers and communities, enhancing our 
security efforts on all levels. One visible example of that 
effort is the launch of a state-of-the-art Cyber Defense 
Center that monitors and protects our networks 24 hours a 
day, seven days a week.
Engaging stakeholders
Through strong stakeholder engagement, we saw greater 
alignment in regulatory proceedings in nearly all of our 
jurisdictions. In Minnesota, we received commission 
approval for a multi-year electric rate case and legislative 
approval to build a natural gas plant at our Sherco site that 
will provide needed generation to replace two coal units that 
are scheduled for early retirement. 

We also received Minnesota commission approval for our 
proposal to exit expensive biomass contracts that were 
mandated by the state in the 1990s. This innovative solution 
provided an economic development package for affected 
communities and will save our customers more than $600 
million by replacing the biomass generation with far-less-
costly energy alternatives. By focusing on all aspects of our 
customers’ bills, we continue to find ways to keep energy 
costs affordable.

CapX2020, the Upper Midwest’s renewable 
energy super highway, is now complete

Without it, the clean energy revolution in the Upper Midwest 
would not have happened.

CapX2020, a forward-thinking massive transmission project 
started in 2004 to enhance grid reliability and bring wind 
energy to customers across the Upper Midwest, is now 
complete. The 13-year, $2 billion transmission system 
upgrade in Minnesota, the Dakotas and Wisconsin was an 
unprecedented partnership between 11 utility organizations 
to expand and strengthen the grid and stimulate future 
renewable energy production.

“If you build it, they will come,” said Teresa Mogensen, 
Senior Vice President, Transmission, noting that nine wind 
projects and one natural gas generation facility have already 
requested interconnection to the final CapX2020 section, a 
75-mile line that runs parallel to the Minnesota border in 
eastern South Dakota. 

When the final leg of CapX2020 was energized in September 
2017, it was the culmination of five individual transmission 

projects spanning 800 miles. That’s the equivalent of running 
a single transmission line from Minneapolis, our corporate 
headquarters, to Amarillo, Texas, the regional headquarters 
of our Texas and New Mexico operations.

In addition to the safe, clean, reliable energy our customers 
have come to expect, the CapX2020 project also provided 
significant economic and environmental benefits. The 3,600 
megawatts of wind energy looking to interconnect to two of 
the CapX2020 transmission lines — enough to power 1.5 
million homes — will generate approximately $15 million in 
annual landowner royalty payments and will avoid 6.3 million 
tons of carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere each year.

Looking forward, CapX2020 has the capacity to deliver 
renewable energy from numerous proposed wind and solar 
projects across the Upper Midwest.

“Transmission lines and substations are the backbone 
of the energy grid and a significant driver of economic 
development,” Mogensen said. 

Annual Report

4While we prepare for our next resource plan, we also engaged 
the Minnesota commission in dialogue about the importance 
of operating our nuclear plants through their licensing periods 
in the early 2030s. As our only 24/7 carbon-free baseload 
energy source, nuclear energy plays a crucial role in system 
reliability and our ability to hit aspirational carbon-reduction 
targets. It’s important that we operate our fleet efficiently and 
effectively, which is exactly what we did in 2017.  

In Colorado, we announced a groundbreaking Colorado 
Energy Plan that, if approved, will drive our carbon-reduction 
plans by adding significant amounts of wind, solar, natural 
gas and battery storage while accelerating the retirement 
of two coal units at our Comanche power plant in Pueblo. 
If implemented, by 2026 in Colorado we would produce 55 
percent of our energy from renewable sources and reduce 
carbon emissions 60 percent from a 2005 baseline.

Our work engaging with Colorado stakeholders also 
resulted in approval for an important decoupling rider to 
encourage customers to save energy, as well as approval 
of Renewable*Connect, a program that provides residential 
and business customers a green solution to receive up to 100 
percent of their energy from certified renewable sources. 

Going forward, we will continue to engage our policymakers 
and stakeholders to put the benefit of tax reform to work for 
our customers while supporting the clean energy transition.
Operational excellence
Offering new customer programs is just one way we are 
focused on enhancing our customers’ experience with us. In 
2017, we completed a four-year project called “Productivity 
through Technology” that successfully deployed new 
software and processes to leverage technology to improve 
operations and create efficiencies.

We recognize that technology is an important component 
in our drive to serve customers even better, but it alone 
is not enough. So at the same time we are undertaking a 
comprehensive effort to analyze people, processes and 
technology to drive results and strengthen our underlying 
culture to be one focused on continuous improvement. 
This effort generated more than $30 million in sustainable 
savings last year due to increased efficiencies and careful 
management of attrition. We expect an additional $45 
million of savings in 2018 as our efforts continue.

Getting better every day is a mantra embraced by our 
employees — and it’s paying off for customers. At a time 
when most monthly consumer bills are on the rise, our 
average residential electric bills across all territories have 
dropped 3 percent since 2013.

Keeping the public safe is about more than restoring power 
after storms. Our year-round campaigns to raise awareness 
about the need to call before you dig to determine the 

locations of natural gas lines and underground electric 
utilities have resulted in our best public safety year on record.

But when storms damage the grid, industry peers agree 
we are at our best. For the third year in a row, we received 
an Edison Electrical Institute Emergency Recovery Award 
for our efforts to restore power following Winter Storm 
Jupiter, which caused the worst damage to the grid in Texas 
and New Mexico since 1999. More than 1,000 workers, 
contractors and mutual aid responders logged 92,000 hours 
and repaired 7,500 structures.

Our crews, which I believe are the best in the business, 
raised their hands to help with hurricane recovery efforts. 
More than 150 full-time employees traveled to Fort Myers, 
Florida, and spent several long and hot days restoring 
power to those in need. Another 70 are currently on the 
ground working to restore power in Puerto Rico, and we’ll 
have supplied a total of 210 employees to that effort over a 
several-month period.

Xcel Energy employees performed their restoration work 
quickly and safely. Overall, 2017 was our best safety year 
ever in terms of the fewest number of employee injuries. 
Still, we made enhancements to our safety program as we 
continue our Journey to Zero efforts to promote employee 
safety, our No. 1 priority.
It starts with employees
The success of Xcel Energy is driven by 11,000 dedicated 
employees who come to work each and every day to build 
on the success of this organization. They are the reason that 
Forbes magazine named us one of the World’s Top Regarded 
Companies and one of the World’s Best Employers. 

Our employees understand the importance of giving back 
to the communities where they live and work through 
philanthropy and volunteerism — stocking food shelves, 
mentoring youth and delivering meals for homebound seniors.

As we look ahead, the employees of Xcel Energy are 
committed to lead the clean energy transition, enhance  
the customer experience and keep bills low. If we  
continue to execute on these three priorities, we will once 
again deliver short- and long-term value for our customers  
and shareholders. We appreciate the continued trust  
you place in us.

Sincerely, 

Ben Fowke 
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

— our proposal will more than quadruple our company-
owned wind portfolio.

Xcel Energy took its Steel for Fuel growth strategy to  
another level in 2017 by proposing the largest multi-state 
wind investment in the country — a dozen wind farms in 
seven states. If all the projects are approved as expected,  
by the end of 2021 Xcel Energy, a national leader in wind 
energy since 2005, will become the first U.S. utility to 
surpass 10,000 megawatts of wind capacity.

Steel for Fuel resonates with constituents across the 
spectrum because it delivers carbon-free renewable energy 
without raising customer bills — in fact, it saves billions 
of dollars over the life of the projects because there are no 
fuel costs. Building and owning wind farms also provides an

it begins to phase down. We subsequently proposed the 
first project in the country to be completed in 2021 after the

development in rural America. Our multi-state proposal is 
expected to create 2,700 construction jobs and 150 full-time 
positions, and generate $800 million in landowner lease and 
property tax payments over the lives of the projects.   

By 2022, 38 percent of our energy will be supplied by wind 
— double the amount on our system in 2017. Our proposed 
wind farms are expected to generate enough clean energy to 
power 1.7 million homes annually and avoid 142 million tons 
of carbon emissions over the projects’ lifetimes.

The first project to come online will be Rush Creek, a 
600-megawatt wind farm in eastern Colorado, the largest 
in the company’s history and the largest in Colorado. When 
completed in the fall of 2018, there will be enough wind 
capacity on our system in Colorado to power every home 
along Colorado’s Front Range with 100 percent wind energy.

Colorado Energy Plan
In Colorado, we are not stopping with Rush Creek —
we plan to continue the transition from fossil fuels to 
renewable energy in the coming years. After extensive 
stakeholder outreach, we proposed the new Colorado 
Energy Plan, a blueprint for the state’s energy future that 
adds significant amounts of wind, solar, natural gas and 
energy storage to our system to offset the early retirement 
of two coal units. The plan received nearly unanimous 
approval from a wide range of stakeholders.

If approved by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, we 
could achieve 55 percent renewable energy on the grid in 
Colorado and reduce carbon emissions 60 percent from 2005 
levels by 2026 while saving customers money on their bills.

Minnesota and one of Xcel Energy’s largest 
business customers, melts scrap metal to make 
300 grades of high-quality steel products at its 
facility in St. Paul. Among those products are 
anchor bolts and jumbo rebar used in wind and 
transmission tower foundations.

At right: Glowing-hot steel billets emerge from 
the caster where they will cool and later be 
refined into high-end steel products. Gerdau 
invested in a $65 million state-of-the-art caster 
to modernize operations at its St. Paul mill. 
Today the caster produces some of the highest 
quality steel products in the country. 

CUSTOMER FOCUS

Gerdau brings Steel for Fuel full circle

When steel bars emerge from the caster at the Gerdau steel 
manufacturing plant in St. Paul, the color of the scorching-
hot metal is blaze orange. Yet, Gerdau St. Paul Mill’s steel 
products are actually “green.”

All of the steel produced at Gerdau’s St. Paul steel mill is 
made from almost 100 percent recycled scrap metals. Every 
day, a steady stream of trailers brings tons of scrap metal, 
ranging from end-of-life automobiles to used washing 
machines. Those materials are shredded, melted in a large 
electric-arc furnace and converted into steel billets. 

After a cooling process, the billets are reheated in a natural 
gas furnace and further refined into hundreds of high-quality 
steel products, including anchor bolts and reinforcing rebar 
used for wind tower foundations for various Xcel Energy 
construction projects. Many of the plant’s by-products have 
value-added end uses such as slag used in road construction. 

Converting scrap metal into steel billets is an energy-
intensive process. In two minutes, the plant uses as much 
energy as an average residential house for a month. Gerdau 
participates in Xcel Energy’s short-notice load management 
program to save on their energy costs each year while 
providing reliability and cost-saving benefits to the grid.

“We have a strong working relationship with Xcel Energy. 
They provide us with the reliability that is essential to run our 
facility and offer various programs to help manage our energy 
costs,” said Alan Lamb, Gerdau St. Paul Vice President and 
General Manager. “Xcel Energy understands the importance 
of keeping energy costs low so their business customers can 
compete effectively in the global marketplace.”

Most steel plants across the country are located in areas 
with higher carbon emissions from coal plants. Gerdau is a 
proponent for Xcel Energy’s Steel for Fuel efforts to invest

our carbon footprint. In turn, the steel products Gerdau 
manufactures with our energy have less environmental 
impact, which is appealing to their customers.
Economic development
Xcel Energy often works behind the scenes to help companies 
invest in the communities we have the privilege to serve. To 
modernize its operations, Gerdau decided in 2012 to invest in 
a $65 million caster, a significant capital expense required to 
produce high-quality steel products the marketplace demands.

Xcel Energy partnered with several organizations, including 
the City of Saint Paul, the St. Paul Port Authority and the 
Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, to offer an economic 
development package to ensure Gerdau located the caster at 
its St. Paul facility instead of another mill. That decision to 
invest locally helped to safeguard 300 jobs in St. Paul. 

“It’s an honor to provide reliable, low-cost and environmentally 
sound power to support Gerdau and the products they  
make for the wind industry. It brings the process full circle,”  
said Xcel Energy Regional Vice President Greg Chamberlain.

community solar garden in Wisconsin, part 
of the Solar*Connect Community® program. 
The one-megawatt garden is located across 
the street from Xcel Energy’s Wisconsin 
headquarters on a seven-acre unused 
parcel, the site of a former city landfill. 
Future solar gardens are in development for 
the greater La Crosse area and Ashland.  

At right: Workers install some of the 3,600 
panels at a new community solar garden in 
Eau Claire, Wisconsin.

Below: Dr. Kirk Dahl (right), one of the first 
community subscribers, tours the site with 
Mark Stoering, President of Xcel Energy–
Wisconsin and Michigan.

COMMUNITY SOLAR GARDENS

Wisconsin customers embrace the sun

Dr. Kirk Dahl jumped at the opportunity to take an advance 
tour of the newest solar garden in his community.

“I’m proud to be one of the first subscribers for this 
project — we subscribed at 100 percent,” Dr. Dahl, a 
retired emergency room physician and longtime Eau Claire 
resident, said while walking among the rows of solar 
panels. “I’ve had a lifelong interest in environmental issues 
and am concerned about climate change. It isn’t feasible to 
place solar panels on our house so this program gave us the 
opportunity to purchase clean energy in a different way.”

Solar*Connect Community is a Wisconsin program paid 
for entirely by subscribers like Dr. Dahl who subscribe at 
various levels. Customers pay a one-time fee to purchase 
energy from the system in exchange for bill credits that 
vary based on production of all the solar gardens in the 

Annual Report

10Solar*Connect Community program. The Eau Claire solar 
garden was energized on October 23, 2017, following a 
ribbon-cutting ceremony with employees and local leaders. 
The garden is not only a clean energy success story, but a 
redevelopment one as well. The garden is located across 
the street from Xcel Energy’s Wisconsin headquarters on 
an unused seven-acre site that once housed a city landfill.  

“This old landfill has a brand new use as a solar array 
producing green, renewable energy for our community,” 
said Dale Peters, Eau Claire’s City Manager. The city of 
Eau Claire is leasing the land for the project and also 
participating as a subscriber — purchasing solar energy to 
power the community pool.

In addition to the solar garden in Eau Claire, a developer 
has been selected to build a second garden in the greater 

La Crosse area in 2018. Xcel Energy also announced 
a location for a third solar garden in Ashland located 
adjacent to our Ashland Service Center. With adequate 
subscriber interest, that garden will be built by mid-2019.

Minnesota is No. 1 in the country
Xcel Energy’s community solar program in Minnesota is 
the largest in the country — by far. At the end of 2017, 
our Minnesota program had grown to 246 megawatts of 
energy, which is nearly twice as large as the next largest 
community solar program. We expect the Minnesota 
program to double in size as Minnesota customers continue 
to support this renewable energy option.

11ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 

Regional headquarters spurs downtown revitalization

More than anyone, Paul Harpole knew the struggle to 
entice businesses to invest in downtown Amarillo.  
“Our downtown was stagnant,” said Harpole, who 
served as mayor of the 200,000-person Texas Panhandle 
community from 2011 until 2017. “It had been decades 
since we had any new construction downtown.”

That changed in January 2015 when Xcel Energy announced 
plans to partner with a developer for a new $42 million 
facility on the eastern edge of downtown, ensuring 
the company’s regional headquarters would remain in 
downtown Amarillo, a tradition that dates back to 1925.  

“I look around Amarillo and say, ‘What would this city be 
without Xcel Energy?’ The company’s vision and forward 
thinking served as a catalyst to our entire downtown 
revitalization,” said Harpole, who decided to not seek 

reelection in 2017. “Your commitment led to the building of 
a $45 million hotel down the street. We just broke ground 
for a minor league baseball stadium that will open next 
year. The energy downtown is so exciting.”

David Hudson, President of Xcel Energy–Texas and New 
Mexico, worked with Mayor Harpole and local leaders 
on plans to invest in the downtown corridor but also 
considered other sites in Amarillo. The seven-story facility 
includes three stories of parking and retail shops on the first 
floor. Approximately 300 employees work in the regional 
headquarters, supporting our customers and communities in 
the Texas Panhandle and eastern New Mexico.

The 790 Buchanan building was completed in May 2017 
in time for Xcel Energy to host its Annual Shareholder 
Meeting, which happened to be one day after Harpole’s

regional headquarters on the east side of 
downtown Amarillo, Texas, is a story that 
goes well beyond larger floor plans, updated 
workspaces and improved collaboration 
opportunities; it was the first major downtown 
development in years. This project added 
power to a fledgling downtown revival, one 
that has matured with a new upscale hotel two 
blocks away and the recent groundbreaking 
across the street for a “AA” minor league 
baseball complex scheduled to open in 2019.

mayoral term ended. Incoming mayor Ginger Nelson 
enjoyed the honor of welcoming Xcel Energy’s Board of 
Directors and shareholders to the city.

“Leadership these days is really about empowering people 
to do what they are already inspired to do. We are seeing 
that impact here in Amarillo. We’re standing today in 
this building, and I personally want to thank you for your 
dedication to our community,” Mayor Nelson said. 

Hudson noted the important role Xcel Energy plays in 
driving economic development. “We will only be as 
successful as the communities we are privileged to serve,” 
Hudson said. “Our No. 1 job is to keep the lights on, but we 
work very hard at driving economic development through 
transmission lines and wind farms — projects that directly 
lead to jobs, tax base and landowner lease payments.”

“ I look around Amarillo and say, ‘What 
would this city be without Xcel Energy?’”

– Paul Harpole, former Amarillo Mayor 

In 2017, 71 percent of our spending — approximately  
$2.5 billion — was done at the local level with businesses 
based in our eight-state service territory. Couple that 
investment with hundreds of millions in tax payments and 
it’s easy to see how a company that provides two essential 
but relatively invisible products — electricity and natural 
gas — can make a visible difference in local communities. 
Our total base capital expenditure plan includes an 
investment of at least $18.5 billion over the next five years.

backpacks with school supplies, Xcel Energy is always 
delivering in our communities. We live and work here, 
so we understand the importance of giving back through 
volunteerism and financial support.

grants to nonprofits that influence positive outcomes in our 
four focus areas: STEM education, economic sustainability, 
environmental stewardship and arts and culture.

Red Xcel Energy volunteer t-shirts were out in full force in 
September for our annual Day of Service. In Colorado, a record-
setting 700 volunteers packed 155,000 meals for Colorado 
Feeding Kids. Meanwhile in Minnesota, our volunteers spruced 
dozens of nonprofit partners, including The Bakken Museum in 
Minneapolis and Springbrook Nature Center in Fridley.

Across our eight-state service territory, Xcel Energy 
encourages employee volunteerism through a paid time 
off program. In 2017, our employees logged approximately 
55,000 volunteer hours for charities of their choice.

We also give back to our communities through philanthropy. 
Our annual United Way campaign —  a combination of 
employee pledges boosted by the company match — will 
provide a $4.83 million impact to strengthen our communities.

nonprofits, resulting in a $1.29 million impact to more than

Company receives Beyond the Yellow Ribbon proclamation
Xcel Energy frequently receives accolades as one of the 
top military-friendly employers in the industry. In 2017, the 
State of Minnesota recognized Xcel Energy as a Beyond  
the Yellow Ribbon company for meeting its criteria as a 
military veteran employer of choice. Xcel Energy is the 
eighth Fortune 500 company headquartered in Minnesota  
to receive the proclamation.

and their families, celebrated its fifth anniversary in  
2017. Our retention of military veterans remains strong  
and slightly higher than our overall retention numbers.  
Xcel Energy employs more than 1,200 military veterans.

We believe that military veterans bring the values and skills 
that we need to succeed — leadership, teamwork and 
dedication. For the third consecutive year, Xcel Energy has 
achieved its goal that 10 percent of our new external hires 
are military veterans.

We also understand the importance of offering a welcoming 
workplace for military veterans and to provide ongoing 
support for our employees who serve in the National 
Guard or Reserves. Military Ombudsman for Veterans and 
Employees (MOVE), our employee resource group focused 
on development, implementation and communication of 
programs and policies centered on the welfare of veterans

Public Utility Regulation

ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS

NSP-Minnesota

Summary of Regulatory Agencies and Areas of Jurisdiction — Retail rates, services and other aspects of NSP-Minnesota’s 
operations are regulated by the MPUC, the NDPSC and the SDPUC within their respective states.  The MPUC also has regulatory 
authority over security issuances, property transfers, mergers, dispositions of assets and transactions between NSP-Minnesota and its 
affiliates.  In addition, the MPUC reviews and approves NSP-Minnesota’s IRPs for meeting customers’ future energy needs.  The 
MPUC also certifies the need and siting for generating plants greater than 50 MW and transmission lines greater than 100 KV that will 
be located within the state.  No large power plant or transmission line may be constructed in Minnesota except on a site or route 
designated by the MPUC.  The NDPSC and SDPUC have regulatory authority over generation and transmission facilities, along with 
the siting and routing of new generation and transmission facilities in North Dakota and South Dakota, respectively.

NSP-Minnesota is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC for its wholesale electric operations, hydroelectric licensing, accounting 
practices, wholesale sales for resale, transmission of electricity in interstate commerce, compliance with NERC electric reliability 
standards, asset transfers and mergers, and natural gas transactions in interstate commerce.  NSP-Minnesota is a transmission owning 
member of the MISO RTO and operates within the MISO RTO and MISO wholesale market.  NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin are 
jointly authorized by the FERC to make wholesale electric sales at market-based prices. 

Fuel, Purchased Energy and Conservation Cost-Recovery Mechanisms — NSP-Minnesota has several retail adjustment clauses that 
recover fuel, purchased energy and other resource costs:

•  CIP rider — Recovers the costs of conservation and demand-side management programs. 
•  EIR — Recovers the costs of environmental improvement projects.
•  RDF — Allocates money collected from retail customers to support the research and development of emerging renewable 

energy projects and technologies.

•  RES — Recovers the cost of renewable generation in Minnesota.
•  RER — Recovers the cost of renewable generation in North Dakota.
• 
• 
• 

SEP — Recovers costs related to various energy policies approved by the Minnesota legislature.
TCR — Recovers costs associated with investments in electric transmission and distribution grid modernization costs. 
Infrastructure rider — Recovers costs for investments in generation and incremental property taxes in South Dakota.

NSP-Minnesota’s retail electric rates in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota include a FCA for monthly billing adjustments to 
recover changes in prudently incurred costs of fuel related items and purchased energy.  In general, capacity costs are recovered 
through base rates and are not recovered through the FCA.  In addition, costs associated with MISO are generally recovered through 
either the FCA or base rates.  In 2017, the MPUC voted to change the process in which utilities seek fuel cost recovery under the FCA 
in Minnesota to be implemented in July 2019.  Under the new process, each month utilities would collect amounts equal to the 
baseline cost of energy set at the start of the plan year.  Monthly variations to the baseline costs would be tracked and netted over a 12-
month period.  Subsequently, utilities would issue refunds above the baseline costs, and could seek recovery of any overage.  

Minnesota state law requires NSP-Minnesota to invest two percent of its state electric revenues and half a percent of its state gas 
revenues in CIP.  These costs are recovered through an annual cost-recovery mechanism for electric conservation and energy 
management program expenditures.  Minnesota state law also requires NSP-Minnesota to submit a CIP plan at least every three years.

Capacity and Demand

Uninterrupted system peak demand for the NSP System’s electric utility for each of the last three years and the forecast for 2018, 
assuming normal weather conditions, is as follows:

NSP System . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

2017

8,546

2016

9,002

2015

The peak demand for the NSP System typically occurs in the summer. The 2017 system peak demand for the NSP System occurred on 
July 17, 2017.  The decline in peak load from 2016 to 2017 is in part due to considerably cooler weather in 2017.  The 2018 forecast 
assumes normal peak day weather, which is warmer than actual 2017 peak day weather.

Energy Sources and Related Transmission Initiatives

NSP-Minnesota expects to use existing power plants, power purchases, CIP/DSM options, new generation facilities and expansion of 
existing power plants to meet its system capacity requirements.

Purchased Power — NSP-Minnesota has contracts to purchase power from other utilities and IPPs.  Generally, long-term 
dispatchable purchased power contracts require a periodic capacity payment and a charge for the delivered associated energy.  Some 
long-term purchased power contracts only contain a charge for the purchased energy.  NSP-Minnesota also makes short-term 
purchases to meet system load and energy requirements, to replace generation from company-owned units under maintenance or 
during outages, to meet operating reserve obligations, or to obtain energy at a lower cost.

Purchased Transmission Services — NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have contracts with MISO and other regional transmission 
service providers to deliver power and energy to their customers.

NSP System Resource Plans — In January 2017, the MPUC approved NSP-Minnesota’s IRP that includes:

•  Retirement of Sherco Unit 2 in 2023 and Sherco Unit 1 in 2026.  The resulting need for 750 MW of capacity in 2026 will be 

addressed in a future CON proceeding;

•  Acquisition of at least 1,000 MW of wind by 2019.  The mix of purchased power and owned facilities was not specified;
•  Acquisition of 650 MW of solar by 2021 either through the community solar gardens program or other cost-effective 

resources.  The mix of purchased power and owned facilities was not specified;

•  Acquisition of at least 400 MW of additional demand response by 2023, and a study of the technical and economic 

achievability of 1,000 MW of additional demand response in total by 2025; and

•  Achievement of at least 444 GWh of energy efficiency in all planning years.

Minnesota Legislation — In February 2017, the Minnesota governor signed a bill into law allowing NSP-Minnesota to build a natural 
gas combined-cycle power plant at NSP-Minnesota’s Sherco site. The plant was originally proposed as part of NSP-Minnesota’s 
resource plan, which enables the retirement of two coal units at the Sherco site. The plant’s in-service date is anticipated for 2026.  
Cost recovery of the plant will be subject to MPUC approval.

Wind Development — In July 2017, the MPUC approved NSP-Minnesota’s proposal to add 1,550 MW of new wind generation 
including ownership of 1,150 MW of wind generation by NSP-Minnesota, which will help achieve NSP-Minnesota’s wind acquisition 
goal outlined in the IRP.  In March 2017, NSP-Minnesota filed an Advanced Determination of Prudence with the NDPSC and reached 
a settlement with the NDPSC Staff.  The timing of a NDPSC order is uncertain.  These projects are expected to be completed by the 
end of 2020 and would qualify for 100 percent of the PTC.  NSP-Minnesota’s total capital investment for these wind ownership 
projects is expected to be approximately $1.9 billion. 

In September 2017, NSP-Minnesota filed with the MPUC seeking approval to build and own the Dakota Range project, a 300 MW 
wind project in South Dakota.  The project is expected to be placed into service by the end of 2021 and qualify for 80 percent of the 
PTC.  The DOC recommended the MPUC deny the petition on the basis that NSP-Minnesota did not follow the standard regulatory 
selection process of issuing a new RFP.  However, the DOC acknowledged the Dakota Range project would benefit ratepayers and the 
MPUC could approve the project if it determines the public interest outweighs their concern about the regulatory selection process. 

These wind projects are expected to provide significant savings to NSP-Minnesota’s customers and substantial environmental benefits. 
Projected savings/benefits assume fuel costs and generation mix consistent with various commission approved resource plans.  NSP-
Minnesota will provide supplemental filings to the MPUC in March 2018, which will estimate impacts of the TCJA on the wind 
projects.

PPA Terminations and Amendments — In 2017, NSP-Minnesota filed requests with the MPUC and the NDPSC for several initiatives 
including changes to four PPAs to reduce future costs for customers.  These actions include the following:

•  The termination of a PPA with Benson Power LLC (Benson) for its 55 MW biomass facility in Benson, Minn., including the 

purchase and closure of the facility.  The purchase of the Benson biomass facility requires FERC approval, which was 
requested in August 2017.  The transaction would result in payments of $95 million to terminate the PPA and acquire the 
facility, as well as additional expenditures of approximately $26 million to temporarily operate and close the facility.

•  The termination of a PPA with Laurentian Energy Authority I, LLC (Laurentian) for its 35 MW of biomass facilities in 

Hibbing and Virginia, Minn.  The termination of the Laurentian PPA would result in approximately $109 million of contract 
cancellation payments over six years. 

•  The remaining two requested PPA changes involve a PPA extension of the Hennepin Energy Recovery Center (HERC) 34 

MW waste-to-energy facility at a price reflective of current market conditions and termination of the Pine Bend 12 MW 
waste-to-energy PPA.

8

In November 2017, the MPUC approved NSP-Minnesota’s request to terminate the Pine Bend PPA but rejected its request to extend 
the HERC PPA.

In January 2018, the MPUC issued an order approving NSP-Minnesota’s petition to terminate the PPAs with Benson and Laurentian, 
as well as purchase and close the Benson biomass facility.  All approved costs are expected to be recoverable through the FCA, 
including a return on NSP-Minnesota’s total investment in the Benson transaction through 2028.  NSP-Minnesota also reached a 
settlement agreement with the NDPSC Staff which allows for the termination of the PPAs with Benson, Laurentian and Pine Bend, as 
well as the purchase and closure of the Benson biomass facility.  The NDPSC is expected to issue an order on the settlement in the 
second quarter of 2018.  NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin will jointly request FERC approval to modify the Interchange 
Agreement to share a portion of the termination costs with NSP-Wisconsin.  

These terminations and amendments are intended to provide in excess of $600 million in net cost savings to NSP System customers 
over the next 10 years.

Jurisdictional Cost Recovery Allocation — In December 2016, NSP-Minnesota filed a resource treatment framework with the 
NDPSC and MPUC. The filing proposed a framework to allow NSP-Minnesota’s operations in North Dakota and Minnesota to 
gradually become more independent of one another with respect to future generation resource selection while also identifying a path 
for cost sharing of current resources. NSP-Minnesota’s filing identified two options: a legal separation, creating a separate North 
Dakota operating company; or a pseudo-separation, which maintains the current corporate structure but directly assigns the costs and 
benefits of each resource to the jurisdiction that supports it.  In October 2017, NDPSC staff filed testimony recommending no change 
to the current system of proxy pricing and policy-based disallowances claiming there is a likelihood of overall increased costs and 
potential loss of resource diversity.  Hearings are planned for the second quarter of 2018.

Minnesota State Right-Of-First Refusal (ROFR) Statute Complaint — In September 2017, LSP Transmission Holdings, LLC filed a 
complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota (Minnesota District Court) against the Minnesota Attorney General, 
the MPUC and the DOC.  The complaint was in response to MISO assigning NSP-Minnesota and ITC Midwest, LLC to jointly own a 
new 345 KV transmission line from near Mankato, Minn. to Winnebago, Minn.  The line was estimated by MISO to cost $103 million.  
The project was assigned to NSP-Minnesota and ITC Midwest as the incumbent utilities, consistent with a Minnesota state ROFR 
statute.  The complaint challenges the constitutionality of the state ROFR statute and is seeking declaratory judgment that the statute 
violates the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution and should not be enforced.  The Minnesota state agencies and NSP-Minnesota 
filed motions to dismiss.  Oral arguments were heard in February 2018, and the matter is now pending before the Minnesota District 
Court.  The timing and outcome of the litigation is uncertain.

Nuclear Power Operations and Waste Disposal

NSP-Minnesota owns two nuclear generating plants: the Monticello plant and the PI plant.  Nuclear power plant operations produce 
gaseous, liquid and solid radioactive wastes which are controlled by federal regulation.  High-level radioactive wastes primarily 
include used nuclear fuel.  LLW consists primarily of demineralizer resins, paper, protective clothing, rags, tools and equipment that 
have become contaminated through use in a plant.

NSP-Minnesota participates with regulators and in industry groups including the NRC, the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations and 
Utilities Service Alliance to stay informed of advancements in nuclear safety, mitigation strategies, performance and operational 
effectiveness.  NSP-Minnesota applies this acquired knowledge by investing in technology and services that improve nuclear 
operations and detect, mitigate and protect NPS-Minnesota’s nuclear facilities. 

NRC Regulation — The NRC regulates nuclear operations.  Decisions by the NRC can significantly impact the operations of the 
nuclear generating plants.  The costs of complying with NRC orders and requirements can affect both operating expenses and capital 
investments of the plants.  NSP-Minnesota has obtained recovery of these compliance costs in customer rates, and expects future 
compliance costs will continue to be recoverable from customers.  Estimates of the future nuclear capital expenditures related to costs 
of NRC compliance are included in Xcel Energy’s capital forecast for electric generation.  See Item 7 for further discussion of capital 
requirements.

9

Nuclear Regulatory Performance — The NRC has a Reactor Oversight Process that classifies U.S. nuclear reactors into various 
categories (referred to as Columns, from 1 to 5).  Issues are evaluated as either green, white, yellow, or red based on their safety 
significance, with green representing the least safety concern and red representing the most concern.  

As of Dec. 31, 2017, Monticello and PI Units 1 and 2 were in Column 1 (licensee response) with all green performance indicators and 
no greater than green findings or violations.  Plants in Column 1 are subject to only a pre-defined set of basic NRC inspections.

LLW Disposal — LLW from NSP-Minnesota’s Monticello and PI nuclear plants is currently disposed at the Clive facility located in 
Utah and the Waste Control Specialists facility located in Texas.  If off-site LLW disposal facilities become unavailable, NSP-
Minnesota has storage capacity available on-site at PI and Monticello that would allow both plants to continue to operate until the end 
of their current licensed lives.

High-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal — The federal government has the responsibility to permanently dispose of domestic spent 
nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive wastes.  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act requires the DOE to implement a program for 
nuclear high-level waste management.  This includes the siting, licensing, construction and operation of a repository for spent nuclear 
fuel from civilian nuclear power reactors and other high-level radioactive wastes at a permanent federal storage or disposal facility.  
The federal government has been evaluating a nuclear geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada for many years.  At this time, 
there are no definitive plans for a permanent federal storage site at Yucca Mountain or any other site.

Review of PI Costs — As part of NSP-Minnesota’s 2016 multi-year electric rate case and IRP the MPUC ordered an investigation into 
NSP-Minnesota’s PI nuclear investments.  The issue was resolved for the 2016 multi-year electric rate case settlement; however the 
DOC is continuing to investigate costs of operation and performance at PI in anticipation of NSP-Minnesota’s 2019 resource plan.

Nuclear Spent Fuel Storage
NSP-Minnesota has interim on-site storage for spent nuclear fuel at its Monticello and PI nuclear generating plants.  As of Dec. 31, 
2017, there were 40 casks loaded and stored at the PI plant and 16 canisters loaded and stored at the Monticello plant.  An additional 
24 casks for PI and 14 canisters for Monticello have been authorized by the State of Minnesota.  This currently authorized storage 
capacity is sufficient to allow NSP-Minnesota to operate until the end of the operating licenses in 2030 for Monticello, 2033 for PI 
Unit 1, and 2034 for PI Unit 2.  Authorizations for additional spent fuel storage capacity may be required at each site to support either 
continued operation or decommissioning if the federal government does not begin operation of a consolidated interim storage 
installation.

In 2013, NSP-Minnesota’s Monticello nuclear generating plant loaded and placed five storage canisters (canisters #11-15) in the ISFSI 
and a sixth canister (canister #16) was loaded but remained in the plant pending resolution of weld inspection issues.  Successful 
pressure and leak testing demonstrated the safety and integrity of all six canisters involved.  NSP-Minnesota took several actions to 
assure compliance with the NRC’s regulations and Monticello’s storage license.

In 2016, the NRC issued an order approving a settlement in which NSP-Minnesota agreed to a timeline for attaining compliance on all 
six canisters, as well as additional training and communications.  During 2016, the NRC approved an exemption request for the 
completion of canister #16.  That canister is now considered in compliance, and was placed in the ISFSI during 2016.  In 2017, NSP-
Minnesota submitted a plan and request to the NRC to restore Monticello canisters #11-15 to compliance through an exemption 
request.  NSP-Minnesota requested that the NRC grant the exemption by October 2018.

Costs attributable to Monticello canisters #11-15 achieving full regulatory compliance within five years are currently being evaluated.  
No public safety issues have been raised, or are believed to exist, in this matter.

See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding nuclear related items.

Fuel Sources

Nuclear — NSP-Minnesota secures contracts for uranium concentrates, uranium conversion, uranium enrichment and fuel fabrication 
to operate its nuclear plants.  The contract strategy involves a portfolio of spot purchases and medium and long-term contracts for 
uranium concentrates, conversion services and enrichment services with multiple producers and with a focus on diversification to 
minimize potential impacts caused by supply interruptions due to geographical and world political issues.

•  Current nuclear fuel supply contracts cover 100 percent of uranium concentrates requirements through 2021 and approximately 

57 percent of the requirements for 2022 through 2033;

•  Current contracts for conversion services cover 100 percent of the requirements through 2021 and approximately 50 percent of 

•  Current enrichment service contracts cover 100 percent of the requirements through 2025 and approximately 29 percent of the 

the requirements for 2022 through 2033; and

requirements for 2026 through 2033.

Fabrication services for Monticello and PI are 100 percent committed through 2030 and 2019, respectively. 

NSP-Minnesota expects sufficient uranium concentrates, conversion services and enrichment services to be available for the total fuel 
requirements of its nuclear generating plants.  Some exposure to market price volatility will remain due to index-based pricing 
structures contained in certain supply contracts.

11

Coal — The NSP System normally maintains approximately 41 days of coal inventory.  Coal supply inventories at Dec. 31, 2017 and 
2016 were approximately 53 and 55 days of usage, respectively.  Milder weather, purchase commitments and relatively low power and 
natural gas prices resulted in coal inventories being above optimal levels.  NSP-Minnesota’s generation stations use low-sulfur western 
coal purchased primarily under contracts with suppliers operating in Wyoming and Montana.  Coal requirements for the NSP System’s 
major coal-fired generating plants were approximately 8.0 million tons for 2017 and 7.5 million tons for 2016.  Coal requirements for 
2017 increased primarily due to slightly higher natural gas prices during the year.  The estimated coal requirements for 2018 are 
approximately 8.3 million tons. 

NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have contracted for coal supplies to provide 79 percent of their estimated coal requirements in 
2018 and a declining percentage of the requirements in subsequent years. The NSP System’s general coal purchasing objective is to 
contract for approximately 75 percent of requirements for the first year, 40 percent of requirements in year two and 20 percent of 
requirements in year three.  Remaining requirements will be filled through the procurement process or over-the-counter transactions.

NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have coal transportation contracts that provide for delivery of 100 and 25 percent of their coal 
requirements in 2018 and 2019, respectively.  Coal delivery may be subject to interruptions or reductions due to operation of the 
mines, transportation problems, weather and availability of equipment.

Natural gas — The NSP System uses both firm and interruptible natural gas supply in combustion turbines and certain boilers.  
Natural gas supplies, transportation and storage services for power plants are procured under contracts to provide an adequate supply 
of fuel.  However, as natural gas primarily serves intermediate and peak demand, remaining forecasted requirements are able to be 
procured through a liquid spot market.  Generally, natural gas supply contracts have variable pricing that is tied to various natural gas 
indices.  Most transportation contract pricing is based on FERC approved transportation tariff rates.  Certain natural gas supply and 
transportation agreements include obligations for the purchase and/or delivery of specified volumes of natural gas or to make 
payments in lieu of delivery.  At Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, the NSP System did not have any commitments related to gas supply 
contracts; however commitments related to gas transportation and storage contracts were approximately $398 million and $382 
million, respectively.  Commitments related to gas transportation and storage contracts expire in various years from 2018 to 2037.

The NSP System also has limited on-site fuel oil storage facilities and primarily relies on the spot market for incremental supplies.

Renewable Energy Sources

The NSP System’s renewable energy portfolio includes wind, hydroelectric, biomass and solar power from both owned generating 
facilities and PPAs.  As of Dec. 31, 2017, the NSP System was in compliance with mandated RPS, which require generation from 
renewable resources of 25.0 percent and 12.9 percent of NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin electric retail sales, respectively.

The NSP System also offers customer-focused renewable energy initiatives.  Windsource allows customers in Minnesota, Wisconsin 
and Michigan to purchase electricity from renewable sources.  The number of customers utilizing Windsource increased to 
approximately 60,900 in 2017 from 54,000 in 2016. 

Additionally, to encourage the growth of solar energy in Minnesota, customers are offered incentives to install solar panels on their 
homes and businesses under the Solar*Rewards® and Made in Minnesota solar incentive programs.  Over 2,800 PV systems with 
approximately 33.75 MW of aggregate capacity have been installed in Minnesota as of Dec. 31, 2017 and 2,000 PV systems with 
approximately 25.2 MW of aggregate capacity were installed as of Dec. 31, 2016.  The Solar*Rewards® Community® program is 
another option made available to encourage use of solar energy in Minnesota.  This program allows for offsite development of solar 
and bill credits to customers based on an approved tariffed rate.

Wind — The NSP System acquires the majority of its wind energy from PPAs.  Currently, the NSP System has more than 130 of these 
agreements in place, with facilities ranging in size from under one MW to more than 200 MW. The NSP System owns and operates 
five wind farms which have the capacity to generate 852 MW.

•  The NSP System had approximately 2,600 MW of wind energy on its system at the end of 2017 and 2016.  In addition to 

receiving purchased wind energy under these agreements, the NSP System typically receives wind RECs, which are used to 
meet state renewable resource requirements.

•  The average cost per MWh of wind energy under existing contracts was approximately $44 for 2017 and $43 for 2016.  The 

cost per MWh of wind energy varies by contract and may be influenced by a number of factors including regulation, state-
specific renewable resource requirements and the year of contract execution.  Generally, contracts executed in 2017 
continued to benefit from improvements in technology, excess capacity among manufacturers and motivation to commence 
new construction prior to the anticipated expiration of the federal PTCs.  In December 2015, the federal PTCs were extended 
through 2019 with a phase down on sites that began construction in 2017.

Hydroelectric — The NSP System acquires its hydroelectric energy from both owned generation and PPAs.  The NSP System owns 20 
hydroelectric plants throughout Wisconsin and Minnesota which provide approximately 263 MW of capacity.  For 2017, PPAs 
provided approximately 34 MW of hydroelectric capacity.  Additionally, the NSP System purchases approximately 850 MW of 
generation from Manitoba Hydro, which is sourced primarily from its fleet of hydroelectric facilities.

Wholesale and Commodity Marketing Operations

NSP-Minnesota conducts various wholesale marketing operations, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, 
ancillary services and energy-related products.  NSP-Minnesota uses physical and financial instruments to minimize commodity price 
and credit risk and hedge sales and purchases.  NSP-Minnesota also engages in trading activity unrelated to hedging and sharing of 
any margins is determined through state regulatory proceedings as well as the operation of the FERC approved joint operating 
agreement.  NSP-Minnesota does not serve any wholesale requirements customers at cost-based regulated rates.  See Item 7 for further 
discussion.

Public Utility Regulation

NSP-Wisconsin

Summary of Regulatory Agencies and Areas of Jurisdiction — Retail rates, services and other aspects of NSP-Wisconsin’s 
operations are regulated by the PSCW and the MPSC, within their respective states.  In addition, each of the state commissions 
certifies the need for new generating plants and electric transmission lines before the facilities may be sited and built.  NSP-Wisconsin 
is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC for its wholesale electric operations, hydroelectric generation licensing, accounting practices, 
wholesale sales for resale, the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce, compliance with NERC electric reliability standards, 
asset transactions and mergers and natural gas transactions in interstate commerce.  NSP- Wisconsin is a transmission owning member 
of the MISO RTO and operates within the MISO RTO and wholesale energy market.  NSP-Wisconsin and NSP-Minnesota are jointly 
authorized by the FERC to make wholesale electric sales at market-based prices. 

The PSCW has a biennial base rate filing requirement.  By June of each odd numbered year, NSP-Wisconsin must submit a rate filing 
for the test year beginning the following January.  In recent years, NSP-Wisconsin has been submitting rate filings each year.

Fuel and Purchased Energy Cost Recovery Mechanisms — NSP-Wisconsin does not have an automatic electric fuel adjustment 
clause for Wisconsin retail customers.  Instead, under Wisconsin rules, utilities submit a forward-looking annual fuel cost plan to the 
PSCW for approval.  Once the PSCW approves the fuel cost plan, utilities defer the amount of any fuel cost under-recovery or over-
recovery in excess of a two percent annual tolerance band, for future rate recovery or refund.  Approval of a fuel cost plan and any rate 
adjustment for refund or recovery of deferred costs is determined by the PSCW.  Rate recovery of deferred fuel cost is subject to an 
earnings test based on the utility’s most recently authorized ROE.  Fuel cost under-collections that exceed the two percent annual 
tolerance band may not be recovered if the utility earnings for that year exceed the authorized ROE.

13

NSP-Wisconsin’s electric fuel costs for 2017 were lower than authorized in rates and outside the two percent annual tolerance band, 
primarily due to lower purchased power costs coupled with moderate weather and generation sales into the MISO market.  Under the 
fuel cost recovery rules, NSP-Wisconsin may retain approximately $4 million of fuel costs and defer approximately $10 million 
through Dec. 31, 2017.  NSP-Wisconsin will file a reconciliation of 2017 fuel costs with the PSCW.  The amount of any potential 
refund is subject to review and approval by the PSCW, which is not expected until mid-2018.

NSP-Wisconsin’s retail electric rate schedules for Michigan customers include power supply cost recovery factors, which are based on 
12-month projections.  After each 12-month period, a reconciliation is submitted whereby over-recoveries are refunded and any under-
recoveries are collected from the customers over the subsequent 12-month period.

Wisconsin Energy Efficiency Program — In Wisconsin, the primary energy efficiency program is funded by the state’s utilities, but 
operated by independent contractors subject to oversight by the PSCW and the utilities.  NSP-Wisconsin recovers these costs in rates 
charged to Wisconsin retail customers.

Capacity and Demand

Energy Sources and Related Transmission Initiatives

NSP-Wisconsin operates an integrated system with NSP-Minnesota.  See NSP-Minnesota Energy Sources and Related Transmission 
Initiatives.

NSP-Wisconsin / American Transmission Company, LLC (ATC) - La Crosse to Madison, Wis. Transmission Line — In 2013, NSP-
Wisconsin and ATC jointly filed an application with the PSCW for a CPCN for a 345 KV transmission line that would extend from La 
Crosse, Wis. to Madison, Wis.  NSP-Wisconsin’s half of the line will be shared with three co-owners, Dairyland Power Cooperative, 
WPPI Energy and Southern Minnesota Municipal Power Agency-Wisconsin.

In 2015, the PSCW issued its order approving a CPCN and route for the project.  Two groups have appealed the CPCN order to the La 
Crosse County Circuit Court (Circuit Court).  In May 2017, the Circuit Court determined that the project was necessary, allowing 
construction to continue on a seven mile segment near La Crosse, Wis.  The parties have appealed various aspects of the case to the 
Wisconsin Court of Appeals which is currently pending.  The CPCN remains in full effect unless one of the parties seeks and receives 
a stay from the court and posts a bond to cover damages the utilities may incur due to delay.  The 180-mile project is expected to cost 
approximately $541 million.  NSP-Wisconsin’s portion of the investment, which includes AFUDC, is estimated to be approximately 
$200 million.  Construction on the line began in January 2016, with completion anticipated by late 2018.

Public Utility Regulation

PSCo

Summary of Regulatory Agencies and Areas of Jurisdiction — PSCo is regulated by the CPUC with respect to its facilities, rates, 
accounts, services and issuance of securities.  PSCo is regulated by the FERC for its wholesale electric operations, accounting 
practices, hydroelectric licensing, wholesale sales for resale, transmission of electricity in interstate commerce, compliance with the 
NERC electric reliability standards, asset transactions and mergers and natural gas transactions in interstate commerce.  PSCo is not 
presently a member of an RTO and does not operate within an RTO energy market.  PSCo is authorized by the FERC to make 
wholesale electric sales at market-based prices to customers outside PSCo’s balancing authority area.

14

Fuel, Purchased Energy and Conservation Cost-Recovery Mechanisms — PSCo has several retail adjustment clauses that recover 
fuel, purchased energy and other resource costs:

•  ECA — Recovers fuel and purchased energy costs.  Short-term sales margins are shared with retail customers through the ECA.  

The ECA is revised quarterly.

•  PCCA — Recovers purchased capacity payments.
• 

SCA — Recovers the difference between PSCo’s actual cost of fuel and the amount of these costs recovered under its base 
steam service rates.  The SCA rate is revised on a quarterly basis.

•  DSMCA — Recovers DSM, interruptible service costs and performance initiatives for achieving energy savings goals.
•  RESA — Recovers the incremental costs of compliance with the RES with a maximum of two percent of the customer’s bill.
•  WCA — Premium service for customers who choose to pay for renewable resources.
TCA — Recovers costs associated with transmission investment outside of rate cases.
• 
•  CACJA — Recovers costs associated with the CACJA.

PSCo recovers fuel and purchased energy costs from its wholesale electric customers through a fuel cost adjustment clause approved 
by the FERC.  PSCo’s wholesale customers pay the full cost of certain renewable energy purchase and generation costs through a fuel 
clause and in exchange receive RECs associated with those resources.  The wholesale customers pay their jurisdictional allocation of 
production costs through a fully forecasted formula rate with true-up.

Capacity and Demand

Uninterrupted system peak demand for PSCo’s electric utility for each of the last three years and the forecast for 2018, assuming 
normal weather conditions, is as follows:

The peak demand for PSCo’s system typically occurs in the summer.  The 2017 system peak demand for PSCo occurred on July 19, 
2017.  The 2017 system peak demand was higher than 2016 due to warmer July summer weather.  The forecast of system peak 
assumes normal weather conditions.

Energy Sources and Related Transmission Initiatives

PSCo expects to meet its system capacity requirements through existing electric generating stations, power purchases, new generation 
facilities, DSM options and phased expansion of existing generation at select power plants.

Purchased Power — PSCo has contracts to purchase power from other utilities and IPPs.  Long-term purchased power contracts for 
dispatchable resources typically require a periodic capacity charge and an energy charge for energy actually purchased.  PSCo also 
contracts to purchase power for both wind and solar resources.  In addition, PSCo makes short-term purchases to meet system load 
and energy requirements, to replace generation from company-owned units under maintenance or during outages, to meet operating 
reserve obligations, or to obtain energy at a lower cost.

Purchased Transmission Services — In addition to using its own transmission system, PSCo has contracts with regional transmission 
service providers to deliver energy to PSCo’s customers.

Rush Creek Wind Ownership Proposal — In 2016, the CPUC granted PSCo a CPCN to build, own and operate a 600 MW wind 
generation facility in Colorado at Rush Creek.  The CPCN includes a hard cost-cap of $1.096 billion (including transmission costs) 
and a capital cost sharing mechanism between customers and PSCo of 82.5 percent to customers and 17.5 percent to PSCo for every 
$10 million the project comes in below the cost-cap.

All major contracts required to complete the project have been executed.  PTC components for safe harboring the facility have been 
fabricated and construction began in April 2017.

Investment costs will be recovered through the RESA and ECA riders until PSCo’s next rate case following Rush Creek’s in-service 
date.  The wind generation facility is anticipated to be in service in October 2018.

15

Colorado Energy Plan (CEP) — In 2016, PSCo filed its 2016 Electric Resource Plan (ERP) which included the estimated need for 
additional generation resources through spring of 2024.  In 2017, PSCo filed an updated capacity need with the CPUC of 450 MW in 
2023.

In August 2017, PSCo and various other stakeholders filed a stipulation agreement proposing the CEP, an alternative plan that 
increases the amount of new resources sought under the ERP.  The CEP would increase PSCo’s potential capacity need up to 1,110 
MW due to the proposed retirement of two coal units.  The major components include:

•  Early retirement of 660 MWs of coal-fired generation at Comanche Units 1 (2022) and 2 (2025);
•  Accelerated depreciation for the early retirement of the two Comanche units and establishment of a regulatory asset to collect 

the incremental depreciation expense and related costs; 

•  A RFP for up to 1,000 MW of wind, 700 MW of solar and 700 MW of natural gas and/or storage;
•  Utility ownership targets of 50 percent renewable generation resources and 75 percent of natural gas-fired, storage, or 

renewable with storage generation resources;

•  Reduction of the RESA rider, from two percent to one percent effective beginning 2021 or 2022; and
•  Construction of a new transmission switching station to further the development of renewable generating resources.

Hearings were held in February 2018 with two parties opposing both the coal retirements and utility ownership.  Fifteen parties in the 
proceeding support the CEP.  The CPUC is expected to rule on the stipulation agreement in March 2018.  PSCo is currently evaluating 
bids from a RFP and anticipates filing its recommended portfolios in April 2018.  A CPUC decision on the recommended portfolio is 
anticipated in the summer of 2018.

Approval of the CEP portfolio could increase capital investment up to $1.5 billion, based on a preliminary estimate.  The level of 
capital investment may decline due to lower renewable pricing and the ultimate composition of assets selected as part of the RFP 
process.  The expected cost and potential capital investment of the CEP will be determined once a recommended portfolio is filed with 
the CPUC.  The CEP portfolio is not included in PSCo and Xcel Energy’s base capital expenditures forecast.  See Item 7. 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources for further 
discussion of the capital forecast.

Boulder, Colorado Municipalization — In 2011, in the City of Boulder, Colorado (Boulder), voters passed a ballot measure 
authorizing the formation of an electric municipal utility, subject to certain conditions.  Since that time, there have been various legal 
proceedings in multiple venues with jurisdiction over Boulder’s plan.  In 2014, the Boulder City Council passed an ordinance to 
establish an electric utility.  PSCo challenged the formation of this utility as premature and the Colorado Court of Appeals ruled in 
PSCo’s favor, vacating a lower court decision.  Subsequently, the Colorado Supreme Court granted Boulder’s petition to review the 
Court of Appeals decision and oral arguments were held on Feb. 14, 2018.  A ruling on the petition is anticipated in 2018.  

In 2015, the Boulder District Court (District Court) affirmed a prior CPUC decision that Boulder cannot serve customers outside its 
city limits; these customers were included in Boulder’s plan at the time.  The District Court also ruled the CPUC has jurisdiction over 
the transfer of any facilities to Boulder and in determining how the systems are separated.  Further, the District Court found that the 
CPUC must give approval before Boulder files any condemnation proceeding.  Boulder does not have authorization to initiate a 
condemnation proceeding at this time. 

Boulder has filed multiple separation applications, the most recent one being in May 2017, which was challenged by PSCo and other 
intervenors.  In September 2017, the CPUC issued a written decision, agreeing with several key aspects of PSCo’s position, stating 
PSCo is not required to undertake many of Boulder’s proposals, such as acting as a financier and contractor for Boulder.  Additionally, 
the CPUC approved the designation of some electrical distribution assets for transfer, subject to Boulder completing certain items, 
including: 

• 

• 
• 

Filing an agreement between Boulder and PSCo providing permanent rights for PSCo to place and access facilities in 
Boulder needed to continue to serve its customers; 
Filing a complete and accurate revised list of distribution assets desired to be transferred; and
Filing an agreement to address payments from Boulder to PSCo for costs of Boulder’s municipalization efforts.  

Boulder has requested that the CPUC grant an extension through March 13, 2018 to complete such filings.  Once those filings have 
been submitted, additional hearings may be held.

In November 2017, Boulder voters passed certain measures regarding Boulder’s pursuit of municipalization, including an extension 
and increase of the Utility Occupational Tax for funding Boulder’s exploration of municipalization.

MWTG — PSCo, along with nine other electric service providers from the Rocky Mountain region, have been considering creating 
and operating a joint transmission tariff to increase wholesale market efficiency and improve regional transmission planning.  In 
September 2017, the MWTG determined that membership in the SPP RTO could provide opportunities to reduce customer costs, and 
maximize resource and electric grid utilization.  In October 2017, the MWTG commenced negotiations with SPP through the SPP 
public stakeholder process.  

SPP’s Board of Directors and organizational groups have begun to address the MWTG’s proposed terms for integration into the SPP 
RTO.  Should the MWTG decide to move forward, SPP would make filings with the FERC and PSCo would make filings with the 
CPUC and the FERC, in the later part of 2018.  If approved, MWTG operations within the SPP RTO would not be expected to begin 
until late 2019 at the earliest.  PSCo recently engaged a consultant to conduct an analysis of the benefits associated with membership 
in the SPP RTO.  The analysis assumed gas price forecasts that are lower than gas price forecasts used by the other MWTG utilities in 
their analysis of the benefits associated with membership in the SPP RTO.  PSCo is in the process of evaluating that analysis.

Coal — PSCo normally maintains approximately 35 - 50 days of coal inventory.  Coal supply inventories at Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016 
were approximately 48 and 36 days of usage, respectively.  PSCo has contracted for coal supply to provide 75 percent of its 9.1 
million tons of estimated coal requirements in 2018, and a declining percentage of requirements in subsequent years.  PSCo’s general 
coal purchasing objective is to contract for approximately 75 percent of requirements for the first year, 40 percent of requirements in 
year two, and 20 percent of requirements in year three.  Remaining requirements will be filled through the procurement process or 
over-the-counter transactions.

PSCo has coal transportation contracts that provide for delivery of 100 percent its coal requirements in 2018 and 2019.  Coal delivery 
may be subject to interruptions or reductions due to operation of the mines, transportation problems, weather and availability of 
equipment.

17

Natural gas — PSCo uses both firm and interruptible natural gas supply in combustion turbines and certain boilers.  Natural gas 
supplies for PSCo’s power plants are procured under contracts to provide an adequate supply of fuel.  However, as natural gas 
primarily serves intermediate and peak demand, any remaining forecasted requirements are able to be procured through a liquid spot 
market.  The majority of natural gas supply under contract is covered by a long-term agreement with Anadarko Energy Services 
Company and the balance of natural gas supply contracts have variable pricing features tied to changes in various natural gas indices.  
PSCo hedges a portion of that risk through financial instruments.  See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further 
discussion.

Most transportation contract pricing is based on FERC approved transportation tariff rates. Certain natural gas supply and 
transportation agreements include obligations for the purchase and/or delivery of specified volumes of natural gas or to make 
payments in lieu of delivery.  

•  At Dec. 31, 2017, PSCo’s commitments related to gas supply contracts, which expire between 2021 through 2023, were 

approximately $545 million and commitments related to gas transportation and storage contracts, which expire between 2018 
through 2040, were approximately $620 million.  

•  At Dec. 31, 2016, PSCo’s commitments related to gas supply contracts were approximately $654 million and commitments 

related to gas transportation and storage contracts were approximately $573 million.  

PSCo has limited on-site fuel oil storage facilities and primarily relies on the spot market for incremental supplies.

Renewable Energy Sources

PSCo’s renewable energy portfolio includes wind, hydroelectric, biomass and solar power from both owned generating facilities and 
PPAs.  As of Dec. 31, 2017, PSCo was in compliance with mandated RPS, which requires generation from renewable resources of 
20.0 percent of electric retail sales.

PSCo also offers customer-focused renewable energy initiatives. Windsource® allows customers to purchase electricity from 
renewable sources.  The number of customers utilizing Windsource increased to approximately 50,000 in 2017 from 46,000 in 2016.  

Additionally, to encourage the growth of solar energy on the system, customers are offered incentives to install solar panels on their 
homes and businesses under the Solar*Rewards® program.  Over 34,900 PV systems with approximately 310 MW of aggregate 
capacity have been installed in Colorado as of Dec. 31, 2017 and over 32,500 PV systems with approximately 276 MW of aggregate 
capacity were installed as of Dec. 31, 2016.  Additionally, 33 community solar gardens with 33.5 MW of capacity have been 
completed in Colorado as of Dec. 31, 2017.  

Wind — PSCo acquires the majority of its wind energy from PPAs.  Currently, PSCo has 18 of these agreements in place, with 
facilities ranging in size from two MW to over 300 MW.

• 

PSCo had approximately 2,560 MW of wind energy on its system at the end of 2017 and 2016. In addition to receiving 
purchased wind energy under these agreements, PSCo typically receives wind RECs which are used to meet state renewable 
resource requirements.

•  The average cost per MWh of wind energy under these contracts was approximately $42 in 2017 and 2016. The cost per 
MWh of wind energy varies by contract and may be influenced by a number of factors including regulation, state-specific 
renewable resource requirements, and the year of contract execution.  Generally, previously executed contracts continued to 
benefit from improvements in wind technology, excess capacity among manufacturers, and motivation to commence new 
construction prior to the anticipated expiration of the federal PTCs.  In December 2015, the federal PTCs were extended 
through 2019 with a phase down on sites that began construction in 2017.

Wholesale and Commodity Marketing Operations

PSCo conducts various wholesale marketing operations, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, ancillary services 
and energy related products.  PSCo uses physical and financial instruments to minimize commodity price and credit risk and hedge 
sales and purchases.  PSCo also engages in trading activity unrelated to hedging and sharing of any margins is determined through 
state regulatory proceedings as well as the operation of the FERC approved joint operating agreement. See Item 7 for further 
discussion.

Public Utility Regulation

SPS

Summary of Regulatory Agencies and Areas of Jurisdiction — The PUCT and NMPRC regulate SPS’ retail electric operations and 
have jurisdiction over its retail rates and services and the construction of transmission or generation in their respective states.  The 
municipalities in which SPS operates in Texas have original jurisdiction over SPS’ rates in those communities.  The municipalities’ 
rate setting decisions are subject to review by the PUCT, which has ultimate authority to set the rates SPS charges in the 
municipalities.  The NMPRC also has jurisdiction over the issuance of securities.  SPS is regulated by the FERC for its wholesale 
electric operations, accounting practices, wholesale sales for resale, the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce, compliance 
with NERC electric reliability standards, asset transactions and mergers, and natural gas transactions in interstate commerce.  As 
approved by the FERC, SPS is a transmission-owning member of the SPP RTO and operates within the SPP RTO and SPP IM 
wholesale market.  SPS is authorized to make wholesale electric sales at market-based prices. 

Fuel, Purchased Energy and Conservation Cost-Recovery Mechanisms — SPS has several retail adjustment clauses that recover 
fuel, purchased energy and other resource costs:

•  DCRF — Recovers distribution costs in Texas that are not included in base rates.
•  EECRF — Recovers costs associated with providing energy efficiency programs in Texas.
•  EE rider — Recovers costs associated with providing energy efficiency programs in New Mexico.
•  FPPCAC — Adjusts monthly to recover the actual fuel and purchased power costs.
•  PCRF — Allows recovery of certain purchased power costs in Texas that are not included in base rates.
•  RPS — Recovers deferred costs associated with renewable energy programs in New Mexico.
• 

TCRF — Recovers certain transmission infrastructure improvement costs and changes in wholesale transmission charges in 
Texas that are not included in base rates.

Fuel and purchased energy costs are recovered in Texas through a fixed fuel and purchased energy recovery factor, which is part of 
SPS’ retail electric tariff.  SO2 and NOx allowance revenues and costs are also recovered through the fixed fuel and purchased energy 
recovery factor.  The regulations allow retail fuel factors to change up to three times per year.

The fixed fuel and purchased energy recovery factor provides for the over- or under-recovery of fuel and purchased energy expenses.  
Regulations also require refunding or surcharging over- or under- recovery amounts, including interest, when they exceed four percent 
of the utility’s annual fuel and purchased energy costs on a rolling 12-month basis, if this condition is expected to continue.

PUCT regulations require periodic examination of SPS’ fuel and purchased energy costs, the efficient use of fuel and purchased 
energy, fuel acquisition and management policies and purchased energy commitments.  SPS is required to file an application for the 
PUCT to retrospectively review fuel and purchased energy costs at least every three years.  In June 2016, SPS filed its fuel 
reconciliation application which reconciled fuel and purchased power costs for 2013 through 2015.  In March 2017, the PUCT 
approved the application.

SPS recovers fuel and purchased energy costs from its wholesale customers through a monthly wholesale fuel and purchased 
economic energy cost adjustment clause accepted for filing by the FERC.

Capacity and Demand

Uninterrupted system peak demand for SPS for each of the last three years and the forecast for 2018, assuming normal weather 
conditions, is as follows:

The peak demand for the SPS system typically occurs in the summer.  The 2017 system peak demand for SPS occurred on July 26, 
2017. The decline in peak load from 2016 to 2017 is in part due to cooler weather in 2017. Additionally, the partial requirement 
contract with Golden Spread ended May 2017, contributing to the lower actual peak demand for SPS.  The 2018 forecast assumes 
normal peak day weather.

Energy Sources and Related Transmission Initiatives

SPS expects to use existing electric generating stations, power purchases, DSM and new generation options to meet its system 
capacity requirements.  In addition, SPS has evaluated water supply issues at its Tolk facility, concluding that additional resource 
investment will be required to operate the plant through its existing life.  The Ogallala aquifer in this region of the country has 
depleted more rapidly than expected and SPS installed a horizontal water well that could help to delay the need for a more substantial 
investment solution.  As a result of this issue and to a lesser extent, future environmental rules facing the plant, SPS is seeking a 
decrease to the remaining life of the facility in its current Texas and New Mexico rate case proceedings (see Note 12).

Purchased Power — SPS has contracts to purchase power from other utilities and IPPs.  Long-term purchased power contracts 
typically require a periodic capacity charge and an energy charge for energy actually purchased.  SPS also makes short-term purchases 
to meet system load and energy requirements, to replace generation from company-owned units under maintenance or during outages, 
to meet operating reserve obligations or to obtain energy at a lower cost.

Purchased Transmission Services — SPS has contractual arrangements with SPP and regional transmission service providers to 
deliver power and energy to its native load customers.

TUCO Substation to Yoakum County Substation to Hobbs Plant Substation 345 KV Transmission Line — In 2014, SPP evaluated 
anticipated transmission needs for certain parts of the SPP region which is commonly known as the High Priority Incremental Load 
Study.  As a result, SPS received 44 transmission projects, with an original estimated cost of $557 million.  The most significant of 
these projects are the TUCO Substation to the Yoakum County Substation to the Hobbs Plant Substation and the Hobbs Plant 
Substation to the China Draw Substation transmission line projects.  

In 2016 and 2017, SPS received CCNs for the three segments of the TUCO Substation to Yoakum County Substation to Hobbs Plant 
Substation 345 KV transmission line, which are expected to be in service in the second quarter of 2020.  This 345 KV transmission 
line is part of a larger project which includes an additional 345 KV transmission line from the Hobbs Plant Substation to the China 
Draw Substation, which was approved by the NMPRC in 2016 and is anticipated to be in service by June 2018.  The estimated total 
investment for these transmission lines is approximately $402 million.  

Wind Proposals — In March 2017, SPS filed proposals with the NMPRC and the PUCT to build, own and operate 1,000 MW of new 
wind generation through two wind farms for a cost of approximately $1.6 billion.  In addition, the proposal includes a PPA for 230 
MW of wind.

In December 2017, SPS and parties filed a unanimous stipulation with the NMPRC.  The stipulation is subject to approval by the 
NMPRC.  The key terms of the stipulation are listed below:

•  An investment cap of $1,675 per KW, which is equal to 102.5 percent of the estimated construction costs;
• 
• 
• 

SPS customers would receive a credit to their bills if actual capacity factors fall below 48 percent;
SPS customers would receive 100 percent of the federal PTC; and
SPS can file a HTY rate case and include projected capital additions for the wind farms five months beyond the end of the 
test year. Interim rates would also be made effective 30 days after filing which will allow SPS to closely match the start of 
cost recovery for that wind farm with the in service date.

On Feb. 9, 2018, the Hearing Examiner issued a certification of stipulation (certification) recommending approval of all but one aspect 
of the stipulation, which is the provision for interim rate recovery of SPS’ investment in the two wind farms.  On Feb. 19, 2018, SPS 
filed exceptions to the recommended decision, as did other parties to the stipulation.

In addition, SPS has reached a settlement in principle with parties in Texas and is working towards finalizing a stipulation.  SPS has 
shared an updated analysis with all parties which shows the wind projects remain cost-effective following the passage of the TCJA.   
The settlements require approval by the NMPRC and PUCT.  Both commissions are expected to rule on the settlements by the end of 
the first quarter of 2018.  The Hale wind project in Texas and the Sagamore wind project in New Mexico are scheduled to be in service 
by mid-2019 and year-end 2020, respectively.

20

Lubbock Power & Light’s (LP&L’s) Request for Participation in ERCOT — In September 2017, LP&L filed its application with the 
PUCT and proposed to transition a portion of its load to ERCOT no later than June 2021.  As a result of LP&L’s proposal, 
approximately $18 million in wholesale transmission revenue would be reallocated to remaining SPS transmission customers at the 
time of the load transition.  In November 2017, SPS and various other parties, including the PUCT Staff, filed direct testimony in 
response to LP&L’s application.  SPS proposed an Interconnection Switching Fee to be determined by the PUCT.

In February 2018, SPS, LP&L, the PUCT Staff and various other parties filed a stipulation that provides SPS’ customers with an 
Interconnection Switching Fee of approximately $24 million to compensate them for the transfer of LP&L’s load from SPP to ERCOT.  
Under the settlement, SPS would allocate the Interconnection Switching Fee to its Texas and New Mexico retail and wholesale 
transmission customers through a bill credit following LP&L’s load transition to ERCOT (tentatively, June 2021).  A PUCT decision is 
expected in March 2018.  No final decision regarding LP&L’s departure or its potential timing is expected until completion of the 
PUCT proceedings.

Texas State ROFR Request for Declaratory Order — In February 2017, SPS and SPP filed a joint petition with the PUCT for a 
declaratory order regarding SPS’ ROFR.  SPS contended that Texas law grants an incumbent electric utility, operating in areas outside 
of ERCOT, the ROFR to construct new transmission facilities located in the utility’s service area.  SPP stated that Texas law does not 
provide a clear statement regarding the ROFR for incumbent utilities and therefore SPP was abiding by the portion of its OATT, which 
requires competitive solicitation to construct and operate new transmission facilities within areas of Texas’ SPP footprint.  

In October 2017, the PUCT issued an order finding that SPS does not possess an exclusive right to construct and operate transmission 
facilities within its service area.  In January 2018, SPS and two other parties filed appeals of the PUCT’s order in the Texas State 
District Court.  The appeals have been consolidated.  A schedule has not been set for the case.

Fuel Sources

Coal — SPS purchases all of the coal requirements for its two coal facilities, Harrington and Tolk electric generating stations, from 
TUCO.  TUCO arranges for the purchase, receiving, transporting, unloading, handling, crushing, weighing and delivery of coal to 
meet SPS’ requirements.  TUCO is responsible for negotiating and administering contracts with coal suppliers, transporters and 
handlers.  The coal supply contract with TUCO expires on Dec. 31, 2022 for both Harrington and Tolk.  

SPS normally maintains approximately 35 - 50 days of coal inventory.  As of Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, coal inventories at SPS were 
approximately 52 and 64 day supply, respectively.  Milder weather, purchase commitments and relatively low power and natural gas 
prices resulted in coal inventories being above optimal levels.  SPS’ generation stations primarily use low-sulfur western coal from 
mines operating in Wyoming. TUCO has coal agreements to supply 79 percent of SPS’ estimated coal requirements in 2018 and a 
declining percentage of requirements in subsequent years.   SPS’ general coal purchasing objective is to contract for approximately 75 
percent of requirements for the first year,  40 percent of requirements in year two and 20 percent of requirements in year three.

Natural gas — SPS uses both firm and interruptible natural gas supply in combustion turbines and certain boilers.  Natural gas for 
SPS’ power plants is procured under contracts to provide an adequate supply of fuel, which typically is purchased with terms of one 
year or less.  The transportation and storage contracts expire between 2018 to 2033.  All of the natural gas supply contracts have 
variable pricing that is tied to various natural gas indices.

Most transportation contract pricing is based on FERC and Railroad Commission of Texas approved transportation tariff rates.  
Certain natural gas supply and transportation agreements include obligations for the purchase and/or delivery of specified volumes of 
natural gas or to make payments in lieu of delivery.  SPS’ commitments related to gas supply contracts were approximately $11 
million and $17 million and commitments related to gas transportation and storage contracts were approximately $191 million and 
$161 million at Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

SPS has limited on-site fuel oil storage facilities and primarily relies on the spot market for incremental supplies.

Renewable Energy Sources

SPS’ renewable energy portfolio includes wind and solar power from PPAs. As of Dec. 31, 2017, SPS is in compliance with mandated 
RPS, which require generation from renewable resources of 3.7 percent of Texas electric retail sales and 15.0 percent of New Mexico 
electric retail sales.

SPS also offers customer-focused renewable energy initiatives.  Windsource® allows customers in New Mexico to purchase electricity 
from renewable sources.  The number of customers utilizing Windsource increased to approximately 940 in 2017 from 900 in 2016. 

Wind — SPS acquires its wind energy from IPP contracts and QF tariffs.  SPS currently has 24 of these agreements in place, with 
facilities ranging in size from under two MW to 250 MW. 

• 

SPS had approximately 1,500 MW of wind energy on its system at the end of 2017 and 2016.  In addition to receiving 
purchased wind energy under these agreements, SPS typically receives wind RECs on certain agreements which are used to 
meet state renewable resource requirements.

•  The average cost per MWh of wind energy under the IPP contracts and QF tariffs was approximately $27 for 2017 and $25 

for 2016.  The cost per MWh of wind energy varies by contract and may be influenced by a number of factors including 
regulation, state-specific renewable resource requirements and the year of contract execution.  Generally, contracts executed 
in 2017 continued to benefit from improvements in technology, excess capacity among manufacturers, and motivation to 
commence new construction prior to the anticipated expiration of the federal PTCs.  In December 2015, the federal PTCs 
were extended through 2019 with a phase down on sites that began construction in 2017.

Wholesale and Commodity Marketing Operations

SPS conducts various wholesale marketing operations, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, ancillary services 
and energy related products.  SPS uses physical and financial instruments to minimize commodity price and credit risk and hedge sales 
and purchases.  See Item 7 for further discussion.

Summary of Recent Federal Regulatory Developments

The FERC has jurisdiction over rates for electric transmission service in interstate commerce and electricity sold at wholesale, hydro 
facility licensing, natural gas transportation, asset transactions and mergers, accounting practices and certain other activities of Xcel 
Energy Inc.’s utility subsidiaries and TransCos, including enforcement of NERC mandatory electric reliability standards.  State and 
local agencies have jurisdiction over many of Xcel Energy Inc.’s utility subsidiaries’ activities, including regulation of retail rates and 
environmental matters.  In addition to the matters discussed below, see Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
for a discussion of other regulatory matters.

Xcel Energy attempts to mitigate the risk of regulatory penalties through formal training on prohibited practices and a compliance 
function that reviews interaction with the markets under FERC and CFTC jurisdictions.  Public campaigns are conducted to raise 
awareness of the public safety issues of interacting with our electric systems.  While programs to comply with regulatory requirements 
are in place, there is no guarantee the compliance programs or other measures will be sufficient to ensure against violations.

FERC Order, ROE Policy — In June 2014, the FERC adopted a two-step ROE methodology for electric utilities in an order issued in 
a complaint proceeding involving New England Transmission Owners (NETOs).  The issue of how to apply the FERC ROE 
methodology has been contested in various complaint proceedings, including two ROE complaints involving the MISO TOs, which 
include NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin.  In April 2017, the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) vacated and remanded the 
June 2014 ROE order.  The D.C. Circuit found that the FERC had not properly determined that the ROE authorized for the NETOs 
prior to June 2014 was unjust and unreasonable.  The D.C. Circuit also found that the FERC failed to justify the new ROE 
methodology.  The FERC has yet to act on the D.C. Circuit’s decision.  See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for 
discussion of the D.C. Circuit’s decision and the impact on the MISO ROE Complaints.

DOE Grid Resiliency Notice of Proposed Rule (NOPR) — In September 2017, the DOE requested the FERC to consider and adopt a 
Grid Resiliency and Pricing Rule to address threats to the U.S. electrical grid.  Under the proposed rule, coal and nuclear generation 
facilities would have to meet certain criteria to qualify for full recovery of their costs including a fair rate of return.  In January 2018, 
the FERC rejected the DOE’s proposal, but alternatively initiated an inquiry into how RTOs and Independent System Operators 
address grid resilience.  Efforts to resolve U.S. grid resilience issues may result from this proceeding and Xcel Energy plans to 
monitor and respond as necessary. 

Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) Enforcement Complaint against CPUC — In December 2016, Sustainable Power 
Group, LLC (sPower) petitioned the FERC to initiate an enforcement action in federal court against the CPUC under PURPA.  The 
petition asserts that a December 2016 CPUC ruling, which indicated that a QF must be a successful bidder in a PSCo resource 
acquisition bidding process, violated PURPA and FERC rules.  In January 2017, PSCo filed a motion to intervene and protest, arguing 
that the FERC should decline the petition.  The CPUC filed a similar pleading.  sPower has proposed to construct 800 MW of solar 
generation and 700 MW of wind generation in Colorado and seeks to require PSCo to contract for these resources under PURPA.  

If sPower were to prevail, PSCo’s ability to select generation resources through competitive bidding would be negatively affected.  
However, due to a lack of quorum at the FERC, the FERC did not act on that petition within the sixty days contemplated by PURPA.  
Subsequently sPower filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the United States District Court for the District of 
Colorado (District Court) requesting that the court find the bidding requirement in the CPUC QF rules to be unlawful.  PSCo 
intervened in that proceeding and the CPUC filed a motion to dismiss.  In June 2017, the United States Magistrate Judge issued a 
recommendation to the District Court that sPower’s complaint be dismissed because sPower failed to establish that it faced a 
substantial risk of harm.  In October 2017, the District Court denied the CPUC’s motion to dismiss and instead allowed sPower to file 
an amended complaint.  The case effectively started over and PSCo intervened.  The CPUC filed a motion to dismiss the amended 
complaint which is currently pending before the District Court.  The timing of a resolution in this case is unclear.

Overview

NATURAL GAS UTILITY OPERATIONS

Xcel Energy operates natural gas local distribution companies in six states, including Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, South Dakota, 
North Dakota, and Colorado with PSCo being the largest.  The most significant developments in the natural gas operations of the 
utility subsidiaries are uncertainty regarding political and regulatory developments that impact hydraulic fracturing, safety 
requirements for natural gas pipelines and the continued trend of declining use per residential and small C&I customer, as a result of 
improved building construction technologies, higher appliance efficiencies and conservation.  From 2000 to 2017, average annual 
sales to the typical residential customer declined 17 percent, while sales to the typical small C&I customer declined 10 percent, each 
on a weather-normalized basis.  Although wholesale price increases do not directly affect earnings because of natural gas cost-
recovery mechanisms, high prices can encourage further efficiency efforts by customers. 

The PHMSA

Pipeline Safety Act — The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act (Pipeline Safety Act) requires additional 
verification of pipeline infrastructure records by pipeline owners and operators to confirm the maximum allowable operating pressure 
of lines located in high consequence areas or more-densely populated areas.  In April 2016, the PHMSA released proposed rules that 
address this verification requirement along with a number of other significant changes to gas transmission regulations.  These changes 
include requirements around use of automatic or remote-controlled shut-off valves, testing of certain previously untested transmission 
lines and expanding integrity management requirements. The Pipeline Safety Act also includes a maximum penalty for violating 
pipeline safety rules of $2 million per day for related violations.  

PHMSA is currently working through the rule with its Pipeline Advisory Committee.  Current estimates are the rule will likely go into 
effect in late 2018 or early 2019.    
 
Xcel Energy has been taking actions that were intended to comply with the Pipeline Safety Act and any related PHMSA regulations as 
they become effective.  PSCo and NSP-Minnesota can generally recover costs to comply with the transmission and distribution 
integrity management programs through the PSIA and GUIC riders, respectively.

Public Utility Regulation

NSP-Minnesota

Summary of Regulatory Agencies and Areas of Jurisdiction — Retail rates, services and other aspects of NSP-Minnesota’s retail 
natural gas operations are regulated by the MPUC and the NDPSC within their respective states.  The MPUC has regulatory authority 
over security issuances, certain property transfers, mergers with other utilities and transactions between NSP-Minnesota and its 
affiliates.  In addition, the MPUC reviews and approves NSP-Minnesota’s natural gas supply plans for meeting customers’ future 
energy needs.  NSP-Minnesota is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC with respect to certain natural gas transactions in interstate 
commerce.  NSP-Minnesota is subject to the DOT, the Minnesota Office of Pipeline Safety, the NDPSC and the SDPUC for pipeline 
safety compliance, including pipeline facilities used in electric utility operations for fuel deliveries.

Purchased Gas and Conservation Cost-Recovery Mechanisms — NSP-Minnesota’s retail natural gas rates for Minnesota and North 
Dakota include a PGA clause that provides for prospective monthly rate adjustments to reflect the forecasted cost of purchased natural 
gas, transportation service and storage service.  The annual difference between the natural gas cost revenues collected through PGA 
rates and the actual natural gas costs is collected or refunded over the subsequent 12-month period.  

NSP-Minnesota also recovers costs associated with transmission and distribution pipeline integrity management programs through its 
GUIC rider.  Costs recoverable under the GUIC rider include funding for pipeline assessments as well as deferred costs from NSP-
Minnesota’s existing sewer separation and pipeline integrity management programs.  The MPUC and NDPSC have the authority to 
disallow recovery of certain costs if they find the utility was not prudent in its procurement activities.

Minnesota state law requires utilities to invest 0.5 percent of their state natural gas revenues in CIP.  These costs are recovered through 
customer base rates and an annual cost-recovery mechanism for the CIP expenditures.

Capability and Demand

Natural gas supply requirements are categorized as firm or interruptible (customers with an alternate energy supply).  The maximum 
daily send-out (firm and interruptible) for NSP-Minnesota was 893,062 MMBtu, which occurred on Dec. 26, 2017 and 800,232 
MMBtu, which occurred on Jan. 18, 2016.

NSP-Minnesota purchases natural gas from independent suppliers, generally based on market indices that reflect current prices.  The 
natural gas is delivered under transportation agreements with interstate pipelines.  These agreements provide for firm deliverable 
pipeline capacity of 640,489 MMBtu per day.  In addition, NSP-Minnesota contracts with providers of underground natural gas 
storage services.  These agreements provide storage for approximately 26 percent of winter natural gas requirements and 29 percent of 
peak day firm requirements of NSP-Minnesota.

NSP-Minnesota also owns and operates one LNG plant with a storage capacity of 2.0 Bcf equivalent and three propane-air plants with 
a storage capacity of 1.3 Bcf equivalent to help meet its peak requirements.  These peak-shaving facilities have production capacity 
equivalent to 246,000 MMBtu of natural gas per day, or approximately 30 percent of peak day firm requirements.  LNG and propane-
air plants provide a cost-effective alternative to annual fixed pipeline transportation charges to meet the peaks caused by firm space 
heating demand on extremely cold winter days.

NSP-Minnesota is required to file for a change in natural gas supply contract levels to meet peak demand, to redistribute demand costs 
among classes, or to exchange one form of demand for another.  In February 2017, the MPUC approved NSP-Minnesota’s contract 
demand levels for the 2016 through 2017 heating season.  Demand levels for the 2017 through 2018 heating season were filed with the 
MPUC in August 2017.

Natural Gas Supply and Costs

NSP-Minnesota actively seeks natural gas supply, transportation and storage alternatives to yield a diversified portfolio that provides 
increased flexibility, decreased interruption and financial risk and economical rates.  In addition, NSP-Minnesota conducts natural gas 
price hedging activity that has been approved by the MPUC.

The following table summarizes the average delivered cost per MMBtu of natural gas purchased for resale by NSP-Minnesota’s

GENERAL

Seasonality

The demand for electric power and natural gas is affected by seasonal differences in the weather.  In general, peak sales of electricity 
occur in the summer months, and peak sales of natural gas occur in the winter months.  As a result, the overall operating results may 
fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis.  Additionally, Xcel Energy’s operations have historically generated less revenues and 
income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer.  See Item 7 for further discussion.

Competition

Xcel Energy is a vertically integrated utility in all of its jurisdictions, subject to traditional cost-of-service regulation by state public 
utilities commissions.  However, Xcel Energy is subject to different public policies that promote competition and the development of 
energy markets.  Xcel Energy’s industrial and large commercial customers have the ability to own or operate facilities to generate their 
own electricity.  In addition, customers may have the option of substituting other fuels, such as natural gas, steam or chilled water for 
heating, cooling and manufacturing purposes, or the option of relocating their facilities to a lower cost region. Customers also have the 
opportunity to supply their own power with distributed generation including solar generation and in most jurisdictions can avoid 
paying for most of the fixed production, transmission and distribution costs incurred to serve them.  Several states have policies 
designed to promote the development of solar and other distributed energy resources through significant incentive policies; with these 
incentives and federal tax subsidies, distributed generating resources are potential competitors to Xcel Energy’s electric service 
business.

30

The FERC has continued to promote competitive wholesale markets through open access transmission and other means.  As a result, 
Xcel Energy Inc.’s utility subsidiaries and their wholesale customers can purchase the output from generation resources of competing 
wholesale suppliers and use the transmission systems of the utility subsidiaries on a comparable basis to serve their native load.

In addition, FERC Order 1000 seeks to establish competition for construction and operation of certain new electric transmission 
facilities.  State public utilities commissions have created resource planning programs that promote competition in the acquisition of 
electricity generation resources used to provide service to retail customers.  Xcel Energy Inc.’s utility subsidiaries also have franchise 
agreements with certain cities subject to periodic renewal.  If a city elected not to renew the franchise agreement, it could seek 
alternative means for its citizens to access electric power or gas, such as municipalization.  While each of Xcel Energy Inc.’s utility 
subsidiaries faces these challenges, Xcel Energy believes their rates and services are competitive with currently available alternatives.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Xcel Energy’s facilities are regulated by federal and state environmental agencies.  These agencies have jurisdiction over air 
emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid wastes and hazardous substances.  Various company activities require 
registrations, permits, licenses, inspections and approvals from these agencies.  Xcel Energy has received all necessary authorizations 
for the construction and continued operation of its generation, transmission and distribution systems.  Xcel Energy’s facilities have 
been designed and constructed to operate in compliance with applicable environmental standards.  However, it is not possible to 
determine when or to what extent additional facilities or modifications of existing or planned facilities will be required as a result of 
changes to environmental regulations, interpretations or enforcement policies or what effect future laws or regulations may have upon 
Xcel Energy’s operations.  See Item 7 and Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

There are significant present and future environmental regulations to encourage the use of clean energy technologies and regulate 
emissions of GHGs to address climate change.  Xcel Energy has undertaken a number of initiatives to meet current requirements and 
prepare for potential future regulations, reduce GHG emissions and respond to state renewable and energy efficiency goals.  If these 
future environmental regulations do not provide credit for the investments we have already made to reduce GHG emissions, or if they 
require additional initiatives or emission reductions, then their requirements would potentially impose additional substantial costs.  
Xcel Energy believes, based on prior state commission practice, it would recover the cost of these initiatives through rates.

Xcel Energy is committed to addressing climate change and potential climate change regulation through efforts to reduce its GHG 
emissions in a balanced, cost-effective manner.  Starting in 2011, Xcel Energy began reporting GHG emissions to the EPA under the 
EPA’s mandatory GHG Reporting Program.

Xcel Energy estimates that in 2017, it reduced the CO2 emissions associated with the electric generating resources used to serve its 
customers by 35 percent from 2005 levels.  This reduction accounts for emissions both from electric generating plants owned by Xcel 
Energy as well as purchased power.  To achieve this goal, Xcel Energy primarily relied on strategies that resulted in:

•  Development of renewable energy facilities;
•  Retirement and replacement of existing generating plants; and
•  Customer energy efficiency programs.

CAPITAL SPENDING AND FINANCING

See Item 7 for a discussion of expected capital expenditures and funding sources.

EMPLOYEES

As of Dec. 31, 2017, Xcel Energy had 11,075 full-time employees and 59 part-time employees, of which 5,115 were covered under 
collective-bargaining agreements.  See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

Item 1A — Risk Factors

Xcel Energy is subject to a variety of risks, many of which are beyond our control.  Important risks that may adversely affect the 
business, financial condition and results of operations are further described below.  These risks should be carefully considered together 
with the other information set forth in this report and in future reports that Xcel Energy files with the SEC.

Oversight of Risk and Related Processes

A key accountability of the Board of Directors is the oversight of material risk, and our Board of Directors employs an effective 
process for doing so.  Management and each Board of Directors’ committee have responsibility for overseeing the identification and 
mitigation of key risks and reporting its assessments and activities to the full Board of Directors. 

Management identifies and analyzes risks to determine materiality and other attributes such as timing, probability and controllability. 
Management broadly considers our business, the utility industry, the domestic and global economies and the environment when 
identifying, assessing, managing and mitigating risk.  Identification and analysis occurs formally through a key risk assessment 
process conducted by senior management, the financial disclosure process, the hazard risk management process and internal auditing 
and compliance with financial and operational controls.  Management also identifies and analyzes risk through its business planning 
process and development of goals and key performance indicators, which include risk identification to determine barriers to 
implementing Xcel Energy’s strategy.  The business planning process also identifies areas in which there is a potential for a business 
area to take inappropriate risk to meet goals, and determines how to prevent inappropriate risk-taking.

At a threshold level, Xcel Energy has developed a robust compliance program and promotes a culture of compliance, including tone at 
the top, which mitigates risk.  The process for risk mitigation includes adherence to our code of conduct and other compliance 
policies, operation of formal risk management structures and groups and overall business management to mitigate the risks inherent in 
the implementation of strategy.  Building on this culture of compliance, Xcel Energy manages and further mitigates risks through 
operation of formal risk management structures and groups, including management councils, risk committees and the services of 
internal corporate areas such as internal audit, the corporate controller and legal services.

Management communicates regularly with the Board of Directors and key stakeholders regarding risk.  Senior management presents a 
periodic assessment of key risks to the Board of Directors.  The presentation and the discussion of the key risks provides the Board of 
Directors with information on the risks management believes are material, including the earnings impact, timing, likelihood and 
controllability.  Management also provides information to the Board of Directors in presentations and communications over the course 
of the year.

The Board of Directors approaches oversight, management and mitigation of risk as an integral and continuous part of its governance 
of Xcel Energy.  First, the Board of Directors regularly reviews management’s key risk assessment and analyzes areas of existing and 
future risks and opportunities.  In addition, the Board of Directors assigns oversight of certain critical risks to each of its four standing 
committees to ensure these risks are well understood and are given focused oversight by the appropriate committee.  The Audit 
Committee is responsible for reviewing the adequacy of risk oversight and affirming that appropriate oversight occurs.  New risks are 
considered and assigned as appropriate during the annual Board of Directors’ and committee evaluation process, and committee 
charters and annual work plans are updated accordingly.  Committees regularly report on their oversight activities and certain risk 
issues may be brought to the full Board of Directors for consideration where deemed appropriate to ensure broad Board of Directors’ 
understanding of the nature of the risk.  Finally, the Board of Directors conducts an annual strategy session where Xcel Energy’s future 
plans and initiatives are reviewed.

Risks Associated with Our Business

Environmental Risks

We are subject to environmental laws and regulations, with which compliance could be difficult and costly.

We are subject to environmental laws and regulations that affect many aspects of our past, present and future operations, including air 
emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges and the generation, transport and disposal of solid wastes and hazardous substances.  
These laws and regulations require us to obtain permits, licenses, and other approvals and to comply with a wide variety of 
environmental requirements including those for protected natural and cultural resources (such as wetlands, endangered species and 
other protected wildlife, and archaeological and historical resources).  Environmental laws and regulations can also require us to 
restrict or limit the output of certain facilities or the use of certain fuels, shift generation to lower-emitting, but potentially more costly 
facilities, install pollution control equipment at our facilities, clean up spills and other contamination and correct environmental 
hazards.  Environmental regulations may also lead to shutdown of existing facilities, either due to the difficulty in assuring compliance 
or that the costs of compliance makes operation of the units no longer economical.  Both public officials and private individuals may 
seek to enforce the applicable environmental laws and regulations against us.  We may be required to pay all or a portion of the cost to 
remediate (i.e., clean-up) sites where our past activities, or the activities of certain other parties, caused environmental contamination. 

We are also subject to mandates to provide customers with clean energy, renewable energy and energy conservation offerings.  Failure 
to meet the requirements of these mandates may result in fines or penalties, which could have a material effect on our results of 
operations.  If our regulators do not allow us to recover all or a part of the cost of capital investment or the O&M costs incurred to 
comply with the mandates or other environmental requirements, it could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial 
position or cash flows.

In addition, existing environmental laws or regulations may be revised, and new laws or regulations may be adopted or become 
applicable to us, including but not limited to, regulation of mercury, NOx, SO2, CO2 and other GHGs, particulates, cooling water 
intakes, water discharges and ash management.  We may also incur additional unanticipated obligations or liabilities under existing 
environmental laws and regulations.

We are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change and other weather, natural disaster and resource 
depletion impacts.

Climate change can create physical and financial risk.  Physical risks from climate change can include changes in weather conditions, 
changes in precipitation and extreme weather events.

Our customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity.  For residential customers, heating 
and cooling represent their largest energy use.  To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers’ energy use 
could increase or decrease.  Increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in additional generating assets, 
transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load.  Decreased energy use due to weather changes may result in decreased 
revenues.  Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system 
stress, including service interruptions.  Weather conditions could also have an impact on our revenues.  We buy and sell electricity 
depending upon system needs and market opportunities.  Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand may raise 
electricity prices, which would increase the cost of energy we provide to our customers.

Severe weather impacts our service territories, primarily when thunderstorms and associated flooding, tornadoes, wildfires and snow 
or ice storms occur.  To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase our cost of providing service.  
Changes in precipitation resulting in droughts or water shortages, whether caused by climate change or otherwise, could adversely 
affect our operations, principally our fossil generating units.  A negative impact to water supplies due to long-term drought or water 
depletion conditions could adversely impact our ability to provide electricity to customers, as well as increase the price they pay for 
energy.  We may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks.

Climate change may impact a region’s economic health, which could impact our revenues.  Our financial performance is tied to the 
health of the regional economies we serve.  The price of energy has an impact on the economic health of our communities.  The cost 
of additional regulatory requirements, such as regulation of GHG or additional environmental regulation could impact the availability 
of goods and prices charged by our suppliers which would normally be borne by consumers through higher prices for energy and 
purchased goods.  To the extent financial markets view climate change and emissions of GHGs as a financial risk, this could 
negatively affect our ability to access capital markets or cause us to receive less than ideal terms and conditions.

34

Financial Risks

Our profitability depends in part on the ability of our utility subsidiaries to recover their costs from their customers and there may 
be changes in circumstances or in the regulatory environment that impair the ability of our utility subsidiaries to recover costs 
from their customers.

We are subject to comprehensive regulation by federal and state utility regulatory agencies.  The utility commissions in the states 
where we operate regulate many aspects of our utility operations, including siting and construction of facilities, customer service and 
the rates that we can charge customers.  The FERC has jurisdiction, among other things, over wholesale rates for electric transmission 
service, the sale of electric energy in interstate commerce and certain natural gas transactions in interstate commerce.

The profitability of our utility operations is dependent on our ability to recover the costs of providing energy and utility services to our 
customers and earn a return on our capital investment.  Our utility subsidiaries provide service at rates approved by one or more 
regulatory commissions.  These rates are generally regulated and based on an analysis of the utility’s costs incurred in a test year.  Our 
utility subsidiaries are subject to both future and historical test years depending upon the regulatory mechanisms approved in each 
jurisdiction.  Thus, the rates a utility is allowed to charge may or may not match its costs at any given time.  While rate regulation is 
premised on providing an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, in a continued low interest rate 
environment there has been pressure pushing down ROE.  There can also be no assurance that the applicable regulatory commission 
will judge all the costs of our utility subsidiaries to have been prudent, which could result in cost disallowances, or that the regulatory 
process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that will produce full recovery of such costs.  Changes in the long-
term cost-effectiveness or changes to the operating conditions of our assets may result in early retirements and while regulation 
typically provides relief for these types of changes, there is no assurance that regulators would allow full recovery of all remaining 
costs leaving all or a portion of these asset costs stranded.  Higher than expected inflation may increase costs of construction and 
operations.  Rising fuel costs could increase the risk that our utility subsidiaries will not be able to fully recover their fuel costs from 
their customers.  Furthermore, there could be changes in the regulatory environment that would impair the ability of our utility 
subsidiaries to recover costs historically collected from their customers, or these factors could cause the operating utilities to exceed 
commitments made regarding cost caps and result in less than full recovery. Overall, management currently believes prudently 
incurred costs are generally recoverable given the existing regulatory mechanisms in place. 

Adverse regulatory rulings or the imposition of additional regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and 
hence could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations, including debt payments and the payment of 
dividends on our common stock.

Any reductions in our credit ratings could increase our financing costs and the cost of maintaining certain contractual 
relationships.

We cannot be assured that any of our current ratings or our subsidiaries’ ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time, or 
that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency.  Significant events including a major disallowance of costs, 
significantly lower returns on equity or equity ratios or impacts of tax policy changes, among others, may impact our cash flows and 
credit metrics, potentially resulting in a change in our credit ratings.  In addition, our credit ratings may change as a result of the 
differing methodologies or change in the methodologies used by the various rating agencies.  Any downgrade could lead to higher 
borrowing costs and could impact our ability to access capital markets.  Also, our utility subsidiaries may enter into certain 
procurement and derivative contracts that require the posting of collateral or settlement of applicable contracts if credit ratings fall 
below investment grade.

We are subject to capital market and interest rate risks.

Utility operations require significant capital investment.  As a result, we frequently need to access capital markets.  Any disruption in 
capital markets could have a material impact on our ability to fund our operations.  Capital markets are global in nature and are 
impacted by numerous issues and events throughout the world economy.  Capital market disruption events and resulting broad 
financial market distress could prevent us from issuing short-term commercial paper, issuing new securities or cause us to issue 
securities with less than ideal terms and conditions, such as higher interest rates.

Higher interest rates on short-term borrowings with variable interest rates could also have an adverse effect on our operating results.  
Changes in interest rates may also impact the fair value of the debt securities in the nuclear decommissioning fund and master pension 
trust, as well as our ability to earn a return on short-term investments of excess cash.

35

We are subject to credit risks.

Credit risk includes the risk that our customers will not pay their bills, which may lead to a reduction in liquidity and an increase in 
bad debt expense.  Credit risk is comprised of numerous factors including the price of products and services provided, the overall 
economy and local economies in the geographic areas we serve, including local unemployment rates.

Credit risk also includes the risk that various counterparties that owe us money or product will become insolvent and/or breach their 
obligations.  Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements.  
In that event, our financial results could be adversely affected and we could incur losses.

We may at times have direct credit exposure in our short-term wholesale and commodity trading activity to various financial 
institutions trading for their own accounts or issuing collateral support on behalf of other counterparties.  We may also have some 
indirect credit exposure due to participation in organized markets, such as CAISO, SPP, PJM, MISO and ERCOT, in which any credit 
losses are socialized to all market participants.

We do have additional indirect credit exposures to various domestic and foreign financial institutions in the form of letters of credit 
provided as security by power suppliers under various long-term physical purchased power contracts.  If any of the credit ratings of 
the letter of credit issuers were to drop below the designated investment grade rating stipulated in the underlying long-term purchased 
power contracts, the supplier would need to replace that security with an acceptable substitute.  If the security were not replaced, the 
party could be in technical default under the contract, which would enable us to exercise our contractual rights.

Increasing costs associated with our defined benefit retirement plans and other employee benefits may adversely affect our results 
of operations, financial position or liquidity.

We have defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that cover most of our employees.  Assumptions related to future costs, 
return on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions, including mortality tables, have a significant impact on our 
funding requirements related to these plans.  These estimates and assumptions may change based on economic conditions, actual stock 
and bond market performance, changes in interest rates and changes in governmental regulations.  In addition, the Pension Protection 
Act of 2006 changed the minimum funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans with modifications that allowed additional 
flexibility in the timing of contributions.  Therefore, our funding requirements and related contributions may change in the future.  
Also, the payout of a significant percentage of pension plan liabilities in a single year due to high retirements or employees leaving 
Xcel Energy could trigger settlement accounting and could require Xcel Energy to recognize material incremental pension expense 
related to unrecognized plan losses in the year these liabilities are paid.

Increasing costs associated with health care plans may adversely affect our results of operations.

Our self-insured costs of health care benefits for eligible employees have increased in recent years.  Increasing levels of large 
individual health care claims and overall health care claims could have an adverse impact on our operating results, financial position 
and liquidity.  We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs related to health care plans for our employees and former 
employees, will continue to rise.  Changes in industry standards utilized by management in key assumptions (e.g., mortality tables) 
could have a significant impact on future liabilities and benefit costs.  Legislation related to health care could also significantly change 
our benefit programs and costs.

We must rely on cash from our subsidiaries to make dividend payments.

We are a holding company and our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets.  Substantially all of our operations are 
conducted by our subsidiaries.  Consequently, our operating cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and pay dividends 
depends upon the operating cash flows of our subsidiaries and the payment of dividends to us.  Our subsidiaries are separate legal 
entities that have no obligation to pay any amounts due pursuant to our obligations or to make any funds available for dividends on 
our common stock.  In addition, each subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to us depends on any statutory and/or contractual 
restrictions which may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of equity ratios, working capital or assets.  Also, our utility 
subsidiaries are regulated by various state utility commissions, which possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of the utility 
customers are being met.

If our utility subsidiaries were to cease making dividend payments, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or otherwise 
meet our financial obligations could be adversely affected.

36

Federal tax law may significantly impact our business.

Xcel Energy’s utility subsidiaries collect through regulated rates its estimated federal, state and local tax payments.  There are a 
number of provisions in federal tax law designed to incentivize capital investments which have benefited our customers by keeping 
our utility subsidiaries’ rates lower than rates calculated without such provisions.  Examples include the use of accelerated 
depreciation for most of our capital investments, PTCs for wind energy, ITCs for solar energy and R&E tax credits and deductions.  
Changes to federal tax law may benefit or adversely affect our earnings and customer costs.  Changes to tax depreciable lives and the 
value of various tax credits could change the economics of resources and our resource selections.  While regulation allows us to 
incorporate changes in tax law into the rate-setting process, there could be timing delays before regulated rates provide for realization 
of the tax changes in revenues.  In addition, certain IRS tax policies such as the requirement to utilize normalization may impact our 
ability to economically deliver certain types of resources relative to market prices. 

Operational Risks

Our natural gas and electric transmission and distribution operations involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and 
other operating risks and costs.

Our natural gas transmission and distribution activities include a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, 
explosions and mechanical problems, which could cause substantial financial losses.  Our electric transmission and distribution 
activities also include inherent hazards and operating risks such as contact, fire and widespread outages which could cause substantial 
financial losses.  In addition, these natural gas and electric risks could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, 
environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us.  We maintain insurance against some, but not all, 
of these risks and losses.

The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material effect on our financial position and results 
of operations.  For our natural gas transmission or distribution lines located near populated areas, the level of potential damages 
resulting from these risks is greater.

Additionally, for natural gas the operating or other costs that may be required in order to comply with potential new regulations, 
including the Pipeline Safety Act, could be significant. The Pipeline Safety Act requires verification of pipeline infrastructure records 
by pipeline owners and operators to confirm the maximum allowable operating pressure of lines located in high consequence areas or 
more-densely populated areas.  We have programs in place to comply with the Pipeline Safety Act and for systematic infrastructure 
monitoring and renewal over time.  A significant incident could increase regulatory scrutiny and result in penalties and higher costs of 
operations.

Our utility operations are subject to long-term planning risks.

Most electric utility investments are long-lived and are planned to be used for decades.  Transmission and generation investments 
typically have long lead times, and therefore are planned well in advance of when they are brought in-service subject to long-term 
resource plans.  These plans are based on numerous assumptions over the planning horizon such as: sales growth, customer usage, 
commodity prices, economic activity, costs, regulatory mechanisms, customer behavior, available technology and public policy.  The 
electric utility sector is undergoing a period of significant change.  For example, public policy has driven increases in appliance and 
lighting efficiency and energy efficient buildings, wider adoption and lower cost of renewable generation and distributed generation, 
including community solar gardens and customer-sited solar, shifts away from coal generation to decrease CO2 emissions and 
increasing use of natural gas in electric generation driven by lower natural gas prices.  Over time, customer adoption of these 
technologies and increased energy efficiency could result in excess transmission and generation resources as well as stranded costs if 
Xcel Energy is not able to fully recover the costs and investments.  These changes also introduce additional uncertainty into long-term 
planning which gives rise to a risk that the magnitude and timing of resource additions and growth in customer demand may not 
coincide, and that the preference for the types of additions may change from planning to execution.  In addition, we are also subject to 
longer-term availability of the natural resource inputs such as coal, natural gas, uranium and water to cool our facilities.  Lack of 
availability of these resources could jeopardize long-term operations of our facilities or make them uneconomic to operate.   

37

The resource plans reviewed and approved by our state regulators assume continuation of the traditional utility cost of service model 
under which utility costs are recovered from customers as they receive the benefit of service.  Xcel Energy is engaged in significant 
and ongoing infrastructure investment programs to accommodate renewable distributed generation and to maintain high system 
reliability. Changing customer expectations and changing technologies are requiring significant investments in advanced grid 
infrastructure. This also increases the exposure to potential outdating of technologies and the resultant risks. Xcel Energy is also 
investing in renewable and natural gas-fired generation to reduce our CO2 emissions profile.  The inability of coal mining companies 
to attract capital could disrupt longer-term supplies.  Early plant retirements that may result from these changes could expose us to 
premature financial obligations, which could result in less than full recovery of all remaining costs.  Both decreasing use per customer 
driven by appliance and lighting efficiency and the availability of cost-effective distributed generation puts downward pressure on 
load growth.  This could lead to under recovery of costs, excess resources to meet customer demand and increases in electric rates.  
Finally, multiple states served by a single system may not agree as to the appropriate resource mix and the differing views may lead to 
costs incurred to comply with one jurisdiction that are not recoverable across all of the jurisdictions served by the same assets. 

Our subsidiary, NSP-Minnesota, is subject to the risks of nuclear generation.

NSP-Minnesota’s two nuclear stations, PI and Monticello, subject it to the risks of nuclear generation, which include:

•  The risks associated with use of radioactive material in the production of energy, the management, handling, storage and 

disposal and the current lack of a long-term disposal solution for radioactive materials;

•  Limitations on the amounts and types of insurance available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear 

operations, as well as obligations to contribute to an insurance pool in the event of damages at a covered U.S. reactor; and
•  Uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their 
licensed lives.  For example, similar to pensions, interest rate and other assumptions regarding decommissioning costs may 
change based on economic conditions and changes in the expected life of the asset may cause our funding obligations to 
change.

The NRC has authority to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities.  In the 
event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down a unit until compliance is achieved.  Revised 
NRC safety requirements could necessitate substantial capital expenditures or a substantial increase in operating expenses.  In 
addition, the Institute for Nuclear Power Operations reviews NSP-Minnesota’s nuclear operations and nuclear generation facilities.  
Compliance with the Institute for Nuclear Power Operations’ recommendations could result in substantial capital expenditures or a 
substantial increase in operating expenses.

If an incident did occur, it could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.  Furthermore, the non-
compliance of other nuclear facilities operators or the occurrence of a serious nuclear incident at other facilities could result in 
increased regulation of the industry, which could then increase NSP-Minnesota’s compliance costs and impact the results of operations 
of its facilities.

NSP-Wisconsin’s production and transmission system is operated on an integrated basis with NSP-Minnesota’s production and 
transmission system, and NSP-Wisconsin may be subject to risks associated with NSP-Minnesota’s nuclear generation.

We are subject to commodity risks and other risks associated with energy markets and energy production.

We engage in wholesale sales and purchases of electric capacity, energy and energy-related products as well as natural gas.  In many 
markets in which we operate, emission allowances and/or renewable energy credits are also needed to comply with various statutes 
and commission rulings associated with energy transactions.  As a result we are subject to market supply and commodity price risk.  
Commodity price changes can affect the value of our commodity trading derivatives.  We mark certain derivatives to estimated fair 
market value on a daily basis (mark-to-market accounting).  Actual settlements can vary significantly from estimated fair values 
recorded, and significant changes from the assumptions underlying our fair value estimates could cause earnings variability.

If we encounter market supply shortages or our suppliers are otherwise unable to meet their contractual obligations, we may be unable 
to fulfill our contractual obligations to our customers at previously anticipated costs.  Therefore, a significant disruption could cause us 
to seek alternative supply services at potentially higher costs or suffer increased liability for unfulfilled contractual obligations.  Any 
significantly higher energy or fuel costs relative to corresponding sales commitments could have a negative impact on our cash flows 
and potentially result in economic losses.  Potential market supply shortages may not be fully resolved through alternative supply 
sources and may cause short-term disruptions in our ability to provide electric and/or natural gas services to our customers.  The 
impact of these cost and reliability issues vary in magnitude for each operating subsidiary depending upon unique operating conditions 
such as generation fuels mix, availability of water for cooling, availability of fuel transportation including rail shipments of coal, 
electric generation capacity, transmission, natural gas pipeline capacity, etc.  Failure to provide service due to disruptions could also 
result in fines, penalties or cost disallowances through the regulatory process. 

38

Public Policy Risks

We may be subject to legislative and regulatory responses to climate change, with which compliance could be difficult and costly.

Increased public awareness and concern regarding climate change may result in more state, regional and/or federal requirements to 
reduce or mitigate the effects of GHGs.  Legislative and regulatory responses related to climate change and new interpretations of 
existing laws through climate change litigation create financial risk as our electric generating facilities may be subject to additional 
regulation at either the state or federal level in the future. Such regulations could impose substantial costs on our system.  International 
agreements could have an impact to the extent they lead to future federal or state regulations. 

In 2015, the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change reached consensus among 
190 nations on an agreement (the Paris Agreement) that establishes a framework for GHG mitigation actions by all countries (“nationally 
determined contributions”), with a goal of holding the increase in global average temperature to below 2o Celsius above pre-industrial 
levels and an aspiration to limit the increase to 1.5o Celsius.  If implemented, the Paris Agreement could result in future additional GHG 
reductions in the United States.  On June 21, 2017, President Trump announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Agreement.  
Such a withdrawal, under terms of the Agreement, becomes effective in four years.  Many state and local government entities, however, 
have indicated that they intend to pursue GHG mitigation with a goal of achieving the GHG reductions in the United States anticipated 
by the Paris Agreement.

We have been, and in the future may be, subject to climate change lawsuits.  An adverse outcome in any of these cases could require 
substantial capital expenditures and could possibly require payment of substantial penalties or damages.  Defense costs associated with 
such litigation can also be significant.  Such payments or expenditures could affect results of operations, cash flows and financial 
condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

Some states and localities have indicated a desire to continue to pursue climate policies even in the absence of federal mandates.  All 
of the steps that Xcel Energy has taken to date to reduce GHG emissions, including energy efficiency measures, adding renewable 
generation or retiring or converting coal plants to natural gas, occurred under state-endorsed resource plans, renewable energy 
standards and other state policies.  While those actions likely would have put Xcel Energy in a good position to meet federal standards 
under the CPP or the Paris Agreement, repeal of these policies would not impact those state-endorsed actions and plans. 
Whether under state or federal programs, an important factor is our ability to recover the costs incurred to comply with any regulatory 
requirements in a timely manner.  If our regulators do not allow us to recover all or a part of the cost of capital investment or the O&M 
costs incurred to comply with the mandates, it could have a material effect on our results of operations.

Increased risks of regulatory penalties could negatively impact our business.

The Energy Act increased civil penalty authority for violation of FERC statutes, rules and orders.  The FERC can now impose 
penalties of up to $1.2 million per violation per day, particularly as it relates to energy trading activities for both electricity and natural 
gas.  Under statute, the FERC can adjust penalties for inflation.  In addition, NERC electric reliability standards and critical 
infrastructure protection requirements are mandatory and subject to potential financial penalties by regional entities, the NERC or the 
FERC for violations.  Additionally, the PHMSA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other federal agencies also 
have penalty authority.  In the event of serious incidents, these agencies have become more active in pursuing penalties.  Some states 
have the authority to impose substantial penalties in the event of non-compliance.  If a serious reliability or safety incident did occur, it 
could have a material effect on our operations or financial results. 

Macroeconomic Risks

Economic conditions impact our business.

Our operations are affected by local, national and worldwide economic conditions.  Growth in our customer base is correlated with 
economic conditions.  While the number of customers is growing, sales growth is relatively modest due to an increased focus on 
energy efficiency including federal standards for appliance and lighting efficiency and distributed generation, primarily solar PV.  
Instability in the financial markets also may affect the cost of capital and our ability to raise capital, which is discussed in the capital 
market risk factor section above.

Economic conditions may be impacted by insufficient financial sector liquidity leading to potential increased unemployment, which 
may impact customers’ ability to pay timely, increase customer bankruptcies, and may lead to increased bad debt. 

39

Further, worldwide economic activity has an impact on the demand for basic commodities needed for utility infrastructure, such as 
steel, copper, aluminum, etc., which may impact our ability to acquire sufficient supplies. We operate in a capital intensive industry, 
and federal policy on trade could significantly impact the costs of the materials we use.  We may be at risk for higher than anticipated 
inflation both with respect to our own workforce, as well as our materials and labor that we contract for with others.  There may be 
delays before these higher costs can be recovered in rates. 

Our operations could be impacted by war, acts of terrorism, threats of terrorism or disruptions in normal operating conditions due 
to localized or regional events.

Our generation plants, fuel storage facilities, transmission and distribution facilities and information and control systems may be 
targets of terrorist activities.  Any such disruption could impact operations or result in a decrease in revenues and additional costs to 
repair and insure our assets.  These disruptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  The 
potential for terrorism has subjected our operations to increased risks and could have a material effect on our business.  We have 
already incurred increased costs for security and capital expenditures in response to these risks.  In addition, we may experience 
additional capital and operating costs to implement security for our plants, including our nuclear power plants under the NRC’s design 
basis threat requirements.  We have also already incurred increased costs for compliance with NERC reliability standards associated 
with critical infrastructure protection.  In addition, we may experience additional capital and operating costs to comply with the NERC 
critical infrastructure protection standards as they are implemented and clarified.

The insurance industry has also been affected by these events and the availability of insurance may decrease.  In addition, the 
insurance we are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums and more restrictive policy terms.

A disruption of the regional electric transmission grid, interstate natural gas pipeline infrastructure or other fuel sources, could 
negatively impact our business, as well as our brand and reputation.  Because our generation, the transmission systems and local 
natural gas distribution companies are part of an interconnected system, we face the risk of possible loss of business due to a 
disruption caused by the actions of a neighboring utility or an event (such as severe storm, severe temperature extremes, wildfires, 
solar storms, generator or transmission facility outage, breakdown or failure of equipment, pipeline rupture, railroad disruption, 
operator error, sudden and significant increase or decrease in wind generation or any disruption of work force such as may be caused 
by flu or other epidemic) within our operating systems or on a neighboring system. Any such disruption could result in a significant 
decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair assets, which could have a material impact on our financial condition 
and results.

The degree to which we are able to maintain day-to-day operations in response to unforeseen events will in part determine the 
financial impact of certain events on our financial condition and results.  It is difficult to predict the magnitude of such events and 
associated impacts.

A cyber incident or cyber security breach could have a material effect on our business.

We operate in an industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology and control systems and 
network infrastructure.  In addition, we use our systems and infrastructure to create, collect, use, disclose, store, dispose of and 
otherwise process sensitive information, including company data, customer energy usage data, and personal information regarding 
customers, employees and their dependents, contractors, shareholders and other individuals.

Our generation, transmission, distribution and fuel storage facilities, information technology systems and other infrastructure or 
physical assets, as well as the information processed in our systems (such as information about our customers, employees, operations, 
infrastructure and assets) could be affected by cyber security incidents, including those caused by human error.  Our industry has 
begun to see an increased volume and sophistication of cyber security incidents from international activist organizations, Nation States 
and individuals.  Cyber security incidents could harm our businesses by limiting our generating, transmitting and distributing 
capabilities, delaying our development and construction of new facilities or capital improvement projects to existing facilities, 
disrupting our customer operations or exposing us to liability.  Our generation, transmission systems and natural gas pipelines are part 
of an interconnected system.  Therefore, a disruption caused by the impact of a cyber security incident of the regional electric 
transmission grid, natural gas pipeline infrastructure or other fuel sources of our third party service providers’ operations, could also 
negatively impact our business.  Our supply chain for procurement of digital equipment may expose software or hardware to these 
risks and could result in a breach or significant costs of remediation.  In addition, such an event would likely receive regulatory 
scrutiny at both the federal and state level.  We are unable to quantify the potential impact of cyber security threats or subsequent 
related actions.  These potential cyber security incidents and corresponding regulatory action could result in a material decrease in 
revenues and may cause significant additional costs (e.g., penalties, third party claims, repairs, insurance or compliance) and 
potentially disrupt our supply and markets for natural gas, oil and other fuels.

40

We maintain security measures designed to protect our information technology and control systems, network infrastructure and other 
assets.  However, these assets and the information they process may be vulnerable to cyber security incidents, including the resulting 
disability, or failures of assets or unauthorized access to assets or information.  If our technology systems were to fail or be breached, 
or those of our third-party service providers, we may be unable to fulfill critical business functions, including effectively maintaining 
certain internal controls over financial reporting.  We are unable to quantify the potential impact of cyber security incidents on our 
business, our brand, and our reputation. The cyber security threat is dynamic and evolves continually, and our efforts to prioritize 
network monitoring may not be effective given the constant changes to threat vulnerability. 

Rising energy prices could negatively impact our business.

Although commodity prices are currently relatively low, if fuel costs increase, customer demand could decline and bad debt expense 
may rise, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.  While we have fuel clause recovery mechanisms in most of 
our states, higher fuel costs could significantly impact our results of operations if costs are not recovered.  Delays in the timing of the 
collection of fuel cost recoveries as compared with expenditures for fuel purchases could have an impact on our cash flows.  Low fuel 
costs could have a positive impact on sales, though low oil and natural gas prices could negatively impact oil and gas production 
activities and subsequently our sales volumes and revenue.  We are unable to predict future prices or the ultimate impact of such prices 
on our results of operations or cash flows.

Our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be adversely affected by milder weather.

Our electric and natural gas utility businesses are seasonal, and weather patterns can have a material impact on our operating 
performance.  Demand for electricity is often greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating.  Because 
natural gas is heavily used for residential and commercial heating, the demand depends heavily upon weather patterns throughout our 
service territory, and a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating 
season.  Accordingly, our operations have historically generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the 
winter and cooler in the summer.  Unusually mild winters and summers could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results 
of operations, or cash flows.

Our operations use third party contractors in addition to employees to perform periodic and on-going work.

We rely on third party contractors with specific qualifications to perform work both for ongoing operations and maintenance and for 
capital construction. We have contractual arrangements with these contractors which typically include performance standards, progress 
payments, insurance requirements and security for performance.  Cyber security breaches seen in the news have at times exploited 
third party equipment or software in order to gain access.  Poor vendor performance could impact on going operations, restoration 
operations, our reputation and could introduce financial risk or risks of fines.

Item 3 — Legal Proceedings

Xcel Energy is involved in various litigation matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business.  The 
assessment of whether a loss is probable or is a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often 
involves a series of complex judgments about future events.  Management maintains accruals for such losses that are probable of 
being incurred and subject to reasonable estimation.  Management is sometimes unable to estimate an amount or range of a reasonably 
possible loss in certain situations, including but not limited to when (1) the damages sought are indeterminate, (2) the proceedings are 
in the early stages, or (3) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories.  In such cases, there is considerable uncertainty 
regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss.

Item 7 and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of proceedings involving utility rates and other regulatory 
matters.

Forward-Looking Statements

Except for the historical statements contained in this report, the matters discussed herein are forward-looking statements that are 
subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions.  Such forward-looking statements, including the 2018 EPS guidance, the 
TCJA’s impact to Xcel Energy and its customers, long-term earnings per share and dividend growth rate, as well as assumptions and 
other statements identified in this document by the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” 
“objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “possible,” “potential,” “should,” “will,” “would” and similar expressions.  Actual results 
may vary materially.  Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we expressly disclaim any obligation 
to update any forward-looking information.  The following factors, in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on 
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2017 (including the items described under Factors Affecting Results of Operations; and 
the other risk factors listed from time to time by Xcel Energy Inc. in reports filed with the SEC, including “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of 
this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Exhibit 99.01 hereto), could cause actual results to differ materially from management 
expectations as suggested by such forward-looking information:  general economic conditions, including inflation rates, monetary 
fluctuations and their impact on capital expenditures and the ability of Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries to obtain financing on 
favorable terms; business conditions in the energy industry, including the risk of a slow down in the U.S. economy or delay in growth, 
recovery, trade, fiscal, taxation and environmental policies in areas where Xcel Energy has a financial interest; customer business 
conditions; actions of credit rating agencies; competitive factors including the extent and timing of the entry of additional competition 
in the markets served by Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries; unusual weather; effects of geopolitical events, including war and acts of 
terrorism; cyber security threats and data security breaches; state, federal and foreign legislative and regulatory initiatives that affect 
cost and investment recovery, have an impact on rates or have an impact on asset operation or ownership or impose environmental 
compliance conditions; structures that affect the speed and degree to which competition enters the electric and natural gas markets; 
costs and other effects of legal and administrative proceedings, settlements, investigations and claims; financial or regulatory 
accounting policies imposed by regulatory bodies; outcomes of regulatory proceedings; availability or cost of capital; and employee 
work force factors.

Management’s Strategic Priorities

Xcel Energy’s vision is to be the preferred and trusted provider of the energy our customers need. We continually evolve our business 
to meet the changing needs of our customers, investors and policymakers.  We strive to provide our investors an attractive value 
proposition and our customers with safe, clean and reliable energy services at a competitive price.  This mission is enabled via three 
key strategic priorities:

•  Lead the clean energy transition;
•  Enhance the customer experience; and
•  Keep bills low.

Successful execution of our strategic objectives should allow Xcel Energy to continue to deliver a competitive total return for our 
shareholders.  Below is a discussion of these objectives.

Lead the clean energy transition

For more than a decade, we have managed the risk of climate change and increasing customer demand for renewable energy through a 
clean energy strategy that consistently reduces carbon emissions and transitions our operations for the future.  As a result, we have 
successfully reduced our carbon emissions by 35 percent from 2005 to 2017. We expect to reduce our carbon footprint by 45 percent 
by 2021 and by 60 percent by 2030 (over 2005 levels).

Our service territories benefit from the geographic concentration of favorable renewable resources.  Strong wind and high solar 
irradiance yield high generation capacity factors, which lowers the cost of these resources.  The combination of high capacity factors, 
grid options from transmission investment and market operations, improved supply chain, technological improvements and the 
extension of the renewable tax credits translates into low renewable energy costs for our customers.  As a result, we are able to invest 
in renewable generation, in which the capital costs are largely or completely offset by fuel savings.  This provides us the opportunity 
to lower the emission profile of our generation fleet, grow our renewable portfolio and provide significant fuel savings to our 
customers.  We call this our “Steel for Fuel” strategy.  

We are transitioning how we produce, deliver and encourage the efficient use of energy through four primary mechanisms:

• 
Increasing the use of affordable renewable energy;
•  Offering energy efficiency programs for customers;
•  Retiring or repowering coals units and modernizing our generating plants; and
•  Advancing power grid capabilities.

48

We have announced ambitious plans to add 3,680 MW of wind energy on our system by 2021.  This includes:

•  The 600 MW Rush Creek project in Colorado that is under construction and will be owned entirely by Xcel Energy;
•  The 1,550 MW of wind generation in Minnesota and the Dakotas.  This project has been approved by the MPUC and will 

include 1,150 MW of ownership and 400 MW of PPAs;

•  The proposed 1,230 MW of wind projects in Texas and New Mexico, which includes 1,000 MW of ownership and 230 MW 

of PPAs; and

•  The proposed 300 MW Dakota Range wind project in South Dakota.

In addition, the proposed CEP encompasses the retirement of 660 MW from two coal-fired units at Comanche and the potential 
addition of up to 1,000 MW of wind, 700 MW of solar and 700 MW of natural gas and/or storage.  

Enhance the customer experience

The utility landscape is changing, and we must continue to thoughtfully anticipate and address the future needs of our stakeholders, 
including our customers, policymakers, employees and shareholders.  Adapting to this changing environment is critical to our long-
term success.  Our customers expect to have choices, and we are committed to providing options and solutions that they want and 
value at a competitive price.  Our continued investment in clean energy is an example of this commitment to our customers.  
Environmental stewardship remains foundational to Xcel Energy and our desire is to more broadly impact our customers and 
communities while creating shareholder value.  

We will continue to expand our production of renewable energy, including wind and solar alternatives, and further develop and 
promote DSM, conservation and renewable programs.  We are also in the process of transforming our transmission and distribution 
systems to accommodate increased levels of renewables, distributed energy resources and corresponding data growth, while 
maintaining high levels of reliability and security and keeping customer bills affordable.  Finally, we are improving our 
communications to enable customers to interact with us in the way they prefer.

Keep bills low

Xcel Energy is very focused on our customers and the impact our actions have on the bill.  Our objective is to keep total bill 
increases at or below the rate of inflation so our prices remain competitive relative to alternatives.  We expect to continue to 
keep our customer bills low by executing on our Steel for Fuel plan, controlling O&M costs and promoting energy efficiency 
and conservation.

Xcel Energy is working to keep O&M expense relatively flat without compromising reliability or safety.  We intend to accomplish this 
objective by continually improving our processes, leveraging technology, proactively managing risk and maintaining a workforce that 
is prepared to meet the needs of our business today and tomorrow.  As a result of these actions, Xcel Energy’s 2017 O&M was lower 
than 2014 levels.  

Provide a competitive total return to investors and maintain strong investment grade credit rating 

Through our disciplined approach to business growth, financial investment, operations and safety, we plan to:

•  Deliver long-term annual EPS growth of five percent to six percent;
•  Deliver annual dividend increases of five percent to seven percent;
•  Target a dividend payout ratio of 60 to 70 percent of annual ongoing EPS; and
•  Maintain senior secured debt credit ratings in the A range and senior unsecured debt credit ratings in the BBB+ to A range.

We have consistently achieved our financial objectives, meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance range for thirteen consecutive 
years, and we believe we are positioned to continue to deliver on our value proposition.  Our ongoing earnings have grown 
approximately 5.9 percent and our dividend has grown approximately 4.4 percent annually from 2005 through 2017.  In addition, our 
current senior unsecured debt credit ratings for Xcel Energy and its utility subsidiaries are in the BBB+ to A range, while our secured 
operating company debt ratings are in the A range.  Although the TCJA placed pressure on our credit metrics, we are taking steps to 
retain the health of our credit ratings.

49

Responsible by nature

We understand the important role we play as a member of society:  meeting a basic need, taking great care of the investments made in 
our company and engaging with our communities in ways that helps them thrive.  We believe energy is a critical service for all people; 
one that enhances quality of life and enables economic progress.  We know our investors and their customers are putting their faith in 
us to create economic value for them and their families over the long term, and we will continue to prepare for tomorrow to retain 
their trust in us.  We exist because of the families, businesses and cities that rely on us, and we are privileged to serve them.  We see 
our success not simply as a measure of profit but also as our broader impact on the public good.

The following discussion and analysis by management focuses on those factors that had a material effect on Xcel Energy’s financial 
condition, results of operations and cash flows during the periods presented, or are expected to have a material impact in the future.  It 
should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial 
statements.
 
The only common equity securities that are publicly traded are common shares of Xcel Energy Inc.  The diluted earnings and EPS of 
each subsidiary as well as the ROE of each subsidiary discussed below do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and 
liabilities allocated to such subsidiary, but rather represent a direct interest in our assets and liabilities as a whole.  Ongoing diluted 
EPS and ongoing ROE for Xcel Energy and by subsidiary are financial measures not recognized under GAAP.  Ongoing diluted EPS 
is calculated by dividing the net income or loss attributable to the controlling interest of each subsidiary, adjusted for certain 
nonrecurring items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the period.  Ongoing ROE 
is calculated by dividing the net income or loss attributable to the controlling interest of Xcel Energy or each subsidiary, adjusted for 
certain nonrecurring items, by each entity’s average common stockholders’ or stockholder’s equity.  We use these non-GAAP financial 
measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results.  We believe these measurements are useful to investors to evaluate the 
actual and projected financial performance and contribution of our subsidiaries.  These non-GAAP financial measures should not be 
considered as alternatives to measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.

Xcel Energy’s management believes that ongoing earnings provide a meaningful comparison of earnings results and is representative 
of Xcel Energy’s fundamental core earnings power.  Xcel Energy’s management uses ongoing earnings internally for financial 
planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors, in determining whether performance targets are met for 
performance-based compensation and when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors.

2017 Adjustment to GAAP Earnings

Impact of the TCJA — Xcel Energy recognized an estimated one-time, non-cash, income tax expense of approximately $23 million in 
the fourth quarter of 2017 for net excess deferred tax assets which may not be recovered from customers or not attributable to 
regulated operations, increased valuation allowances, etc. due to the enactment of the TCJA in December 2017.  The income tax 
expense associated with the TCJA enactment has been excluded from Xcel Energy’s 2017 ongoing earnings, given the non-recurring 
nature of the TCJA’s broad and sweeping reform of the IRC.  See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further 
discussion.

2015 Adjustment to GAAP Earnings

Loss on Monticello LCM/EPU Project — In March 2015, the MPUC approved full recovery, including a return, on $415 million of 
the project costs, inclusive of AFUDC, but only allowed recovery of the remaining $333 million of costs with no return on this portion 
of the investment for 2015 and beyond.  As a result of this decision, Xcel Energy recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $129 
million, or $79 million net of tax, in the first quarter of 2015.  See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further 
discussion.

Earnings Adjusted for Certain Items

2017 Comparison with 2016

Xcel Energy — GAAP earnings increased $0.04 per share for 2017.  Ongoing earnings increased $0.09 per share, excluding the 
impact of the TCJA.  Earnings were higher as a result of increased electric and natural gas margins to recover infrastructure 
investments, reduced O&M expenses, a lower ETR and higher AFUDC.  These positive factors were partially offset by increased 
depreciation expense, interest charges and property taxes.

NSP-Minnesota — GAAP earnings were flat for 2017.  Ongoing earnings increased $0.05 per share, excluding the impact of the 
TCJA.  The change reflects higher electric margins driven by a 2017 Minnesota rate increase as well as increased gas margins, a lower 
ETR and reduced O&M expenses.  The decrease in the ETR is largely driven by resolution of IRS appeals/audits and an increase in 
wind PTCs, which are flowed back to customers and reduce electric margin.  Lower O&M expenses primarily relate to reduced 
expenses for nuclear refueling outages and overhauls at generation facilities.  These positive factors were partially offset by higher 
depreciation expense due to increased invested capital as well as prior year amortization of Minnesota’s excess depreciation reserve 
and higher property taxes.
 
PSCo — GAAP earnings increased $0.06 per share for 2017.  Ongoing earnings increased $0.03 per share, excluding the impact of the 
TCJA.  The increase in earnings was driven by higher electric and natural gas margins, increased AFUDC primarily related to the 
Rush Creek wind project, a decrease in O&M expenses (timing of generation outages) and a lower ETR, partially offset by higher 
depreciation expense, interest charges and the impact of unfavorable weather.
 
SPS — GAAP earnings increased $0.01 per share for 2017.  Ongoing earnings were flat, excluding the impact of the TCJA.  Rate 
increases in Texas and New Mexico and a lower ETR were offset by higher depreciation expense (representing continued investment), 
O&M expenses (including the prior year deferrals associated with the Texas 2016 rate case), property taxes and the impact of 
unfavorable weather.
 
NSP-Wisconsin — GAAP and ongoing earnings increased $0.02 per share for 2017.  The change in ongoing earnings was driven by a 
rise in electric and natural gas rates, partially offset by additional depreciation expense related to continued transmission and 
distribution investments and higher O&M expenses.
 
Equity earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries — GAAP earnings increased $0.02 per share for 2017.  Ongoing earnings of 
unconsolidated subsidiaries decreased $0.02 per share, excluding the impact of the TCJA.  The decline primarily related to lower 
revenues due to lower rates at our WYCO subsidiary, which develops and leases natural gas pipelines, storage and compression 
facilities.

2016 Comparison with 2015

Xcel Energy — 2016 GAAP earnings increased due to the 2015 loss on Monticello LCM/EPU project; see Note 12 for further 
information.  Ongoing earnings increased $0.12 per share (GAAP earnings increased $0.28 per share).  Increases in electric and 
natural gas margins were primarily driven by higher rates and riders across various jurisdictions to recover our capital investments and 
the favorable impact of weather as compared with the previous year.  These positive factors and a lower ETR were partially offset by 
higher depreciation, interest charges and property taxes.

NSP-Minnesota — 2016 GAAP earnings increased due to the 2015 loss on Monticello LCM/EPU project; see Note 12 for further 
information.  Ongoing earnings increased $0.11 per share due to the following: higher electric margins primarily driven by an interim 
electric rate increase in Minnesota (net of estimated provision for refund); non-fuel riders; the favorable impact of weather; and a 
lower ETR.  These positive factors were partially offset by higher depreciation, O&M expenses, interest charges and property taxes.

PSCo — Earnings decreased $0.01 per share for 2016.  The positive impact of higher natural gas margins (primarily due to a rate 
increase), sales growth and a lower estimated electric earnings test refund, were more than offset by increased depreciation and 
interest charges. 

SPS — Earnings increased $0.05 per share for 2016.  Higher electric margins and lower O&M expenses were partially offset by an 
increase in depreciation and interest charges.

NSP-Wisconsin — Earnings decreased $0.01 per share for 2016.  The positive impact of higher electric margins (primarily driven by 
an electric rate increase) was more than offset by higher O&M expenses and depreciation.

Equity earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries — Earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries increased $0.01 per share in 2016 due to 
facility expansion and increased revenue at WYCO.

Xcel Energy Inc. and other — Xcel Energy Inc. and other includes financing costs at the holding company and other items.
The decrease in earnings was primarily related to higher long-term debt levels.

Statement of Income Analysis

The following discussion summarizes the items that affected the individual revenue and expense items reported in the consolidated 
statements of income.

Estimated Impact of Temperature Changes on Regulated Earnings — Unusually hot summers or cold winters increase electric and 
natural gas sales, while mild weather reduces electric and natural gas sales.  The estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on 
the number of customers, temperature variances and the amount of natural gas or electricity the average customer historically uses per 
degree of temperature.  Accordingly, deviations in weather from normal levels can affect Xcel Energy’s financial performance.

53

Degree-day or Temperature-Humidity Index (THI) data is used to estimate amounts of energy required to maintain comfortable indoor 
temperature levels based on each day’s average temperature and humidity.  Heating degree-days (HDD) is the measure of the variation 
in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature falls below 65° Fahrenheit.  Cooling degree-days (CDD) is 
the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature rises above 65° Fahrenheit.  
Each degree of temperature above 65° Fahrenheit is counted as one CDD, and each degree of temperature below 65° Fahrenheit is 
counted as one HDD.  In Xcel Energy’s more humid service territories, a THI is used in place of CDD, which adds a humidity factor 
to CDD.  HDD, CDD and THI are most likely to impact the usage of Xcel Energy’s residential and commercial customers.  Industrial 
customers are less sensitive to weather.

Normal weather conditions are defined as either the 20-year or 30-year average of actual historical weather conditions.  The historical 
period of time used in the calculation of normal weather differs by jurisdiction, based on regulatory practice.  To calculate the impact 
of weather on demand, a demand factor is applied to the weather impact on sales as defined above to derive the amount of demand 
associated with the weather impact.

The percentage increase (decrease) in normal and actual HDD, CDD and THI are provided in the following table:

HDD . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

  The estimated impact of the 2016 leap day is excluded to present a more comparable year-over-year presentation.  The estimated impact of the additional day of 

sales in 2016 was approximately 0.3 percent for retail electric and 0.5 percent for firm natural gas for the twelve months ended.

Weather-normalized 2017 Electric Sales Growth (Decline) (Excluding Leap Day) 

• 

•  NSP-Minnesota’s residential sales decrease was a result of lower use per customer, partially offset by customer growth. The 
decline in commercial and industrial (C&I) sales was largely due to reduced usage, which offset an increase in the number of 
customers.  Declines in services more than offset increased sales to large customers in manufacturing and energy industries.
PSCo’s decline in residential sales reflects lower use per customer, partially offset by customer additions.  C&I growth was 
mainly due to an increase in customers and higher use for large C&I customers that support the mining, oil and natural gas 
industries, partially offset by lower use for the small C&I class.     
SPS’ residential sales fell largely due to lower use per customer.  The increase in C&I sales reflects customer additions and 
greater use for large C&I customers driven by the oil and natural gas industry in the Permian Basin.

•  NSP-Wisconsin’s residential sales increase was primarily attributable to higher use per customer and customer additions. C&I 

• 

growth was largely due to higher use per customer and increased sales to customers in the sand mining industry and large 
customers in the energy and manufacturing industries.

Weather-normalized 2017 Natural Gas Sales Growth (Excluding Leap Day) 

•  Across service territories, higher natural gas sales reflect an increase in the number of customers, partially offset by a decline 

in customer use. 

Weather-normalized sales for 2018 are projected to be within a range of 0 percent to 0.5 percent over 2017 levels for retail electric 
customers and 0 percent to 0.5 percent below 2017 levels for firm natural gas customers.

Weather-normalized 2016 Electric Sales Growth (Decline) (Excluding Leap Day)

•  NSP-Minnesota’s residential sales decreased as a result of lower use per customer, partially offset by customer additions.  

C&I sales declined primarily as a result of lower use by customers in the manufacturing and service industries. 
PSCo’s residential growth reflects an increased number of customers.  The C&I decline was mainly due to lower sales to 
certain large customers in the manufacturing, mining, oil and gas industries.  The decline was partially offset by an increase 
in the number of small C&I customers.
SPS’ residential sales decline was primarily the result of lower use per customer, partially offset by an increased number of 
customers.  The increase in C&I sales was driven by energy sector expansion in the Southeastern New Mexico, Permian 
Basin area as well as greater use by agricultural customers.

•  NSP-Wisconsin’s residential sales decrease was primarily attributable to lower use per customer, partially offset by customer 
additions.  The C&I decline was largely due to reduced sales to small customers.  The overall decrease was partially offset by 
an increase in the number of C&I customers as well as greater use in the large C&I class for the oil and gas industries.  

Weather-normalized 2016 Natural Gas Sales Decline (Excluding Leap Day)

•  Across natural gas service territories, lower natural gas sales reflect a decline in customer use, partially offset by a slight 

increase in the number of customers.

Electric Revenues and Margin

Electric revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses are impacted by fluctuation in the price of natural gas, coal and uranium 
used in the generation of electricity.  However, these price fluctuations have minimal impact on electric margin due to fuel recovery 
mechanisms that recover fuel expenses.  The following table details the electric revenues and margin:

• 

•  Nuclear plant operations and amortization expenses are lower mostly due to reduced refueling outage costs and operating 

efficiencies;
Plant generation costs decreased as a result of lower expenses associated with planned outages and overhauls at a number of 
generation facilities; and

•  Employee benefits expense includes the recognition of an $8 million pension settlement expense in the fourth quarter of 

2017.

O&M expenses decreased $4 million, or 0.1 percent for 2016 compared with 2015.

Conservation and DSM Program Expenses — Conservation and DSM program expenses increased $28 million, or 11.4 percent, for 
2017 compared with 2016.  The increase was due to higher customer participation in electric conservation programs and recovery 
rates, mostly in Minnesota.  Conservation and DSM expenses, including incentives, are generally recovered in our major jurisdictions 
concurrently through riders and base rates.  Timing of recovery may not correspond to the period in which costs were incurred.

Conservation and DSM program expenses increased $20 million, or 8.9 percent, for 2016 compared with 2015. The increase is 
primarily attributable to more customer participation in DSM programs.

Depreciation and Amortization — Depreciation and amortization increased $176 million, or 13.5 percent, for 2017 compared with 
2016.  The increase was primarily due to capital investments and prior year amortization of the excess depreciation reserve in 
Minnesota.

Depreciation and amortization increased $179 million, or 15.9 percent, for 2016 compared with 2015.  The increase was primarily 
attributable to capital investments, including Pleasant Valley and Border Wind Farms, reduction of the excess depreciation reserve in 
Minnesota and recognition of the DOE settlement credits in 2015.

Taxes (Other Than Income Taxes) — Taxes (other than income taxes) increased $13 million, or 2.4 percent, for 2017 compared with 
2016.  The increase was primarily due to higher property taxes in Minnesota and Texas.

Taxes (other than income taxes) increased $20 million, or 4.0 percent, for 2016 compared with 2015.  The increase was primarily due 
to higher property taxes in Minnesota, excluding the impact of the tax deferral related to the Minnesota 2016 multi-year electric rate 
case.

AFUDC, Equity and Debt — AFUDC increased $23 million for 2017 compared with 2016.  The increase was primarily due to higher 
CWIP, particularly the Rush Creek wind project in Colorado.

AFUDC increased $5 million for 2016 compared with 2015.  The increase was primarily due to the expansion of transmission 
facilities and other capital expenditures.

Interest Charges — Interest charges increased $16 million, or 2.5 percent, for 2017 compared with 2016.  The increase was related to 
higher debt levels to fund capital investments, partially offset by refinancings at lower interest rates.

Interest charges increased $52 million, or 8.7 percent, for 2016 compared with 2015.  The increase was related to higher long-term 
debt levels to fund capital investments, partially offset by refinancings at lower interest rates.

59

Income Taxes — Income tax expense decreased $39 million for 2017 compared with 2016.  The decrease was primarily driven by 
increased wind PTCs, a net tax benefit related to the resolution of appeals/audits in 2017, an increase in research and experimentation 
credits, lower pretax earnings in 2017 and a rise in permanent plant-related adjustments.  PTCs are flowed back to customers and 
reduce electric margin.  The decrease was partially offset by the estimated one-time, non-cash, income tax expense recognized in the 
fourth quarter related to the TCJA.  The ETR was 32.1 percent for 2017 compared with 34.1 percent for 2016.  The lower ETR in 
2017 was primarily due to the adjustments referenced above.  Excluding the impact for the TCJA adjustment, the ETR would have 
been 30.7 percent for 2017.  See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

Income tax expense increased $38 million for 2016 compared with 2015.  The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to 
higher pretax earnings in 2016, partially offset by increased wind PTCs in 2016.  The ETR was 34.1 percent for 2016 compared with 
35.5 percent for 2015.  The lower ETR was primarily due to the wind PTCs in 2016.

Contribution to Xcel Energy’s GAAP diluted EPS

(a)  Amounts include gains or losses associated with sales of properties held by Eloigne.

Xcel Energy Inc.’s results include interest charges, which are incurred at Xcel Energy Inc. and are not directly assigned to individual 
subsidiaries.

Factors Affecting Results of Operations

Xcel Energy’s utility revenues depend on customer usage, which varies with weather conditions, general business conditions and the 
cost of energy services.  Various regulatory agencies approve the prices for electric and natural gas service within their respective 
jurisdictions and affect Xcel Energy’s ability to recover its costs from customers.  The historical and future trends of Xcel Energy’s 
operating results have been, and are expected to be, affected by a number of factors, including those listed below.

General Economic Conditions

Economic conditions may have a material impact on Xcel Energy’s operating results.  While economic growth has been improving 
over the past year, management cannot predict whether this trend will be sustained going forward.  Other events impact overall 
economic conditions and management cannot predict the impact of fluctuating energy prices, terrorist activity, war or the threat of war.  
However, Xcel Energy could experience a material impact to its results of operations, future growth or ability to raise capital resulting 
from a sustained general slowdown in economic growth or a significant increase in interest rates.

Fuel Supply and Costs

Xcel Energy Inc.’s operating utilities have varying dependence on coal, natural gas and uranium.  Changes in commodity prices are 
generally recovered through fuel recovery mechanisms and have very little impact on earnings.  However, availability of supply, the 
potential implementation of a carbon tax or emissions-related generation restrictions and unanticipated changes in regulatory recovery 
mechanisms could impact our operations.  See Item 1 for further discussion of fuel supply and costs.

Pension Plan Costs and Assumptions

Xcel Energy has significant net pension and postretirement benefit costs that are measured using actuarial valuations.  Inherent in 
these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates and expected return on plan assets.  Xcel Energy evaluates these key 
assumptions at least annually by analyzing current market conditions, which include changes in interest rates and market returns.  
Changes in the related net pension and postretirement benefits costs and funding requirements may occur in the future due to changes 
in assumptions.  The payout of a significant percentage of pension plan liabilities in a single year due to high retirements or employees 
leaving Xcel Energy would trigger settlement accounting and could require Xcel Energy to recognize material incremental pension 
expense related to unrecognized plan losses in the year these liabilities are paid.  For further discussion and a sensitivity analysis on 
these assumptions, see “Employee Benefits” under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.

Tax Reform 

On Dec. 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed by the President, enacting significant changes to the IRC.  The changes are generally effective 
for Xcel Energy federal tax returns for years following 2017, and include a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 
percent to 21 percent. The TCJA recognizes the unique nature of public utilities and contains certain provisions specific to the 
industry, including continuing certain interest expense deductibility and not allowing 100 percent expensing of capital investments.  

2017 Impacts of Tax Reform

•  Required the revaluation of federal deferred tax assets and liabilities using the new lower tax rate.  The majority of the 
revaluation relates to regulated utility activities and results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities, with no 
estimated income statement impact; and

•  Xcel Energy recognized approximately $23 million of income tax expense associated with the TCJA in the fourth quarter of 

2017.  This amount is considered to be non-recurring and has been excluded from Xcel Energy’s 2017 ongoing earnings.

Future Impacts of Tax Reform

•  Decreases annual revenue requirements by approximately $400 million;     
•  Reduces the tax benefit from holding company interest expense by approximately $20 million in 2018, negatively impacting 

earnings;
Increases rate base growth for the same level of expected capital expenditures due to lower forecasted deferred tax liabilities; 
and

• 

•  Negative impact on cash flow from operations and credit metrics, depending on regulatory actions.

Potential Regulatory Options

The timing of revenue requirements adjustments for both the return of excess deferred taxes and the lower tax rate are subject to 
regulatory actions in each of the eight states in which the regulated utilities operate, as well as the FERC.  Each regulatory jurisdiction 
has initiated active proceedings to reflect the impacts of TCJA.  In addition to lower revenue requirements, the TCJA also reduces the 
pre-tax credit that our customers receive from the federal PTCs; this issue will be reviewed in various resource planning and asset 
acquisition proceedings.  Additionally, Xcel Energy has open rate cases and resource acquisition dockets pending in several states that 
may be impacted.

Xcel Energy plans to work directly with its regulators to determine the appropriate path forward in each jurisdiction.  Potential 
regulatory options that may be appropriate to consider either as alternatives to or in a combination with flowing back the lower 
revenue requirements through rates include, but are not limited to:

Increasing authorized equity ratios at the operating company level;

•  Accelerating depreciation or amortization for selected assets or asset classes;
• 
•  Modifying capital investments;
•  Avoiding or deferring future rate cases; and
• 
Funding of certain long-dated obligations.

Xcel Energy believes that regulatory actions that include higher authorized operating company equity ratios and/or accelerated 
depreciation/amortization can preserve operating company credit metrics that otherwise degrade under the TCJA.

See Notes 6 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

Regulation

FERC and State Regulation — The FERC and various state and local regulatory commissions regulate Xcel Energy Inc.’s utility 
subsidiaries, TransCo subsidiaries and WGI.  Decisions by these regulators can significantly impact Xcel Energy’s results of 
operations.  Xcel Energy expects to periodically file for rate changes based on changing operating costs, new or planned investments, 
fluctuations in energy markets and general economic conditions.

The electric and natural gas rates charged to customers of Xcel Energy Inc.’s utility subsidiaries are approved by the FERC or the 
regulatory commissions in the states in which they operate.  The rates are designed to recover plant investment, operating costs and an 
allowed return on investment.  Rates charged by Xcel Energy Inc.’s TransCo subsidiaries and WGI are approved by the FERC.  Xcel 
Energy Inc.’s utility subsidiaries request changes in rates for utility services through filings with the governing commissions.  Changes 
in operating costs can affect Xcel Energy’s financial results, depending on the timing of filing general rate cases and the 
implementation of final rates.  In addition to changes in operating costs, other factors affecting rate filings are new investments, sales, 
conservation and DSM efforts, and the cost of capital.  In addition, the regulatory commissions authorize the ROE, capital structure 
and depreciation rates in rate proceedings.

Wholesale Energy Market Regulation — Wholesale energy markets are operated by MISO in the Midwest and SPP in the South 
Central U.S. to centrally dispatch all regional electric generation and apply a regional transmission congestion management system.  
NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin are members of MISO and SPS is a member of SPP.  NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin and SPS 
expect to recover RTO energy and other charges through either base rates or various recovery mechanisms.  PSCo is evaluating 
participation in the SPP RTO energy market through the MWTG.  See Item 1 and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for 
further discussion.

Capital Expenditure Regulation — Xcel Energy Inc.’s utility subsidiaries make substantial investments in renewable generation, plant 
additions to build and upgrade power plants, and expand and maintain the energy transmission and distribution systems.  Xcel Energy 
Inc.’s utility subsidiaries to recover the costs associated with capital investments through rate case filings and through riders (in certain 
states).  These non-fuel rate riders are expected to provide cash flows to enable recovery of costs incurred on a more timely basis.  
Xcel Energy has implemented formula rates for each of the utility subsidiaries that will provide annual rate changes as transmission or 
production investments increase in a manner similar to the retail rate riders for wholesale electric transmission and production 
services.  Electric transmission investments owned by the TransCos are recoverable through FERC approved transmission formula 
rates for XETD and XEST.  NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have no cost-based wholesale production customers and therefore 
have not implemented a production formula rate.

Environmental Matters

Environmental costs include accruals for nuclear plant decommissioning and payments for storage of spent nuclear fuel, disposal of 
hazardous materials and waste, remediation of contaminated sites, monitoring of discharges to the environment and compliance with 
laws and permits with respect to emissions.  A trend of greater environmental awareness and increasingly stringent regulation may 
continue to cause higher operating expenses and capital expenditures for environmental compliance.

Costs charged to operating expenses for nuclear decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel disposal expenses, environmental monitoring 
and disposal of hazardous materials and waste were approximately:

• 
• 
• 

$303 million in 2017;
$304 million in 2016; and
$292 million in 2015.

Xcel Energy estimates an average annual expense of approximately $349 million from 2018 through 2022 for similar costs.  The 
precise timing and amount of environmental costs, including those for site remediation and disposal of hazardous materials, are 
unknown.  Additionally, the extent to which environmental costs will be included in and recovered through rates may fluctuate.

Capital expenditures for environmental improvements at regulated facilities were approximately:

• 
• 
• 

$61 million in 2017;
$93 million in 2016; and
$184 million in 2015.

See Item 7 — Capital Requirements for further discussion.

62

Xcel Energy’s operations are subject to federal and state laws and regulations related to air emissions, water discharges and waste 
management from various sources.  Such laws and regulations impose monitoring and reporting requirements and may require Xcel 
Energy to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of projects that increase air emissions, water discharges or land 
disposal of wastes, obtain and comply with permits that contain emission, discharge and operational limitations, or install or operate 
pollution control equipment at facilities.  Xcel Energy will likely be required to incur capital expenditures in the future to comply with 
these requirements for remediation of MGP and other legacy sites and various regulations for air emissions, water intake and discharge 
and waste disposal.  Actual expenditures could vary from the estimates presented.  The scope and timing of these expenditures cannot 
be determined until any new or revised regulations become final or until more information is learned about the need for remediation at 
the legacy sites.

Pollution control equipment can be required by federal and state regulations, such as those requiring mercury emission reductions, and 
by state or federal implementation plans, such as those to address visibility impairment, interstate air pollution impacts or attainment 
of NAAQS.  In 2016, the EPA adopted a federal visibility plan for Texas which imposes SO2 emission limitations that reflect 
installation of dry scrubbers on Tolk Units 1 and 2, with compliance required by early 2021.  This rule has been stayed by the Fifth 
Circuit.  In March 2017, the Fifth Circuit remanded the rule to the EPA for reconsideration, while leaving the stay in effect.  The Fifth 
Circuit is now holding the case in abeyance until the EPA completes its reconsideration of the rule.  

See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of Xcel Energy’s environmental contingencies.

Inflation

Inflation at its current level is not expected to materially affect Xcel Energy’s prices or returns to shareholders.  However, potential 
future inflation could result from economic conditions or the economic and monetary policies of the U.S. Government and the Federal 
Reserve.  This could lead to future price increases for materials and services required to deliver electric and natural gas services to 
customers.  These potential cost increases could in turn lead to increased prices to customers.  Likewise, lower oil and natural gas 
prices could lead to sustained deflation, that could also reduce general economic activity although it may lead to lower electric and 
natural gas prices to customers. Additionally, under statute, federal agencies such as the FERC now can adjust statutory penalties for 
inflation.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of 
accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates.  The application of these policies involves judgments regarding future 
events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs.  
These judgments could materially impact the consolidated financial statements and disclosures, based on varying assumptions.  In 
addition, the financial and operating environment also may have a significant effect on the operation of the business and on the results 
reported.  The following is a list of accounting policies and estimates that are most significant to the portrayal of Xcel Energy’s 
financial condition and results, and require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments.  Each of these has a higher 
likelihood of resulting in materially different reported amounts under different conditions or using different assumptions.  Each critical 
accounting policy has been reviewed and discussed with the Audit Committee of Xcel Energy Inc.’s Board of Directors on a quarterly 
basis.

Regulatory Accounting

Xcel Energy Inc. is a holding company with rate-regulated subsidiaries that are subject to the accounting for Regulated Operations, 
which provides that rate-regulated entities report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates, if 
the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates will be charged and collected.  Xcel Energy’s rates are derived through 
the ratemaking process, which results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities based on the probability of future cash flows.  
Regulatory assets generally represent incurred or accrued costs that have been deferred because future recovery from customers is 
probable.  Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future rates or amounts 
collected in current rates for future costs.  In other businesses or industries, regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities would generally 
be charged to net income or OCI.

Each reporting period Xcel Energy assesses the probability of future recoveries and obligations associated with regulatory assets and 
liabilities. Factors such as the current regulatory environment, recently issued rate orders and historical precedents are considered. 
Decisions made by regulatory agencies can directly impact the amount and timing of cost recovery as well as the rate of return on 
invested capital, and may materially impact Xcel Energy’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

63

As of Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, Xcel Energy has recorded regulatory assets of $3.4 billion for both periods, and regulatory liabilities of 
$5.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively.  Each subsidiary is subject to regulation that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  If 
future recovery of costs in any such jurisdiction ceases to be probable, Xcel Energy would be required to charge these assets to current 
net income or OCI.  In assessing the probability of recovery of recognized regulatory assets, Xcel Energy noted no current or 
anticipated proposals or changes in the regulatory environment that it expects will materially impact the probability of recovery of the 
assets.  See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of regulatory assets and liabilities and Note 12 to 
the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of rate matters.

Income Tax Accruals

Judgment, uncertainty, and estimates are a significant aspect of the income tax accrual process that accounts for the effects of current 
and deferred income taxes. Uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations and the outcomes of tax audits 
and appeals require that judgment and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of the ETR. 

Changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future ETR.  The TCJA reduced the 
federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, significantly impacting the recorded amounts of deferred tax assets and 
liabilities and reducing the ETR applicable to future periods.   See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations - Tax Reform and Notes 6 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

ETRs are highly impacted by assumptions. ETR calculations are revised every quarter based on best available year-end tax 
assumptions (income levels, deductions, credits, etc.); adjusted in the following year after returns are filed, with the tax accrual 
estimates being trued-up to the actual amounts claimed on the tax returns; and further adjusted after examinations by taxing authorities 
have been completed.

In accordance with the interim period reporting guidance, income tax expense for the first three quarters in a year is based on the 
forecasted annual ETR. The forecasted ETR reflects a number of estimates including forecasted annual income, permanent tax 
adjustments and tax credits.

Valuation allowances are applied to deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that at least a portion may not be realized based on 
an evaluation of expected future taxable income.

Accounting for income taxes also requires that only tax benefits that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold can be 
recognized or continue to be recognized. The change in the unrecognized tax benefits needs to be reasonably estimated based on 
evaluation of the nature of uncertainty, the nature of event that could cause the change and an estimated range of reasonably possible 
changes. 

Management will use prudent business judgment to derecognize appropriate amounts of tax benefits at any period end, and as new 
developments occur. Unrecognized tax benefits can be recognized as issues are favorably resolved and loss exposures decline.  We 
may adjust our unrecognized tax benefits and interest accruals to the updated estimates as disputes with the IRS and state tax 
authorities are resolved. These adjustments may increase or decrease earnings. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for 
further discussion.

Employee Benefits

Xcel Energy’s pension costs are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of key assumptions, most notably the annual 
return level that pension and postretirement health care investment assets are expected to earn in the future and the interest rate used to 
discount future pension benefit payments to a present value obligation.  In addition, the pension cost calculation uses an asset-
smoothing methodology to reduce the volatility of varying investment performance over time.  See Note 9 to the consolidated 
financial statements for further discussion on the rate of return and discount rate used in the calculation of pension costs and 
obligations.

Pension costs are expected to decrease in 2018 and continue to decline in the following few years.  Funding requirements in 2018 are 
expected to be consistent with 2017 and continue at that level in the following years.  While investment returns were below the 
assumed levels in 2015 and 2016, investment returns exceeded the assumed levels in 2017.  The pension cost calculation uses a 
market-related valuation of pension assets.  Xcel Energy uses a calculated value method to determine the market-related value of the 
plan assets.  The market-related value is determined by adjusting the fair market value of assets at the beginning of the year to reflect 
the investment gains and losses (the difference between the actual investment return and the expected investment return on the market-
related value) during each of the previous five years at the rate of 20 percent per year.  As these differences between the actual 
investment returns and the expected investment returns are incorporated into the market-related value, the differences are recognized 
in pension cost over the expected average remaining years of service for active employees, which was approximately 12 years in 2017.

64

Based on current assumptions and the recognition of past investment gains and losses, Xcel Energy currently projects the pension 
costs recognized for financial reporting purposes will be $119 million in 2018 and $105 million in 2019, while the actual pension costs 
were $139 million in 2017 and $122 million in 2016.  The expected decrease in 2018 and future year costs is due primarily to 
reductions in loss amortizations, plan design changes and an increase in expected return on assets due to planned future contributions 
and expected return of current assets.  

In 2014, the Society of Actuaries published a new mortality table (RP-2014) that increased the overall life expectancy of males and 
females.  In 2014, Xcel Energy adopted this mortality table, with modifications, based on its population and specific experience.  
During 2017, a new projection table was released (MP-2017).  Xcel Energy evaluated the updated projection table and concluded that 
the methodology currently in use and adopted in 2016 is consistent with the recently updated 2017 table and continues to be 
representative of Xcel Energy’s population.

At Dec. 31, 2017, Xcel Energy set the rate of return on assets used to measure pension costs at 6.87 percent, which is consistent with 
the rate set at Dec. 31, 2016.  The rate of return used to measure postretirement health care costs is 5.80 percent at Dec. 31, 2017 and 
this is consistent with Dec. 31, 2016.  Xcel Energy’s ongoing pension investment strategy is based on plan-specific investments that 
seek to minimize potential investment and interest rate risk as a plan’s funded status increases over time.  The investments result in a 
greater percentage of interest rate sensitive securities being allocated to specific plans having relatively higher funded status ratios and 
a greater percentage of growth assets being allocated to plans having relatively lower funded status ratios.

Xcel Energy set the discount rates used to value the Dec. 31, 2017 pension at 3.63 percent and postretirement health care obligations at 
3.62 percent, which represents a 50 basis point and a 51 basis point decrease from Dec. 31, 2016, respectively.  Xcel Energy uses a 
bond matching study as its primary basis for determining the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement health care 
obligations.  The bond matching study utilizes a portfolio of high grade (Aa or higher) bonds that matches the expected cash flows of 
Xcel Energy’s benefit plans in amount and duration.  The effective yield on this cash flow matched bond portfolio determines the 
discount rate for the individual plans.  The bond matching study is validated for reasonableness against the Merrill Lynch Corporate 
15+ Bond Index.  At Dec. 31, 2017, this reference point supported the selected rate.  In addition to this reference point, Xcel Energy 
also reviews general actuarial survey data to assess the reasonableness of the discount rate selected.

The following are the pension funding contributions across all four of Xcel Energy’s pension plans, both voluntary and required, for 
2015 through 2018:

• 
• 
• 
• 

$150 million in January 2018;
$162 million in 2017;
$125 million in 2016; and
$90 million in 2015.

For future years, we anticipate contributions will be made as necessary.  These contributions are summarized in Note 9 to the 
consolidated financial statements.  Future year amounts are estimates and may change based on actual market performance, changes in 
interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations.  Therefore, additional contributions could be required in the future.

If Xcel Energy were to use alternative assumptions at Dec. 31, 2017, a one-percent change would result in the following impact on 
2017 pension costs:

Beginning with the Dec. 31, 2017 measurement date, Xcel Energy separated its initial medical trend assumption for pre-Medicare 
(Pre-65) and post-Medicare (Post-65) claims costs, and assumed 7.0 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively.  Xcel Energy separated the 
trends in order to reflect different short-term expectations based on recent experiences with Pre-65 and Post-65 claims cost increases 
for Xcel Energy’s retiree medical plan.  The ultimate trend assumption remained at 4.5 percent for both Pre-65 and Post-65 claims 
costs as similar long-term trend rates are expected for both populations.  The period from initial trend rate until the ultimate rate is 
reached is five years.  Xcel Energy bases its medical trend assumption on the long-term cost inflation expected in the health care 
market, considering the levels projected and recommended by industry experts, as well as recent actual medical cost experienced by 
Xcel Energy’s retiree medical plan.

•  Xcel Energy contributed $20 million, $18 million and $18 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, to the 

postretirement health care plans.

•  Xcel Energy expects to contribute approximately $12 million during 2018.

Xcel Energy recovers employee benefits costs in its regulated utility operations consistent with accounting guidance with the 
exception of the areas noted below.

•  NSP-Minnesota recognizes pension expense in all regulatory jurisdictions as calculated using the aggregate normal cost 

actuarial method.  Differences between aggregate normal cost and expense as calculated by pension accounting standards are 
deferred as a regulatory liability.
In 2017, the PSCW approved NSP-Wisconsin’s request for deferred accounting treatment of the 2017 pension settlement 
accounting expense. 

•  Colorado, Texas, New Mexico and FERC jurisdictions allow the recovery of other postretirement benefit costs only to the 

extent that recognized expense is matched by cash contributions to an irrevocable trust.  Xcel Energy has consistently funded 
at a level to allow full recovery of costs in these jurisdictions.
PSCo and SPS recognize pension expense in all regulatory jurisdictions based on expense consistent with accounting 
guidance.  The Texas and Colorado electric retail jurisdictions and the Colorado gas retail jurisdiction, each record the 
difference between annual recognized pension expense and the annual amount of pension expense approved in their last 
respective general rate case as a deferral to a regulatory asset.

Nuclear Decommissioning

Xcel Energy recognizes liabilities for the expected cost of retiring tangible long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists. These 
AROs are recognized at fair value as incurred and are capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived assets.  In the absence of 
quoted market prices, Xcel Energy estimates the fair value of its AROs using present value techniques, in which it makes various 
assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, credit-adjusted 
risk free rates and cost escalation rates.  When Xcel Energy revises any assumptions used to estimate AROs, it adjusts the carrying 
amount of both the ARO liability and the related long-lived asset.  Xcel Energy accretes ARO liabilities to reflect the passage of time 
using the interest method.

A significant portion of Xcel Energy’s AROs relates to the future decommissioning of NSP-Minnesota’s nuclear facilities.  The total 
obligation for nuclear decommissioning is expected to be funded by the external decommissioning trust fund.  The difference between 
regulatory funding (including depreciation expense less returns from the external trust fund) and expense recognized under current 
accounting guidance is deferred as a regulatory asset.  The amounts recorded for AROs related to future nuclear decommissioning 
were $1.874 billion and $2.249 billion as of Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Based on their significance, the following 
discussion relates specifically to the AROs associated with nuclear decommissioning.

NSP-Minnesota obtains periodic cost studies in order to estimate the cost and timing of planned nuclear decommissioning activities.  
These independent cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time performed.  Estimates of future cash flows for 
extended periods of time are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results.  NSP-Minnesota is required to 
file a nuclear decommissioning filing every three years.  The filing covers all expenses over the decommissioning period of the 
nuclear plants, including decontamination and removal of radioactive material.  The MPUC approved NSP-Minnesota’s currently 
effective decommissioning filing in October 2015.  The most recent filing was submitted in December 2017 and is currently pending 
with the MPUC, with an order expected in 2018.  See Note 13 for further discussion.

66

The following key assumptions have a significant effect on the estimated nuclear obligation:

•  Timing — Decommissioning cost estimates are impacted by each facility’s retirement date and the expected timing of the 

actual decommissioning activities.  Currently, the estimated retirement dates coincide with the expiration of each unit’s 
operating license with the NRC (i.e., 2030 for Monticello and 2033 and 2034 for PI’s Unit 1 and 2, respectively).  The 
estimated timing of the decommissioning activities is based upon the DECON method, which assumes prompt removal and 
dismantlement.  The use of the DECON method is required by the MPUC.  By utilizing this method, decommissioning 
activities are expected to begin at the end of the license date and be completed for both facilities by 2091.

•  Technology and Regulation — There is limited experience with actual decommissioning of large nuclear facilities.  Changes in 
technology and experience as well as changes in regulations regarding nuclear decommissioning could cause cost estimates to 
change significantly.  NSP-Minnesota’s most recent nuclear decommissioning filing assumed current technology and 
regulations.

•  Escalation Rates — Escalation rates represent projected cost increases over time due to both general inflation and increases in 
the cost of specific decommissioning activities.  NSP-Minnesota used an escalation rate of 3.42 percent in calculating the ARO 
related to nuclear decommissioning for the Monticello facility, a rate of 3.40 percent for PI Unit 1, and a rate of 3.40 percent for 
PI Unit 2.  These rates are weighted averages of labor and non-labor escalation factors calculated by Goldman Sachs Asset 
Management.

•  Discount Rates — Changes in timing or estimated expected cash flows that result in upward revisions to the ARO are 

calculated using the then-current credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. The credit-adjusted risk-free rate in effect when the 
change occurs is used to discount the revised estimate of the incremental expected cash flows of the retirement activity.  If the 
change in timing or estimated expected cash flows results in a downward revision of the ARO, the undiscounted revised 
estimate of expected cash flows is discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate in effect at the date of initial measurement 
and recognition of the original ARO.  Discount rates ranging from approximately four to seven percent have been used to 
calculate the net present value of the expected future cash flows over time.

Significant uncertainties exist in estimating the future cost of nuclear decommissioning including the method to be utilized, the 
ultimate costs to decommission, and the planned method of disposing spent fuel.  If different cost estimates, life assumptions or cost 
escalation rates were utilized, the AROs could change materially.  However, changes in estimates have minimal impact on results of 
operations as NSP-Minnesota expects to continue to recover all costs in future rates.

Xcel Energy continually makes judgments and estimates related to these critical accounting policy areas, based on an evaluation of the 
varying assumptions and uncertainties for each area.  The information and assumptions underlying many of these judgments and 
estimates will be affected by events beyond the control of Xcel Energy, or otherwise change over time.  This may require adjustments 
to recorded results to better reflect the events and updated information that becomes available.  The accompanying financial 
statements reflect management’s best estimates and judgments of the impact of these factors as of Dec. 31, 2017.

Derivatives, Risk Management and Market Risk

Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries are exposed to a variety of market risks in the normal course of business.  Market risk is the 
potential loss that may occur as a result of adverse changes in the market or fair value of a particular instrument or commodity.  All 
financial and commodity-related instruments, including derivatives, are subject to market risk.  See Note 11 to the consolidated 
financial statements for further discussion of market risks associated with derivatives.

Xcel Energy is exposed to the impact of adverse changes in price for energy and energy-related products, which is partially mitigated 
by the use of commodity derivatives.  In addition to ongoing monitoring and maintaining credit policies intended to minimize overall 
credit risk, when necessary, management takes steps to mitigate changes in credit and concentration risks associated with its 
derivatives and other contracts, including parental guarantees and requests of collateral.  While Xcel Energy expects that the 
counterparties will perform under the contracts underlying its derivatives, the contracts expose Xcel Energy to some credit and non-
performance risk.

Though no material non-performance risk currently exists with the counterparties to Xcel Energy’s commodity derivative contracts, 
distress in the financial markets may in the future impact that risk to the extent it impacts those counterparties.  Distress in the 
financial markets may also impact the fair value of the securities in the nuclear decommissioning fund and master pension trust, as 
well as Xcel Energy’s ability to earn a return on short-term investments of excess cash.

67

Commodity Price Risk — Xcel Energy Inc.’s utility subsidiaries are exposed to commodity price risk in their electric and natural gas 
operations.  Commodity price risk is managed by entering into long- and short-term physical purchase and sales contracts for electric 
capacity, energy and energy-related products and for various fuels used in generation and distribution activities.  Commodity price risk 
is also managed through the use of financial derivative instruments.  Xcel Energy’s risk management policy allows it to manage 
commodity price risk within each rate-regulated operation per commission approved hedge plans.

Wholesale and Commodity Trading Risk — Xcel Energy Inc.’s utility subsidiaries conduct various wholesale and commodity trading 
activities, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, energy-related instruments and natural gas-related instruments, 
including derivatives.  Xcel Energy’s risk management policy allows management to conduct these activities within guidelines and 
limitations as approved by its risk management committee, which is made up of management personnel not directly involved in the 
activities governed by this policy.

At Dec. 31, 2017, the fair values by source for net commodity trading contract assets were as follows:

At Dec. 31, 2017, a 10 percent increase or decrease in market prices for commodity trading contracts would have an immaterial 
impact.  At Dec. 31, 2016, a 10 percent increase in market prices for commodity trading contracts would decrease pretax income from 
continuing operations by approximately $1 million, whereas a 10 percent decrease would increase pretax income from continuing 
operations by approximately $1 million.

Xcel Energy Inc.’s utility subsidiaries’ wholesale and commodity trading operations measure the outstanding risk exposure to price 
changes on transactions, contracts and obligations that have been entered into, but not closed, using an industry standard methodology 
known as Value at Risk (VaR).  VaR expresses the potential change in fair value on the outstanding transactions, contracts and 
obligations over a particular period of time under normal market conditions.

The VaRs for the NSP-Minnesota and PSCo commodity trading operations, calculated on a consolidated basis using a Monte Carlo 
simulation with a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, were as follows:

Nuclear Fuel Supply — NSP-Minnesota is scheduled to take delivery of approximately 58 percent of its 2018 and approximately 24 
percent of its 2019 enriched nuclear material requirements from sources that could be impacted by events in Ukraine and extended 
sanctions against Russia.  Alternate potential sources are expected to provide the flexibility to manage NSP-Minnesota’s nuclear fuel 
supply to ensure that plant availability and reliability will not be negatively impacted in the near-term.  Long-term, through 2024, 
NSP-Minnesota is scheduled to take delivery of approximately 35 percent of its average enriched nuclear material requirements from 
sources that could be impacted by events in Ukraine and extended sanctions against Russia.  NSP-Minnesota is closely following the 
progression of these events and will periodically assess if further actions are required to assure a secure supply of enriched nuclear 
material.

Separately, NSP-Minnesota has enriched nuclear fuel materials in process with Westinghouse Electric Corporation (Westinghouse). 
Westinghouse filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March 2017. NSP-Minnesota owns materials in Westinghouse’s inventory 
and has contracts in place under which Westinghouse will provide certain services during an upcoming outage at Prairie Island (PI). 
Westinghouse will provide nuclear fuel assemblies for the upcoming PI outage under the current nuclear fuel fabrication contract. 
Westinghouse has indicated its intention to continue to perform under the arrangements. Based on Westinghouse’s stated intent and the 
interim financing secured to fund its on-going operations, NSP-Minnesota does not expect the bankruptcy to materially impact NSP-
Minnesota’s operational or financial performance.  Westinghouse announced on Jan. 4, 2018 it has agreed to be acquired by 
Brookfield Business Partners LP and other institutional partners.  Brookfield’s acquisition of Westinghouse is expected to close in the 
third quarter of 2018, subject to bankruptcy court and regulatory approvals.  NSP-Minnesota will continue to monitor the 
Westinghouse acquisition process.

Interest Rate Risk — Xcel Energy is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business.  Xcel Energy’s 
risk management policy allows interest rate risk to be managed through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and interest rate 
derivatives such as swaps, caps, collars and put or call options.

At Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, a 100 basis point change in the benchmark rate on Xcel Energy’s variable rate debt would impact annual 
pretax interest expense by approximately $9 million and $4 million, respectively.  See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 
for a discussion of Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries’ interest rate derivatives.

NSP-Minnesota maintains a nuclear decommissioning fund, as required by the NRC.  The nuclear decommissioning fund is subject to 
interest rate risk and equity price risk.  At Dec. 31, 2017, the fund was invested in a diversified portfolio of cash equivalents, debt 
securities, equity securities and other investments.  These investments may be used only for activities related to nuclear 
decommissioning.  Given the purpose and legal restrictions on the use of nuclear decommissioning fund assets, realized and 
unrealized gains on fund investments over the life of the fund are deferred as an offset of NSP-Minnesota’s regulatory asset for nuclear 
decommissioning costs.  Consequently, any realized and unrealized gains and losses on securities in the nuclear decommissioning 
fund, including any other-than-temporary impairments, are deferred as a component of the regulatory asset for nuclear 
decommissioning.  Since the accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through rates, fluctuations in 
equity prices or interest rates affecting the nuclear decommissioning fund do not have a direct impact on earnings.

Changes in discount rates and expected return on plan assets impact the value of pension and postretirement plan assets as well as 
benefit costs.  For further information, see “Employee Benefits” under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.

Credit Risk — Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries are also exposed to credit risk.  Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from 
counterparties’ nonperformance on their contractual obligations.  Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries maintain credit policies 
intended to minimize overall credit risk and actively monitor these policies to reflect changes and scope of operations.

At Dec. 31, 2017, a 10 percent increase in commodity prices would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $26 million, 
while a decrease in prices of 10 percent would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $7 million.  At Dec. 31, 2016, a 10 
percent increase in commodity prices would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $6 million, while a decrease in prices of 
10 percent would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $17 million.

Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries conduct standard credit reviews for all counterparties.  Xcel Energy employs additional credit 
risk control mechanisms when appropriate, such as letters of credit, parental guarantees, standardized master netting agreements and 
termination provisions that allow for offsetting of positive and negative exposures.  Credit exposure is monitored and, when necessary, 
the activity with a specific counterparty is limited until credit enhancement is provided.  Distress in the financial markets could 
increase Xcel Energy’s credit risk.

Fair Value Measurements

Xcel Energy follows accounting and disclosure guidance on fair value measurements that contains a hierarchy for inputs used in 
measuring fair value and requires disclosure of the observability of the inputs used in these measurements.  See Note 11 to the 
consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the fair value hierarchy and the amounts of assets and liabilities measured at 
fair value that have been assigned to Level 3.

69

Commodity Derivatives — Xcel Energy continuously monitors the creditworthiness of the counterparties to its commodity derivative 
contracts and assesses each counterparty’s ability to perform on the transactions set forth in the contracts.  Given this assessment and 
the typically short duration of these contracts, the impact of discounting commodity derivative assets for counterparty credit risk was 
not material to the fair value of commodity derivative assets at Dec. 31, 2017.  Adjustments to fair value for credit risk of commodity 
trading instruments are recorded in electric revenues.  Credit risk adjustments for other commodity derivative instruments are deferred 
as OCI or regulatory assets and liabilities.  The classification as a regulatory asset or liability is based on commission approved 
regulatory recovery mechanisms.  Xcel Energy also assesses the impact of its own credit risk when determining the fair value of 
commodity derivative liabilities.  The impact of discounting commodity derivative liabilities for credit risk was immaterial to the fair 
value of commodity derivative liabilities at Dec. 31, 2017.

Commodity derivative assets and liabilities assigned to Level 3 typically consist of FTRs, as well as forward and option contracts that 
are long-term in nature or relate to inactive delivery locations.  Level 3 commodity derivative assets and liabilities represent 1.7 
percent and 4.3 percent of gross assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value at Dec. 31, 2017.

Determining the fair value of FTRs requires numerous management forecasts that vary in observability, including various forward 
commodity prices, retail and wholesale demand, generation and resulting transmission system congestion.  Given the limited 
observability of management’s forecasts for several of these inputs, these instruments have been assigned a Level 3.  Level 3 
commodity derivatives assets and liabilities included $32 million and $2 million of estimated fair values, respectively, for FTRs held 
at Dec. 31, 2017.

Determining the fair value of certain commodity forwards and options can require management to make use of subjective price and 
volatility forecasts for inactive delivery locations and for contracts that extend to periods beyond those readily observable on active 
exchanges or quoted by brokers.  When less observable forward price and volatility forecasts are significant to determining the value 
of commodity forwards and options, these instruments are assigned to Level 3.  There were $5 million in Level 3 commodity 
derivative assets and no liabilities for options held at Dec. 31, 2017.  There were immaterial Level 3 commodity derivative assets and 
liabilities for forwards held at Dec. 31, 2017.

payments and lower income tax refunds received. 

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $14 million for 2016 as compared to 2015.  The increase was primarily due to 
timing of vendor payments and higher net income, excluding amounts related to non-cash operating activities (e.g., depreciation,

Capital Requirements

Xcel Energy expects to meet future financing requirements by periodically issuing short-term debt, long-term debt, common stock, 
hybrid and other securities to maintain desired capitalization ratios.

(a)   Other category includes intercompany transfers for safe harbor wind turbines. 
(b)  Xcel Energy has reduced its capital forecast by $500 million due to the potential impact of tax reform on cash flows and credit metrics. 
(c)  Amounts in other category are net of intercompany transfers. 

The base capital expenditure forecast does not include the CEP, which if approved could increase the total capital investment by up to 
$1.5 billion, based on a preliminary estimate.  The level of capital investment may decline due to lower renewable pricing and the 
ultimate composition of assets selected as part of the RFP process.  The expected cost and potential capital investment of the CEP will 
be determined once a recommended portfolio is filed with the CPUC. 

The capital expenditure programs of Xcel Energy are subject to continuing review and modification. Actual capital expenditures may 
vary from estimates due to changes in electric and natural gas projected load growth, regulatory decisions, legislative initiatives, 
reserve margin requirements, the availability of purchased power, alternative plans for meeting long-term energy needs, compliance 
with environmental requirements, RPS and merger, acquisition and divestiture opportunities.

Xcel Energy issues debt and equity securities to refinance retiring maturities, reduce short-term debt, fund capital programs, infuse 
equity in subsidiaries, fund asset acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes. 

Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments — In addition to its capital expenditure programs, Xcel Energy has contractual 
obligations and other commitments that will need to be funded in the future.  The following is a summarized table of contractual 
obligations and other commercial commitments at Dec. 31, 2017.  See the statements of capitalization and additional discussion in 
Notes 4 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements.

(a) 

(c) 

Includes interest payments over the terms of the debt.  Interest is calculated using the applicable interest rate at Dec. 31, 2017, and outstanding principal for each 
investment with the terms ending at each instrument’s maturity.

(b)  Under some leases, Xcel Energy would have to sell or purchase the property that it leases if it chose to terminate before the scheduled lease expiration date.  Most 
of Xcel Energy’s railcar, vehicle and equipment and aircraft leases have these terms.  At Dec. 31, 2017, the amount that Xcel Energy would have to pay if it chose 
to terminate these leases was approximately $28 million.  In addition, at the end of the equipment lease terms, each lease must be extended, equipment purchased 
for the greater of the fair value or unamortized value of equipment sold to a third party with Xcel Energy making up any deficiency between the sales price and the 
unamortized value.
Included in operating lease payments are $213 million, $474 million, $481 million and $1.7 billion, for the less than 1 year, 1-3 years, 3-5 years and after 5 years 
categories, respectively, pertaining to PPAs that were accounted for as operating leases.

(d)  Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries have contracts providing for the purchase and delivery of a significant portion of its current coal, nuclear fuel and natural gas 
requirements.  Additionally, the utility subsidiaries of Xcel Energy Inc. have entered into agreements with utilities and other energy suppliers for purchased power 
to meet system load and energy requirements, replace generation from company-owned units under maintenance and during outages, and meet operating reserve 
obligations.  Certain contractual purchase obligations are adjusted on indices.  The effects of price changes are mitigated through cost of energy adjustment 
mechanisms.

(e)  Other long-term obligations relate primarily to amounts associated with technology agreements as well as uncertain tax positions.
(f)  Xcel Energy also has outstanding authority under O&M contracts to purchase up to approximately $4.8 billion of goods and services through the year 2037, in 

addition to the amounts disclosed in this table.
In January 2018, contributions of $150 million were made across four of Xcel Energy’s pension plans.  Obligations of this type are dependent on several factors, 
including management discretion and various minimum contribution requirements determined by the Pension Protection Act, and therefore, are not included in the 
table.

(h)  Xcel Energy expects to contribute approximately $12 million to the postretirement health care plans during 2018.  Obligations of this type are dependent on 

(g) 

several factors, including management discretion, and therefore, are not included in the table.

Common Stock Dividends — Future dividend levels will be dependent on Xcel Energy’s results of operations, financial position, cash 
flows, reinvestment opportunities and other factors, and will be evaluated by the Xcel Energy Inc. Board of Directors.  In February 
2018, Xcel Energy announced a quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share, which represents an increase of 5.6 percent.  Xcel Energy’s 
dividend policy balances the following:

Projected cash generation;
Projected capital investment;

• 
• 
•  A reasonable rate of return on shareholder investment; and
•  The impact on Xcel Energy’s capital structure and credit ratings.

In addition, there are certain statutory limitations that could affect dividend levels.  Federal law places certain limits on the ability of 
public utilities within a holding company system to declare dividends.

Specifically, under the Federal Power Act, a public utility may not pay dividends from any funds properly included in a capital 
account.  The utility subsidiaries’ dividends may be limited directly or indirectly by state regulatory commissions or bond indenture 
covenants.  See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of restrictions on dividend payments.

Regulation of Derivatives — In 2010, financial reform legislation was passed that provides for the regulation of derivative 
transactions amongst other provisions.  The CFTC ruled that swap dealing activity conducted by entities for the preceding 12 months 
under a notional limit, initially set at $8 billion, will fall under the general de minimis threshold and will not subject an entity to 
registering as a swap dealer.  The de minimis threshold is scheduled to be reduced to $3 billion in 2018.  Xcel Energy’s current and 
projected swap activity is well below these de minimis thresholds.  The bill also contains provisions that exempt certain derivatives 
end users from much of the clearing and margin requirements and Xcel Energy’s Board of Directors has renewed the end-user 
exemption on an annual basis.  Xcel Energy is currently meeting all reporting requirements and transaction restrictions.

Pension Fund — Xcel Energy’s pension assets are invested in a diversified portfolio of domestic and international equity securities, 
short-term to long-duration fixed income securities and alternative investments, including private equity, real estate and hedge funds.

The funded status and pension assumptions are summarized in the following tables:

Money Pool — Xcel Energy received FERC approval to establish a utility money pool arrangement with the utility subsidiaries, 
subject to receipt of required state regulatory approvals.  The utility money pool allows for short-term investments in and borrowings 
between the utility subsidiaries.  Xcel Energy Inc. may make investments in the utility subsidiaries at market-based interest rates; 
however, the money pool arrangement does not allow the utility subsidiaries to make investments in Xcel Energy Inc.  The money 
pool balances are eliminated in consolidation.

NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS participate in the money pool pursuant to approval from their respective state regulatory commissions.  
NSP-Wisconsin does not participate in the money pool.

Registration Statements — Xcel Energy Inc.’s Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of one billion shares of $2.50 par value 
common stock.  As of Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, Xcel Energy Inc. had approximately 508 million shares and 507 million shares of 
common stock outstanding, respectively.  In addition, Xcel Energy Inc.’s Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of seven 
million shares of $100 par value preferred stock.  Xcel Energy Inc. had no shares of preferred stock outstanding on Dec. 31, 2017 and 
2016.

Xcel Energy Inc. and its utility subsidiaries have registration statements on file with the SEC pursuant to which they may sell 
securities from time to time. These registration statements, which are uncapped, permit Xcel Energy Inc. and its utility subsidiaries to 
issue debt and other securities in the future at amounts, prices and with terms to be determined at the time of future offerings, and in 
the case of our utility subsidiaries, subject to commission approval.

Financing Plans — Xcel Energy Inc. and its utility subsidiaries’ 2018 debt financing plans reflect the following:

•  Xcel Energy Inc. plans to issue approximately $750 million of senior unsecured bonds;
•  NSP-Minnesota plans to issue approximately $300 million of first mortgage bonds;
•  NPS-Wisconsin plans to issue approximately $200 million of first mortgage bonds;
• 
• 

PSCo plans to issue approximately $750 million of first mortgage bonds; and 
SPS plans to issue approximately $350 million of first mortgage bonds. 

74

Xcel Energy also plans to issue approximately $300 million of incremental equity in addition to $385 million of equity to be issued 
through the DRIP and benefit programs during the five-year forecast time period.

Financing plans are subject to change, depending on capital expenditures, regulatory outcomes, internal cash generation, market 
conditions and other factors.  

Long-Term Borrowings and Other Financing Instruments — See the consolidated statements of capitalization and a discussion of 
the long-term borrowings in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements

Xcel Energy does not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements, other than those currently disclosed, that have or are reasonably likely 
to have a current or future effect on financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, 
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

Earnings Guidance

Xcel Energy’s 2018 GAAP and ongoing earnings guidance is $2.37 to $2.47 per share.(a)  Key assumptions: 

•  Constructive outcomes in all rate case and regulatory proceedings.
•  Normal weather patterns.
•  Weather-normalized retail electric sales are projected to be within a range of 0 percent to 0.5 percent over 2017 levels.
•  Weather-normalized retail firm natural gas sales are projected to be within a range of 0 percent to 0.5 percent below 2017 

levels.

•  Capital rider revenue is projected to increase by $30 million to $40 million over 2017 levels.  PTCs are flowed back to 

customers, primarily through capital riders and reductions to electric margin.

•  O&M expenses are projected to be flat.
•  Depreciation expense is projected to increase approximately $150 million to $160 million over 2017 levels.  Approximately 
$20 million of the increase in depreciation expense reflects an increased renewable development fund, which is recovered in 
revenue and will not have an impact on earnings.  
Property taxes are projected to increase approximately $30 million to $40 million over 2017 levels.
Interest expense (net of AFUDC — debt) is projected to increase $20 million to $30 million over 2017 levels.

• 
• 
•  AFUDC — equity is projected to increase approximately $20 million to $30 million from 2017 levels.
•  The ETR is projected to be approximately 8 percent to 10 percent.  The lower ETR for 2018 compared to 2017 reflects the 
lower tax rate as part of the TCJA, including excess deferred taxes and PTCs which are flowed back to customers through 
margin.  The ETR would be approximately 21 percent to 23 percent excluding excess deferred taxes and PTCs.

(a)   Ongoing earnings is calculated using net income and adjusting for certain nonrecurring or infrequent items that are, in management’s view, not reflective of 

ongoing operations.  Ongoing earnings could differ from those prepared in accordance with GAAP for unplanned and/or unknown adjustments.  Xcel Energy is 
unable to forecast if any of these items will occur or provide a quantitative reconciliation of the guidance for ongoing diluted EPS to corresponding GAAP diluted 
EPS.

Long-Term EPS and Dividend Growth Rate Objectives 

Long-Term EPS and Dividend Growth Rate Objectives — Xcel Energy expects to deliver an attractive total return to our 
shareholders through a combination of earnings growth and dividend yield, based on the following long-term objectives:

•   Deliver long-term annual EPS growth of 5 percent to 6 percent off of a 2017 base of $2.30 per share;
•  Deliver annual dividend increases of 5 percent to 7 percent;
•   Target a dividend payout ratio of 60 percent to 70 percent; and
•   Maintain senior secured debt credit ratings in the A range and senior unsecured debt credit ratings in the BBB+ to A range.

Management Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting

The management of Xcel Energy Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial 
reporting.  Xcel Energy Inc.’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to Xcel Energy Inc.’s management 
and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be 
effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

In 2016, Xcel Energy Inc. implemented the general ledger modules, as well as initiated deployment of work management systems 
modules, of a new enterprise resource planning system.  Xcel Energy Inc. implemented additional work management systems modules 
in 2017.  Xcel Energy Inc. does not believe this implementation had an adverse effect on its internal control over financial reporting.

Xcel Energy Inc. management assessed the effectiveness of Xcel Energy Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of Dec. 31, 
2017.  In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (COSO) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013).  Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of Dec. 31, 
2017, Xcel Energy Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting is effective at the reasonable assurance level based on those criteria.

Xcel Energy Inc.’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on the Xcel Energy Inc.’s internal control 
over financial reporting.  Its report appears herein.

Xcel Energy Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Xcel Energy Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 
31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and common stockholders' 
equity, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at 
Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material 
respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows 
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) 
(PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal 
Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our 
report dated February 23, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the

be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and 
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. 
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to 
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence 
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used 
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe 
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Xcel Energy Inc.

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Xcel Energy Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 
31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective 
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated 
Framework (2013) issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) 
(PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, of the Company and our report dated 
February 23, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion 

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of 
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Controls 
over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based 
on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the 
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such 
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our 
opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect 
on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections 
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

XCEL ENERGY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Business and System of Accounts — Xcel Energy Inc.’s utility subsidiaries are engaged in the regulated generation, purchase, 
transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and in the regulated purchase, transportation, distribution and sale of natural gas.  Xcel 
Energy’s consolidated financial statements and disclosures are presented in accordance with GAAP.  All of the utility subsidiaries’ 
underlying accounting records also conform to the FERC uniform system of accounts or to systems required by various state 
regulatory commissions, which are the same in all material respects.

Principles of Consolidation — In 2017, Xcel Energy’s operations included the activity of NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and 
SPS.  These utility subsidiaries serve electric and natural gas customers in portions of Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, 
North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin.  Also included in Xcel Energy’s operations are WGI, an interstate natural gas 
pipeline company, and WYCO, a joint venture with CIG to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage and compression facilities.

Xcel Energy Inc.’s nonregulated subsidiaries include Eloigne and Capital Services.  Eloigne invests in rental housing projects that 
qualify for low-income housing tax credits.  Capital Services procures equipment for construction of renewable generation facilities at 
other subsidiaries.  Xcel Energy Inc. owns the following additional direct subsidiaries, some of which are intermediate holding 
companies with additional subsidiaries: Xcel Energy Wholesale Group Inc., Xcel Energy Markets Holdings Inc., Xcel Energy 
Ventures Inc., Xcel Energy Retail Holdings Inc., Xcel Energy Communications Group, Inc., Xcel Energy International Inc., Xcel 
Energy Transmission Holding Company, LLC, Nicollet Holdings Company, LLC, Nicollet Project Holdings LLC and Xcel Energy 
Services Inc.  Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries collectively are referred to as Xcel Energy.

Xcel Energy’s consolidated financial statements include its wholly-owned subsidiaries and VIEs for which it is the primary 
beneficiary.  In the consolidation process, all intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated.  Xcel Energy uses the equity 
method of accounting for its investment in WYCO.  Xcel Energy’s equity earnings in WYCO are included on the consolidated 
statements of income as equity earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries.  Xcel Energy has investments in several plants and 
transmission facilities jointly owned with nonaffiliated utilities.  Xcel Energy’s proportionate share of jointly owned facilities is 
recorded as property, plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets, and Xcel Energy’s proportionate share of the operating 
costs associated with these facilities is included in its consolidated statements of income.  See Note 5 for further discussion of jointly 
owned generation, transmission and gas facilities, and related ownership percentages.

Xcel Energy evaluates its arrangements and contracts with other entities, including investments, PPAs and fuel contracts, to determine 
if the other party is a VIE, if Xcel Energy has a variable interest and if Xcel Energy is the primary beneficiary.  Xcel Energy follows 
accounting guidance for VIEs which requires consideration of the activities that most significantly impact an entity’s financial 
performance and power to direct those activities, when determining whether Xcel Energy is a VIE’s primary beneficiary.  See Note 13 
for further discussion of VIEs.

Use of Estimates — In recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations, Xcel Energy uses estimates based on 
the best information available.  Estimates are used for such items as plant depreciable lives or potential disallowances, AROs, certain 
regulatory assets and liabilities, tax provisions, uncollectible amounts, environmental costs, unbilled revenues, jurisdictional fuel and 
energy cost allocations and actuarially determined benefit costs.  The recorded estimates are revised when better information becomes 
available or when actual amounts can be determined.  Those revisions can affect operating results.

Regulatory Accounting — Our regulated utility subsidiaries account for certain income and expense items in accordance with 
accounting guidance for regulated operations.  Under this guidance:

•  Certain costs, which would otherwise be charged to expense or OCI, are deferred as regulatory assets based on the expected 

ability to recover the costs in future rates; and

•  Certain credits, which would otherwise be reflected as income or OCI, are deferred as regulatory liabilities based on the 

expectation the amounts will be returned to customers in future rates, or because the amounts were collected in rates prior to 
the costs being incurred.

Estimates of recovering deferred costs and returning deferred credits are based on specific ratemaking decisions or precedent for each 
item.  Regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized consistent with the treatment in the rate setting process.

86

If restructuring or other changes in the regulatory environment occur, regulated utility subsidiaries may no longer be eligible to apply 
this accounting treatment, and may be required to eliminate regulatory assets and liabilities from their balance sheets.  Such changes 
could have a material effect on Xcel Energy’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  See Note 15 for further 
discussion of regulatory assets and liabilities.

Revenue Recognition — Revenues related to the sale of energy are generally recorded when service is rendered or energy is delivered 
to customers.  However, the determination of the energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meter, which 
occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month.  At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date 
of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is recognized.  Xcel Energy presents its revenues net of 
any excise or other fiduciary-type taxes or fees.

NSP-Minnesota participates in MISO, and SPS participates in SPP.  Xcel Energy’s utility subsidiaries recognize sales to both native 
load and other end use customers on a gross basis.  Revenues and charges for short term wholesale sales of excess energy transacted 
through RTOs are recorded on a gross basis in electric revenues and cost of sales.  Other revenues and charges related to participating 
and transacting in RTOs are recorded on a net basis in cost of sales.

Xcel Energy Inc.’s utility subsidiaries have various rate-adjustment mechanisms in place that provide for the recovery of natural gas, 
electric fuel and purchased energy costs.  These cost-adjustment tariffs may increase or decrease the level of revenue collected from 
customers and are revised periodically for differences between the total amount collected under the clauses and the costs incurred.  
When applicable, under governing regulatory commission rate orders, fuel cost over-recoveries (the excess of fuel revenue billed to 
customers over fuel costs incurred) are deferred as regulatory liabilities and under-recoveries (the excess of fuel costs incurred over 
fuel revenues billed to customers) are deferred as regulatory assets.

Certain rate rider mechanisms qualify as alternative revenue programs under GAAP.  These mechanisms arise from costs imposed 
upon the utility by action of a regulator or legislative body related to an environmental, public safety or other mandate.  When certain 
criteria are met, revenue is recognized equal to the revenue requirement, including return on rate base items, for the qualified 
mechanisms.  The mechanisms are revised periodically for differences between the total amount collected under the riders and the 
revenue recognized, which may increase or decrease the level of revenue collected from customers.  

Conservation Programs — Xcel Energy Inc.’s utility subsidiaries have implemented programs in many of their retail jurisdictions to 
assist customers in reducing peak demand and conserving energy on the electric and natural gas systems.  These programs include 
efficiency and redesign programs, as well as rebates for the purchase of items such as high efficiency lighting.

The costs incurred for DSM and CIP programs are deferred if it is probable future revenue will be provided to permit recovery of the 
incurred cost.  Recorded revenues for incentive programs designed for recovery of lost margins and/or conservation performance 
incentives are limited to amounts expected to be collected within 24 months from the annual period in which they are earned.

For PSCo, SPS and NSP-Minnesota, DSM and CIP program costs are recovered through a combination of base rate revenue and rider 
mechanisms.  The revenue billed to customers recovers incurred costs for conservation programs and also incentive amounts that are 
designed to encourage Xcel Energy’s achievement of energy conservation goals and compensate for related lost sales margin.  For 
these utility subsidiaries, regulatory assets are recognized to reflect the amount of costs or earned incentives that have not yet been 
collected from customers.  NSP-Wisconsin recovers approved conservation program costs in base rate revenue.

Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation — Property, plant and equipment is stated at original cost.  The cost of plant 
includes direct labor and materials, contracted work, overhead costs and AFUDC.  The cost of plant retired is charged to accumulated 
depreciation and amortization.  Amounts recovered in rates for future removal costs are recorded as regulatory liabilities.  Significant 
additions or improvements extending asset lives are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense as 
incurred.  Maintenance and replacement of items determined to be less than a unit of property are charged to operating expenses as 
incurred.  Planned major maintenance activities are charged to operating expense unless the cost represents the acquisition of an 
additional unit of property or the replacement of an existing unit of property.  Property, plant and equipment also includes costs 
associated with property held for future use.  The depreciable lives of certain plant assets are reviewed annually and revised, if 
appropriate. 

Property, plant and equipment is tested for impairment when it is determined that the carrying value of the assets may not be 
recoverable.  A loss is recognized in the current period if it becomes probable that part of a cost of a plant under construction or 
recently completed plant will be disallowed for recovery from customers and a reasonable estimate of the disallowance can be made.  
See Note 12 for a discussion of the loss recognized in 2015 related to the Monticello LCM/EPU project.  For investments in property, 
plant and equipment that are abandoned and not expected to go into service, incurred costs and related deferred tax amounts are 
compared to the discounted estimated future rate recovery, and a loss is recognized, if necessary.

87

Xcel Energy records depreciation expense related to its plant using the straight-line method over the plant’s useful life.  Actuarial life 
studies are performed and submitted to the state and federal commissions for review.  Upon acceptance by the various commissions, 
the resulting lives and net salvage rates are used to calculate depreciation.  Depreciation expense, expressed as a percentage of average 
depreciable property, was approximately 3.1, 2.9, and 2.8 percent for the years ended Dec. 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Leases — Xcel Energy evaluates a variety of contracts for lease classification at inception, including PPAs and rental arrangements for 
office space, vehicles and equipment.  Contracts determined to contain a lease because of per unit pricing that is other than fixed or 
market price, terms regarding the use of a particular asset, and other factors are evaluated further to determine if the arrangement is a 
capital lease.  See Note 13 for further discussion of leases.

AFUDC — AFUDC represents the cost of capital used to finance utility construction activity.  AFUDC is computed by applying a 
composite financing rate to qualified CWIP.  The amount of AFUDC capitalized as a utility construction cost is credited to other 
nonoperating income (for equity capital) and interest charges (for debt capital).  AFUDC amounts capitalized are included in Xcel 
Energy’s rate base for establishing utility service rates. 

Generally, AFUDC costs are recovered from customers as the related property is depreciated.  However, in some cases commissions 
have approved a more current recovery of the cost of capital associated with large capital projects, resulting in a lower recognition of 
AFUDC.  In other cases, some commissions have allowed an AFUDC calculation greater than the FERC-defined AFUDC rate, 
resulting in higher recognition of AFUDC.

AROs — Xcel Energy Inc.’s utility subsidiaries account for AROs under accounting guidance that requires a liability for the fair value 
of an ARO to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated, with the offsetting associated asset 
retirement costs capitalized as a long-lived asset.  The liability is generally increased over time by applying the effective interest 
method of accretion, and the capitalized costs are depreciated over the useful life of the long-lived asset.  Changes resulting from 
revisions to the timing or amount of expected asset retirement cash flows are recognized as an increase or a decrease in the ARO.  
Xcel Energy Inc.’s utility subsidiaries also recover through rates certain future plant removal costs in addition to AROs.  The 
accumulated removal costs for these obligations are reflected in the balance sheets as a regulatory liability.  See Note 13 for further 
discussion of AROs.

Nuclear Decommissioning — Nuclear decommissioning studies estimate NSP-Minnesota’s ultimate costs of decommissioning its 
nuclear power plants and are performed at least every three years and submitted to the MPUC and other state commissions for 
approval.  NSP-Minnesota’s most recent triennial nuclear decommissioning studies were filed with the MPUC in December 2017.  
These studies reflect NSP-Minnesota’s plans for dismantlement of the Monticello and PI facilities.  These studies assume that NSP-
Minnesota will store spent fuel on site pending removal to a U.S. government facility.

For rate making purposes, NSP-Minnesota recovers the total decommissioning costs related to its nuclear power plants over each 
facility’s expected service life based on the triennial decommissioning studies filed with the MPUC and other state commissions.  The 
studies consider estimated future costs of decommissioning and the market value of investments in trust funds, and recommend annual 
funding amounts.  Amounts collected in rates are deposited in the trust funds.  See Note 14 for further discussion of the approved 
nuclear decommissioning studies and funded amounts.  For financial reporting purposes, NSP-Minnesota accounts for nuclear 
decommissioning as an ARO as described above.

Restricted funds for the payment of future decommissioning expenditures for NSP-Minnesota’s nuclear facilities are included in 
nuclear decommissioning fund and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.  See Note 11 for further discussion of the nuclear 
decommissioning fund.

Nuclear Fuel Expense — Nuclear fuel expense, which is recorded as NSP-Minnesota’s nuclear generating plants use fuel, includes 
the cost of fuel used in the current period (including AFUDC) and costs associated with the end-of-life fuel segments.

Nuclear Refueling Outage Costs — Xcel Energy uses a deferral and amortization method for nuclear refueling O&M costs.  This 
method amortizes refueling outage costs over the period between refueling outages consistent with how the costs are recovered ratably 
in electric rates.

Income Taxes — Xcel Energy accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of 
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial 
statements.  Xcel Energy defers income taxes for all temporary differences between pretax financial and taxable income, and between 
the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities.  Xcel Energy uses the tax rates that are scheduled to be in effect when the temporary 
differences are expected to reverse.  The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period 
that includes the enactment date.

88

The effects of tax rate changes that are attributable to the regulated utility subsidiaries are generally subject to a normalization method 
of accounting. Therefore, the revaluation of most of the utility subsidiaries’ net deferred taxes upon a tax rate reduction results in the 
establishment of a net regulatory liability which will be refundable to utility customers over the remaining life of the related assets. A 
tax rate increase would result in the establishment of a similar regulatory asset.  Due to the effects of past regulatory practices, when 
deferred taxes were not required to be recorded due to the use of flow through accounting for ratemaking purposes, the reversal of 
some temporary differences are accounted for as current income tax expense. Tax credits are recorded when earned unless there is a 
requirement to defer the benefit and amortize it over the book depreciable lives of the related property.  The requirement to defer and 
amortize tax credits only applies to federal ITCs related to public utility property.  Utility rate regulation also has resulted in the 
recognition of certain regulatory assets and liabilities related to income taxes, which are summarized in Note 15.

Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset 
will not be realized.  In making such a determination, all available evidence is considered, including scheduled reversals of deferred 
tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations.

Xcel Energy follows the applicable accounting guidance to measure and disclose uncertain tax positions that it has taken or expects to 
take in its income tax returns.  Xcel Energy recognizes a tax position in its consolidated financial statements when it is more likely 
than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position.  Recognition of changes in 
uncertain tax positions are reflected as a component of income tax.

Xcel Energy reports interest and penalties related to income taxes within the other income and interest charges sections in the 
consolidated statements of income.

Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries file consolidated federal income tax returns as well as combined or separate state income tax 
returns.  Federal income taxes paid by Xcel Energy Inc. are allocated to Xcel Energy Inc.’s subsidiaries based on separate company 
computations of tax.  A similar allocation is made for state income taxes paid by Xcel Energy Inc. in connection with combined state 
filings.  Xcel Energy Inc. also allocates its own income tax benefits to its direct subsidiaries based on the relative positive tax 
liabilities of the subsidiaries.

See Note 6 for further discussion of income taxes.

Types of and Accounting for Derivative Instruments — Xcel Energy uses derivative instruments in connection with its interest rate, 
utility commodity price, vehicle fuel price and commodity trading activities, including forward contracts, futures, swaps and options.  
All derivative instruments not designated and qualifying for the normal purchases and normal sales exception, as defined by the 
accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging, are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as derivative 
instruments.  This includes certain instruments used to mitigate market risk for the utility operations including transmission in 
organized markets and all instruments related to the commodity trading operations.  The classification of changes in fair value for 
those derivative instruments is dependent on the designation of a qualifying hedging relationship.  Changes in fair value of derivative 
instruments not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship are reflected in current earnings or as a regulatory asset or liability.  
The classification as a regulatory asset or liability is based on commission approved regulatory recovery mechanisms.

Gains or losses on commodity trading transactions are recorded as a component of electric operating revenues; hedging transactions 
for vehicle fuel costs are recorded as a component of capital projects and O&M costs; and interest rate hedging transactions are 
recorded as a component of interest expense. Certain utility subsidiaries are allowed to recover in electric or natural gas rates the costs 
of certain financial instruments purchased to reduce commodity cost volatility.  For further information on derivatives entered to 
mitigate commodity price risk on behalf of electric and natural gas customers, see Note 11.

Cash Flow Hedges — Certain qualifying hedging relationships are designated as a hedge of a forecasted transaction, or future cash 
flow (cash flow hedge).  Changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge, to the extent effective, are included 
in OCI or deferred as a regulatory asset or liability based on recovery mechanisms until earnings are affected by the hedged 
transaction.

Normal Purchases and Normal Sales — Xcel Energy enters into contracts for the purchase and sale of commodities for use in its 
business operations.  Derivatives and hedging accounting guidance requires a company to evaluate these contracts to determine 
whether the contracts are derivatives.  Certain contracts that meet the definition of a derivative may be exempted from derivative 
accounting if designated as normal purchases or normal sales.

Xcel Energy evaluates all of its contracts at inception to determine if they are derivatives and if they meet the normal purchases and 
normal sales designation requirements.  None of the contracts entered into within the commodity trading operations qualify for a 
normal purchases and normal sales designation.

See Note 11 for further discussion of Xcel Energy’s risk management and derivative activities.

Commodity Trading Operations — All applicable gains and losses related to commodity trading activities, whether or not settled 
physically, are shown on a net basis in electric operating revenues in the consolidated statements of income.

Xcel Energy’s commodity trading operations are primarily conducted by NSP-Minnesota and PSCo.  Commodity trading activities are 
not associated with energy produced from Xcel Energy’s generation assets or energy and capacity purchased to serve native load.  
Commodity trading contracts are recorded at fair market value and commodity trading results include the impact of all margin-sharing 
mechanisms.  See Note 11 for further discussion.

Fair Value Measurements — Xcel Energy presents cash equivalents, interest rate derivatives, commodity derivatives and nuclear 
decommissioning fund assets at estimated fair values in its consolidated financial statements.  Cash equivalents are recorded at cost 
plus accrued interest; money market funds are measured using quoted NAVs.  For interest rate derivatives, quoted prices based 
primarily on observable market interest rate curves are used as a primary input to establish fair value.  For commodity derivatives, the 
most observable inputs available are generally used to determine the fair value of each contract.  In the absence of a quoted price for 
an identical contract in an active market, Xcel Energy may use quoted prices for similar contracts or internally prepared valuation 
models to determine fair value.  For the pension and postretirement plan assets and the nuclear decommissioning fund, published 
trading data and pricing models, generally using the most observable inputs available, are utilized to estimate fair value for each 
security.  See Notes 9 and 11 for further discussion.

Cash and Cash Equivalents — Xcel Energy considers investments in certain instruments, including commercial paper and money 
market funds, with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase, to be cash equivalents.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Bad Debts — Accounts receivable are stated at the actual billed amount net of an allowance 
for bad debts.  Xcel Energy establishes an allowance for uncollectible receivables based on a policy that reflects its expected exposure 
to the credit risk of customers.

Inventory — All inventory is recorded at average cost.

RECs — RECs are marketable environmental instruments that represent proof that energy was generated from eligible renewable 
energy sources.  RECs are awarded upon delivery of the associated energy and can be bought and sold.  RECs are typically used as a 
form of measurement of compliance to RPS enacted by those states that are encouraging construction and consumption from 
renewable energy sources, but can also be sold separately from the energy produced.  Utility subsidiaries acquire RECs from the 
generation or purchase of renewable power.

When RECs are purchased or acquired in the course of generation they are recorded as inventory at cost.  The cost of RECs that are 
utilized for compliance purposes is recorded as electric fuel and purchased power expense.  In certain jurisdictions, as a result of state 
regulatory orders, Xcel Energy reduces recoverable fuel costs for the cost of certain RECs and records that cost as a regulatory asset 
when the amount is recoverable in future rates.

Sales of RECs that are purchased or acquired in the course of generation are recorded in electric utility operating revenues on a gross 
basis.  The cost of these RECs, related transaction costs, and amounts credited to customers under margin-sharing mechanisms are 
recorded in electric fuel and purchased power expense.

Emission Allowances — Emission allowances, including the annual SO2 and NOx emission allowance entitlement received from the 
EPA, are recorded at cost plus associated broker commission fees.  Xcel Energy follows the inventory accounting model for all 
emission allowances.  Sales of emission allowances are included in electric utility operating revenue and the operating activities 
section of the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Environmental Costs — Environmental costs are recorded when it is probable Xcel Energy is liable for remediation costs and the 
liability can be reasonably estimated.  Costs are deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that the costs will be recovered from 
customers in future rates.  Otherwise, the costs are expensed.  If an environmental expense is related to facilities currently in use, such 
as emission-control equipment, the cost is capitalized and depreciated over the life of the plant.

90

Estimated remediation costs, excluding inflationary increases, are recorded based on experience, an assessment of the current situation 
and the technology currently available for use in the remediation.  The recorded costs are regularly adjusted as estimates are revised 
and remediation proceeds.  If other participating PRPs exist and acknowledge their potential involvement with a site, costs are 
estimated and recorded only for Xcel Energy’s expected share of the cost.  

Any future costs of restoring sites where operation may extend indefinitely are treated as a capitalized cost of plant retirement.  The 
depreciation expense levels recoverable in rates include a provision for removal expenses, which may include final remediation costs.  
Removal costs recovered in rates before the related costs are incurred are classified as a regulatory liability.

See Note 13 for further discussion of environmental costs.

Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits — Xcel Energy maintains pension and postretirement benefit plans for eligible 
employees.  Recognizing the cost of providing benefits and measuring the projected benefit obligation of these plans under applicable 
accounting guidance requires management to make various assumptions and estimates.

Based on the regulatory recovery mechanisms of Xcel Energy Inc.’s utility subsidiaries, certain unrecognized actuarial gains and 
losses and unrecognized prior service costs or credits are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities, rather than OCI.

See Note 9 for further discussion of benefit plans and other postretirement benefits.

Guarantees — Xcel Energy recognizes, upon issuance or modification of a guarantee, a liability for the fair market value of the 
obligation that has been assumed in issuing the guarantee.  This liability includes consideration of specific triggering events and other 
conditions which may modify the ongoing obligation to perform under the guarantee.

The obligation recognized is reduced over the term of the guarantee as Xcel Energy is released from risk under the guarantee.  See 
Note 13 for specific details of issued guarantees.

Subsequent Events — Management has evaluated the impact of events occurring after Dec. 31, 2017 up to the date of issuance of 
these consolidated financial statements.  These statements contain all necessary adjustments and disclosures resulting from that 
evaluation.

2.  Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Issued

Revenue Recognition — In May 2014, the FASB issued Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Topic 606 (ASU No. 2014-09), 
which provides a new framework for the recognition of revenue.  As the appropriate timing of recognition of revenue from contracts 
with customers in our regulated operations continues to generally be based on the delivery of electricity and natural gas, Xcel Energy’s 
adoption will primarily result in increased disclosures regarding sources of revenues, including alternative revenue programs.  The 
guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after Dec. 15, 2017.  Xcel Energy is implementing the standard on a 
modified retrospective basis, which requires application to contracts with customers effective Jan. 1, 2018.

Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments — In January 2016, the FASB issued Recognition and Measurement of 
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Subtopic 825-10 (ASU No. 2016-01), which eliminates the available-for-sale classification 
for marketable equity securities and also replaces the cost method of accounting for non-marketable equity securities with a model for 
recognizing impairments and observable price changes.  Under the new standard, other than when the consolidation or equity method 
of accounting is utilized, changes in the fair value of equity securities are to be recognized in earnings.  This guidance is effective for 
interim and annual reporting periods beginning after Dec. 15, 2017.  As a result of application of accounting principles for rate 
regulated entities, changes in the fair value of the securities in the nuclear decommissioning fund, historically classified as available-
for-sale, will continue to be deferred to a regulatory asset, and the overall impacts of the Jan. 1, 2018 adoption will not be material.

Leases — In February 2016, the FASB issued Leases, Topic 842 (ASU No. 2016-02), which for lessees requires balance sheet 
recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases.  This guidance will be effective for interim and annual reporting 
periods beginning after Dec. 15, 2018.  Xcel Energy has not yet fully determined the impacts of implementation.  However, adoption 
is expected to occur on Jan. 1, 2019 utilizing the practical expedients provided by the standard and proposed in Targeted 
Improvements, Topic 842 (Proposed ASU 2018-200).  As such, agreements entered prior to Jan. 1, 2019 that are currently considered 
leases are expected to be recognized on the consolidated balance sheet, including contracts for use of office space, equipment and 
natural gas storage assets, as well as certain purchased power agreements (PPAs) for natural gas-fueled generating facilities.  Xcel 
Energy expects that similar agreements entered after Dec. 31, 2018 will generally qualify as leases under the new standard.

91

Presentation of Net Periodic Benefit Cost — In March 2017, the FASB issued Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension 
Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, Topic 715 (ASU No. 2017-07), which establishes that only the service cost element 
of pension cost may be presented as a component of operating income in the income statement.  Also under the guidance, only the 
service cost component of pension cost is eligible for capitalization.  As a result of application of accounting principles for rate 
regulated entities, a similar amount of pension cost, including non-service components, will be recognized consistent with the 
historical ratemaking treatment and the impacts of adoption will be limited to changes in classification of non-service costs in the 
consolidated statement of income.  This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after Dec. 15, 2017.  

Recently Adopted

Stock Compensation — In March 2016, the FASB issued Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, Topic 718 
(ASU No. 2016-09), which simplifies accounting and financial statement presentation for share-based payment transactions.  The 
guidance requires that the difference between the tax deduction available upon settlement of share-based equity awards and the tax 
benefit accumulated over the vesting period be recognized as an adjustment to income tax expense.  Xcel Energy adopted the guidance 
in 2016, resulting in immaterial 2016 adjustments to income tax expense and changes in classification of cash flows related to tax 
withholding in the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2016 and prior presented periods.

Accounting for the TCJA — In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 Income Tax Accounting 
Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), to supplement the accounting requirements of ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes 
(ASC Topic 740) as it relates to assessing and recognizing the impacts of the TCJA in the period of enactment.  SAB 118 allows an 
entity to recognize provisional amounts in its financial statements in circumstances in which the entity’s assessment is incomplete, but 
for which a reasonable estimate can be made.  Provisional amounts recognized are subject to adjustment for up to one year from the 
enactment date.  For further details, see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.

Reporting Comprehensive Income — In February 2018, the FASB issued Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated 
Other Comprehensive Income, Topic 220 (ASU No. 2018-02), which addresses the stranded amounts of accumulated OCI which may 
result from enactment of a new tax law.  Though accumulated OCI is presented on a net-of-tax basis, ASC Topic 740 requires that the 
effects of new tax laws on items in accumulated OCI be recognized without a corresponding adjustment to accumulated OCI, and 
instead recorded to income tax expense.  ASU No. 2018-02 permits stranded amounts of accumulated OCI specifically resulting from 
the TCJA to be removed from accumulated OCI and reclassified to retained earnings, if elected.  Xcel Energy adopted the guidance in 
the fourth quarter of 2017, and elected to recognize a $22 million increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss and retained 
earnings in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended Dec. 31, 2017, related to a revaluation of deferred income tax 
assets and liabilities for items in accumulated other comprehensive loss, at the TCJA federal tax rate.

4.  Borrowings and Other Financing Instruments

Short-Term Borrowings

Money Pool — Xcel Energy Inc. and its utility subsidiaries have established a money pool arrangement that allows for short-term 
investments in and borrowings between the utility subsidiaries.  NSP-Wisconsin does not participate in the money pool.  Xcel Energy 
Inc. may make investments in the utility subsidiaries at market-based interest rates; however, the money pool arrangement does not 
allow the utility subsidiaries to make investments in Xcel Energy Inc.  The money pool balances are eliminated in consolidation.

Short-Term Debt — Xcel Energy Inc. and its utility subsidiaries meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the 
issuance of commercial paper and borrowings under their credit facilities and term loan.  Commercial paper and term loan borrowings 
outstanding for Xcel Energy were as follows:

Letters of Credit — Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries use letters of credit, generally with terms of one year, to provide financial 
guarantees for certain operating obligations.  As of Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, there were $30 million and $19 million of letters of credit 
outstanding, respectively, under the credit facilities.  The contract amounts of these letters of credit approximate their fair value and 
are subject to fees.

Credit Facilities — In order to use their commercial paper programs to fulfill short-term funding needs, Xcel Energy Inc. and its 
utility subsidiaries must have revolving credit facilities in place at least equal to the amount of their respective commercial paper 
borrowing limits and cannot issue commercial paper in an aggregate amount exceeding available capacity under these credit facilities.  
The lines of credit provide short-term financing in the form of notes payable to banks, letters of credit and back-up support for 
commercial paper borrowings.

SPS issued $300 million of 3.40 percent first mortgage bonds due Aug. 15, 2046; and

senior notes due Dec. 1, 2026.

Deferred Financing Costs — Deferred financing costs of approximately $119 million and $109 million, net of amortization, are 
presented as a deduction from the carrying amount of long-term debt as of Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Xcel Energy is 
amortizing these financing costs over the remaining maturity periods of the related debt.

Capital Stock — Xcel Energy Inc. has 7,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized to be issued with a $100 par value.  As of Dec. 
31, 2017 and 2016, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding.

The charters of PSCo and SPS authorize each subsidiary to issue 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with par values of $0.01 and 
$1.00 per share, respectively.  As of Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no preferred shares of subsidiaries outstanding.

Xcel Energy Inc. has 1 billion shares of common stock authorized to be issued with a $2.50 par value.  Outstanding shares as of Dec. 
31, 2017 and 2016 were 507,762,881 and 507,222,795, respectively.

Dividend and Other Capital-Related Restrictions — Xcel Energy depends on its subsidiaries to pay dividends.  All of Xcel Energy 
Inc.’s utility subsidiaries’ dividends are subject to the FERC’s jurisdiction, which prohibits the payment of dividends out of capital 
accounts; payment of dividends is allowed out of retained earnings only.  Due to certain restrictive covenants, Xcel Energy Inc. is 
required to be current on particular interest payments before dividends can be paid.

The most restrictive dividend limitations for NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin and SPS are imposed by their respective state regulatory 
commission.  PSCo’s dividends are subject to the FERC’s jurisdiction.

Only NSP-Minnesota has a first mortgage indenture which places certain restrictions on the amount of cash dividends it can pay to 
Xcel Energy Inc., the holder of its common stock.  Even with this restriction, NSP-Minnesota could have paid more than $1.9 billion 
and $1.7 billion in additional cash dividends to Xcel Energy Inc. as of Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

NSP-Minnesota’s state regulatory commissions indirectly limit the amount of dividends NSP-Minnesota can pay by requiring an 
equity-to-total capitalization ratio between 47.2 percent and 57.6 percent.  NSP-Minnesota’s equity-to-total capitalization ratio was 
52.1 percent at Dec. 31, 2017 and $1.1 billion in retained earnings was not restricted.  Total capitalization for NSP-Minnesota was 
$10.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2017, which did not exceed the limit of $11.2 billion.

95

NSP-Wisconsin cannot pay annual dividends in excess of approximately $53 million if its calendar year average equity-to-total 
capitalization ratio is or falls below the state commission authorized level as calculated by PSCW requirements.  NSP-Wisconsin’s 
calendar year average equity ratio calculated on this basis was 53.1 percent as of Dec. 31, 2017 and $19 million in retained earnings 
was not restricted.  NSP-Wisconsin’s authorized equity ratio was 52.5 percent for 2016 and 2017, but will be 51.5 percent for 2018.

SPS’ state regulatory commissions indirectly limit the amount of dividends that SPS can pay Xcel Energy Inc. by requiring an equity-
to-total capitalization ratio (excluding short-term debt) between 45.0 percent and 55.0 percent.  In addition, SPS may not pay a 
dividend that would cause it to lose its investment grade bond rating.  SPS’ equity ratio (excluding short-term debt) was 53.8 percent 
as of Dec. 31, 2017 and $542 million in retained earnings was not restricted.

The issuance of securities by Xcel Energy Inc. generally is not subject to regulatory approval.  However, utility financings and certain 
intra-system financings are subject to the jurisdiction of the applicable state regulatory commissions and/or the FERC.  As of Dec. 31, 
2017:

• 
• 

PSCo has authorization to issue up to an additional $1.8 billion of long-term debt and up to $800 million of short-term debt.
SPS has authorization to issue up to $500 million of short-term debt and SPS will file for additional long-term debt 
authorization.

•  NSP-Wisconsin has authorization to issue an additional $250 million of long-term debt and up to $150 million of short-term 

debt.

•  NSP-Minnesota has authorization to issue long-term securities provided the equity-to-total capitalization ratio remains between 
47.2 percent and 57.6 percent and to issue short-term debt provided it does not exceed 15 percent of total capitalization.  Total 
capitalization for NSP-Minnesota cannot exceed $11.2 billion.

Xcel Energy believes these authorizations are adequate and seeks additional authorization as necessary.

respective owners is responsible for providing its own financing.

6. 

Income Taxes

Federal Tax Reform — In December 2017, the TCJA was signed into law.  While the legislation will require interpretations and 
regulations to be issued by the IRS, the key provisions impacting Xcel Energy, generally beginning in 2018, include: 

•  Corporate federal tax rate reduction from 35 percent to 21 percent;
•  Normalization of resulting plant-related excess deferred taxes;
•  Elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax;
•  Continued interest expense deductibility and discontinued bonus depreciation for regulated public utilities;
•  Limitations on certain executive compensation deductions;
•  Limitations on certain deductions for NOLs arising after Dec. 31, 2017 (limited to 80 percent of taxable income); 
•  Repeal of the section 199 manufacturing deduction; and
•  Reduced deductions for meals and entertainment as well as state and local lobbying.

Entities are required under ASC Topic 740 to recognize the accounting impacts of a tax law change, including the impacts of a 
change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities, in the period including the date of the tax law enactment.  The SEC staff 
issued guidance in SAB 118 that supplements the accounting requirements of ASC Topic 740 if elements of the TCJA assessment 
are not complete, and provides for up to a one year period to finalize the required accounting.  Xcel Energy has estimated the 
effects of the TCJA, which have been reflected in the Dec. 31, 2017 consolidated financial statements.  Issuance of U.S. Treasury 
regulations interpreting the TCJA, other U.S. Treasury and IRS guidance or interpretations of the application of ASC Topic 740 
may result in changes to these estimates.  

Overall for Xcel Energy, reductions in deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the reduction in corporate federal tax rates result in 
a net tax benefit.  However, as a result of IRS requirements and past regulatory treatment of deferred taxes in the determination of 
regulated rates of the utility subsidiaries, including deferred taxes related to regulated plant and certain other deferred tax assets 
and liabilities, the impact was primarily recognized as a regulatory liability refundable to utility customers. 

The fourth quarter 2017 estimated accounting impacts of the December 2017 enactment of the new tax law at Xcel Energy 
included:

• 

• 

• 

$2.7 billion ($3.8 billion grossed-up for tax) of reclassifications of plant-related excess deferred taxes to regulatory 
liabilities upon valuation at the new 21 percent federal rate. The regulatory liabilities will be amortized consistent with 
IRS normalization requirements, resulting in customer refunds over an estimated weighted average period of 
approximately 30 years;
$254 million and $174 million of reclassifications (grossed-up for tax) of excess deferred taxes for non-plant related 
deferred tax assets and liabilities, respectively, to regulatory assets and liabilities; and 
$23 million of total estimated income tax expense related to the tax rate change on certain non-plant deferred taxes and all 
other 2017 income statement impacts of the federal tax reform.

97

Xcel Energy has accounted for the state tax impacts of federal tax reform based on currently enacted state tax laws.  Any future 
state tax law changes related to the TCJA will be accounted for in the periods state laws are enacted.

Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 — In December 2015, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (Act) was signed into 
law.  The Act provided for the following:

• 
• 

• 

Immediate expensing, or “bonus depreciation,” of 50 percent for property placed in service in 2015, 2016, and 2017;
PTCs at 100 percent of the applicable rate for wind energy projects that begin construction by the end of 2016; 80 percent 
of the credit rate for projects that begin construction in 2017; 60 percent of the credit rate for projects that begin 
construction in 2018; and 40 percent of the credit rate for projects that begin construction in 2019.  The wind energy PTC 
was not extended for projects that begin construction after 2019;
ITCs at 30 percent for commercial solar projects that begin construction by the end of 2019; 26 percent for projects that 
begin construction in 2020; 22 percent for projects that begin construction in 2021; and 10 percent for projects thereafter;

•  R&E credit was permanently extended; and
•  Delay of two years (until 2020) of the excise tax on certain employer-provided health insurance plans.

The accounting related to the Act was recorded beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 because a change in tax law is accounted 
for beginning in the period of enactment.  The fourth quarter 2015 accounting impacts included:

•  Recognition of additional tax deductions for bonus depreciation of $1.2 billion, and as a result, recognition of $5 million 

benefit related to a carryback claim (see additional discussion below) and $4 million expense related to valuation 
allowances and expirations of charitable contribution carryforwards; and

•  Recognition of $7 million benefit for federal R&E credits.

Federal Tax Loss Carryback Claims — In 2012-2015, Xcel Energy identified certain expenses related to 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 
2014 and 2015 that qualify for an extended carryback beyond the typical two-year carryback period.  As a result of a higher tax 
rate in prior years, Xcel Energy recognized a tax benefit of approximately $5 million in 2015, $17 million in 2014, $12 million in 
2013 and $15 million in 2012.

Federal Audit — Xcel Energy files a consolidated federal income tax return.  The statute of limitations applicable to Xcel Energy’s 
federal income tax returns expire as follows:

In 2012, the IRS commenced an examination of tax years 2010 and 2011, including the 2009 carryback claim.  The IRS proposed 
an adjustment to the federal tax loss carryback claims that would have resulted in $14 million of income tax expense for the 2009 
through 2011 claims, and the 2013 through 2015 claims.  In the fourth quarter of 2015, the IRS forwarded the issue to the Office of 
Appeals (“Appeals”).  In the third quarter of 2017, Xcel Energy and Appeals reached an agreement and the benefit related to the 
agreed upon portions was recognized.  As of Dec. 31, 2017, the case has been forwarded to the Joint Committee on Taxation.

In the third quarter of 2015, the IRS commenced an examination of tax years 2012 and 2013.  In the third quarter of 2017, the IRS 
concluded the audit of tax years 2012 and 2013 and proposed an adjustment that would impact Xcel Energy’s NOL and ETR.  
After evaluating the proposed adjustment, Xcel Energy filed a protest with the IRS.  Xcel Energy anticipates the issue will be 
forwarded to Appeals. As of Dec. 31, 2017, Xcel Energy has recognized its best estimate of income tax expense that will result 
from a final resolution of this issue; however, the outcome and timing of a resolution is uncertain.

State Audits — Xcel Energy files consolidated state tax returns based on income in its major operating jurisdictions of Colorado, 
Minnesota, Texas, and Wisconsin, and various other state income-based tax returns.  As of Dec. 31, 2017, Xcel Energy’s earliest 
open tax years that are subject to examination by state taxing authorities in its major operating jurisdictions were as follows:

In 2016, Minnesota began an audit of years 2010 through 2014. As of Dec. 31, 2017, Minnesota had not proposed any 
material adjustments.

In 2016, Texas began an audit of years 2009 and 2010, and in September 2017, began an audit of year 2011.  In the fourth 
quarter of 2017, Texas concluded these audits and Xcel Energy recognized the related benefit.

In 2016, Wisconsin began an audit of years 2012 and 2013. As of Dec. 31, 2017, Wisconsin had not proposed any material 
adjustments. 

As of Dec. 31, 2017, there were no other state income tax audits in progress.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits — The unrecognized tax benefit balance includes permanent tax positions, which if recognized would 
affect the annual ETR.  In addition, the unrecognized tax benefit balance includes temporary tax positions for which the ultimate 
deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.  A change in the period of 
deductibility would not affect the ETR but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period.

A reconciliation of the amount of unrecognized tax benefit is as follows:

It is reasonably possible that Xcel Energy’s amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months 
as the IRS Appeals progresses and audits resume, the Minnesota and Wisconsin audits progress, and other state audits resume.  As 
the IRS Appeals, Minnesota and Wisconsin audits progress, it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefit 
could decrease up to approximately $15 million.

The payable for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is partially offset by the interest benefit associated with NOL and tax

Basic EPS was computed by dividing the earnings available to Xcel Energy Inc.’s common shareholders by the weighted average 
number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted EPS was computed by dividing the earnings available to Xcel 
Energy Inc.’s common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  
Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common stock (i.e., common 
stock equivalents) were settled.  The weighted average number of potentially dilutive shares outstanding used to calculate Xcel Energy 
Inc.’s diluted EPS is calculated using the treasury stock method.

101

Common Stock Equivalents — Xcel Energy Inc. currently has common stock equivalents related to certain equity awards in share-
based compensation arrangements.  Common stock equivalents causing a dilutive impact to EPS include commitments to issue 
common stock related to time based equity compensation awards.  Effective August 2015, 401(k) matching contributions are settled in 
cash for all Xcel Energy employee groups.

Stock equivalent units granted to Xcel Energy Inc.’s Board of Directors are included in common shares outstanding upon grant date as 
there is no further service, performance or market condition associated with these awards.  Restricted stock, granted to settle amounts 
due to certain employees under the Xcel Energy Inc. Executive Annual Incentive Award Plan, is included in common shares 
outstanding when granted.

Share-based compensation arrangements for which there is currently no dilutive impact to EPS include the following:

•  Equity awards subject to a performance condition; included in common shares outstanding when all necessary conditions for 

settlement have been satisfied by the end of the reporting period.

•  Liability awards subject to a performance condition; any portions settled in shares are included in common shares 

outstanding upon settlement.

Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan and Stock Compensation Settlements — In 2015, the Xcel Energy Inc. Board of 
Directors authorized open market purchases by the plan administrator as the source of shares for the dividend reinvestment program as 
well as market purchases of up to 3.0 million shares for stock compensation plan settlements.  In 2017, Xcel Energy Inc. repurchased 
approximately 0.1 million shares of common stock in the open market at a total cost of approximately $3 million.

8.  Share-Based Compensation

Restricted Stock — Certain employees may elect to receive shares of common or restricted stock under the Xcel Energy Inc. 
Executive Annual Incentive Award Plan and the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan (effective May 20, 2015).  Restricted stock is treated as 
an equity award and vests and settles in equal annual installments over a three-year period.  Xcel Energy Inc. reinvests dividends on 
the restricted stock while restrictions are in place.  Restrictions also apply to the additional shares of restricted stock acquired through 
dividend reinvestment.  If the restricted shares are forfeited, the employee is not entitled to the dividends on those shares.  Restricted 
stock has a fair value equal to the market trading price of Xcel Energy Inc.’s stock at the grant date.

Xcel Energy Inc. granted shares of restricted stock for the years ended Dec. 31 as follows:

Other Equity Awards — Xcel Energy Inc.’s Board of Directors has granted equity awards under the Xcel Energy Inc. 2005 Long-
Term Incentive Plan (as amended and restated in 2010) and the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan (effective May 20, 2015).  These plans 
allow the attachment of various vesting conditions and performance goals to the awards granted.  The vesting conditions and 
performance goals may vary by plan year.  At the end of the restricted period, such grants will be awarded if the vesting conditions 
and/or performance goals are met. 

Commencing in 2014, certain employees were granted equity awards with one portion of shares subject only to service conditions, and 
the other portion subject to performance conditions.  Inclusive of other grants of time-based awards, a total of 0.3 million time-based 
equity shares subject only to service conditions were granted annually in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  Other than shares 
associated with these time-based awards and restricted stock, payout of all other employee equity awards and the lapsing of 
restrictions on the transfer of units are based on the achievement of performance criteria.

The performance conditions for a portion of the awards granted from 2015 to 2017 are based on relative TSR, measured identically to 
TSR liability awards granted in those years, and measurement of performance for a portion of units awarded from 2011 to 2013 is 
based on EPS growth with an additional condition that Xcel Energy Inc.’s annual dividend paid on its common stock remains at a 
specified amount per share or greater.  The performance conditions for the remaining employee equity awards are based on 
environmental goals.  Equity awards with performance conditions awarded from 2011 to 2017, plus associated dividend equivalents, 
will be settled or forfeited and the restricted period will lapse after three years, with potential payouts ranging from zero to 150 percent 
for 2011 to 2013 grants, and zero to 200 percent for 2014 to 2017 grants, depending on the level of achievement.

•  The 2012 awards measured on EPS growth and the 2012 environmental awards met their targets as of Dec. 31, 2014, and 

were settled in shares in February 2015.

•  The 2013 awards measured on EPS growth, the 2013 environmental awards and the 2013 time-based awards met their targets 

as of Dec. 31, 2015, and were settled in shares in February 2016.

•  The 2014 environmental awards and the 2014 time-based awards met their targets as of Dec. 31, 2016, and were settled in

Stock Equivalent Units — Non-employee members of the Xcel Energy Inc. Board of Directors receive annual awards of stock 
equivalent units, with each unit having a value equal to one share of Xcel Energy Inc. common stock.  The annual grants are vested as 
of the date of each member’s election to the Board of Directors; there is no further service or other condition attached to the annual 
grants.  Additionally, directors may elect to receive their fees in stock equivalent units in lieu of cash.  Dividends on Xcel Energy 
Inc.’s common stock are converted to stock equivalent units and granted based on the number of stock equivalent units held by each 
participant as of the dividend date.  The stock equivalent units are payable as a distribution of Xcel Energy Inc.’s common stock upon 
a director’s termination of service.

The stock equivalent units granted for the years ended Dec. 31 were as follows:

TSR Liability Awards — Xcel Energy Inc.’s Board of Directors has granted TSR liability awards under the Xcel Energy Inc. 2005 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (as amended and restated effective in 2010) and 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan.  The plans allow Xcel 
Energy to attach various performance goals to the awards granted.  The liability awards granted have been historically dependent on a 
single measure of performance, Xcel Energy Inc.’s relative TSR measured over a three-year period.  For 2017, 2016 and 2015 awards, 
Xcel Energy Inc.’s TSR is compared to the TSR of other companies in a 22-member utilities peer group. At the end of the three-year 
period, potential payouts of the awards range from zero to 200 percent, depending on Xcel Energy Inc.’s TSR compared to the 
applicable peer group or index.

The TSR liability awards granted for the years ended Dec. 31 were as follows:

Share-Based Compensation Expense — Other than for restricted stock, the vesting of employee equity awards is generally predicated 
on the achievement of a performance condition, which is the achievement of a TSR, EPS or environmental measures target.  
Additionally, approximately 0.3 million of equity award units were granted annually in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, with 
vesting subject only to service conditions for periods of three years.  Generally, all of these instruments are considered to be equity 
awards since the plan settlement determination (shares or cash) resides with Xcel Energy and not the participants.  In addition, these 
awards have not been previously settled in cash and Xcel Energy plans to continue electing share settlement.  The grant date fair value 
of equity awards is expensed over the service period as employees vest in their rights to those awards.

The TSR liability awards have been historically settled partially in cash, and do not qualify as equity awards, but rather are accounted 
for as liabilities.  As liability awards, the fair value on which ratable expense is based, as employees vest in their rights to those 
awards, is remeasured each period based on the current stock price and performance achievement, and final expense is based on the 
market value of the shares on the date the award is settled.

The maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the Xcel Energy Inc. 2015 Omnibus 
Incentive Plan (effective May 20, 2015) is 7.0 million shares.  The maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock available 
for issuance under the Xcel Energy Inc. 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan (as amended and restated effective Feb. 17, 2010) is 8.3 
million shares.  Under the Xcel Energy Inc. Executive Annual Incentive Award Plan (as amended and restated effective Feb. 17, 2010), 
the total number of shares approved for issuance is 1.2 million shares.

As of Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, there was approximately $44 million and $29 million, respectively, of total unrecognized compensation 
cost related to nonvested share-based compensation awards.  Xcel Energy expects to recognize the amount unrecognized at Dec. 31, 
2017 over a weighted average period of 1.7 years.

9.     Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

Xcel Energy offers various benefit plans to its employees.  Approximately 46 percent of employees that receive benefits are 
represented by several local labor unions under several collective-bargaining agreements.  As of Dec. 31, 2017:

•  NSP-Minnesota had 1,858 and NSP-Wisconsin had 383 bargaining employees covered under a collective-bargaining 

agreement, which expires in December 2019.  NSP-Minnesota also had an additional 248 nuclear operation bargaining 
employees covered under several collective-bargaining agreements.  These agreements expire in 2018 and 2019. 
PSCo had 1,835 bargaining employees covered under a collective-bargaining agreement, which expired in May 2017.  
While collective bargaining is ongoing, the terms and conditions of the agreement are automatically extended.
SPS had 791 bargaining employees covered under a collective-bargaining agreement, which expires in October 2019. 

• 

• 

The plans invest in various instruments which are disclosed under the accounting guidance for fair value measurements which 
establishes a hierarchical framework for disclosing the observability of the inputs utilized in measuring fair value.  The three levels 
in the hierarchy and examples of each level are as follows:

Level 1 — Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets as of the reporting date.  The types of assets 
included in Level 1 are highly liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices.

Level 2 — Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, but are either directly or indirectly observable as 
of the reporting date.  The types of assets included in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively traded securities 
or contracts, or priced with models using highly observable inputs.

Level 3 — Significant inputs to pricing have little or no observability as of the reporting date.  The types of assets 
included in Level 3 are those with inputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation.

Specific valuation methods include the following:

Cash equivalents — The fair values of cash equivalents are generally based on cost plus accrued interest; money market funds are 
measured using quoted NAVs.

Insurance contracts — Insurance contract fair values take into consideration the value of the investments in separate accounts of 
the insurer, which are priced based on observable inputs.

Investments in commingled funds, equity securities and other funds — Equity securities are valued using quoted prices in active 
markets.  The fair values for commingled funds are measured using NAVs, which take into consideration the value of underlying 
fund investments, as well as the other accrued assets and liabilities of a fund, in order to determine a per share market value.  The 
investments in commingled funds may be redeemed for NAV with proper notice.  Proper notice varies by fund and can range from 
daily with a few days’ notice to annually with 90 days’ notice.  Private equity investments require approval of the fund for any 
unscheduled redemption, and such redemptions may be approved or denied by the fund at its sole discretion.  Depending on the 
fund, unscheduled distributions from real estate investments may require approval of the fund or may be redeemed with proper 
notice, which is typically quarterly with 45-90 days’ notice; however, withdrawals from real estate investments may be delayed or 
discounted as a result of fund illiquidity. 

105

Investments in debt securities — Fair values for debt securities are determined by a third party pricing service using recent trades 
and observable spreads from benchmark interest rates for similar securities.

Derivative Instruments — Fair values for foreign currency derivatives are determined using pricing models based on the prevailing 
forward exchange rate of the underlying currencies.  The fair values of interest rate derivatives are based on broker quotes that 
utilize current market interest rate forecasts.

Pension Benefits

Xcel Energy has several noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans that cover almost all employees.  Generally, benefits are 
based on a combination of years of service, the employee’s average pay and, in some cases, social security benefits.  Xcel Energy’s 
policy is to fully fund into an external trust the actuarially determined pension costs recognized for ratemaking and financial 
reporting purposes, subject to the limitations of applicable employee benefit and tax laws.

In addition to the qualified pension plans, Xcel Energy maintains a supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) and a 
nonqualified pension plan.  The SERP is maintained for certain executives that were participants in the plan in 2008, when the 
SERP was closed to new participants.  The nonqualified pension plan provides unfunded, nonqualified benefits for compensation 
that is in excess of the limits applicable to the qualified pension plans, with distributions funded by Xcel Energy’s consolidated 
operating cash flows.  The total obligations of the SERP and nonqualified plan as of Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016 were $37 million and 
$44 million, respectively.  In 2017 and 2016, Xcel Energy recognized net benefit cost for financial reporting for the SERP and 
nonqualified plans of $5 million and $8 million, respectively. 

In 2016, Xcel Energy established rabbi trusts to provide partial funding for future distributions of the SERP and its deferred 
compensation plan, supplemented by Xcel Energy’s consolidated operating cash flows as determined necessary.  For more 
information regarding the funding of rabbi trusts, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.  Also in 2016, Xcel Energy 
amended the deferred compensation plan to provide eligible participants the ability to diversify deferred settlements of equity 
awards, other than time-based equity awards, into various fund options. 

Xcel Energy bases the investment-return assumption on expected long-term performance for each of the investment types included 
in its pension asset portfolio.  Xcel Energy considers the historical returns achieved by its asset portfolio over the past 20-year or 
longer period, as well as the long-term return levels projected and recommended by investment experts.  Xcel Energy continually 
reviews its pension assumptions.  The pension cost determination assumes a forecasted mix of investment types over the long-term.

• 
• 
• 
• 

Investment returns in 2017 were above the assumed level of 6.87 percent;
Investment returns in 2016 were below the assumed level of 6.87 percent;
Investment returns in 2015 were below the assumed level of 7.09 percent; and
In 2018, Xcel Energy’s expected investment-return assumption is 6.87 percent.

The assets are invested in a portfolio according to Xcel Energy’s return, liquidity and diversification objectives to provide funding 
for plan obligations and minimize contributions to the plan, within appropriate levels of risk.  The principal mechanism for 
achieving these objectives is the projected asset allocation given the long-term risk, return, and liquidity characteristics of each 
particular asset class.  There were no significant concentrations of risk in any particular industry, index, or entity.  Market volatility 
can impact even well-diversified portfolios and significantly affect the return levels achieved by pension assets in any year.

The following table presents the target pension asset allocations for Xcel Energy at Dec. 31 for the upcoming year:

Xcel Energy’s ongoing investment strategy is based on plan-specific investment recommendations that seek to minimize potential 
investment and interest rate risk as a plan’s funded status increases over time.  The investment recommendations result in a greater 
percentage of long-duration fixed income securities being allocated to specific plans having relatively higher funded status ratios 
and a greater percentage of growth assets being allocated to plans having relatively lower funded status ratios.  The aggregate 
projected asset allocation presented in the table above for the master pension trust results from the plan-specific strategies.

Mortality — In 2014, the Society of Actuaries published a new mortality table (RP-2014) that increased the overall life expectancy 
of males and females.  In 2014, Xcel Energy adopted this mortality table, with modifications, based on its population and specific 
experience.  During 2017, a new projection table was released (MP-2017).  Xcel Energy evaluated the updated projection table and 
concluded that the methodology currently in use and adopted in 2016 is consistent with the recently updated 2017 table and 
continues to be representative of Xcel Energy’s population.

Cash Flows — Cash funding requirements can be impacted by changes to actuarial assumptions, actual asset levels and other 
calculations prescribed by the funding requirements of income tax and other pension-related regulations.  Required contributions 
were made in 2015 through 2018 to meet minimum funding requirements.

Total voluntary and required pension funding contributions across all four of Xcel Energy’s pension plans were as follows:

• 
• 
• 
• 

$150 million in January 2018;
$162 million in 2017; 
$125 million in 2016; and
$90 million in 2015. 

For future years, Xcel Energy anticipates contributions will be made as necessary.

Plan Amendments — Xcel Energy amended the Xcel Energy Pension Plan and Xcel Energy Inc. Nonbargaining Pension Plan 
(South) in 2017 to reduce supplemental benefits for non-bargaining participants as well as to allow the transfer of a portion of non-
qualified pension obligations into the qualified plans.  In 2016, the Xcel Energy Pension Plan was amended to change the discount 
rate basis for lump-sum conversion to annuity participants and annuity conversion to lump-sum participants.  Additionally in 2016, 
the annual credits contributed to the PSCo Bargaining Plan retirement spending account increased.

(a)  A settlement charge is required when the amount of all lump-sum distributions during the year is greater than the sum of the service and interest cost 

components of the annual net periodic pension cost.  In the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of lump-sum distributions during the 2017 plan year, Xcel 
Energy recorded a total pension settlement charge of $81 million, the majority of which was not recognized due to the effects of regulation.  A total of $8 
million of that amount was recorded in O&M expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Pension costs include an expected return impact for the current year that may differ from actual investment performance in the 
plan.  The return assumption used for 2018 pension cost calculations is 6.87 percent.

Defined Contribution Plans

Xcel Energy maintains 401(k) and other defined contribution plans that cover substantially all employees.  Total expense to these 
plans was approximately $37 million in 2017, $36 million in 2016 and $34 million in 2015.

Postretirement Health Care Benefits

Xcel Energy has a contributory health and welfare benefit plan that provides health care and death benefits to certain Xcel Energy 
retirees.

•  NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin discontinued contributing toward health care benefits for non-bargaining employees 

retiring after 1998 and for bargaining employees who retired after 1999.

•  Xcel Energy discontinued contributing toward health care benefits for nonbargaining employees of the former NCE who 

retired after June 30, 2003 and for PSCo bargaining employees hired on or after July 1, 2003.

•  Xcel Energy discontinued contributing toward health care benefits for SPS bargaining employees hired on or after Jan. 1, 

2012. 

Plan Assets — Certain state agencies that regulate Xcel Energy Inc.’s utility subsidiaries also have issued guidelines related to the 
funding of postretirement benefit costs.  SPS is required to fund postretirement benefit costs for Texas and New Mexico 
jurisdictional amounts collected in rates. PSCo is required to fund postretirement benefit costs in irrevocable external trusts that are 
dedicated to the payment of these postretirement benefits.  These assets are invested in a manner consistent with the investment 
strategy for the pension plan.

The following table presents the target postretirement asset allocations for Xcel Energy at Dec. 31 for the upcoming year:

Xcel Energy bases its investment-return assumption for the postretirement health care fund assets on expected long-term 
performance for each of the investment types included in its asset portfolio.  The assets are invested in a portfolio according to 
Xcel Energy’s return, liquidity and diversification objectives to provide a source of funding for plan obligations and minimize 
contributions to the plan, within appropriate levels of risk.  The principal mechanism for achieving these objectives is the projected 
asset allocation given the long-term risk, return, correlation and liquidity characteristics of each particular asset class.  There were 
no significant concentrations of risk in any particular industry, index, or entity.  Market volatility can impact even well-diversified 
portfolios and significantly affect the return levels achieved by postretirement health care assets in any year.

The following tables present, for each of the fair value hierarchy levels, Xcel Energy’s postretirement benefit plan assets that are 
measured at fair value as of Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016:

Beginning with the Dec. 31, 2017 measurement, Xcel Energy Inc. separated its initial medical trend assumption for pre-Medicare 
(Pre-65) and post-Medicare (Post-65) claims costs in order to reflect different short-term expectations based on recent experience 
differences.  The Post-65 initial medical trend rate was set at 5.5 percent. The Pre-65 initial medical trend rate was set at 7.0 
percent. The ultimate trend assumption remained at 4.5 percent for both groups.  The period until the ultimate rate is reached is five 
years.  Xcel Energy bases its medical trend assumption on the long-term cost inflation expected in the health care market, 
considering the levels projected and recommended by industry experts, as well as recent actual medical cost increases experienced 
by Xcel Energy’s retiree medical plan.

A one-percent change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects on Xcel Energy:

Cash Flows — The postretirement health care plans have no funding requirements under income tax and other retirement-related 
regulations other than fulfilling benefit payment obligations, when claims are presented and approved under the plans.  Additional 
cash funding requirements are prescribed by certain state and federal rate regulatory authorities.  Xcel Energy contributed $20 
million during 2017, $18 million during 2016, $18 million during 2015 and expects to contribute approximately $12 million during 
2018.

Plan Amendments — In 2017 and 2016, there were no plan amendments made which affected the benefit obligation.

NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin each contribute to several union multiemployer pension and other postretirement benefit 
plans, none of which are individually significant.  These plans provide pension and postretirement health care benefits to certain 
union employees who may perform services for multiple employers and do not participate in the NSP-Minnesota and NSP-
Wisconsin sponsored pension and postretirement health care plans.  Contributing to these types of plans creates risk that differs 
from providing benefits under NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin sponsored plans, in that if another participating employer 
ceases to contribute to a multiemployer plan, additional unfunded obligations may need to be funded over time by remaining 
participating employers.

Contributions to multiemployer plans were as follows for the years ended Dec. 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.  The average number of 
NSP-Minnesota union employees covered by the multiemployer pension plans decreased to approximately 576 in 2017 from 700 
in 2016.  There were no other significant changes to the nature or magnitude of the participation of NSP-Minnesota and NSP-
Wisconsin in multiemployer plans for the years presented:

11.  Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities

Fair Value Measurements

The accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures provides a single definition of fair value and requires certain 
disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value.  A hierarchical framework for disclosing the observability of the inputs 
utilized in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value is established by this guidance.  The three levels in the hierarchy are as follows:

Level 1 — Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.  The types 
of assets and liabilities included in Level 1 are highly liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices.

Level 2 — Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, but are either directly or indirectly observable as of 
the reporting date.  The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively traded 
securities or contracts, or priced with models using highly observable inputs.

Level 3 — Significant inputs to pricing have little or no observability as of the reporting date.  The types of assets and 
liabilities included in Level 3 are those valued with models requiring significant management judgment or estimation.

Specific valuation methods include the following:

Cash equivalents — The fair values of cash equivalents are generally based on cost plus accrued interest; money market funds are 
measured using quoted NAV.

Investments in equity securities and other funds — Equity securities are valued using quoted prices in active markets.  The fair values 
for commingled funds are measured using NAVs, which take into consideration the value of underlying fund investments, as well as 
the other accrued assets and liabilities of a fund, in order to determine a per-share market value.  The investments in commingled 
funds may be redeemed for NAV with proper notice.  Proper notice varies by fund and can range from daily with one or two days 
notice to annually with 90 days notice.  Private equity investments require approval of the fund for any unscheduled redemption, and 
such redemptions may be approved or denied by the fund at its sole discretion.  Unscheduled distributions from real estate investments 
may be redeemed with proper notice, which is typically quarterly with 45-90 days notice; however, withdrawals from real estate 
investments may be delayed or discounted as a result of fund illiquidity. 

Investments in debt securities — Fair values for debt securities are determined by a third party pricing service using recent trades and 
observable spreads from benchmark interest rates for similar securities.

Interest rate derivatives — The fair values of interest rate derivatives are based on broker quotes that utilize current market interest 
rate forecasts.

Commodity derivatives — The methods used to measure the fair value of commodity derivative forwards and options utilize forward 
prices and volatilities, as well as pricing adjustments for specific delivery locations, and are generally assigned a Level 2 
classification.  When contractual settlements relate to inactive delivery locations or extend to periods beyond those readily observable 
on active exchanges or quoted by brokers, the significance of the use of less observable forecasts of forward prices and volatilities on 
a valuation is evaluated, and may result in Level 3 classification.

Electric commodity derivatives held by NSP-Minnesota and SPS include transmission congestion instruments, generally referred to as 
FTRs.  FTRs purchased from a RTO are financial instruments that entitle or obligate the holder to monthly revenues or charges based 
on transmission congestion across a given transmission path.  The value of an FTR is derived from, and designed to offset, the cost of 
transmission congestion.  In addition to overall transmission load, congestion is also influenced by the operating schedules of power 
plants and the consumption of electricity pertinent to a given transmission path.  Unplanned plant outages, scheduled plant 
maintenance, changes in the relative costs of fuels used in generation, weather and overall changes in demand for electricity can each 
impact the operating schedules of the power plants on the transmission grid and the value of an FTR. 

114

If forecasted costs of electric transmission congestion increase or decrease for a given FTR path, the value of that particular FTR 
instrument will likewise increase or decrease.  Given the limited observability of important inputs to the value of FTRs between 
auction processes, including expected plant operating schedules and retail and wholesale demand, fair value measurements for FTRs 
have been assigned a Level 3.  Non-trading monthly FTR settlements are included in fuel and purchased energy cost recovery 
mechanisms as applicable in each jurisdiction, and therefore changes in the fair value of the yet to be settled portions of most FTRs are 
deferred as a regulatory asset or liability.  Given this regulatory treatment and the limited magnitude of FTRs relative to the electric 
utility operations of NSP-Minnesota and SPS, the numerous unobservable quantitative inputs pertinent to the value of FTRs are 
insignificant to the consolidated financial statements of Xcel Energy.

Non-Derivative Instruments Fair Value Measurements

The NRC requires NSP-Minnesota to maintain a portfolio of investments to fund the costs of decommissioning its nuclear generating 
plants.  Together with all accumulated earnings or losses, the assets of the nuclear decommissioning fund are legally restricted for the 
purpose of decommissioning the Monticello and PI nuclear generating plants.  The fund contains cash equivalents, debt securities, 
equity securities and other investments – all classified as available-for-sale.  NSP-Minnesota plans to reinvest matured securities until 
decommissioning begins.  NSP-Minnesota uses the MPUC approved asset allocation for the escrow and investment targets by asset 
class for both the escrow and qualified trust.

NSP-Minnesota recognizes the costs of funding the decommissioning of its nuclear generating plants over the lives of the plants, 
assuming rate recovery of all costs.  Given the purpose and legal restrictions on the use of nuclear decommissioning fund assets, 
realized and unrealized gains on fund investments over the life of the fund are deferred as an offset of NSP-Minnesota’s regulatory 
asset for nuclear decommissioning costs.  Consequently, any realized and unrealized gains and losses on securities in the nuclear 
decommissioning fund, including any other-than-temporary impairments, are deferred as a component of the regulatory asset for 
nuclear decommissioning.

Unrealized gains for the nuclear decommissioning fund were $560 million and $379 million as of Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, 
respectively, and unrealized losses and amounts recorded as other-than-temporary impairments were $7 million and $47 million as of 
Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The following tables present the cost and fair value of Xcel Energy’s non-derivative instruments with recurring fair value 
measurements in the nuclear decommissioning fund as of Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016:

Derivative Instruments Fair Value Measurements

Xcel Energy enters into derivative instruments, including forward contracts, futures, swaps and options, for trading purposes and to 
manage risk in connection with changes in interest rates, utility commodity prices and vehicle fuel prices.

Interest Rate Derivatives — Xcel Energy enters into various instruments that effectively fix the interest payments on certain floating 
rate debt obligations or effectively fix the yield or price on a specified benchmark interest rate for an anticipated debt issuance for a 
specific period.  These derivative instruments are generally designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes.

As of Dec. 31, 2017, accumulated other comprehensive losses related to interest rate derivatives included $3 million of net losses 
expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months as the related hedged interest rate transactions impact earnings, 
including forecasted amounts for unsettled hedges, as applicable.

Wholesale and Commodity Trading Risk — Xcel Energy Inc.’s utility subsidiaries conduct various wholesale and commodity trading 
activities, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, energy-related instruments and natural gas-related instruments, 
including derivatives.  Xcel Energy’s risk management policy allows management to conduct these activities within guidelines and 
limitations as approved by its risk management committee, which is made up of management personnel not directly involved in the 
activities governed by this policy.

Commodity Derivatives — Xcel Energy enters into derivative instruments to manage variability of future cash flows from changes in 
commodity prices in its electric and natural gas operations, as well as for trading purposes.  This could include the purchase or sale of 
energy or energy-related products, natural gas to generate electric energy, natural gas for resale, FTRs, vehicle fuel and weather 
derivatives.

As of Dec. 31, 2017, Xcel Energy had various vehicle fuel contracts designated as cash flow hedges extending through December 
2018.  Xcel Energy enters into derivative instruments that mitigate commodity price risk on behalf of electric and natural gas 
customers, but may not be designated as qualifying hedging transactions.  Changes in the fair value of non-trading commodity 
derivative instruments are recorded in OCI or deferred as a regulatory asset or liability.  The classification as a regulatory asset or 
liability is based on commission approved regulatory recovery mechanisms.  Xcel Energy recorded immaterial amounts to income 
related to the ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges for the years ended Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016.

As of Dec. 31, 2017, net gains related to commodity derivative cash flow hedges recorded as a component of accumulated other 
comprehensive losses included immaterial net gains expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months as the hedged 
transactions occur.  

Additionally, Xcel Energy enters into commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes not directly related to commodity price 
risks associated with serving its electric and natural gas customers.  Changes in the fair value of these commodity derivatives are 
recorded in electric operating revenues, net of amounts credited to customers under margin-sharing mechanisms.

The following table details the gross notional amounts of commodity forwards, options and FTRs as of Dec. 31:

Consideration of Credit Risk and Concentrations — Xcel Energy continuously monitors the creditworthiness of the counterparties to 
its interest rate derivatives and commodity derivative contracts prior to settlement, and assesses each counterparty’s ability to perform 
on the transactions set forth in the contracts.  Given this assessment, as well as an assessment of the impact of Xcel Energy’s own 
credit risk when determining the fair value of derivative liabilities, the impact of credit risk was immaterial to the fair value of 
unsettled commodity derivatives presented in the consolidated balance sheets.

Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries employ additional credit risk control mechanisms when appropriate, such as letters of credit, 
parental guarantees, standardized master netting agreements and termination provisions that allow for offsetting of positive and 
negative exposures.  Credit exposure is monitored and, when necessary, the activity with a specific counterparty is limited until credit 
enhancement is provided.

Xcel Energy’s utility subsidiaries’ most significant concentrations of credit risk with particular entities or industries are contracts with 
counterparties to their wholesale, trading and non-trading commodity activities.  As of Dec. 31, 2017, four of Xcel Energy’s 10 most 
significant counterparties for these activities, comprising $45 million or 29 percent of this credit exposure, had investment grade credit 
ratings from S&P’s, Moody’s or Fitch Ratings.  Five of the 10 most significant counterparties, comprising $30 million or 19 percent of 
this credit exposure, were not rated by these external agencies, but based on Xcel Energy’s internal analysis, had credit quality 
consistent with investment grade.  Another of these significant counterparties, comprising $7 million or 5 percent of this credit 
exposure, had credit quality less than investment grade, based on ratings from external analysis.  Eight of these significant 
counterparties are municipal or cooperative electric entities or other utilities.

Financial Impact of Qualifying Cash Flow Hedges — The impact of qualifying interest rate and vehicle fuel cash flow hedges on 
Xcel Energy’s accumulated other comprehensive loss, included in the consolidated statements of common stockholders’ equity and in 
the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, is detailed in the following table:

(a)  Amounts are recorded to interest charges.
(b)  Amounts are recorded to electric operating revenues.  Portions of these gains and losses are subject to sharing with electric customers through margin-sharing 

mechanisms and deducted from gross revenue, as appropriate.

(c)  Amounts are recorded to electric fuel and purchased power.  These derivative settlement gains and losses are shared with electric customers through fuel and 

purchased energy cost-recovery mechanisms, and reclassified out of income as regulatory assets or liabilities, as appropriate.

(d)  Certain derivatives are utilized to mitigate natural gas price risk for electric generation and are recorded to electric fuel and purchased power, subject to cost-

recovery mechanisms and reclassified to a regulatory asset, as appropriate.  Amounts for the years ended Dec. 31, 2017 and Dec. 31, 2016 included immaterial 
settlement gains and losses.  Amounts for the year ended Dec. 31, 2015 included $1 million of settlement losses.  The remaining settlement losses for the years 
ended Dec. 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 relate to natural gas operations and are recorded to cost of natural gas sold and transported.  These losses are subject to cost-
recovery mechanisms and reclassified out of income to a regulatory asset, as appropriate.

Xcel Energy had no derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges during the years ended Dec. 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.  
Therefore, no gains or losses from fair value hedges or related hedged transactions were recognized for these periods.

Credit Related Contingent Features — Contract provisions for derivative instruments that the utility subsidiaries enter, including 
those accounted for as normal purchase-normal sale contracts and therefore not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets, may 
require the posting of collateral or settlement of the contracts for various reasons, including if the applicable utility subsidiary’s credit 
ratings are downgraded below its investment grade credit rating by any of the major credit rating agencies or for cross default 
contractual provisions that could result in the settlement of such contracts if there was a failure under other financing arrangements 
related to payment terms or other covenants.  As of Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no derivative instruments in a material liability 
position with such underlying contract provisions.

119

Certain derivative instruments are also subject to contract provisions that contain adequate assurance clauses.  These provisions allow 
counterparties to seek performance assurance, including cash collateral, in the event that a given utility subsidiary’s ability to fulfill its 
contractual obligations is reasonably expected to be impaired.  Xcel Energy had no collateral posted related to adequate assurance 
clauses in derivative contracts as of Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016.

The fair value of Xcel Energy’s long-term debt is estimated based on recent trades and observable spreads from benchmark interest 
rates for similar securities.  The fair value estimates are based on information available to management as of Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, 
and given the observability of the inputs to these estimates, the fair values presented for long-term debt have been assigned a Level 2.

12.  Rate Matters

Tax Reform — Regulatory Proceedings

The specific impacts of the TCJA on retail customer rates are subject to regulatory approval.  Xcel Energy is in the process of 
quantifying the rate impacts of the TCJA and addressing these impacts in its open and recently concluded proceedings focused on 
retail base rate impacts for its utility subsidiaries.  In addition, several states have opened dockets on the impact of tax reform, with the 
expectation that currently effective rates in those jurisdictions will be adjusted.

NSP-Minnesota — A docket has been opened in Minnesota.  NSP-Minnesota will provide a detailed filing to the MPUC by March 2, 
2018, which will estimate the impact of the TCJA on the latest electric and natural gas rate case filings and corporate forecasts.  

Dockets have also been opened in North Dakota and South Dakota.  In February 2018, NSP-Minnesota provided the NDPSC a 
preliminary quantification of the impact of the TCJA on electric and natural gas revenue requirements.  NSP-Minnesota proposed 
multi-year moratoriums on electric and natural gas rate case filings.  NSP-Minnesota also filed comments with the SDPUC and 
proposed using the reduced revenue requirements from the TCJA to defer planned future rate filings. 

NSP-Wisconsin — In January 2018, the PSCW issued an order requiring public utilities to apply deferred accounting for the impacts 
of the TCJA.  The PSCW has also requested that utilities provide responses to questions on tax reform and its impact on electric and 
natural gas revenue requirements.  In February 2018, NSP-Wisconsin proposed levelizing upcoming rate cases, advancing 
infrastructure investments and buying down assets such as the regulatory asset for Ashland clean-up.

PSCo — The impacts associated with the TCJA on PSCO’s retail customer rates are being addressed in several proceedings, which 
include the following:

•  Colorado Statewide TCJA Proceeding — On Jan. 31, 2018, the CPUC opened a statewide TCJA proceeding and ordered 

deferred accounting for all investor-owned utilities.  On Feb. 21, 2017, PSCo filed a response with the CPUC related to the  
deferred accounting order and statewide TCJA proceeding, addressing the estimated impacts along with other considerations 
given PSCo’s pending natural gas and electric rate cases.

•  Colorado 2017 Multi-Year Natural Gas Rate Case — On Feb. 14, 2018, the ALJ approved PSCo and CPUC Staff’s non-
unanimous settlement agreement which addresses the impacts of the TCJA in 2018.  This settlement agreement includes a 
$20 million reduction to provisional rates effective March 1, 2018, with future true-ups to be determined later in 2018 once a 
full analysis of the comprehensive impacts of tax reform is performed, including any outcomes associated with statewide 
proceeding.  The final true-up would provide customers the full net benefit of the TCJA effective Jan. 1, 2018.

•  Colorado 2017 Multi-Year Electric Rate Case — On Feb. 16, 2018, the CPUC denied the proposed settlement agreement 

between PSCo and several intervenors, in favor of the state TCJA proceeding.  In the second quarter of 2018, PSCo plans to 
file a revised rate request that will include the impacts of the TCJA.  Provisional rates, subject to refund with interest, are 
expected to be effective June 1, 2018.  The appropriate test year and the final approved revenue requirement will be 
determined in the pending rate case, discussed below.  PSCo expects to defer the TCJA net benefits for the first five months 
of 2018, prior to provisional rates.    

The CPUC is expected to rule on the regulatory treatment of the TCJA, the natural gas rate case and the electric rate case later in 2018.

122

SPS — On Jan. 25, 2018, the PUCT issued an order requiring utilities to apply deferred accounting for the impacts of the TCJA.  On 
Feb. 16, 2018, SPS provided the PUCT supplemental testimony on the impacts of the TCJA for its ongoing Texas 2017 electric rate 
case, including increasing its equity ratio to 58 percent to offset the negative impact of the TCJA on its credit metrics and potentially 
its credit ratings.

In February 2018, SPS provided the NMPRC a preliminary quantification of the impacts of the TCJA on its ongoing New Mexico 
2017 electric rate case.  SPS also recommended increasing its equity ratio to 58 percent to offset the negative impact of the TCJA on 
its credit metrics and potentially its credit ratings.  In a separate NMPRC investigation into the impacts of the TCJA on regulated 
utilities in New Mexico, SPS provided additional information on the impacts of the TCJA on 2018 operations on Feb. 23, 2018.

FERC Formula Rates — The FERC has not yet issued guidance on how and when utilities should reflect the impacts of the TCJA in 
formula rates.  However, FERC-approved formula rates for wholesale customers are generally adjusted on an annual basis for certain 
changes in rate base and actual operating expenses, including income taxes.  As a result, these revenues would be subject to an 
automatic reduction for the effect of the TCJA tax rate change, absent specific FERC action.  

NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin were parties to a February 2018 FERC filing by MISO and MISO TOs proposing to early 
commence reductions to transmission formula rates in 2018 for tax rate impacts of the TCJA.  Also in February 2018, PSCo made a 
filing with FERC similarly requesting early reductions in its transmission and production formula rates in 2018 for tax rate impacts of 
the TCJA.  For SPS, as the TCJA tax rate change largely offsets a depreciation rate change that was effective Jan. 1, 2018 in its 
wholesale production rates, SPS has notified FERC that it will continue to charge rates established in 2017, subject to refund.  FERC 
has not issued any orders on these matters, or commenced any formula rate proceedings related the impacts of the TCJA.  

NSP-Minnesota

Pending and Recently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings — MPUC

Minnesota 2016 Multi-Year Electric Rate Case — In June 2017, the MPUC issued a written order approving an estimated total rate 
increase of approximately $240 million over the four-year period covering 2016-2019.

Key terms:

Monticello Prudence Investigation — In 2013, NSP-Minnesota completed the Monticello LCM/EPU project.  The multi-year project 
extended the life of the facility and increased the capacity from 600 to 671 MW in 2015.  The Monticello LCM/EPU project 
expenditures were approximately $665 million.  Total capitalized costs were approximately $748 million, which includes AFUDC.  In 
2008, project expenditures were initially estimated at approximately $320 million, excluding AFUDC.

123

In 2015, the MPUC voted to allow for full recovery, including a return, on $415 million of the total plant costs (inclusive of AFUDC), 
but only allow recovery of the remaining $333 million of costs with no return on this portion of the investment.  As a result, Xcel 
Energy recorded a pre-tax loss of $129 million in the first quarter of 2015, after which the remaining book value of the Monticello 
project represented the present value of the estimated future cash flows.

2017 and 2018 TCR Filing — In November 2017, NSP-Minnesota submitted a TCR filing with the MPUC, requesting a combined 
recovery of approximately $110 million of transmission investment costs not included in electric base rates for 2017 and 2018.  In 
accordance with NSP-Minnesota’s most recent electric rate case, three CapX2020 transmission projects currently included in the TCR 
rider remain in the rider through the multi-year plan period.  NSP-Minnesota has also proposed recovery of one additional project 
related to grid modernization.  An MPUC decision is expected in 2018. 

Electric, Purchased Gas and Resource Adjustment Clauses

CIP and CIP Rider — CIP expenses are recovered through base rates and a rider that is adjusted annually.  The estimated electric and 
natural gas incentives for 2017 are expected to be $32 million and $3 million, respectively, based on the approved savings goals in 
NSP-Minnesota’s CIP Triennial Plan.  The plan sets an annual electric goal of saving the equivalent of 1.5 percent of the volume of 
electric energy sales and an annual natural gas goal of saving 1.0 percent of the volume of gas energy sales.  In 2017 the MPUC 
approved the following for NSP-Minnesota: 

•  The 2016 CIP electric and natural gas financial incentives totaling $48 million and $6 million, respectively; and  
•  The proposed 2017 electric and natural gas CIP riders with estimated 2017 recovery of $59 million of electric CIP expenses 

and $18 million of natural gas CIP expenses.  The proposed recovery through the riders is in addition to an estimated $89 
million and $4 million through electric and gas base rates, respectively.

GUIC Rider — In February 2018, the MPUC approved a 2017 revenue requirement of approximately $20 million for GUIC 
investments.  New rates are expected to be in effect in March 2018.  In November 2017, NSP-Minnesota filed the 2018 GUIC rider 
with the MPUC requesting recovery of approximately $28 million from Minnesota gas utility customers.  Costs in both filings include 
funding for pipeline assessments as well as deferred costs from NSP-Minnesota’s existing sewer separation and pipeline integrity 
management programs.  The MPUC is currently considering the 2018 petition. 

Annual Automatic Adjustment of Fuel Clause Charges — In May 2017, the MPUC voted to disallow approximately $4 million of 
replacement energy costs for the PI nuclear facility outages allocated to the Minnesota jurisdiction in 2015.  This disallowance was 
recognized in the second quarter of 2017.  In December 2017, the MPUC issued an order to hold utilities responsible for incremental 
costs of replacement power incurred due to unplanned outages under certain circumstances.  In January 2018, NSP-Minnesota filed a 
petition for clarification of the order.  The outcome of the petition is uncertain.  

NSP-Wisconsin

Recently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings — PSCW

Wisconsin 2018 Electric and Gas Rate Case — In May 2017, NSP-Wisconsin filed a request with the PSCW to increase electric rates 
by $25 million, or 3.6 percent, and natural gas rates by $12 million, or 10.1 percent, effective Jan. 1, 2018.  The rate filing was based 
on a 2018 FTY, a ROE of 10.0 percent, an equity ratio of 52.53 percent and a forecasted rate base of approximately $1.2 billion for the 
electric utility and $138 million for the natural gas utility.  

In December 2017, the PSCW approved electric and natural gas rate increases of approximately $9 million, or 1.4 percent, and $10 
million, or 8.3 percent, respectively, based on a 9.8 percent ROE and an equity ratio of 51.45 percent.  New rates went into effect on 
Jan. 1, 2018.

PSCo

Pending Regulatory Proceedings — CPUC

Colorado 2017 Multi-Year Electric Rate Case — In October 2017, PSCo filed a multi-year request with the CPUC seeking to 
increase electric rates approximately $245 million over four years.  The request, summarized below, is based on FTY ending Dec. 31, 
a 10.0 percent ROE and an equity ratio of 55.25 percent.

(a)  The roll-in of the TCA and CACJA rider revenues into base rates will not have an impact on customer bills or revenue as these costs are already being recovered 

through a rider.  Transmission investments for 2019-2021 will be recovered through the TCA rider.

(b)  This base rate request does not include the impacts of the RESA and ECA for the Rush Creek wind investments or the proposed CEP.

Key dates in the procedural schedule are as follows:

Supplemental direct testimony — April 16, 2018;

• 
•  Answer testimony — May 31, 2018;
•  Rebuttal and cross-answer testimony — July 10, 2018;
•  Hearings — Aug. 21 - 31, 2018; and
• 

Statement of position — Sept. 28, 2018.

Interim rates, subject to refund and interest, are to be effective on June 1, 2018.  PSCo also proposed a stay-out provision and earnings 
test through 2021.  On Jan. 31, 2018, the CPUC ordered deferred accounting for the impacts of TCJA and opened a statewide TCJA 
proceeding, as discussed above.  In the second quarter of 2018, PSCo plans to file a revised rate request that will include the impacts 
of the TCJA.  The CPUC is expected to rule on the regulatory treatment of the TCJA and the electric rate case later in 2018.

Colorado 2017 Multi-Year Natural Gas Rate Case — In June 2017, PSCo filed a multi-year request with the CPUC seeking to 
increase retail natural gas rates approximately $139 million over three years.  The request, detailed below, is based on FTYs, a 10.0 
percent ROE and an equity ratio of 55.25 percent.

(a)   The roll-in of PSIA rider revenue into base rates will not have an impact on customer bills or revenue as these costs are already being recovered through the rider.  

The recovery of incremental PSIA related investments in 2019 and 2020 are included in the base rate request.

(b)   The additional rate base in 2019 predominantly reflects the roll-in of capital associated with the PSIA rider.

In October 2017, several parties filed answer testimony.  The CPUC Staff (Staff) and the OCC, recommended a single 2016 HTY, 
based on an average 13-month rate base, and opposed a multi-year request.  The Staff and OCC recommended an equity capital 
structure of 48.73 percent and 51.2 percent, respectively.  Both the Staff and the OCC recommended the existing PSIA rider expire 
with the 2018 rates rolled into base rates beginning Jan. 1, 2019.  Planned investments in 2019 and 2020 would be recoverable through 
base rates, subject to a future rate case.  The final positions of the Staff and OCC provide for a recommended 2018 rate increase of 
approximately $30 million and $39 million, respectively.

125

In December 2017, hearings before an ALJ were held and the evidentiary record for the case was closed.  Provisional rates, subject to 
refund, were implemented on Jan. 1, 2018.  As discussed above, PSCo and the CPUC Staff filed a non-unanimous settlement 
agreement to address the impacts of the TCJA on rates to be effective in 2018, which was approved by the ALJ.  On Jan. 31, 2018, the 
CPUC ordered deferred accounting for the impacts of TCJA and opened a statewide TCJA proceeding, as discussed above.  The 
CPUC is expected to rule on the regulatory treatment of the TCJA and the natural gas rate case later in 2018.

Annual Electric Earnings Test — PSCo must share with customers earnings that exceed the authorized ROE of 9.83 percent for 2015 
through 2017, as part of an annual earnings test.  PSCo estimates the 2017 earnings test will not result in a customer refund obligation.  
PSCo will file its 2017 earnings test with the CPUC in April 2018.  The final sharing obligation, if any, will be based on the CPUC 
approved tariff and could vary from the current estimate.

Electric, Purchased Gas and Resource Adjustment Clauses

DSM and the DSMCA riders — Energy efficiency and DSM costs are recovered through a combination of the DSMCA riders and 
base rates.  DSMCA riders are adjusted biannually to capture program costs, performance incentives, and any over- or under-
recoveries are trued-up in the following year.  Performance incentives are awarded in the year following plan achievements.  PSCo is 
able to earn $5 million upon reaching its annual savings goal along with an incentive on five percent of net economic benefits up to a 
maximum annual incentive of $30 million.  In 2017, PSCo earned an electric and natural gas DSM incentive of $11 million and $3 
million, respectively, for achieving its 2016 electric and natural gas savings goals.  For 2018, the electric energy savings goal is 400 
GWh with a spending limit of $84 million. 

SPS

Pending and Recently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings — PUCT

Appeal of the Texas 2015 Electric Rate Case Decision — In 2014, SPS had requested an overall retail electric revenue rate increase 
of $42 million.  In 2015, the PUCT approved an overall rate decrease of approximately $4 million, net of rate case expenses.  In April 
2016, SPS filed an appeal with the Texas State District Court (District Court) challenging the PUCT’s order that had denied SPS’ 
request for rehearing on certain items in SPS’ Texas 2015 electric rate case related to capital structure, incentive compensation and 
wholesale load reductions.  In March 2017, the District Court denied SPS’ appeal.  In April 2017, SPS appealed the District Court’s 
decision to the Court of Appeals.  A decision is pending.    

Texas 2017 Electric Rate Case — In 2017, SPS filed a $55 million, or 5.8 percent, retail electric, non-fuel base rate increase case in 
Texas with each of its Texas municipalities and the PUCT.  The request was based on the 12-month period ended June 30, 2017, with 
the final three months based on estimates, a requested ROE of 10.25 percent, a Texas retail electric rate base of approximately $1.9 
billion and an equity ratio of 53.97 percent.  

The following table summarizes SPS’ rate increase request:

(a)  The roll-in of the TCRF rider revenue into base rates will not have an impact on customer bills or revenue as these costs are already being recovered through the 

rider.  SPS can request another TCRF rider after the conclusion of this rate case to recover transmission investments subsequent to June 30, 2017.

Key dates in the revised procedural schedule are as follows:

Intervenors’ direct testimony — April 25, 2018;
PUCT Staff direct testimony — May 2, 2018;
PUCT Staff and intervenors’ cross-rebuttal testimony — May 14, 2018;
SPS’ rebuttal testimony — May 23, 2018; and

• 
• 
• 
• 
•  Hearings — June 4 - 14, 2018.

The final rates are expected to be effective retroactive to Jan. 23, 2018 through a customer surcharge.  A PUCT decision is expected in 
the fourth quarter of 2018.  As discussed above, the PUCT has opened a docket on the impact of the TCJA, which may have a 
significant impact on this rate case.  On Feb. 16, 2018, SPS provided additional information on the impacts of the TCJA.

Pending Regulatory Proceedings — NMPRC

Appeal of the New Mexico 2016 Electric Rate Case Dismissal — In November 2016, SPS filed an electric rate case with the NMPRC 
seeking an increase in base rates of approximately $41 million, representing a total revenue increase of approximately 10.9 percent.  
The rate filing was based on a requested ROE of 10.1 percent, an equity ratio of 53.97 percent, an electric rate base of approximately 
$832 million and a FTY ending June 30, 2018.  In April 2017, the NMPRC dismissed SPS’ rate case.  In May 2017, SPS filed a notice 
of appeal to the New Mexico Supreme Court.  A decision is pending.

New Mexico 2017 Electric Rate Case — In October 2017, SPS filed an electric rate case with the NMPRC seeking an increase in 
retail electric base rates of approximately $43 million.  The request is based on a HTY ended June 30, 2017, a ROE of 10.25 percent, 
an equity ratio of 53.97 percent and a jurisdictional rate base of approximately $885 million, including rate base additions through 
Nov. 30, 2017.  This rate case also takes into account the decline in sales of 380 MW in 2017 from certain wholesale customers and 
seeks to adjust the life of SPS’ Tolk power plant (Unit 1 from 2042 to 2032 and Unit 2 from 2045 to 2032). 

Key dates in the procedural schedule are as follows:

Staff and intervenor direct testimony — April 13, 2018;
SPS’ rebuttal testimony — May 2, 2018; and

• 
• 
•  Hearings — May 15 - 25, 2018. 

SPS anticipates a decision and implementation of final rates in the second half of 2018.  As discussed above, the NMPRC has opened 
a docket on the impact of the TCJA, which may have a significant impact on this rate case.

Pending Regulatory Proceedings — FERC 

MISO ROE Complaints/ROE Adder — In November 2013, a group of customers filed a complaint at the FERC against MISO TOs, 
including NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin.  The complaint argued for a reduction in the ROE in transmission formula rates in the 
MISO region from 12.38 percent to 9.15 percent, and the removal of ROE adders (including those for RTO membership), effective 
Nov. 12, 2013.

In December 2015, an ALJ recommended the FERC approve a base ROE of 10.32 percent for the MISO TOs.  The ALJ found the 
existing 12.38 percent ROE to be unjust and unreasonable.  The recommended 10.32 percent ROE applied a FERC ROE policy 
adopted in a June 2014 order (Opinion 531).  The FERC approved the ALJ recommended 10.32 percent base ROE in an order issued 
in September 2016.  This ROE would be applicable for Nov. 12, 2013 to Feb. 11, 2015, and prospectively from the date of the FERC 
order.  The total prospective ROE would be 10.82 percent, including a 50 basis point adder for RTO membership.  Various parties 
requested rehearing of the September 2016 order.  The requests are pending FERC action.

In February 2015, a second complaint seeking to reduce the MISO ROE from 12.38 percent to 8.67 percent prior to any adder was 
filed with the FERC, resulting in a second period of potential refund from Feb. 12, 2015 to May 11, 2016.  In June 2016, the ALJ 
recommended a ROE of 9.7 percent, applying the methodology adopted by the FERC in Opinion 531.  In April 2017, the D.C. Circuit 
vacated and remanded Opinion 531.  It is unclear how the D.C. Circuit’s opinion to vacate and remand Opinion 531 will affect the 
September 2016 FERC order or the timing and outcome of the second ROE complaint.  In September 2017, certain MISO TOs (not 
including NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin) filed a motion to dismiss the second ROE complaint.  The motion to dismiss is 
pending FERC action. 

As of Dec. 31, 2017, NSP-Minnesota has processed the refunds for the Nov. 12, 2013 to Feb. 11, 2015 complaint period based on the 
10.32 percent ROE.  NSP-Minnesota has also recognized a current refund liability consistent with the best estimate of the final ROE 
for the Feb. 12, 2015 to May 11, 2016 complaint period.

SPP OATT Upgrade Costs — Under the SPP OATT, costs of participant-funded, or “sponsored,” transmission upgrades may be 
recovered from other SPP customers whose transmission service depends on capacity enabled by the upgrade.  The SPP OATT has 
allowed SPP to charge for these upgrades since 2008, but SPP had not been charging its customers for these upgrades.  In 2016, the 
FERC granted SPP’s request to recover the charges not billed since 2008.  SPP subsequently billed SPS approximately $13 million for 
these charges.  SPP is also billing SPS ongoing charges of approximately $0.5 million per month.  SPS is currently seeking recovery 
of these SPP charges in its pending Texas and New Mexico base rate cases. 

127

In October 2017, SPS filed a complaint against SPP regarding the amounts billed asserting that SPP has assessed upgrade charges to 
SPS even where SPS’ transmission service was not dependent upon the upgrade as required by the SPP OATT.  If SPS’ complaint 
results in additional charges or refunds, SPS will seek to recover or refund the differential in future rate proceedings. 

13.  Commitments and Contingencies

Commitments

Capital Commitments — Xcel Energy has made commitments in connection with a portion of its projected capital expenditures.  Xcel 
Energy’s capital commitments primarily relate to the following major projects:

NSP-Minnesota Upper Midwest Wind Projects — NSP-Minnesota has gained approval to build and own 1,150 MW of new wind 
generation in the Upper Midwest.  NSP-Minnesota is also seeking approval from the MPUC to build and own the Dakota Range 
project, a 300 MW wind project in South Dakota.

PSCo Advanced Grid Intelligence and Security Initiative — PSCo is pursuing projects to update and advance its electric distribution 
grid to increase reliability and security standards, meet customer expectations, offer additional customer choice and control over 
energy usage and implement new rate structures. 

PSCo Rush Creek Wind Farm — PSCo has gained approval to build, own and operate a 600 MW wind generation facility and 
proposed transmission line in Colorado. 

PSCo Gas Transmission Integrity Management Programs — PSCo is proactively identifying and addressing the safety and reliability 
of natural gas transmission pipelines. The pipeline integrity efforts include primarily pipeline assessment and maintenance projects.

PSCo Electric Distribution Integrity Management Programs — PSCo is assessing aging infrastructure for distribution assets and 
replacing worn components to increase system performance.

SPS Transmission NTC — SPS has accepted NTCs for several hundred miles of transmission line and related substation projects based 
on needs identified through SPP’s various planning processes, including those associated with economics, reliability, generator 
interconnection and the load addition processes.  Most significant are the 345 KV transmission line from TUCO to Yoakum County to 
Hobbs Plant and the Hobbs Plant to China Draw 345 KV transmission lines.  

SPS New Mexico and Texas Wind Projects — SPS is seeking approval from the NMPRC and the PUCT to build, own and operate 
1,000 MW of new wind generation through the addition of two wind generation facilities in New Mexico and Texas. 

Fuel Contracts — Xcel Energy has entered into various long-term commitments for the purchase and delivery of a significant portion 
of its current coal, nuclear fuel and natural gas requirements.  These contracts expire in various years between 2018 and 2060.  Xcel 
Energy is required to pay additional amounts depending on actual quantities shipped under these agreements.

The estimated minimum purchases for Xcel Energy under these contracts as of Dec. 31, 2017 are as follows:

Additional expenditures for fuel and natural gas storage and transportation will be required to meet expected future electric generation 
and natural gas needs.  Xcel Energy’s risk of loss, in the form of increased costs from market price changes in fuel, is mitigated 
through the use of natural gas and energy cost-rate adjustment mechanisms, which provide for pass-through of most fuel, storage and 
transportation costs to customers.

128

PPAs — NSP Minnesota, PSCo and SPS have entered into PPAs with other utilities and energy suppliers with expiration dates through 
2039 for purchased power to meet system load and energy requirements and meet operating reserve obligations.  In general, these 
agreements provide for energy payments, based on actual energy delivered and capacity payments.  Certain PPAs accounted for as 
executory contracts also contain minimum energy purchase commitments.  Capacity and energy payments are typically contingent on 
the IPPs meeting contract obligations, including plant availability requirements.  Contractual payments are adjusted based on market 
indices.  The effects of price adjustments on our financial results are mitigated through purchased energy cost recovery mechanisms.

Included in electric fuel and purchased power expenses for PPAs accounted for as executory contracts were payments for capacity of 
$168 million, $191 million and $231 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  At Dec. 31, 2017, the estimated future payments 
for capacity and energy that the utility subsidiaries of Xcel Energy are obligated to purchase pursuant to these executory contracts, 
subject to availability, are as follows:

(a)  Excludes contingent energy payments for renewable energy PPAs.

Additional energy payments under these PPAs and PPAs accounted for as operating leases will be required to meet expected future 
electric demand.

Leases — Xcel Energy leases a variety of equipment and facilities.  Three of these leases are accounted for as capital leases.  The 
assets and liabilities at the inception of a capital lease are recorded at the lower of fair market value or the present value of future lease 
payments and are amortized over the term of the contract.

WYCO is a joint venture with CIG to develop and lease natural gas pipeline, storage, and compression facilities.  Xcel Energy Inc. has 
a 50 percent ownership interest in WYCO.  WYCO generally leases its facilities to CIG, and CIG operates the facilities, providing 
natural gas storage services to PSCo under separate service agreements.

PSCo accounts for its Totem natural gas storage service arrangement with CIG as a capital lease.  As a result, PSCo had $124 million 
and $127 million of capital lease obligations as of Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Xcel Energy Inc. eliminates 50 percent of the 
capital lease obligation related to WYCO in the consolidated balance sheet along with an equal amount of Xcel Energy Inc.’s equity 
investment in WYCO. 

PSCo records amortization for its capital leases as cost of natural gas sold and transported on the consolidated statements of income.  
Total amortization expenses under capital lease assets were approximately $5 million, $8 million and $8 million for 2017, 2016 and 
2015, respectively.  Following is a summary of property held under capital leases:

The remainder of the leases, primarily for office space, railcars, generating facilities, natural gas pipeline transportation, vehicles, 
aircraft and power-operated equipment, are accounted for as operating leases.  Total expenses under operating lease obligations for 
Xcel Energy were approximately $246 million, $255 million and $265 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  These expenses 
include capacity payments for PPAs accounted for as operating leases of $210 million, $216 million and $224 million in 2017, 2016 
and 2015, respectively, recorded to electric fuel and purchased power expenses.

Included in the future commitments under operating leases are estimated future capacity payments under PPAs that have been 
accounted for as operating leases in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance.  Future commitments under operating and 
capital leases are:

Variable Interest Entities — The accounting guidance for consolidation of VIEs requires enterprises to consider the activities that 
most significantly impact an entity’s financial performance, and power to direct those activities, when determining whether an 
enterprise is a VIE’s primary beneficiary.

PPAs — Under certain PPAs, NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS purchase power from IPPs for which the utility subsidiaries are required 
to reimburse natural gas or biomass fuel costs, or to participate in tolling arrangements under which the utility subsidiaries procure the 
natural gas required to produce the energy that they purchase.  In addition, certain solar PPAs provide the utility subsidiaries with an 
option to purchase emission allowances or sharing provisions related to production credits generated by the solar facility under 
contract. These specific PPAs create a variable interest in the IPP.

Xcel Energy has determined that certain IPPs are VIEs.  Xcel Energy is not subject to risk of loss from the operations of these entities, 
and no significant financial support has been, or is required to be provided other than contractual payments for energy and capacity set 
forth in the PPAs.

Xcel Energy has evaluated each of these VIEs for possible consolidation, including review of qualitative factors such as the length and 
terms of the contract, control over O&M, control over dispatch of electricity, historical and estimated future fuel and electricity prices, 
and financing activities.  Xcel Energy has concluded that these entities are not required to be consolidated in its consolidated financial 
statements because it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic 
performance.  Xcel Energy’s utility subsidiaries had approximately 3,537 MW of capacity under long-term PPAs at both Dec. 31, 2017 
and 2016 with entities that have been determined to be VIEs.  These agreements have expiration dates through the year 2041.

Fuel Contracts — SPS purchases all of its coal requirements for its Harrington and Tolk electric generating stations from TUCO under 
contracts for those facilities that will expire in December 2022.  TUCO arranges for the purchase, receiving, transporting, unloading, 
handling, crushing, weighing, and delivery of coal to meet SPS’ requirements.  TUCO is responsible for negotiating and administering 
contracts with coal suppliers, transporters and handlers.

No significant financial support has been, or is required to be provided to TUCO by SPS, other than contractual payments for 
delivered coal.  However, the fuel contracts create a variable interest in TUCO due to SPS’ reimbursement of certain fuel procurement 
costs.  SPS has determined that TUCO is a VIE.  SPS has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of TUCO because SPS does 
not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact TUCO’s economic performance.

Low-Income Housing Limited Partnerships — Eloigne and NSP-Wisconsin have entered into limited partnerships for the construction 
and operation of affordable rental housing developments which qualify for low-income housing tax credits.  Xcel Energy Inc. has 
determined Eloigne and NSP-Wisconsin’s low-income housing limited partnerships to be VIEs primarily due to contractual 
arrangements within each limited partnership that establish sharing of ongoing voting control and profits and losses that does not 
consistently align with the partners’ proportional equity ownership.  Xcel Energy Inc. has determined that Eloigne and NSP-Wisconsin 
have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact these entities’ economic performance, and therefore Xcel Energy 
Inc. consolidates these limited partnerships in its consolidated financial statements.

130

Equity financing for these entities has been provided by Eloigne, NSP-Wisconsin and the general partner of each limited partnership.  
Xcel Energy’s risk of loss is limited to its capital contributions, adjusted for any distributions and its share of undistributed profits and 
losses; no significant additional financial support has been, or is required to be provided to the limited partnerships by Eloigne or 
NSP-Wisconsin.  Obligations of the limited partnerships are generally secured by the housing properties of each limited partnership, 
and the creditors of each limited partnership have no significant recourse to Xcel Energy Inc. or its subsidiaries.  Likewise, the assets 
of the limited partnerships may only be used to settle obligations of the limited partnerships, and not those of Xcel Energy Inc. or its 
subsidiaries.

Amounts reflected in Xcel Energy’s consolidated balance sheets for the Eloigne and NSP-Wisconsin low-income housing limited 
partnerships include the following:

Guarantees and Indemnifications

Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries provide guarantees and bond indemnities under specified agreements or transactions, which 
guarantee payment or performance.  Xcel Energy Inc.’s exposure is based upon the net liability of the relevant subsidiary under the 
specified agreements or transactions.  Most of the guarantees and bond indemnities issued by Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries 
limit the exposure to a maximum stated amount.  As of Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries had no assets 
held as collateral related to their guarantees, bond indemnities and indemnification agreements.

Failure of any one of Xcel Energy Inc.’s utility subsidiaries to perform under the agreement that is the subject of the relevant bond.  In addition, per the indemnity 
agreement between Xcel Energy Inc. and the various surety companies, the surety companies have the discretion to demand that collateral be posted.

(j)  Due to the magnitude of projects associated with the surety bonds, the total current exposure of this indemnification cannot be determined.  Xcel Energy Inc. 

believes the exposure to be significantly less than the total amount of the outstanding bonds.

Indemnification Agreements

Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries provide indemnifications through contracts entered into in the normal course of business.  These 
are primarily indemnifications against adverse litigation outcomes in connection with underwriting agreements, as well as breaches of 
representations and warranties, including corporate existence, transaction authorization and income tax matters with respect to assets 
sold.  Xcel Energy Inc.’s and its subsidiaries’ obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of duration and amount.  The 
maximum future payments under these indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated as the dollar amounts are often not explicitly 
stated.

Environmental Contingencies

Xcel Energy has been or is currently involved with the cleanup of contamination from certain hazardous substances at several sites.  In 
many situations, the subsidiary involved believes it will recover some portion of these costs through insurance claims.  Additionally, 
where applicable, the subsidiary involved is pursuing, or intends to pursue, recovery from other PRPs and through the regulated rate 
process.  New and changing federal and state environmental mandates can also create added financial liabilities for Xcel Energy, 
which are normally recovered through the regulated rate process.  To the extent any costs are not recovered through the options listed 
above, Xcel Energy would be required to recognize an expense.

Site Remediation — Various federal and state environmental laws impose liability, without regard to the legality of the original 
conduct, where hazardous substances or other regulated materials have been released to the environment.  Xcel Energy Inc.’s 
subsidiaries may sometimes pay all or a portion of the cost to remediate sites where past activities of their predecessors or other parties 
have caused environmental contamination.  Environmental contingencies could arise from various situations, including sites of former 
MGPs operated by Xcel Energy Inc.’s subsidiaries or their predecessors, or other entities; and third-party sites, such as landfills, for 
which one or more of Xcel Energy Inc.’s subsidiaries are alleged to be a PRP that sent wastes to that site.

132

MGP Sites

Ashland MGP Site — NSP-Wisconsin was named a PRP for contamination at a site in Ashland, Wis.  The Ashland/Northern States 
Power Lakefront Superfund Site (the Site) includes NSP-Wisconsin property, previously operated as a MGP facility (the Upper Bluff), 
and two other properties: an adjacent city lakeshore park area (Kreher Park); and an area of Lake Superior’s Chequamegon Bay 
adjoining the park.

In 2012, NSP-Wisconsin agreed to remediate the Phase I Project Area (which includes the Upper Bluff and Kreher Park areas of the 
Site), under a settlement agreement with the EPA.  In January 2017, NSP-Wisconsin agreed to remediate the Phase II Project Area (the 
Sediments), under a settlement agreement with the EPA.  The settlement agreements were approved by the U.S. District Court for the 
Western District of Wisconsin.  NSP-Wisconsin initiated a full scale wet dredge remedy of the Sediments in 2017.  Going forward, 
NSP-Wisconsin anticipates completion of restoration activities of the Sediments in 2018 with finalization of Phase I Project Area 
construction and restoration activities in 2019.  Groundwater treatment activities at the Site will continue.

The current cost estimate for the entire site (both Phase I Project Area and the Sediments) is approximately $168 million, of which 
approximately $138 million has been spent.  As of Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, NSP-Wisconsin had recorded a total liability of $30 
million and $64 million, respectively, for the entire site.

NSP-Wisconsin has deferred the unrecovered portion of the estimated Site remediation costs as a regulatory asset.  The PSCW has 
authorized NSP-Wisconsin rate recovery for all remediation costs incurred at the Site.  In 2012, the PSCW agreed to allow NSP-
Wisconsin to pre-collect certain costs, to amortize costs over a ten-year period and to apply a three percent carrying cost to the 
unamortized regulatory asset.  In December 2017, the PSCW approved an NSP-Wisconsin natural gas rate case, which included 
recovery of additional expenses associated with remediating the Site.  The annual recovery of MGP clean-up costs will increase from 
$12 million in 2017 to $18 million in 2018.

Fargo, N.D. MGP Site — In May 2015, underground pipes, tars and impacted soils were discovered in a right-of-way in Fargo, N.D. 
that appeared to be associated with a former MGP operated by NSP-Minnesota or prior companies.  NSP-Minnesota removed 
impacted soils and other materials and commenced an investigation of the historic MGP and adjacent properties (the Fargo MGP Site).  
The North Dakota Department of Health approved NSP-Minnesota’s proposed cleanup plan in January 2017, which involves targeted 
source removal of impacted soils and historic MGP infrastructure. It is anticipated that remediation activities will be performed in 
2018.  NSP-Minnesota has also initiated insurance recovery litigation in North Dakota.  The U.S. District Court for the District of 
North Dakota agreed to the parties’ request for a stay of the litigation until May 31, 2018.

NSP-Minnesota had recorded an estimated liability of $16 million as of Dec. 31, 2017, and $11 million as of Dec. 31, 2016, for the 
Fargo MGP Site.  The current cost estimate for the remediation of the site is approximately $23 million, of which approximately $7 
million has been spent.  NSP-Minnesota has deferred Fargo MGP Site costs allocable to the North Dakota jurisdiction, or 
approximately 88 percent of all remediation costs, as approved by the NDPSC.  In December 2017, NSP-Minnesota filed a request 
with the MPUC to defer post-2017 expenditures allocable to the Minnesota jurisdiction.

Other MGP, Landfill or Disposal Sites — Xcel Energy is currently involved in investigating and/or remediating several MGP, landfill 
or other disposal sites.  Xcel Energy has identified twelve sites across its service territories in addition to the sites in Ashland and 
Fargo, where contamination is present and where investigation and/or remediation activities are currently underway.  Other parties 
may have responsibility for some portion of the investigation and/or remediation activities that are underway.  Xcel Energy anticipates 
that these investigation or remediation activities will continue through at least 2018.  Xcel Energy had accrued $4 million as of Dec. 
31, 2017 and $2 million as of Dec. 31, 2016 for all of these sites.  There may be insurance recovery and/or recovery from other PRPs 
that will offset any costs incurred.  Xcel Energy anticipates that any amounts spent will be fully recovered from customers.

Environmental Requirements

Water and Waste
Asbestos Removal — Some of Xcel Energy’s facilities contain asbestos.  Most asbestos will remain undisturbed until the facilities that 
contain it are demolished or removed.  Xcel Energy has recorded an estimate for final removal of the asbestos as an ARO.  It may be 
necessary to remove some asbestos to perform maintenance or make improvements to other equipment.  The cost of removing 
asbestos as part of other work is not expected to be material and is recorded as incurred as operating expenses for maintenance 
projects, capital expenditures for construction projects or removal costs for demolition projects.

Coal Ash Regulation — Xcel Energy’s operations are subject to federal and state laws that impose requirements for handling, storage, 
treatment and disposal of solid waste.  In 2015, the EPA published a final rule regulating the management, storage, and disposal of 
coal combustion residuals (CCRs) as a nonhazardous waste (CCR Rule).  Industry and environmental non-governmental organizations 
sought judicial review of the final CCR Rule, but a final decision has not been issued in that litigation.  The EPA announced in late 
2017 its intent to revise the CCR Rule.  It is anticipated that the EPA will publish the revised rule in the first quarter of 2018.

133

Under the CCR Rule, utilities were required to complete groundwater sampling around their CCR landfills and surface impoundments 
and to analyze the results by early 2018 to determine if there were any statistically significant increases (SSIs) above background 
levels of certain constituents in the groundwater.  Xcel Energy has identified SSIs at several sites located in Colorado and one site in 
Minnesota.  Going forward, Xcel Energy will either conduct additional groundwater sampling to determine whether another source 
besides plant operations is impacting groundwater and/or to determine if corrective action is needed.  Several Xcel Energy sites where 
SSIs were identified were already undergoing cessation of coal operations and closure of the on-site coal units and therefore no further 
corrective action is expected at those sites.

Until a final decision is reached in the litigation, the EPA publishes its revised rule, and Xcel Energy completes additional groundwater 
sampling, it is uncertain what impact, if any, there will be on the operations, financial position or cash flows of Xcel Energy.  Xcel 
Energy believes that any associated costs would be recoverable through regulatory mechanisms.

Federal CWA Waters of the United States Rule — In 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) published a final 
rule that significantly expanded the types of water bodies regulated under the CWA and broadened the scope of waters subject to 
federal jurisdiction.  In October 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued a nationwide stay of the final rule and 
subsequently ruled that it, rather than the federal district courts, had jurisdiction over challenges to the rule.  In January 2017, the U.S. 
Supreme Court agreed to resolve the dispute as to which court should hear challenges to the rule.  A ruling is expected in 2018. 

In February 2017, President Trump issued an executive order requiring the EPA and the Corps to review and revise the final rule.  In 
June 2017, the agencies issued a proposed rule that rescinds the final rule and reinstates the prior definition of “Water of the U.S.”  
The agencies are also undertaking a rulemaking to develop a new definition of “Waters of the U.S.”

Federal CWA Effluent Limitations Guidelines (ELG) — In 2015, the EPA issued a final ELG rule for power plants that use coal, 
natural gas, oil or nuclear materials as fuel and discharge treated effluent to surface waters as well as utility-owned landfills that 
receive coal combustion residuals.  In 2017, the EPA delayed the compliance date for flue gas desulfurization wastewater and bottom 
ash transport until November 2020 while the agency conducts a rulemaking process to potentially revise the effluent limitations and 
pretreatment standards for these waste streams. 

Federal CWA Section 316(b) — The federal CWA requires the EPA to regulate cooling water intake structures to assure that these 
structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts to aquatic species.  The EPA published 
the final 316(b) rule in 2014.  The rule prescribes technology for protecting fish that get stuck on plant intake screens (known as 
impingement) and describes a process for site-specific determinations by each state for sites that must protect the small aquatic 
organisms that pass through the intake screens into the plant cooling systems (known as entrainment).  For Xcel Energy, these 
requirements will primarily impact plants at NSP-Minnesota.  Xcel Energy estimates the likely cost for complying with impingement 
requirements may be incurred between 2018 and 2027 and is approximately $41 million with the majority needed for NSP-Minnesota.  
Xcel Energy believes at least six NSP-Minnesota plants and two NSP-Wisconsin plants could be required by state regulators to make 
improvements to reduce entrainment.  The exact total cost of the entrainment improvements is uncertain, but could be up to $192 
million.  Xcel Energy anticipates these costs will be fully recoverable in rates.

Air
GHG Emission Standard for Existing Sources (CPP) — In 2015, the EPA issued its final CPP rule for existing power plants.  Among 
other things, the CPP requires that state plans include enforceable measures to ensure emissions from existing power plants achieve 
the EPA’s state-specific interim and final emission performance targets.  

The CPP was challenged by multiple parties in the D.C. Circuit Court.  In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an order 
staying the final CPP rule. The stay will remain in effect until the D.C. Circuit Court reaches its decision and the U.S. Supreme Court 
either declines to review the lower court’s decision or reaches a decision of its own. 

In March 2017, President Trump signed an executive order requiring the EPA Administrator to review the CPP rule and if appropriate 
publish proposed rules suspending, revising or rescinding it.  Accordingly, the EPA requested that the D.C. Circuit Court hold the 
litigation in abeyance until the EPA completes its work under the executive order.  The D.C. Circuit granted the EPA’s request and is 
holding the litigation in abeyance, while considering briefs by the parties on whether the court should remand the challenges to the 
EPA rather than holding them in abeyance, determining whether and how the court continues or ends the stay that currently applies to 
the CPP.

In October 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to repeal the CPP, based on an analysis that the CPP exceeds the EPA’s statutory 
authority under the CAA.  In the proposal, the EPA stated it has not yet determined whether it will promulgate a new rule to regulate 
GHG emissions from existing EGUs.  In December 2017, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to take and 
consider comments on whether to issue a future rule and what such a rule should include. 

134

CSAPR — CSAPR addresses long range transport of PM and ozone by requiring reductions in SO2 and NOx from utilities in the 
eastern half of the United States using an emissions trading program.  For Xcel Energy, the rule applies in Minnesota, Wisconsin and 
Texas. 

CSAPR was adopted to address interstate emissions impacting downwind states’ attainment of the ozone and particulate NAAQS.  As 
the EPA revises NAAQS, it will consider whether to make any further reductions to CSAPR emission budgets and whether to change 
which states are included in the emissions trading program. 

In September 2017, the EPA adopted a final rule that withdraws Texas from the CSAPR particle program and determines that further 
emission reductions in Texas are not needed to address interstate particle transport.  Texas is no longer subject to the annual SO2 and 
NOX emission budgets under CSAPR.  In November 2017, the National Parks Conservation Association and Sierra Club appealed this 
rule to the D.C. Circuit Court.  In January 2018, the Court granted SPS’ motion to intervene in support of the EPA’s final rule. 

Regional Haze Rules — The regional haze program requires SO2, NOX and PM emission controls at power plants and other industrial 
facilities to reduce visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas.  The program is divided into two parts: BART and 
reasonable further progress.  The requirements of the first regional haze plans developed by Minnesota and Colorado that apply to 
NSP-Minnesota and PSCo have been fully approved and implemented.  Texas’ first regional haze plan has undergone federal review 
as described below.

BART Determination for Texas: The EPA published a proposed BART rule for Texas in January 2017 that could have required 
installation of dry scrubbers to reduce SO2 emissions from Harrington Units 1 and 2.  Investment costs associated with dry scrubbers 
for Harrington Units 1 and 2 could have been approximately $400 million.  In October 2017, the EPA issued a revised final rule 
adopting a BART alternative Texas only SO2 trading program that applies to all Harrington and Tolk units.  Under the trading 
program, SPS expects the allowance allocations to be sufficient for SO2 emissions from units in 2019 and future years.  The 
anticipated costs of compliance are not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations, financial position or cash 
flows; and SPS believes that compliance costs would be recoverable through regulatory mechanisms.

Several parties have challenged whether the final rule issued by the EPA should be considered to have met the requirements imposed 
in a Consent Decree entered the United States District Court for the District of Columbia that established deadlines for the EPA to take 
final action on state regional haze plan submissions.  The matter is now submitted to the court.

In December 2017, the National Parks Conservation Association, Sierra Club, and Environmental Defense Fund appealed the EPA’s 
October 2017 final BART rule to the Fifth Circuit, and filed a petition for administrative reconsideration of the final rule with the EPA.  
In January 2018, the court granted SPS’ motion to intervene in the Fifth Circuit litigation in support of the EPA’s final rule. 

Reasonable Progress Rule: In January 2016, the EPA adopted a final rule establishing a federal implementation plan for reasonable 
further progress under the regional haze program for the state of Texas.  The rule imposes SO2 emission limitations that would require 
the installation of dry scrubbers on Tolk Units 1 and 2, with compliance required by February 2021.  Investment costs associated with 
dry scrubbers could be approximately $600 million.  SPS appealed the EPA’s decision and obtained a stay of the final rule.  In March 
2017, the Fifth Circuit remanded the rule to the EPA for reconsideration, leaving the stay in effect.  In a future rulemaking, the EPA  
will address whether SO2 emission reductions beyond those required in the BART alternative rule are needed at Tolk under the 
“reasonable progress” requirements of the regional haze program.  The risk of these controls being imposed along with the risk of 
investments to provide additional cooling water to Tolk have caused SPS to seek to decrease the remaining depreciable life of the Tolk 
units.  The EPA has not announced a schedule for acting on the remanded rule. 

Implementation of the NAAQS for SO2 — The EPA adopted a more stringent NAAQS for SO2 in 2010, and evaluated areas in three 
phases.  In December 2017, the EPA adopted a final rule that completed its initial designations of areas attaining or not attaining the 
standard.  The EPA’s final actions designate all areas near Xcel Energy’s generating plants as meeting the SO2 NAAQS with two 
exceptions.  In June 2016, the EPA issued final designations which found the areas near the SPS Harrington and PSCo Pawnee plants 
as “unclassifiable.”  The area near the Harrington plant is to be monitored for three years and a final designation is expected to be 
made by December 2020.  Since the 2016 “unclassifiable” designation, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment 
has prepared and submitted air dispersion modeling to the EPA demonstrating that the area near the Pawnee plant meets the SO2 
NAAQS.  The EPA has not yet completed its evaluation of the Pawnee plant.

If the area near the Harrington plant is designated nonattainment in 2020, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) 
will need to develop an implementation plan, which would be due by 2022, designed to achieve the NAAQS by 2025.  The TCEQ 
could require additional SO2 controls at Harrington as part of such a plan.  Xcel Energy cannot evaluate the impacts until the final 
designation is made and any required state plans are developed.  Xcel Energy believes that should SO2 control systems be required or 
require upgrades for a plant, compliance costs or the costs of alternative cost-effective generation will be recoverable through 
regulatory mechanisms and therefore does not expect a material impact on results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  

135

Revisions to the NAAQS for Ozone — In 2015, the EPA revised the NAAQS for ozone by lowering the eight-hour standard from 75
parts per billion (ppb) to 70 ppb.  In November 2017, the EPA published final designations of areas that meet the 2015 ozone standard.  
Xcel Energy meets the 2015 ozone standard in all areas where its generating units operate, except for the Denver Metropolitan Area.  
PSCo’s scheduled retirement of coal fired plants in Denver that began in 2011 and was completed in August 2017, should help in any 
plan to mitigate non-attainment.  The EPA has not yet taken final action on the designation, but notified the State of Colorado in December 
2017 that it intends to designate the parts of the Denver Metropolitan Area that currently do not attain the 2008 ozone standards as also 
not attaining the more stringent 2015 ozone standard. 

Asset Retirement Obligations

Recorded AROs — AROs have been recorded for property related to the following: electric production (nuclear, steam, wind, other 
and hydro), electric distribution and transmission, natural gas production, natural gas transmission and distribution, natural gas 
storage, thermal and general property.  The electric production obligations include asbestos, processed water and ash-containment 
facilities, radiation sources, storage tanks, control panels and decommissioning.  The asbestos recognition associated with electric 
production includes certain plants at NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS.  AROs also have been recorded for NSP-
Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS steam production related to processed water and ash-containment facilities such as ash 
ponds, evaporation ponds and solid waste landfills.  NSP-Minnesota and PSCo have also recorded AROs for the retirement and 
removal of assets at certain wind production facilities for which the land is leased and removal is required by contract.

Xcel Energy has recognized AROs for the retirement costs of natural gas mains and lines at NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin and 
PSCo and AROs for the retirement of above ground gas gathering equipment, impoundments at gas extraction sites and wells related 
to gas storage facilities at PSCo.  In addition, an ARO was recognized for the removal of electric transmission and distribution 
equipment at NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS, which consists of obligations associated with polychlorinated 
biphenyl, mineral oil, lithium batteries, mercury and street lighting lamps.  The common general AROs include obligations related to 
storage tanks, radiation sources and office buildings.

For the nuclear assets, the ARO is associated with the decommissioning of the NSP-Minnesota nuclear generating plants, Monticello 
and PI.  See Note 14 for further discussion of nuclear obligations.

A reconciliation of Xcel Energy’s AROs for the years ended Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:

other above ground equipment.

(b) 

In 2017, AROs were revised for changes in estimated cash flows and the timing of those cash flows.  The nuclear decommissioning ARO decreased due to updated 
assumptions in the nuclear triennial filing.  Changes in the gas transmission and distribution AROs were mainly related to increased labor costs.

The aggregate fair value of NSP-Minnesota’s legally restricted assets, for purposes of funding future nuclear decommissioning, was 
$2.1 billion as of Dec. 31, 2017, consisting of external investment funds.

(a)  The liability recognized relates to the NSP-Minnesota Courtenay Wind Farm which was placed in service during 2016.
(b) 

In 2016, AROs were revised for changes in estimated cash flows and the timing of those cash flows.  Changes in the gas transmission and distribution AROs were 
mainly related to increased miles of gas mains.

The aggregate fair value of NSP-Minnesota’s legally restricted assets, for purposes of funding future nuclear decommissioning, was 
$1.9 billion as of Dec. 31, 2016, consisting of external investment funds.

Indeterminate AROs — Outside of the known and recorded asbestos AROs, other plants or buildings may contain asbestos due to the 
age of many of Xcel Energy’s facilities, but no confirmation or measurement of the amount of asbestos or cost of removal could be 
determined as of Dec. 31, 2017.  Therefore, an ARO has not been recorded for these facilities.

Removal Costs — Xcel Energy records a regulatory liability for the plant removal costs of generation, transmission and distribution 
facilities of its utility subsidiaries that are recovered currently in rates.  Generally, the accrual of future non-ARO removal obligations 
is not required.  However, long-standing ratemaking practices approved by applicable state and federal regulatory commissions have 
allowed provisions for such costs in historical depreciation rates.  These removal costs have accumulated over a number of years based 
on varying rates as authorized by the appropriate regulatory entities.  Given the long time periods over which the amounts were 
accrued and the changing of rates over time, the utility subsidiaries have estimated the amount of removal costs accumulated through 
historic depreciation expense based on current factors used in the existing depreciation rates.

The accumulated balances by entity were as follows at Dec. 31:

Nuclear Insurance

NSP-Minnesota’s public liability for claims resulting from any nuclear incident is limited to $13.4 billion under the Price-Anderson 
amendment to the Atomic Energy Act.  NSP-Minnesota has secured $450 million of coverage for its public liability exposure with a 
pool of insurance companies.  The remaining $13.0 billion of exposure is funded by the Secondary Financial Protection Program, 
available from assessments by the federal government in case of a nuclear incident. NSP-Minnesota is subject to assessments of up to 
$127 million per reactor-incident for each of its three licensed reactors, to be applied for public liability arising from a nuclear incident 
at any licensed nuclear facility in the United States.  The maximum funding requirement is $19 million per reactor per incident during 
any one year. These maximum assessment amounts are both subject to inflation adjustment by the NRC and state premium taxes.  The 
NRC’s last adjustment was effective September 2013.

NSP-Minnesota purchases insurance for property damage and site decontamination cleanup costs from Nuclear Electric Insurance Ltd. 
(NEIL) and European Mutual Association for Nuclear Insurance (EMANI).  The coverage limits are $2.3 billion for each of NSP-
Minnesota’s two nuclear plant sites.  NEIL also provides business interruption insurance coverage, including the cost of replacement 
power obtained during certain prolonged accidental outages of nuclear generating units.  Premiums are expensed over the policy term.  
All companies insured with NEIL are subject to retroactive premium adjustments if losses exceed accumulated reserve funds.  Capital 
has been accumulated in the reserve funds of NEIL and EMANI to the extent that NSP-Minnesota would have no exposure for 
retroactive premium assessments in case of a single incident under the business interruption and the property damage insurance 
coverage.  However, in each calendar year, NSP-Minnesota could be subject to maximum assessments of approximately $19 million 
for business interruption insurance and $41 million for property damage insurance if losses exceed accumulated reserve funds.

Legal Contingencies

Xcel Energy is involved in various litigation matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business.  The 
assessment of whether a loss is probable or is a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often 
involves a series of complex judgments about future events.  Management maintains accruals for such losses that are probable of 
being incurred and subject to reasonable estimation.  Management is sometimes unable to estimate an amount or range of a reasonably 
possible loss in certain situations, including but not limited to when (1) the damages sought are indeterminate, (2) the proceedings are 
in the early stages, or (3) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories.  In such cases, there is considerable uncertainty 
regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss.  For current proceedings not 
specifically reported herein, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings 
would have a material effect on Xcel Energy’s financial statements.  Unless otherwise required by GAAP, legal fees are expensed as 
incurred.

Employment, Tort and Commercial Litigation

Gas Trading Litigation — e prime inc. (e prime) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc.  e prime was in the business of 
natural gas trading and marketing but has not engaged in natural gas trading or marketing activities since 2003.  Thirteen lawsuits 
were commenced against e prime and Xcel Energy (and NSP-Wisconsin, in two instances) between 2003 and 2009 alleging fraud and 
anticompetitive activities in conspiring to restrain the trade of natural gas and manipulate natural gas prices.  

e prime, Xcel Energy Inc. and its other affiliates were sued along with several other gas marketing companies.  These cases were all 
consolidated in the U.S. District Court in Nevada.  Six of the cases remain active, which includes a multi-district litigation (MDL) 
matter consisting of a Colorado class (Breckenridge), a Wisconsin class (Arandell Corp.), a Missouri class, a Kansas class, and two 
other cases identified as “Sinclair Oil” and “Farmland.”  In March 2017, summary judgment was granted by the MDL judge in favor 
of Xcel Energy and e prime in the Sinclair Oil and Farmland cases.  In November 2017, the U.S District Court in Nevada granted 
summary judgment against two plaintiffs in the Arandell Corp. case in favor of Xcel Energy and NSP-Wisconsin, leaving only three 
individual plaintiffs remaining in the litigation.  In addition, the plaintiffs’ motions for class certification and remand back to 
originating courts in these cases were denied in March 2017.  Plaintiffs have appealed the summary judgment motions granted in the 
Farmland and Sinclair Oil cases and the denial of class certification and remand to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit 
(Ninth Circuit).  Oral arguments were heard before the Ninth Circuit in February 2018.  A final decision is expected by the end of the 
first quarter of 2019.  Xcel Energy, NSP-Wisconsin and e prime have concluded that a loss is remote.

138

Line Extension Disputes — In December 2015, Development Recovery Company (DRC) filed a lawsuit in the Denver District Court, 
stating PSCo failed to award proper allowances and refunds for line extensions to new developments pursuant to the terms of electric 
and gas service agreements entered into by PSCo and various developers.  The dispute involves claims by over fifty developers.  In 
May 2016, the Denver District Court granted PSCo’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, concluding that jurisdiction over this dispute 
resides with the CPUC.  In June 2016, DRC appealed the Denver District Court’s dismissal of the lawsuit, and the Colorado Court of 
Appeals affirmed the lower court decision in favor of PSCo.  In July 2017, DRC filed a petition to appeal the decision with the 
Colorado Supreme Court.  In February 2018, the Colorado Supreme Court denied DRC’s petition effectively terminating this 
litigation. 

In January 2018, DRC filed a new lawsuit in Boulder County District Court, asserting a single claim that PSCo was required to file its 
line extension agreements with the CPUC but failed to do so.  This claim is substantially similar to the arguments previously raised by 
DRC.  Dates for this proceeding have not been scheduled.

PSCo has concluded that a loss is remote with respect to both of these matters as the service agreements were developed to implement 
CPUC approved tariffs and PSCo has complied with the tariff provisions.  Also, if a loss were sustained, PSCo believes it would be 
allowed to recover these costs through traditional regulatory mechanisms.  The amount or range in dispute is presently unknown and 
no accrual has been recorded for this matter.

Other Contingencies

See Note 12 for further discussion.

14.  Nuclear Obligations

Fuel Disposal — NSP-Minnesota is responsible for temporarily storing used or spent nuclear fuel from its nuclear plants.  The DOE is 
responsible for permanently storing spent fuel from U.S. nuclear plants, but no such facility is yet available.  NSP-Minnesota has 
funded its portion of the DOE’s permanent disposal program since 1981.  Through May 2014, the fuel disposal fees were based on a 
charge of 0.1 cent per KWh sold to customers from nuclear generation.  Since that time, the DOE has set the fee to zero.  There were 
no DOE fuel disposal assessments in 2017 or 2016. 

NSP-Minnesota has its own temporary on-site storage facilities for spent fuel at its Monticello and PI nuclear plants, which consist of 
storage pools and dry cask facilities at both sites.  The amount of spent fuel storage capacity is determined by the NRC and the 
MPUC.  The Monticello dry-cask storage facility currently stores 16 of the 30 authorized canisters, and the PI dry-cask storage facility 
currently stores 40 of the 64 authorized casks. 

Regulatory Plant Decommissioning Recovery — Decommissioning activities related to NSP-Minnesota’s nuclear facilities are 
planned to begin at the end of each unit’s operating license and be completed by 2091.  NSP-Minnesota’s current operating licenses 
allow continued use of its Monticello nuclear plant until 2030 and its PI nuclear plant until 2033 for Unit 1 and 2034 for Unit 2.

Future decommissioning costs of nuclear facilities are estimated through triennial periodic studies that assess the costs and timing of 
planned nuclear decommissioning activities for each unit.  The MPUC most recently approved NSP-Minnesota’s 2014 nuclear 
decommissioning study in October 2015.  This cost study quantified decommissioning costs in 2014 dollars and utilized escalation 
rates of 4.36 percent per year for plant removal activities, and 3.36 percent for spent fuel management and site restoration activities 
over a 60-year decommissioning scenario.

The total obligation for decommissioning is expected to be funded 100 percent by the external decommissioning trust fund when 
decommissioning commences.  NSP-Minnesota’s most recently approved decommissioning study resulted in an annual funding 
requirement of $14 million to be recovered in utility customer rates which started in 2016.  This cost study assumes the external 
decommissioning fund will earn an after-tax return between 5.23 percent and 6.30 percent.  Realized and unrealized gains on fund 
investments are deferred as an offset of NSP-Minnesota’s regulatory asset for nuclear decommissioning costs.

As of Dec. 31, 2017, NSP-Minnesota has accumulated $2.1 billion of assets held in external decommissioning trusts.  The following 
table summarizes the funded status of NSP-Minnesota’s decommissioning obligation based on parameters established in the most 
recently approved decommissioning study.  Xcel Energy believes future decommissioning costs, if necessary, will continue to be 
recovered in customer rates.  The amounts presented below were prepared on a regulatory basis, and are not recorded in the financial 
statements for the ARO.

(b)  Decommissioning expenses in 2017 and 2016 include Minnesota’s retail jurisdiction annual funding requirement of approximately $14 million. The 2015 expense 

was offset by the DOE settlement refund.

The 2014 nuclear decommissioning filing approved in 2015 has been used for the regulatory presentation for both 2017 and 2016.  
The most recent triennial filing was submitted in December 2017 and is currently pending with the MPUC, with an order expected in 
2018.

15.  Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

Xcel Energy prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, as discussed in 
Note 1.  Under this guidance, regulatory assets and liabilities are created for amounts that regulators may allow to be collected, or may 
require to be paid back to customers in future electric and natural gas rates.  Any portion of Xcel Energy’s business that is not 
regulated cannot establish regulatory assets and liabilities.  If changes in the utility industry or the business of Xcel Energy no longer 
allow for the application of regulatory accounting guidance under GAAP, Xcel Energy would be required to recognize the write-off of 
regulatory assets and liabilities in net income or OCI.

17.  Segments and Related Information

The regulated electric utility operating results of NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS, as well as the regulated natural gas 
utility operating results of NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin and PSCo are each separately and regularly reviewed by Xcel Energy’s 
chief operating decision maker.  Xcel Energy evaluates performance by each utility subsidiary based on profit or loss generated from 
the product or service provided.  These segments are managed separately because the revenue streams are dependent upon regulated 
rate recovery, which is separately determined for each segment.

142

Xcel Energy has the following reportable segments: regulated electric utility, regulated natural gas utility and all other.

•  Xcel Energy’s regulated electric utility segment generates, transmits and distributes electricity in Minnesota, Wisconsin, 

Michigan, North Dakota, South Dakota, Colorado, Texas and New Mexico.  In addition, this segment includes sales for resale 
and provides wholesale transmission service to various entities in the United States.  Regulated electric utility also includes 
wholesale commodity and trading operations.

•  Xcel Energy’s regulated natural gas utility segment transports, stores and distributes natural gas primarily in portions of 

Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, Michigan and Colorado.

•  Revenues from operating segments not included above are below the necessary quantitative thresholds and are therefore 
included in the all other category.  Those primarily include steam revenue, appliance repair services, nonutility real estate 
activities, revenues associated with processing solid waste into refuse-derived fuel and investments in rental housing projects 
that qualify for low-income housing tax credits.

Xcel Energy had equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries of $140 million and $133 million as of Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, 
respectively, included in the natural gas utility and all other segments.

Asset and capital expenditure information is not provided for Xcel Energy’s reportable segments because as an integrated electric and 
natural gas utility, Xcel Energy operates significant assets that are not dedicated to a specific business segment, and reporting assets 
and capital expenditures by business segment would require arbitrary and potentially misleading allocations which may not 
necessarily reflect the assets that would be required for the operation of the business segments on a stand-alone basis.

To report income from operations for regulated electric and regulated natural gas utility segments, the majority of costs are directly 
assigned to each segment.  However, some costs, such as common depreciation, common O&M expenses and interest expense are 
allocated based on cost causation allocators.  A general allocator is used for certain general and administrative expenses, including 
office supplies, rent, property insurance and general advertising.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1.

Item 9A — Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Xcel Energy maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in 
reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the 
time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.  In addition, the disclosure controls and procedures ensure that information required to 
be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer 
(CFO), allowing timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  As of Dec. 31, 2017, based on an evaluation carried out under the 
supervision and with the participation of Xcel Energy’s management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of its 
disclosure controls and the procedures, the CEO and CFO have concluded that Xcel Energy’s disclosure controls and procedures were 
effective.

144

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

No change in Xcel Energy’s internal control over financial reporting has occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that has 
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Xcel Energy’s internal control over financial reporting.  Xcel Energy 
maintains internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the financial reporting. 

Xcel Energy has evaluated and documented its controls in process activities, general computer activities, and on an entity-wide level.  
During the year and in preparation for issuing its report for the year ended Dec. 31, 2017 on internal controls under section 404 of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Xcel Energy conducted testing and monitoring of its internal control over financial reporting.  Based on 
the control evaluation, testing and remediation performed, Xcel Energy did not identify any material control weaknesses, as defined 
under the standards and rules issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and as approved by the SEC and as 
indicated in Management Report on Internal Controls herein.

In 2016, Xcel Energy implemented the general ledger modules, as well as initiated deployment of work management systems 
modules, of a new enterprise resource planning system to improve certain financial and related transaction processes.  Xcel Energy 
implemented additional work management systems modules in 2017.  Xcel Energy updated its internal control over financial 
reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to its business processes and accounting systems. Xcel Energy does not believe 
that this implementation had an adverse effect on its internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Incorporated by reference are Xcel Energy’s consolidated statements of common stockholders’ equity and OCI in Part II, Item 8.

Basis of Presentation — The condensed financial information of Xcel Energy Inc. is presented to comply with Rule 12-04 of 
Regulation S-X.  Xcel Energy Inc.’s investments in subsidiaries are presented under the equity method of accounting.  Under this 
method, the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries are not consolidated.  The investments in net assets of the subsidiaries are recorded in 
the balance sheets.  The income from operations of the subsidiaries is reported on a net basis as equity in income of subsidiaries.

As a holding company with no business operations, Xcel Energy Inc.’s assets consist primarily of investments in its utility 
subsidiaries.  Xcel Energy Inc.’s material cash inflows are only from dividends and other payments received from its utility 
subsidiaries and the proceeds raised from the sale of debt and equity securities.  The ability of its utility subsidiaries to make dividend 
and other payments is subject to the availability of funds after taking into account their respective funding requirements, the terms of 
their respective indebtedness, the regulations of the FERC under the Federal Power Act, and applicable state laws.  Management does 
not expect maintaining these requirements to have an impact on Xcel Energy Inc.’s ability to pay dividends at the current level in the 
foreseeable future.  Each of its utility subsidiaries, however, is legally distinct and has no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make 
funds available to Xcel Energy Inc.

Related Party Transactions — Xcel Energy Inc. presents its related party receivables net of payables.  Accounts receivable and 
payable with affiliates at Dec. 31 were:

years ended Dec. 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  These cash receipts are included in operating cash flows of the condensed 
statements of cash flows.

Money Pool — Xcel Energy received FERC approval to establish a utility money pool arrangement with the utility subsidiaries, 
subject to receipt of required state regulatory approvals.  The utility money pool allows for short-term investments in and borrowings 
between the utility subsidiaries.  Xcel Energy Inc. may make investments in the utility subsidiaries at market-based interest rates; 
however, the money pool arrangement does not allow the utility subsidiaries to make investments in Xcel Energy Inc. The following
