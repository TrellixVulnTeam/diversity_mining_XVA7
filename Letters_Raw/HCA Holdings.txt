to improve patient care.”

R. Milton Johnson
Chairman and CEO

Brand colors - do not use w/o checking with Mandy

To Our Valued Shareholders:
For HCA Healthcare, 2017 marked a year of 
success and resilience. We executed on our 
growth strategy and clinical agenda, making 
strides in expanding our footprint, service 
line capabilities, technologies and support of 
employees. During 2017, we also experienced 
some adversity, including the destruction 
caused by hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which 
significantly impacted many of our coastal 
markets. Through these events, our mission – 
above all else, we are committed to the care 
and improvement of human life – kept us 
grounded in a shared culture focused on the 
patients and communities we serve. Overall, 
HCA’s 2017 performance was solid, and we 
look toward 2018 with optimism and our 
signature long-term perspective. 

For 2017, we had same facility equivalent 
admission growth of 1.5 percent – our tenth 
consecutive year of achieving same facility 
equivalent admission growth. HCA generated 
revenues of $43.6 billion, an increase of 5.1 
percent over 2016. 

We continued our balanced approach to 
capital allocation by investing in our markets, 
repurchasing shares of our common stock 
and completing complementary acquisitions. 
We invested more than $3 billion in capital 
expenditures in our existing facilities during 
2017. We also repurchased 25.1 million shares 
of our common stock at a cost of $2.05 
billion, and had $1.8 billion remaining on our 
$2 billion October 2017 authorization as of the 
end of 2017. 

During 2017, we made several strategic 
acquisitions, acquiring eight hospitals and 
other healthcare assets for $1.2 billion. These 
acquisitions, located in the Houston, San 
Antonio, Fort Worth and East Florida markets, 

have enhanced our ability to improve medical 
care, patient access and brand relevance in 
communities where we already operate.  
We believe that our capital investments 
are long-term assets that will provide us 
continual growth opportunities over the  
next several years. 

In addition to hospital acquisitions, our growth 
strategy remains focused on investing in 
access points in our networks that provide 
convenience and choice to our patients. In 
2015, we began acquiring and developing 
freestanding emergency rooms and urgent 
care centers, and that focus continued 
throughout 2017. We ended the year with 
72 freestanding emergency rooms and 123 
urgent care centers, and our expansion efforts 
in those spaces will continue in 2018. In May, 
we changed our company name to HCA 
Healthcare, reflecting the broad spectrum 
of care we provide across both hospital and 
non-hospital settings (including freestanding 
emergency rooms, ambulatory surgery 
centers, urgent care centers and physician 
clinics). Moving forward, we will continue 
to invest in our market brands to better 
coordinate services between these diverse 
points of care, and to make it easier for our 
patients to navigate within our system in the 
communities where they live and work.

Within our markets, we worked to broaden 
our service line capabilities by investing in 
cancer, trauma, stroke, behavioral health 
and pediatric services. This focus centers 
on elevating clinical performance and 
establishing consistent clinical protocols to 
achieve better patient outcomes across the 
organization. As a result, we were pleased 
that 70.2 percent of HCA hospitals received 
a quality rating of A or B from The Leapfrog 

Group in its fall 2017 grades, in contrast to 
only 55.9 percent of non-HCA hospitals that 
achieved such ratings.

Our clinical achievements were supported 
by HCA’s multi-year investments in medical 
technologies like PatientKeeper, iMobile, 
and vitals monitoring devices, which have 
moved out of their pilot phases and are 
now being deployed company-wide. 
Our expanding clinical data warehouse 
supports our clinical excellence program 
and positions us well to continue exploring 
emerging technologies. As we dive deeper 
into informatics, we are working to harness 
the power of big data to efficiently test 
methodologies, discover trends and provide 
information to support our physicians 
and clinicians as they continually strive to 
improve the quality of care to our patients.

Our 2017 clinical agenda also included 
strong investments in our people, 
notably our nurses and leadership. Late 
2017 marked the launch of our multi-
year nursing strategy, which brings the 
organizational expertise of our company 
to the practice of nursing. Centered on 
four pillars - Advocacy and Leadership, 
Increase Performance Visibility, 
Consistency in Nursing Practice and 
Operations, and Leverage Scale to Drive 
Performance – this strategic plan invests 
in capital improvements, technologies 
and infrastructure that ultimately allow 
nurses to spend more time at the bedside, 
providing patient care. Nurses are critical 
enablers of core performance initiatives 
like patient experience, clinical quality, 
physician relationships and efficiency. 
By making these long-term investments 
in their professional growth and the 
environments in which they practice, we 
expect to create a meaningful competitive 
advantage for HCA.

Through the efforts of our recently 
consolidated Human Resources Group, 
we continued to broaden the scope of our 
Leadership Institute, which launched in 
2014. The Institute now features programs 
to develop leaders across the enterprise in 
a variety of roles, including COOs, CFOs, 
CNOs, CMOs, operators, VPs, emergency 
room directors, surgical services directors, 
and leaders in our physician services group 
and outpatient and service line group. We 
are actively preparing our future leaders to 
take advantage of increasing opportunities 
for advancement at HCA. 

Our third quarter expenses and revenues 
were negatively impacted by hurricanes 
Harvey and Irma, which affected our Corpus 
Christi, Houston, Florida, Georgia and South 
Carolina facilities. During the hurricanes, 
several of our hospitals were evacuated 
and others received evacuated patients 
from our affected facilities and non-HCA 
facilities. These unprecedented weather 
events were quickly followed by the tragic 
shooting in Las Vegas, which left more 
than 200 patients in need of emergency 
care from our Sunrise Hospital & Medical 
Center. Before, during and after these 
crises, our enterprise preparedness and 
emergency operations team acted swiftly 
and decisively to maintain patient care, 
protect our facilities from damage, support 
our colleagues and provide crucial services 
in the communities we serve. I am proud 
of the courage, compassion and resilience 
our HCA family showed during these 
challenging events.

We approach 2018 with a spirit of 
confidence and hope for the future. In 2018, 
we will enter a new market for the first time 
since 2003, with the acquisition of Memorial 
Health in Savannah, Georgia. We anticipate 
the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 

will reduce our expected 2018 tax payments 
by approximately $500 million, which 
we plan on reinvesting into our markets 
and workforce development. Our focus 
on maintaining a safe care environment 
for patients and working environment 
for employees will continue through our 
emergency preparedness, cultural inclusion 
and healthy work environment initiatives. 
We also recently announced a quarterly 
cash dividend that demonstrates our 
confidence in the strength of HCA, and 
which we believe will differentiate us among 
other healthcare services providers.

Beyond these significant reasons for 
optimism, 2018 is a celebratory year 
for our organization: our 50th year in 
operation. Since our founding in 1968 by 
two physicians, Dr. Thomas Frist, Sr. and 
Dr. Thomas Frist, Jr., and businessman 
Jack Massey, HCA has grown from a 
single hospital in Nashville to an expansive 
network of caregivers supported by shared 
services, solid infrastructure and a common 
mission to care for and improve human 
life. That growth has been enabled by our 
long-term perspective, which compels us 
to think critically about our investments 
in communities, employees, technologies 
and infrastructure, and helps us persevere 
through various economic cycles, political 
environments and other short-term 
challenges. As I reflect on our organization’s 
history, I am excited about both 2018 and 
the bright future that lies ahead for HCA 
Healthcare.

we will enter a new market for the first time 
since 2003, with the acquisition of Memorial 
Health in Savannah, Georgia. We anticipate 
the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 

will reduce our expected 2018 tax payments 
by approximately $500 million, which 
we plan on reinvesting into our markets 
and workforce development. Our focus 
on maintaining a safe care environment 
for patients and working environment 
for employees will continue through our 
emergency preparedness, cultural inclusion 
and healthy work environment initiatives. 
We also recently announced a quarterly 
cash dividend that demonstrates our 
confidence in the strength of HCA, and 
which we believe will differentiate us among 
other healthcare services providers.

Beyond these significant reasons for 
optimism, 2018 is a celebratory year 
for our organization: our 50th year in 
operation. Since our founding in 1968 by 
two physicians, Dr. Thomas Frist, Sr. and 
Dr. Thomas Frist, Jr., and businessman 
Jack Massey, HCA has grown from a 
single hospital in Nashville to an expansive 
network of caregivers supported by shared 
services, solid infrastructure and a common 
mission to care for and improve human 
life. That growth has been enabled by our 
long-term perspective, which compels us 
to think critically about our investments 
in communities, employees, technologies 
and infrastructure, and helps us persevere 
through various economic cycles, political 
environments and other short-term 
challenges. As I reflect on our organization’s 
history, I am excited about both 2018 and 
the bright future that lies ahead for HCA 
Healthcare.

Business Strategy

We are committed to providing the communities we serve with high quality, cost-effective health care while
growing our business, increasing our profitability and creating long-term value for our stockholders. To achieve
these objectives, we align our efforts around the following growth agenda:

•

•

•

•

•

grow our presence in existing markets;

achieve industry-leading performance in clinical and satisfaction measures;

recruit and employ physicians to meet the need for high quality health services;

continue to leverage our scale and market positions to enhance profitability; and

pursue a disciplined development strategy.

Health Care Facilities

We currently own, manage or operate hospitals, freestanding surgery centers, freestanding emergency care
facilities, urgent care facilities, walk-in clinics, diagnostic and imaging centers, radiation and oncology therapy
centers, comprehensive rehabilitation and physical
therapy centers, physician practices and various other
facilities.

At December 31, 2017, we owned and operated 175 general, acute care hospitals with 46,226 licensed beds.
Most of our general, acute care hospitals provide medical and surgical services, including inpatient care,
intensive care, cardiac care, diagnostic services and emergency services. The general, acute care hospitals also
provide outpatient services such as outpatient surgery, laboratory, radiology, respiratory therapy, cardiology and
physical therapy. Each hospital has an organized medical staff and a local board of trustees or governing board,
made up of members of the local community.

At December 31, 2017, we operated three psychiatric hospitals with 412 licensed beds. Our psychiatric
hospitals provide therapeutic programs including child, adolescent and adult psychiatric care, adolescent and
adult alcohol and drug abuse treatment and counseling.

We also operate outpatient health care facilities, which include freestanding ambulatory surgery centers
(“ASCs”), freestanding emergency care facilities, urgent care facilities, walk-in clinics, diagnostic and imaging
centers, comprehensive rehabilitation and physical therapy centers, radiation and oncology therapy centers,
physician practices and various other facilities. These outpatient services are an integral component of our
strategy to develop comprehensive health care networks in select communities. Most of our ASCs are operated
through partnerships or limited liability companies, with majority ownership of each partnership or limited
liability company typically held by a general partner or member that is an affiliate of HCA.

Certain of our affiliates provide a variety of management services to our health care facilities, including
patient safety programs, ethics and compliance programs, national supply contracts, equipment purchasing and
leasing contracts, accounting,
reimbursement assistance,
construction planning and coordination, information technology systems and solutions, legal counsel, human
resources services and internal audit services.

Sources of Revenue

Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the medical and ancillary services ordered by
physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or payment rates for
such services. Charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient services vary significantly depending on the type of
third-party payer, the type of service (e.g., medical/surgical, intensive care or psychiatric) and the geographic
location of the hospital. Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our
control.

We receive payments for patient services from the federal government under the Medicare program, state
governments under their respective Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans (including plans offered
through the American Health Benefit Exchanges (“Exchanges”)), private insurers and directly from patients. Our
revenues from third-party payers and other (including uninsured patients) for the years ended December 31,
2017, 2016 and 2015 are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):

Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age
65 and over, some disabled persons, persons with end-stage renal disease and persons with Lou Gehrig’s Disease.
Medicaid is a federal-state program, administered by the states, that provides hospital and medical benefits to
qualifying individuals who are unable to afford health care. All of our general, acute care hospitals located in the
United States are eligible to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs. Amounts received under Medicare
and Medicaid programs are generally significantly less than established hospital gross charges for the services
provided.

Our hospitals generally offer discounts from established charges to certain group purchasers of health care
services, including private health insurers, employers, health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”), preferred
provider organizations (“PPOs”) and other managed care plans, including health plans offered through the
Exchanges. These discount programs generally limit our ability to increase revenues in response to increasing
costs. See Item 1, “Business — Competition.” Patients are generally not responsible for the total difference
between established hospital gross charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid,
HMOs, PPOs and other managed care plans, but are responsible to the extent of any exclusions, deductibles or
coinsurance features of their coverage. The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and coinsurance continues to
increase. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from government health care
programs or other third-party payers. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for
Medicaid or for financial relief under our charity care policy. In implementing our uninsured discount policy, we
may attempt to provide assistance to uninsured patients to help determine whether they may qualify for
Medicaid, other federal or state assistance or charity care under our charity care policy. If an uninsured patient
does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.

Medicare

In addition to the reimbursement reductions and adjustments discussed below, the Budget Control Act of
2011 (the “BCA”) requires automatic spending reductions to reduce the federal deficit, including Medicare
spending reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year, with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare
programs. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) began imposing a 2% reduction on Medicare
claims on April 1, 2013. These reductions have been extended through 2027.

5

Inpatient Acute Care

Under the Medicare program, we receive reimbursement under a prospective payment system (“PPS”) for
general, acute care hospital inpatient services. Under the hospital inpatient PPS, fixed payment amounts per
inpatient discharge are established based on the patient’s assigned Medicare severity diagnosis-related group
(“MS-DRG”). MS-DRGs classify treatments for illnesses according to the estimated intensity of hospital
resources necessary to furnish care for each principal diagnosis. MS-DRG weights represent the average
resources for a given MS-DRG relative to the average resources for all MS-DRGs. MS-DRG payments are
adjusted for area wage differentials. Hospitals, other than those defined as “new,” receive PPS reimbursement for
inpatient capital costs based on MS-DRG weights multiplied by a geographically adjusted federal rate. When the
cost to treat certain patients falls well outside the normal distribution, providers typically receive additional
“outlier” payments. These payments are financed by offsetting reductions in the inpatient PPS rates. A high-cost
outlier threshold is set annually at a level that will result in estimated outlier payments equaling 5.1% of total
inpatient PPS payments for the fiscal year.

MS-DRG rates are updated, and MS-DRG weights are recalibrated, using cost-relative weights each federal
fiscal year (which begins October 1). The index used to update the MS-DRG rates (the “market basket”) gives
consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals and entities outside the health care industry in purchasing
goods and services. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and
Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Health Reform Law”), provides for annual decreases to
the market basket, including reductions of 0.75 percentage point for federal fiscal years 2018 and 2019. For each
federal fiscal year, the Health Reform Law provides for the annual market basket update to be further reduced by
a productivity adjustment based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics (“BLS”) 10-year moving average of changes in
specified economy-wide productivity. A decrease in payment rates or an increase in rates that is below the
increase in our costs may adversely affect our results of operations.

For federal fiscal year 2017, CMS increased the MS-DRG rate by 0.95%. This increase reflected a 2.7%
market basket increase adjusted by the following percentage points: 0.75 reduction required by the Health
Reform Law, a negative 0.3 productivity adjustment, and a prospective reduction of 1.5 for documentation and
coding that was required under the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. It also reflects a positive adjustment
to the market basket update of approximately 0.8 percentage point to remove the effects of prior adjustments
intended to offset the estimated increase in inpatient PPS expenditures resulting from the Medicare program’s
“two midnight rule.” Under the two midnight rule, services provided to Medicare beneficiaries are only payable
as inpatient hospital services when there is a reasonable expectation that the hospital care is medically necessary
and will be required across two midnights, absent unusual circumstances. For federal fiscal year 2018, CMS
increased the MS-DRG rate by approximately 1.2%. This increase reflects a market basket update of 2.7%,
adjusted by the following percentage points: 0.75 reduction required by the Health Reform Law, a negative 0.6
productivity adjustment, a further reduction of 0.6 to remove the effects of prior adjustments related to the two
midnight rule, and a positive 0.46 adjustment in accordance with the 21st Century Cures Act. Additional
adjustments may apply, depending on patient-specific or hospital-specific factors. Under the post-acute care
transfer policy, for example, Medicare reimbursement rates are reduced when an inpatient hospital discharges a
patient in a specified MS-DRG to certain post-acute care settings. Under the budget bill enacted in February
2018, hospice will be added as a setting covered by the policy effective October 1, 2018.

CMS has implemented, or is implementing, a number of programs and requirements intended to transform
Medicare from a passive payer to an active purchaser of quality goods and services. For example, hospitals that
do not successfully participate in the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program are subject to an additional
0.25% reduction of the market basket update. Hospitals that do not demonstrate meaningful use of electronic
health records (“EHRs”) are subject to an additional 0.75% reduction of the market basket update.

Medicare does not allow an inpatient hospital discharge to be assigned to a higher paying MS-DRG if
certain designated hospital acquired conditions (“HACs”) were not present on admission and the identified HAC
is the only condition resulting in the assignment of the higher paying MS-DRG. In this situation, the case is paid

6

as though the secondary diagnosis was not present. There are currently 14 categories of conditions on the list of
HACs. Pursuant to the Health Reform Law, the 25% of hospitals with the worst risk-adjusted HAC rates in the
designated performance period receive a 1% reduction in their inpatient PPS Medicare payments. CMS has also
established three National Coverage Determinations that prohibit Medicare reimbursement for erroneous surgical
procedures performed on an inpatient or outpatient basis.

The Health Reform Law also provides for reduced payments to hospitals based on readmission rates. Each
federal fiscal year inpatient payments are reduced if a hospital experiences “excess” readmissions within the
30-day time period from the date of discharge for conditions designated by CMS. For federal fiscal year 2018,
CMS has designated seven conditions, including heart attack, pneumonia and total hip arthroplasty. Hospitals
with what CMS defines as excess readmissions for these conditions receive reduced payments for all inpatient
discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excess readmission standard. The amount
by which payments are reduced is determined by comparing the hospital’s performance for each condition using
three years of discharge data to a risk-adjusted national average, subject to a cap established by CMS. The
reduction in payments to hospitals with excess readmissions can be up to 3% of a hospital’s base payments. Each
hospital’s performance is publicly reported by CMS.

The Health Reform Law additionally establishes a hospital value-based purchasing program to further link
payments to quality and efficiency. For federal fiscal year 2017 and subsequent years, CMS reduces the inpatient
PPS payment amount for all discharges by 2.00%. The total amount collected from these reductions is pooled and
used to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet certain quality performance standards established by CMS.
CMS scores each hospital based on achievement (relative to other hospitals) and improvement ranges (relative to
the hospital’s own past performance) for each applicable performance standard. Because the Health Reform Law
provides that the pool will be fully distributed, hospitals that meet or exceed the quality performance standards
receive greater reimbursement under the value-based purchasing program than they would have otherwise.
Hospitals that do not achieve the necessary quality performance receive reduced Medicare inpatient hospital
payments. Hospitals are scored on a number of individual measures that are categorized into four domains:
clinical care; efficiency and cost reduction; safety and patient and caregiver experience of care. CMS estimates
that $1.9 billion will be available to hospitals as incentive payments in federal fiscal year 2018 under the value-
based purchasing program.

Outpatient

CMS reimburses hospital outpatient services (and certain Medicare Part B services furnished to hospital
inpatients who have no Part A coverage) on a PPS basis. CMS uses fee schedules to pay for physical,
occupational and speech therapies, durable medical equipment, clinical diagnostic laboratory services,
nonimplantable orthotics and prosthetics, freestanding surgery center services and services provided by
independent diagnostic testing facilities. In addition, as required by statute, certain items and services furnished
by off-campus provider-based departments, subject
to certain exceptions, are not covered as outpatient
department services under the outpatient PPS, but are reimbursed under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule
(“Physician Fee Schedule”), subject to adjustments as specified by CMS.

Hospital outpatient services paid under PPS are classified into groups called ambulatory payment
classifications (“APCs”). Services for each APC are similar clinically and in terms of the resources they require.
A payment rate is established for each APC. Depending on the services provided, a hospital may be paid for
more than one APC for a patient visit. The APC payment rates are updated for each calendar year. The Health
Reform Law provides for annual reductions of 0.75 percentage point to the market basket update in calendar
years 2018 and 2019. For each calendar year, the Health Reform Law provides for the annual market basket
update to be further reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes
in specified economy-wide productivity. For calendar year 2017, CMS increased APC payment rates by an
estimated 1.7%. The change reflected a market basket increase of 2.7% with a negative 0.3 percentage point
productivity adjustment and the negative 0.75 percentage point adjustment required by the Health Reform Law,
along with other payment adjustments. For calendar year 2018, CMS increased APC payment rates by an

7

estimated 1.4%. This increase reflects a market basket increase of 2.7% adjusted by the following percentage
points: a positive 0.6 productivity adjustment and negative 0.75 adjustment required by the Health Reform Law,
along with other policy changes. CMS requires hospitals to submit quality data relating to outpatient care to
avoid receiving a 2.0 percentage point reduction to the market basket update under the outpatient PPS.

Rehabilitation

CMS reimburses inpatient rehabilitation facilities (“IRFs”) on a PPS basis. Under the IRF PPS, patients are
classified into case mix groups based upon impairment, age, comorbidities (additional diseases or disorders from
which the patient suffers) and functional capability. IRFs are paid a predetermined amount per discharge that
reflects the patient’s case mix group and is adjusted for area wage levels, low-income patients, rural areas and
high-cost outliers. The Health Reform Law provides for reductions to the market basket update, including annual
reductions of 0.75 percentage point in federal fiscal years 2018 and 2019. For each federal fiscal year, the Health
Reform Law provides for the annual market basket update to be further reduced by a productivity adjustment
based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For federal fiscal
year 2017, CMS increased inpatient rehabilitation payment rates by approximately 1.9%, which reflects an
increase of 2.7% to the IRF-specific market basket with a negative 0.3 percentage point productivity adjustment
and the 0.75 percentage point reduction required by the Health Reform Law, among other payment adjustments.
For federal fiscal year 2018, CMS increased inpatient rehabilitation payment rates by an estimated 0.9%. This
reflects an increase factor of 1.0%, the figure required by the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of
2015 (“MACRA”), with adjustments related to outlier threshold results. In addition, CMS requires IRFs to report
quality measures to avoid receiving a reduction of 2 percentage points to the market basket update.

In order to qualify for classification as an IRF, at least 60% of a facility’s inpatients during the most recent
12-month CMS-defined review period must have required intensive rehabilitation services for one or more of 13
specified conditions. IRFs must also meet additional coverage criteria, including patient selection and care
requirements relating to pre-admission screenings, post-admission evaluations, ongoing coordination of care and
involvement of rehabilitation physicians. A facility that fails to meet the 60% threshold, or other criteria to be
classified as an IRF, will be paid under either the acute care hospital inpatient or outpatient PPS, which generally
provide for lower payment amounts. As of December 31, 2017, we had one rehabilitation hospital and 58
hospital rehabilitation units.

Psychiatric

Inpatient hospital services furnished in psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units of general, acute care
hospitals and critical access hospitals are reimbursed on a PPS basis. The inpatient psychiatric facility (“IPF”)
PPS is based upon a per diem payment, with adjustments to account for certain patient and facility
characteristics. The IPF PPS contains an “outlier” policy for extraordinarily costly cases and an adjustment to a
facility’s base payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department. CMS has established the IPF PPS
payment rate in a manner intended to be budget neutral. The Health Reform Law provides for reductions to the
market basket update, including reductions of 0.75 percentage point in federal fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020.
For each payment year, the Health Reform Law provides for the annual market basket update to be further
reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified
economy-wide productivity. For federal fiscal year 2017, CMS increased inpatient psychiatric payment rates by
approximately 2.2%, which reflects a 2.8% IPF market basket update, reduced by a 0.3 percentage point
productivity adjustment and by 0.2 percentage point as required by the Health Reform Law, among other
payment adjustments. For federal fiscal year 2018, CMS increased inpatient psychiatric payment rates by an
estimated 1.0%, which reflects a 2.6% IPF market basket update with a negative 0.6 percentage point
productivity adjustment, a negative 0.75 percentage point adjustment as required by the Health Reform Law, and
other policy changes. Inpatient psychiatric facilities are required to report quality measures to CMS to avoid
receiving a 2.0 percentage point reduction to the market basket update. As of December 31, 2017, we had three
psychiatric hospitals and 55 hospital psychiatric units.

Ambulatory Surgery Centers

CMS reimburses ASCs using a predetermined fee schedule. Reimbursements for ASC overhead costs are
limited to no more than the overhead costs paid to hospital outpatient departments under the Medicare hospital
outpatient PPS for the same procedure. If CMS determines that a procedure is commonly performed in a
physician’s office, the ASC reimbursement for that procedure is limited to the reimbursement allowable under
the Physician Fee Schedule, with limited exceptions. All surgical procedures, other than those that pose a
significant safety risk or generally require an overnight stay, are payable as ASC procedures. From time to time,
CMS considers expanding the services that may be performed in ASCs, which may result in more Medicare
procedures that historically have been performed in hospitals being moved to ASCs, reducing surgical volume in
our hospitals. Also, more Medicare procedures that historically have been performed in ASCs may be moved to
physicians’ offices. Commercial third-party payers may adopt similar policies. For each federal fiscal year, the
Health Reform Law provides for an annual reduction to the ASC payment system by a productivity adjustment
based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For calendar year
2017, CMS increased ASC payments by 1.9%, which reflects a consumer price index update of 2.2% and a
negative 0.3 percentage point productivity adjustment. For calendar year 2018, CMS increased ASC payment
rates by 1.2%, which reflects a consumer price index update of 1.7%, less a 0.5 percentage point productivity
adjustment. In addition, CMS has established a quality reporting program for ASCs under which ASCs that fail
to report on specified quality measures receive a 2.0 percentage point reduction to the consumer price index
update.

Physician Services

Physician services are reimbursed under the Physician Fee Schedule system, under which CMS has assigned
a national relative value unit (“RVU”) to most medical procedures and services that reflects the various resources
required by a physician to provide the services, relative to all other services. Each RVU is calculated based on a
combination of work required in terms of time and intensity of effort for the service, practice expense (overhead)
attributable to the service and malpractice insurance expense attributable to the service. These three elements are
each modified by a geographic adjustment factor to account for local practice costs and are then aggregated.
While RVUs for various services may change in a given year, any alterations are required by statute to be
virtually budget neutral, such that total payments made under the Physician Fee Schedule may not differ by more
than $20 million from what payments would have been if adjustments were not made. CMS annually reviews
resource inputs for select services as part of the potentially misvalued code initiative. Congress set targets
through 2018 for annual reductions in Physician Fee Schedule expenditures resulting from adjustments to relative
values of misvalued codes. Under MACRA, the Physician Fee Schedule reimbursement rate increases 0.5% for
calendar year 2018.

In addition, MACRA required the establishment of the Quality Payment Program (“QPP”), a payment
methodology intended to reward high-quality patient care. Beginning in 2017, physicians and certain other health
care clinicians are required to participate in of one of two QPP tracks. Under both tracks, performance data
collected in 2017 will affect Medicare payments in 2019, and performance data collected in 2018 will affect
Medicare payments in 2020. CMS expects to transition increasing financial risk to providers as the QPP evolves.
The Advanced Alternative Payment Model (“APM”) track makes incentive payments available for participation
in specific innovative payment models approved by CMS. Providers may earn a 5% Medicare incentive payment
between 2019 and 2024 and will be exempt from the reporting requirements and payment adjustments imposed
under the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (“MIPS”) if the provider has sufficient participation (based on
percentage of payments or patients) in an Advanced APM. Alternatively, providers may participate in the MIPS
track. Providers electing this option may receive payment incentives or be subject to payment reductions of up to
5% of the provider’s Medicare payments based on their performance with respect to clinical quality, resource
use, clinical improvement activities, and meaningful use of EHRs. The adjustment percentage will increase
incrementally to 9% by 2022. MIPS consolidates components of three previously established physician incentive
programs: the Physician Quality Reporting System, the Physician Value-Based Payment Modifier, and the
Medicare EHR Incentive Program.

9

Other

Under PPS, the payment rates are adjusted for area differences in wage levels by a factor (“wage index”)
reflecting the relative wage level in the geographic area compared to the national average wage level and taking
into account occupational mix. The redistributive impact of wage index changes is not anticipated to have a
material financial impact for 2018.

Medicare reimburses hospitals for a portion (65%) of bad debts resulting from deductible and coinsurance

amounts that are uncollectable from Medicare beneficiaries.

CMS has implemented contractor reform whereby CMS competitively bids the Medicare fiscal intermediary
and Medicare carrier functions to Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MACs”), which are geographically
assigned across 12 jurisdictions to service both Part A and Part B providers. While chain providers had the option
of having all hospitals use one home office MAC, we chose to use the MACs assigned to the geographic areas in
which our hospitals are located. CMS periodically re-solicits bids, and the MAC servicing a geographic area can
change as a result of the bid competition. MAC transition periods can impact claims processing functions and the
resulting cash flow.

CMS contracts with third parties to promote the integrity of the Medicare program through reviews of
quality concerns and detections and corrections of improper payments. Quality Improvement Organizations
(“QIOs”), for example, are groups of physicians and other health care quality experts that work on behalf of
CMS to ensure that Medicare pays only for goods and services that are reasonable and necessary and that are
provided in the most appropriate setting. Under the Recovery Audit Contractor (“RAC”) program, CMS
contracts with RACs on a contingency basis to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper
payments in the fee-for-service Medicare program. The compensation for the RACs is based on their review of
claims submitted to Medicare for billing compliance, including correct coding and medical necessity, and the
amount of overpayments and underpayments they identify. CMS limits the number of claims that RACs may
audit by limiting the number of records that RACs may request from hospitals based on each provider’s claim
denial rate for the previous year. CMS has implemented the RAC program on a permanent, nationwide basis and
expanded the RAC program to the Managed Medicare program and Medicare Part D.

We have established policies and procedures to respond to the RAC requests and payment denials. Payment
recoveries resulting from RAC reviews and denials are appealable through administrative and judicial processes,
and we pursue reversal of adverse determinations at appropriate appeal levels. We incur additional costs related
to responding to RAC requests and denials, including costs associated with responding to requests for records
and pursuing the reversal of payment denials and losses associated with overpayments that are not reversed upon
appeal. Currently, there are significant delays in the assignment of new Medicare appeals to Administrative Law
Judges. Depending upon changes to and the growth of RAC programs and our success in appealing claims in
future periods, our cash flows and results of operations could be negatively impacted.

Managed Medicare

Under the Managed Medicare program (also known as Medicare Part C, or Medicare Advantage), the
federal government contracts with private health insurers to provide members with Medicare Part A, Part B and
Part D benefits. Managed Medicare plans can be structured as HMOs, PPOs or private fee-for-service plans. In
addition to covering Part A and Part B benefits, the health insurers may choose to offer supplemental benefits
and impose higher premiums and plan costs on beneficiaries. CMS makes fee payment adjustments based on
service benchmarks and quality ratings and publishes star ratings to assist beneficiaries with plan selection.
Enrollment in managed Medicare plans is increasing, with more than one-third of all Medicare enrollees
projected to be in such a plan in 2018.

10

Medicaid

Medicaid programs are funded jointly by the federal government and the states and are administered by
states under approved plans. Most state Medicaid program payments are made under a PPS or are based on
negotiated payment levels with individual hospitals. Medicaid reimbursement is often less than a hospital’s cost
of services. The Health Reform Law, as enacted, requires states to expand Medicaid coverage to all individuals
under age 65 with incomes effectively at or below 138% of the federal poverty level. However, states may opt
out of the expansion without losing existing federal Medicaid funding. A number of states, including Texas and
Florida, have opted out of the Medicaid expansion. Some states use, or have applied to use, waivers granted by
CMS to implement expansion, impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions, or otherwise implement
programs that vary from federal standards. The presidential administration and a number of members of
Congress have indicated their intent to increase state flexibility in the administration of Medicaid programs,
including allowing states to condition enrollment on work or other community engagement.

Because most states must operate with balanced budgets and because the Medicaid program is often the
state’s largest program, states can be expected to adopt or consider adopting legislation designed to reduce their
Medicaid expenditures. Budgetary pressures have, in recent years, resulted and likely will continue to result in
decreased spending, or decreased spending growth, for Medicaid programs in many states. Certain states in
which we operate have adopted broad-based provider taxes to fund the non-federal share of Medicaid programs.
Many states have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage, enroll Medicaid
recipients in managed care programs and/or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the
states’ Medicaid systems. However, the Health Reform Law requires states to at least maintain Medicaid
eligibility standards for children established prior to the enactment of the law until October 1, 2019.

Federal funds under the Medicaid program may not be used to reimburse providers for medical assistance
provided to treat certain provider-preventable conditions. Each state Medicaid program must deny payments to
providers for the treatment of health care-acquired conditions designated by CMS as well as other provider-
preventable conditions that may be designated by the state.

Congress has expanded the federal government’s involvement in fighting fraud, waste and abuse in the
Medicaid program through the Medicaid Integrity Program. CMS employs private contractors, referred to as
Medicaid Integrity Contractors (“MICs”), to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify
overpayments. In addition to MICs, several other contractors and state Medicaid agencies have increased their
review activities. The Health Reform Law increased federal funding for the Medicaid Integrity Program and
expanded the RAC program’s scope to include Medicaid claims. Most states have implemented RAC programs,
which vary by state in design and operation.

Managed Medicaid

Enrollment in managed Medicaid plans has increased in recent years, as state governments seek to control
the cost of Medicaid programs. Managed Medicaid programs enable states to contract with one or more entities
for patient enrollment, care management and claims adjudication. The states usually do not relinquish program
responsibilities for financing, eligibility criteria and core benefit plan design. We generally contract directly with
one or more of the designated entities, usually a managed care organization. The provisions of these programs
are state-specific. Many states direct managed care plans to pass through supplemental payments to designated
providers, independent of services rendered, to ensure consistent funding of providers that serve large numbers of
low-income patients. However, in an effort to more closely tie funds to delivery and outcomes, CMS began
limiting these “pass-through payments” to managed Medicaid plans in 2016 and will ultimately prohibit such
payments by 2027.

Accountable Care Organizations and Bundled Payment Initiatives

An Accountable Care Organization (“ACO”) is a network of providers and suppliers that work together to
invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to attempt to achieve high quality and efficient delivery

11

of services. Promoting accountability and coordination of care, ACOs are intended to produce savings as a result
of improved quality and operational efficiency. ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by
HHS are eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. There are several types of
ACO programs, including the Medicare Shared Savings Program (“MSSP”), which was established pursuant to
the Health Reform Law, and the Next Generation ACO Model.

The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation (“CMMI”) is responsible for establishing demonstration
projects and other initiatives in order to identify, develop, test and encourage the adoption of new methods of
delivering and paying for health care that create savings under the Medicare and Medicaid programs while
improving quality of care. For example, providers participating in bundled payment initiatives agree to receive
one payment for services provided to Medicare patients for certain medical conditions or episodes of care,
accepting accountability for costs and quality of care. By rewarding providers for increasing quality and reducing
costs and penalizing providers if costs exceed a set amount, these models are intended to lead to higher quality,
more coordinated care at a lower cost to the Medicare program. Hospitals may receive supplemental Medicare
payments or owe repayments to CMS depending on whether overall CMS spending per episode exceeds or falls
below a target specified by CMS and whether quality standards are met. The CMMI has implemented a voluntary
bundled payment program known as the Bundled Payment for Care Improvement (“BPCI”) initiative.
Participation in bundled payment programs is generally voluntary, but CMS requires hospitals in selected
geographic areas to participate in bundling programs for specified orthopedic procedures.

HHS continues to focus on shifting from traditional fee-for-service reimbursement models to alternative
payment models that tie reimbursement to quality and/or value, including bundled payment programs. Several
private third-party payers have expressed their intent to increasingly rely on such reimbursement models, which
may increasingly shift financial risk to providers.

Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments

In addition to making payments for services provided directly to beneficiaries, Medicare makes additional
payments to hospitals that treat a disproportionately large number of low-income patients (Medicaid and
Medicare patients eligible to receive Supplemental Security Income). Disproportionate Share Hospital (“DSH”)
payments are determined annually based on certain statistical information required by HHS and are paid as a
percentage addition to MS-DRG payments.

The Health Reform Law reduced Medicare DSH payments to 25% of the amount they otherwise would have
been absent the law. The remaining 75% of the amount that would otherwise be paid under Medicare DSH is
effectively pooled, and this pool is adjusted each year by a formula that reflects changes in the national level of
uninsured who are under 65 years of age. Thus, the greater the level of coverage for the previously uninsured
nationally, the more the Medicare DSH payment pool will be reduced. Each DSH hospital is paid, out of the
DSH payment pool, an amount allocated based upon its estimated cost of providing uncompensated care.

Hospitals that provide care to a disproportionately high number of low-income patients may receive
Medicaid DSH payments. The federal government distributes federal Medicaid DSH funds to each state based on
a statutory formula. The states then distribute the DSH funding among qualifying hospitals. States have broad
discretion to define which hospitals qualify for Medicaid DSH payments and the amount of such payments. The
Health Reform Law and subsequent legislation provide for reductions to the Medicaid DSH hospital program.
However, Congress has delayed the implementation of these reductions until 2020. Under the budget bill signed
into law in February 2018, Medicaid DSH payments will be reduced by $4 billion in 2020 and by $8 billion per
year from 2021 through 2025.

TRICARE

TRICARE is the Department of Defense’s health care program for members of the armed forces. For
inpatient services, TRICARE reimburses hospitals based on a DRG system modeled on the Medicare inpatient

12

PPS. For outpatient services, TRICARE reimburses hospitals based on a PPS that is similar to that utilized for
services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries.

Annual Cost Reports

All hospitals participating in the Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE programs, whether paid on a
reasonable cost basis or under a PPS, are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements. Federal and,
where applicable, state regulations require the submission of annual cost reports covering the revenues, costs and
expenses associated with the services provided by each hospital
to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid
recipients.

Annual cost reports required under the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to routine audits, which
may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us under these reimbursement
programs. These audits often require several years to reach the final determination of amounts due to or from us
under these programs. Providers also have rights of appeal, and it is common to contest issues raised in audits of
cost reports.

Managed Care and Other Discounted Plans

Most of our hospitals offer discounts from established charges to certain large group purchasers of health
care services, including managed care plans and private health insurers. Admissions reimbursed by commercial
managed care and other insurers were 28%, 29% and 30% of our total admissions for the years ended
December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Managed care contracts are typically negotiated for terms
between one and three years. While we generally received contracted annual average increases of 4% to 5% from
managed care payers during 2017, there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive increases in the
future. Further, it is not clear what impact, if any, health reform efforts at the federal and state levels,
consolidation within the third-party payer industry and vertical integration among third party payers and health
care providers will have on our ability to negotiate reimbursement rates.

Uninsured and Self-Pay Patients

Self-pay revenues are derived from providing health care services to patients without health insurance
coverage and from the patient responsibility portion of payments for our health care services that are not covered
by an individual’s health plan. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than
collection of amounts due from government health care programs or private third-party payers. Any increases in
uninsured individuals, changes to the payer mix or greater adoption of health plan structures that result in higher
patient responsibility amounts could increase amounts due from individuals.

A high percentage of our uninsured patients are initially admitted through our emergency rooms. For the
year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 85% of our admissions of uninsured patients occurred through our
emergency rooms. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (“EMTALA”) requires any hospital that
participates in the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person
who presents to the hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an
emergency medical condition, to either stabilize that condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual
to a facility that can handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions
exists regardless of an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. In addition, health insurers are required to
reimburse hospitals for emergency services provided to enrollees without prior authorization and without regard
to whether a participating provider contract is in place. The financial impact of the obligation to screen for and
stabilize emergency medical conditions has been offset, in part, by provisions of the Health Reform Law that
decrease the number of uninsured individuals. However, in 2017, Congress eliminated the financial penalty
associated with the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019. It is difficult to predict the impact of this
change, but it may result in fewer individuals electing to purchase health insurance.

13

Hospital Utilization

We believe the most important factors relating to the overall utilization of a hospital are the quality and
market position of the hospital and the number and quality of physicians and other health care professionals
providing patient care within the facility. Generally, we believe the ability of a hospital to be a market leader is
determined by its breadth of services, level of technology, quality and condition of the facilities, emphasis on
quality of care and convenience for patients and physicians. Other factors that impact utilization include the
growth in local population, local economic conditions and market penetration of managed care programs.

The following table sets forth certain operating statistics for our health care facilities. Health care facility
operations are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations, including decreases in patient utilization during holiday
periods and increases in the cold weather months.

(b) Represents the average number of licensed beds, weighted based on periods owned.
(c) Represents the total number of patients admitted to our hospitals and is used by management and certain

investors as a general measure of inpatient volume.

(d) Equivalent admissions are used by management and certain investors as a general measure of combined
inpatient and outpatient volume. Equivalent admissions are computed by multiplying admissions (inpatient
volume) by the sum of gross inpatient revenue and gross outpatient revenue and then dividing the resulting
amount by gross inpatient revenue. The equivalent admissions computation “equates” outpatient revenue to

Competition

Generally, other hospitals in the communities we serve provide services similar to those offered by our
hospitals. Additionally,
in recent years the number of freestanding specialty hospitals, surgery centers,
emergency departments, urgent care centers and diagnostic and imaging centers in the geographic areas in which
we operate has increased significantly. As a result, most of our hospitals operate in a highly competitive
environment. In some cases, competing hospitals are more established than our hospitals. Some competing
facilities are physician-owned or are owned by tax-supported government agencies and many others are owned
by not-for-profit entities that may be supported by endowments, charitable contributions and/or tax revenues and
are exempt from sales, property and income taxes. Such exemptions and support are not available to our hospitals
and may provide the tax-supported or not-for-profit entities an advantage in funding capital expenditures. In
certain localities there are large teaching hospitals that provide highly specialized facilities, equipment and
services that may not be available at most of our hospitals. We also face competition from specialty hospitals and
from both our own and unaffiliated freestanding ASCs for market share in certain high margin services.

Psychiatric hospitals frequently attract patients from areas outside their immediate locale and, therefore, our
psychiatric hospitals and units compete with both local and regional hospitals, including the psychiatric units of
general, acute care hospitals.

Our strategies are designed to ensure our hospitals are competitive. We believe our hospitals compete within
local communities on the basis of many factors, including the quality of care, ability to attract and retain quality
physicians, skilled clinical personnel and other health care professionals,
location, breadth of services,
technology offered, quality and condition of the facilities and prices charged. Hospitals must make public a list of
their standard charges for items and services or their policies for providing a list of such charges in response to an
inquiry. We have increased our focus on operating outpatient services with improved accessibility and more
convenient service for patients and increased predictability and efficiency for physicians.

Two of the most significant factors to the competitive position of a hospital are the number and quality of
physicians affiliated with or employed by the hospital. Although physicians may at any time terminate their
relationship with a hospital we operate, our hospitals seek to retain physicians with varied specialties on the
hospitals’ medical staffs and to attract other qualified physicians. We believe physicians refer patients to a
hospital on the basis of the quality and scope of services it renders to patients and physicians, the quality of
physicians on the medical staff, the location of the hospital and the quality of the hospital’s facilities, equipment
and employees. Accordingly, we strive to maintain and provide quality facilities, equipment, employees and
services for physicians and patients. Our hospitals face competition from competitors that are implementing
physician alignment strategies, such as employing physicians, acquiring physician practice groups and
participating in ACOs or other clinical integration models.

Another major factor in the competitive position of our hospitals is our ability to negotiate service contracts
with group purchasers of health care services. Managed care plans attempt to direct and control the use of
hospital services and obtain discounts from hospitals’ established gross charges. Similarly, employers and
traditional health insurers continue to attempt to contain costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed
care programs and discounts from established gross charges. Generally, hospitals compete for service contracts
with group purchasers of health care services on the basis of price, market reputation, geographic location,
quality and range of services, quality of the medical staff and convenience. Our future success will depend, in
part, on our ability to retain and renew our contracts with third-party payers and enter into new contracts on
favorable terms. Other health care providers may impact our ability to enter into contracts with third-party payers
or negotiate increases in our reimbursement and other favorable terms and conditions. For example, some of our
competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of
managed care companies to contract with us. Increasing vertical integration efforts involving third-party payers
and health care providers may increase these challenges. Moreover, the trend toward consolidation among private
third-party payers tends to increase payer bargaining power over fee structures. In addition, health reform

15

efforts, such as the Health Reform Law’s creation of the Exchanges and limitations on rescissions of coverage
and pre-existing condition exclusions, may lead to private third-party payers increasingly demanding reduced
fees or being unwilling to negotiate reimbursement increases. Most of the health plans offered through the
Exchanges provide for narrow networks that restrict the number of participating providers or tiered networks that
impose significantly higher cost sharing obligations on patients that obtain services from providers in a
disfavored tier. These trends may continue regardless of potential repeal or replacement of, or changes to, the
Health Reform Law. The importance of obtaining contracts with group purchasers of health care services varies
from community to community, depending on the market strength of such organizations.

State certificate of need (“CON”) laws, which place limitations on a health care facility’s ability to expand
services and facilities, make capital expenditures and otherwise make changes in operations, may also have the
effect of restricting competition. We currently operate health care facilities in a number of states with CON laws
or that require other types of approvals for the establishment or expansion of certain facility types or services.
Before issuing a CON or other approval, these states consider the need for additional or expanded health care
facilities or services. In those states that do not require state approval or that set relatively high levels of
expenditures before they become reviewable by state authorities, competition in the form of new services,
facilities and capital spending is more prevalent. See Item 1, “Business — Regulation and Other Factors.”

We and the health care industry as a whole face the challenge of continuing to provide quality patient care
while dealing with rising costs and strong competition for patients. Changes in medical technology, existing and
future legislation, regulations and interpretations and contracting for provider services by third-party payers
remain ongoing challenges.

Admissions, average lengths of stay and reimbursement amounts continue to be negatively affected by
third-party payer pre-admission authorization requirements, utilization review and pressure to maximize
outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Increased competition,
admission constraints and third-party payer pressures are expected to continue. To meet these challenges, we
intend to expand and update our facilities or acquire or construct new facilities where appropriate, to enhance the
provision of a comprehensive array of outpatient services, offer market competitive pricing to group purchasers
of health care services, upgrade facilities and equipment and offer new or expanded programs and services.

Regulation and Other Factors

Licensure, Certification and Accreditation

Health care facility construction and operation are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations
relating to the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, maintenance
of adequate records, fire prevention, rate-setting, building codes and environmental protection. Facilities are
subject to periodic inspection by governmental and other authorities to assure continued compliance with the
various standards necessary for licensing and accreditation. We believe our health care facilities are properly
licensed under applicable state laws. Each of our acute care hospitals located in the United States is eligible to
participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs and is accredited by The Joint Commission. If any facility were
to lose its Medicare or Medicaid certification, the facility would be unable to receive reimbursement from federal
health care programs. If any facility were to lose accreditation, the facility would be subject to state surveys,
potentially be subject to increased scrutiny by CMS and likely lose payment from private third-party payers.
Management believes our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal, state, local and
independent
licensure, certification and
accreditation are subject to change and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for us to make
changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel and services. The requirements for licensure, certification and
accreditation also include notification or approval in the event of the transfer or change of ownership or certain
other changes. Failure to provide required notifications or obtain necessary approvals in these circumstances can
result
lapses in
reimbursement or other penalties.

Certificates of Need

In some states where we operate hospitals and other health care facilities, the construction or expansion of
health care facilities, the acquisition of existing facilities, the transfer or change of ownership and the addition of
new beds or services may be subject to review by and prior approval of, or notifications to, state regulatory
agencies under a CON program. Such laws generally require the reviewing state agency to determine the public
need for additional or expanded health care facilities and services. Failure to provide required notifications or
obtain necessary state approvals can result in the inability to expand facilities, complete an acquisition or change
ownership or other penalties.

State Rate Review

Some states have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on
hospital revenues, assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state. In the aggregate,
indigent tax provisions have not materially, adversely affected our results of operations. Although we do not
currently operate facilities in states that mandate rate or budget reviews, we cannot predict whether we will
operate in such states in the future, or whether the states in which we currently operate may adopt legislation
mandating such reviews.

Federal Health Care Program Regulations

Participation in any federal health care program, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, is heavily
regulated by statute and regulation. If a hospital fails to substantially comply with the numerous conditions of
participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs or performs certain prohibited acts,
the hospital’s
participation in the federal health care programs may be terminated, or civil and/or criminal penalties may be
imposed. Civil monetary penalties are adjusted annually based on updates to the consumer price index and were
recently increased under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.

Anti-kickback Statute

A section of the Social Security Act known as the “Anti-kickback Statute” prohibits providers and others
from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration with the intent of generating
referrals or orders for services or items covered by a federal health care program. Courts have interpreted this
statute broadly and held that there is a violation of the Anti-kickback Statute if just one purpose of the
remuneration is to generate referrals, even if there are other lawful purposes. Furthermore, the Health Reform
Law provides that knowledge of the law or the intent to violate the law is not required. Violations of the Anti-
kickback Statute may be punished by criminal fines of up to $100,000 per violation, imprisonment, substantial
civil monetary penalties per violation that are subject to annual adjustment based on updates to the consumer
price index and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and/or exclusion from
participation in federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, submission of a
claim for services or items generated in violation of the Anti-kickback Statute may be subject to additional
penalties under the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) as a false or fraudulent claim.

The OIG, among other regulatory agencies, is responsible for identifying and eliminating fraud, abuse and
waste. The OIG carries out this mission through a nationwide program of audits, investigations and inspections.
The OIG provides guidance to the industry through various methods including advisory opinions and “Special
Fraud Alerts.” These Special Fraud Alerts do not have the force of law, but identify features of arrangements or
transactions that the government believes may cause the arrangements or transactions to violate the Anti-
kickback Statute or other federal health care laws. The OIG has identified several incentive arrangements that
constitute suspect practices, including: (a) payment of any incentive by a hospital each time a physician refers a
patient to the hospital, (b) the use of free or significantly discounted office space or equipment in facilities
usually located close to the hospital, (c) provision of free or significantly discounted billing, nursing or other staff

17

services, (d) free training for a physician’s office staff in areas such as management techniques and laboratory
techniques, (e) guarantees which provide, if the physician’s income fails to reach a predetermined level, the
hospital will pay any portion of the remainder, (f) low-interest or interest-free loans, or loans which may be
forgiven if a physician refers patients to the hospital, (g) payment of the costs of a physician’s travel and
expenses for conferences, (h) coverage on the hospital’s group health insurance plans at an inappropriately low
cost to the physician, (i) payment for services (which may include consultations at the hospital) which require
few, if any, substantive duties by the physician, (j) purchasing goods or services from physicians at prices in
excess of their fair market value, (k) rental of space in physician offices, at other than fair market value terms, by
persons or entities to which physicians refer, and (l) physician-owned entities (frequently referred to as
physician-owned distributorships or PODs) that derive revenue from selling, or arranging for the sale of,
implantable medical devices ordered by their physician-owners for use on procedures that physician-owners
perform on their own patients at hospitals or ASCs. The OIG has encouraged persons having information about
hospitals who offer the above types of incentives to physicians to report such information to the OIG.

The OIG also issues “Special Advisory Bulletins” as a means of providing guidance to health care
providers. These bulletins, along with the Special Fraud Alerts, have focused on certain arrangements that could
be subject to heightened scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, including: (a) contractual joint venture
arrangements and other joint venture arrangements between those in a position to refer business, such as
physicians, and those providing items or services for which Medicare or Medicaid pays, and (b) certain
“gainsharing” arrangements, i.e., the practice of giving physicians a share of any reduction in a hospital’s costs
for patient care attributable in part to the physician’s efforts.

In addition to issuing Special Fraud Alerts and Special Advisory Bulletins, the OIG issues compliance
program guidance for certain types of health care providers. The OIG guidance identifies a number of risk areas
under federal fraud and abuse statutes and regulations. These areas of risk include compensation arrangements
with physicians, recruitment arrangements with physicians and joint venture relationships with physicians.

As authorized by Congress, the OIG has published safe harbor regulations that outline categories of
activities deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback Statute. Currently, there are statutory
exceptions and safe harbors for various activities, including the following: certain investment interests, space
rental, equipment rental, practitioner recruitment, personnel services and management contracts, sale of practice,
referral services, warranties, discounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of beneficiary
coinsurance and deductible amounts, managed care arrangements, obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies,
investments in group practices, freestanding surgery centers, ambulance replenishing, and referral agreements for
specialty services.

The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor or is identified in a
Special Fraud Alert, Special Advisory Bulletin or other guidance does not necessarily render the conduct or
business arrangement illegal under the Anti-kickback Statute. However, such conduct and business arrangements
may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities.

We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians and others who either refer or influence the
referral of patients to our hospitals, other health care facilities and employed physicians, including employment
contracts, leases, medical director agreements and professional service agreements. We also have similar
relationships with physicians and facilities to which patients are referred from our facilities and other providers.
In addition, we provide financial incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit physicians into
the communities served by our hospitals. While we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors, certain
of our current arrangements, including joint ventures and financial relationships with physicians and other
referral sources and persons and entities to which we refer patients, do not qualify for safe harbor protection.

Although we believe our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources and referral recipients
have been structured to comply with current law and available interpretations, there can be no assurance

18

regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements comply with the Anti-
kickback Statute or other applicable laws. An adverse determination could subject us to liabilities under the
Social Security Act and other laws, including criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from
participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs.

Stark Law

The Social Security Act also includes a provision commonly known as the “Stark Law.” The Stark Law
prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their
immediate family members have a financial relationship, if these entities provide certain “designated health
services” reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits
entities that provide designated health services reimbursable by Medicare and Medicaid from billing the
Medicare and Medicaid programs for any items or services that result from a prohibited referral and requires the
entities to refund amounts received for items or services provided pursuant to the prohibited referral on a timely
basis. “Designated health services” include inpatient and outpatient hospital services, clinical laboratory services
and radiology services. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, substantial civil
monetary penalties per claim submitted and exclusion from the federal health care programs. Failure to refund
amounts received as a result of a prohibited referral on a timely basis may constitute a false or fraudulent claim
and may result in civil penalties and additional penalties under the FCA. The statute also provides for a penalty
for a circumvention scheme. These penalties are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index.

There are exceptions to the self-referral prohibition for many of the customary financial arrangements
between physicians and providers, including employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements. Unlike
safe harbors under the Anti-kickback Statute with which compliance is voluntary, a financial relationship must
comply with every requirement of a Stark Law exception or the arrangement is in violation of the Stark Law.
Although there is an exception for a physician’s ownership interest in an entire hospital, the Health Reform Law
prohibits physician-owned hospitals established after December 31, 2010 from billing for Medicare or Medicaid
patients referred by their physician owners. As a result, the law effectively prevents the formation of new
physician-owned hospitals that participate in Medicare or Medicaid. While the Health Reform Law grandfathers
existing physician-owned hospitals, it does not allow these hospitals to increase the percentage of physician
ownership and significantly restricts their ability to expand services.

Through a series of rulemakings, CMS has issued final regulations implementing the Stark Law. While
these regulations were intended to clarify the requirements of the exceptions to the Stark Law, it is unclear how
the government will interpret many of these exceptions for enforcement purposes. Further, we do not always
have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of the Stark Law and its implementing
regulations. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the regulations
implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex, and we cannot assure that every relationship complies
fully with the Stark Law.

Similar State Laws

Many states in which we operate also have laws similar to the Anti-kickback Statute that prohibit payments
to physicians for patient referrals and laws similar to the Stark Law that prohibit certain self-referrals. These state
laws often apply regardless of the source of payment for care, and little precedent exists for their interpretation or
enforcement. These statutes typically provide for criminal and civil penalties, as well as loss of licensure.

Other Fraud and Abuse Provisions

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) broadened the scope of certain
fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all health

19

benefit programs. The Social Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for making false claims and
statements to Medicare and Medicaid. False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for services not
rendered or for misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement, billing for
unnecessary goods and services and cost report fraud. Federal enforcement officials have the ability to exclude
from Medicare and Medicaid any business entities and any investors, officers and managing employees
associated with business entities that have committed health care fraud, even if the officer or managing employee
had no knowledge of the fraud. Criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for a number of other prohibited
activities, including failure to return known overpayments, certain gainsharing arrangements, billing Medicare
amounts that are substantially in excess of a provider’s usual charges, offering remuneration to influence a
Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary’s selection of a health care provider, contracting with an individual or entity
known to be excluded from a federal health care program, making or accepting a payment to induce a physician
to reduce or limit services, and soliciting or receiving any remuneration in return for referring an individual for
an item or service payable by a federal health care program. Like the Anti-kickback Statute, these provisions are
very broad. Civil penalties may be imposed for the failure to report and return an overpayment within 60 days of
identifying the overpayment or by the date a corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later. To avoid
liability, providers must, among other things, carefully and accurately code claims for reimbursement, promptly
return overpayments and accurately prepare cost reports.

Some of these provisions, including the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, require a lower burden of
proof than other fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-kickback Statute. Substantial civil monetary penalties
may be imposed under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law. These penalties will be updated annually based
on changes to the consumer price index. In some cases, violations of the Civil Monetary Penalty Law may result
in penalties of up to three times the remuneration offered, paid, solicited or received. In addition, a violator may
be subject to exclusion from federal and state health care programs. Federal and state governments increasingly
use the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, especially where they believe they cannot meet the higher burden of
proof requirements under the Anti-kickback Statute. Further, individuals can receive up to $1,000 for providing
information on Medicare fraud and abuse that leads to the recovery of at least $100 of Medicare funds under the
Medicare Integrity Program.

The Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Laws

We are subject to state and federal laws that govern the submission of claims for reimbursement and
prohibit the making of false claims or statements. One of the most prominent of these laws is the FCA, which
may be enforced by the federal government directly or by a qui tam plaintiff, or whistleblower, on the
government’s behalf. The government may use the FCA to prosecute Medicare and other government program
fraud in areas such as coding errors, billing for services not provided and submitting false cost reports. In
addition, the FCA covers payments made in connection with the Exchanges created under the Health Reform
Law, if those payments include any federal funds. When a private party brings a qui tam action under the FCA,
the defendant is not made aware of the lawsuit until the government commences its own investigation or makes a
determination whether it will intervene. If a defendant is determined by a court of law to be liable under the FCA,
the defendant may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus
substantial mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim. These penalties are updated annually based on
changes to the consumer price index.

There are many potential bases for liability under the FCA. Liability often arises when an entity knowingly
submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The FCA defines the term “knowingly”
broadly. Though simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the FCA, submitting a claim with reckless
disregard to its truth or falsity constitutes a “knowing” submission under the FCA and, therefore, may create
liability. Submission of claims for services or items generated in violation of the Anti-kickback Statute
constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the FCA. Whistleblowers and the federal government have taken the
position, and some courts have held, that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes, such as the Stark
Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the FCA. False claims under the FCA also include the knowing

20

and improper failure to report and refund amounts owed to the government in a timely manner following
identification of an overpayment. An overpayment is deemed to be identified when a person has, or should have
through reasonable diligence, determined that an overpayment was received and quantified the overpayment.

Every entity that receives at least $5 million annually in Medicaid payments must have written policies for
all employees, contractors or agents, providing detailed information about false claims, false statements and
whistleblower protections under certain federal laws, including the FCA, and similar state laws. In addition,
federal law provides an incentive to states to enact false claims laws comparable to the FCA. A number of states
in which we operate have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower
provisions under which a private party may file a civil lawsuit in state court. We have adopted and distributed
policies pertaining to the FCA and relevant state laws.

HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy and Security Requirements

The Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA and implementing regulations require the use of
uniform electronic data transmission standards and code sets for certain health care claims and payment
transactions submitted or received electronically. In addition, HIPAA requires that each provider use a National
Provider Identifier. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry.
HHS is in the process of adopting standards for additional electronic transactions and establishing operating rules
to promote uniformity in the implementation of each standardized electronic transaction.

The privacy and security regulations promulgated pursuant to HIPAA extensively regulate the use and
disclosure of individually identifiable health information, known as “protected health information,” and require
covered entities, including health plans and most health care providers, to implement administrative, physical and
technical safeguards to protect the security of such information. Certain provisions of the security and privacy
regulations apply to business associates (entities that handle protected health information on behalf of covered
entities), and business associates are subject to direct liability for violation of these provisions. In addition, a
covered entity may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business
associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity.

Covered entities must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals
without unreasonable delay but not to exceed 60 days of discovery of the breach by a covered entity or its agents.
Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain situations involving large breaches, to the media. HHS is
required to publish on its website a list of all covered entities that report a breach involving more than
500 individuals. All non-permitted uses or disclosures of unsecured protected health information are presumed to
be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the
information has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected
individuals in the event of a data breach involving individually identifiable information.

Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in criminal penalties and in substantial
civil penalties per violation. These civil penalties are updated annually based on updates to the consumer price
index. HHS enforces the regulations and performs compliance audits. In addition to enforcement by HHS, state
attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to
violations that threaten the privacy of state residents. HHS may resolve HIPAA violations through informal
means, such as allowing a covered entity to implement a corrective action plan, but HHS has the discretion to
move directly to impose monetary penalties and is required to impose penalties for violations resulting from
willful neglect. We enforce a HIPAA compliance plan, which we believe complies with the HIPAA privacy and
security regulations and under which a HIPAA compliance group monitors our compliance. The HIPAA privacy
regulations and security regulations have and will continue to impose significant costs on our facilities in order to
comply with these standards.

21

There are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels
addressing privacy and security concerns. Our facilities remain subject to any federal or state privacy-related
laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could
impose additional penalties. For example, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority
to initiate enforcement actions in response to data breaches.

EMTALA

All of our hospitals in the United States are subject to EMTALA. This federal law requires any hospital
participating in the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every
individual who presents to the hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an
emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to
a facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists
regardless of an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital
fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer an individual or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in
order to first inquire about the individual’s ability to pay. Penalties for violations of EMTALA include exclusion
from participation in the Medicare program and civil monetary penalties. These civil monetary penalties are
adjusted annually based on updates to the consumer price index. In addition, an injured individual,
the
individual’s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of a hospital’s violation of
the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital.

The government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in which individuals do not actually
present to a hospital’s emergency room, but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospital’s
campus, generally, or to a hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a
hospital-owned ambulance, subject to certain exceptions. At least one court has interpreted the law also to apply
to a hospital that has been notified of a patient’s pending arrival in a non-hospital owned ambulance. EMTALA
does not generally apply to individuals admitted for inpatient services. The government has expressed its intent
to investigate and enforce EMTALA violations actively.

Corporate Practice of Medicine/Fee Splitting

Some of the states in which we operate have laws prohibiting corporations and other entities from
employing physicians, practicing medicine for a profit and making certain direct and indirect payments to, or
entering into fee-splitting arrangements with, health care providers designed to induce or encourage the referral
of patients to, or the recommendation of, particular providers for medical products and services. Possible
sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties. In addition,
agreements between the corporation and the physician may be considered void and unenforceable. These statutes
vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies.

Health Care Industry Investigations

Significant media and public attention has focused in recent years on the hospital industry. This media and
public attention, changes in government personnel and other factors have led to increased scrutiny of the health
care industry. Except as may be disclosed in our SEC filings, we are not aware of any material investigations of
the Company under federal or state health care laws or regulations. It is possible that governmental entities could
initiate investigations or litigation in the future at facilities we operate and that such matters could result in
significant penalties, as well as adverse publicity. It is also possible that our executives and managers could be
included in governmental investigations or litigation or named as defendants in private litigation.

Our substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental billings result in heightened scrutiny of our
operations. We continue to monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and
compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.

22

Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigations or litigation may
result in interpretations that are inconsistent with our or industry practices.

In public statements surrounding current investigations, governmental authorities have taken positions on a
number of issues, including some for which little official interpretation previously has been available, that appear
to be inconsistent with practices that have been common within the industry and that previously have not been
challenged in this manner. In some instances, government investigations that have in the past been conducted
under the civil provisions of federal law may now be conducted as criminal investigations.

Both federal and state government agencies have increased their focus on and coordination of civil and
criminal enforcement efforts in the health care area. The OIG and the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) have, from
time to time, established national enforcement initiatives, targeting all hospital providers that focus on specific
billing practices or other suspected areas of abuse. The Health Reform Law includes additional federal funding of
$350 million over 10 years to fight health care fraud, waste and abuse, including $10 million in federal fiscal
year 2018. In addition, governmental agencies and their agents, such as MACs, fiscal intermediaries and carriers,
may conduct audits of our health care operations. Private third-party payers may conduct similar post-payment
audits, and we also perform internal audits and monitoring.

In addition to national enforcement initiatives, federal and state investigations have addressed a wide variety
of routine health care operations such as: cost reporting and billing practices, including for Medicare outliers;
financial arrangements with referral sources; physician recruitment activities; physician joint ventures; and
hospital charges and collection practices for self-pay patients. We engage in many of these routine health care
operations and other activities that could be the subject of governmental investigations or inquiries. For example,
we have significant Medicare and Medicaid billings, numerous financial arrangements with physicians who are
referral sources to our hospitals, and joint venture arrangements involving physician investors. Certain of our
individual facilities have received, and other facilities may receive, government inquiries from, and may be
subject to investigation by, federal and state agencies. Any additional investigations of the Company, our
executives or managers could result in significant liabilities or penalties to us, as well as adverse publicity.

Health Care Reform

The health care industry is subject to changing political, regulatory, and other influences, along with various
scientific and technological initiatives. In recent years, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have
passed a large number of laws and regulations intended to effect major change within the U.S. health care
system, including the Health Reform Law. The Health Reform Law affects how health care services are covered,
delivered and reimbursed through expanded health insurance coverage, reduced growth in Medicare program
spending, reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH payments, and the establishment of programs that tie
reimbursement to quality and integration. However, there is uncertainty regarding the future of the Health
Reform Law. The presidential administration and a number of members of Congress have expressed their intent
to repeal or make significant changes to the Health Reform Law, its implementation or interpretation. In 2017,
Congress eliminated the penalty associated with the individual mandate to maintain health insurance, effective
January 1, 2019. Further, the President of the United States signed an executive order that directs agencies to
minimize “economic and regulatory burdens” of the Health Reform Law, which may result in additional changes
in how the law is implemented.

As currently structured, the Health Reform Law expands coverage through a combination of public program
expansion and private sector health insurance and other reforms. Expansion in public program coverage has been
driven primarily by expanding the categories of individuals eligible for Medicaid coverage and permitting
individuals with relatively higher incomes to qualify. A number of states, including Texas and Florida, have
opted out of the Medicaid expansion provisions, which they may do without losing federal funding. For states
that have not participated in the Medicaid expansion, the maximum income level required for individuals and
families to qualify for Medicaid varies widely from state to state. Some states are using waivers granted by CMS
to expand their Medicaid programs,
impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions, or otherwise
implement programs that vary from federal standards.

23

The expansion of health coverage through the private sector as a result of the Health Reform Law has been
driven by new requirements applicable to health insurers, employers and individuals. For example, health
insurers are prohibited from imposing annual coverage limits, dropping coverage, excluding persons based upon
pre-existing conditions or denying coverage for any individual who is willing to pay the premiums for such
coverage. Large employers are required to provide health insurance benefits to their full time employees or pay a
penalty if an employee obtains government-subsidized coverage through an Exchange. Although individuals are
required to maintain health insurance for a minimum defined set of benefits, elimination of the penalty associated
with this mandate may impact the number of individuals who elect to purchase health insurance.

Health insurers participating in an Exchange must offer a set of minimum benefits, as defined by HHS, and
may offer more benefits. For individuals and families below 400% of the federal poverty level, the cost of
obtaining health insurance through the Exchanges is subsidized by the federal government. However, several
health insurers have limited or ended their participation in these marketplaces, creating uncertainty regarding the
long-term viability of the Exchanges.

As discussed in Item 1, “Business — Sources of Revenue,” the Health Reform Law provides for spending
reductions for Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. It also increasingly ties payment for
services to quality outcomes, provides for the creation of ACOs and creates incentives and other initiatives to
better coordinate patient care across settings and over time.

for

the sharing of

information and enhances criminal and administrative penalties

The Health Reform Law also makes several significant changes to health care fraud and abuse laws,
provides additional enforcement tools to the government, increases cooperation between agencies by establishing
mechanisms
for
non-compliance. For example, the Health Reform Law tightens up the rules for returning overpayments made by
governmental health programs and expands FCA liability to include failure to timely repay identified
overpayments. The Health Reform Law also prohibits newly created physician-owned hospitals from billing for
Medicare patients referred by their physician owners. As a result, the law effectively prevents the formation of
new physician-owned hospitals that participate in Medicare and Medicaid. While the law grandfathers existing
physician-owned hospitals, it does not allow these hospitals to increase the percentage of physician ownership
and significantly restricts their ability to expand services.

The Health Reform Law has had a net positive effect on the Company to date, before considering the impact
of Medicare reductions that began in 2010, and it is expected that the law, as presently implemented, will
continue to have a meaningful contribution to the Company’s results of operations. However, the Company could
be affected by efforts to change, repeal or replace the Health Reform Law and the potential instability of the
Exchanges, as discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”

General Economic and Demographic Factors

The health care industry is impacted by the overall United States economy. Budget deficits at federal, state
and local government entities have had a negative impact on spending for many health and human service
programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and similar programs, which represent significant payer sources for our
hospitals. We anticipate that the federal deficit, the growing magnitude of Medicare expenditures and the aging
of the United States population will continue to place pressure on government health care programs. Other risks
we face during periods of economic weakness and high unemployment include potential declines in the
population covered under managed care agreements, increased patient decisions to postpone or cancel elective
and nonemergency health care procedures (including delaying surgical procedures), potential increases in the
uninsured and underinsured populations,
increased adoption of health plan structures that shift financial
responsibility to patients and further difficulties in collecting patient receivables for copayment and deductible
amounts.

24

Compliance Program

We maintain a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable
federal guidelines and industry standards. The program is intended to monitor and raise awareness of various
regulatory issues among employees and to emphasize the importance of complying with governmental laws and
regulations. As part of the ethics and compliance program, we provide annual ethics and compliance training to
our employees and encourage all employees to report any violations to their supervisor, an ethics and compliance
officer or a toll-free telephone ethics line.

Antitrust Laws

The federal government and most states have enacted antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct
deemed to be anti-competitive. These laws prohibit price fixing, market allocation, bid-rigging, concerted refusal
to deal, market monopolization, price discrimination, tying arrangements, acquisitions of competitors and other
practices that have, or may have, an adverse effect on competition. Violations of federal or state antitrust laws
can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties. Antitrust enforcement in the health care
industry is currently a priority of the Federal Trade Commission and the DOJ. We believe we are in compliance
with such federal and state laws, but courts or regulatory authorities may reach a determination in the future that
could adversely affect our operations.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to various federal, state and local statutes and ordinances regulating the discharge of
materials into the environment. We do not believe that we will be required to expend any material amounts in
order to comply with these laws and regulations.

Insurance

As is typical in the health care industry, we are subject to claims and legal actions by patients in the ordinary
course of business. Subject, in most cases, to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention, our facilities are
insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence. The insurance
subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional
liability risks generally above a retention level of
$25 million per occurrence. We also maintain professional liability insurance with unrelated commercial carriers
for losses in excess of amounts insured by our insurance subsidiary.

We purchase, from unrelated insurance companies, coverage for cyber security incidents, directors and
officers liability and property loss in amounts we believe are adequate. The cyber security and directors and
officers liability coverage each include a $5 million corporate deductible. In addition, we will continue to
purchase coverage for our directors and officers on an ongoing basis. The property coverage includes varying
deductibles depending on the cause of the property damage. These deductibles range from 2% to 5% of the
affected property values for certain flood and wind and earthquake related incidents.

Employees and Medical Staffs

At December 31, 2017, we had approximately 253,000 employees, including approximately 63,000 part-
time employees. References herein to “employees” refer to employees of our affiliates. We are subject to various
state and federal laws that regulate wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions relating to employment.
At December 31, 2017, certain employees at 39 of our domestic hospitals are represented by various labor
unions. While no elections are expected in 2018, it is possible additional hospitals may unionize in the future. We
consider our employee relations to be good and have not experienced work stoppages that have materially,
adversely affected our business or results of operations. Our hospitals, like most hospitals, have experienced
rising labor costs. In some markets, nurse and medical support personnel availability has become a significant
operating issue to health care providers. To address this challenge, we have implemented several initiatives to
improve retention, recruiting, compensation programs and productivity.

25

Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians, including both employed physicians and physicians who
are not employees of our hospitals. Some physicians provide services in our hospitals under contracts, which
generally describe a term of service, provide and establish the duties and obligations of such physicians, require
the maintenance of certain performance criteria and fix compensation for such services. Any licensed physician
may apply to be accepted to the medical staff of any of our hospitals, but the hospital’s medical staff and the
appropriate governing board of the hospital, in accordance with established credentialing criteria, must approve
acceptance to the staff. Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals often also serve on the medical staffs of
other hospitals and may terminate their affiliation with one of our hospitals at any time.

We may be required to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other
medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs
could increase. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of
the markets in which we operate. Recent changes by the National Labor Relations Board (the “NLRB”) in its
election procedures could increase the likelihood of employee unionization attempts. To the extent a significant
portion of our employee base unionizes, our costs could increase materially. In addition, the states in which we
operate could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse-staffing ratios already in
place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs, and have an adverse impact on
revenues if we are required to limit patient admissions in order to meet the required ratios.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

If any of the events discussed in the following risk factors were to occur, our business, financial position,
results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially, adversely affected. Additional risks and
uncertainties not presently known, or currently deemed immaterial, may also constrain our business and
operations.

Our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations,
limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent
of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations.

We are highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2017, our total indebtedness was $33.058 billion. As of
December 31, 2017, we had availability of $1.977 billion under our senior secured revolving credit facility and
$70 million under our asset-based revolving credit facility, after giving effect to letters of credit and borrowing
base limitations. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including:

•

•

•

•

•

•

increasing our vulnerability to downturns or adverse changes in general economic,
competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulations;

industry or

requiring a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of
principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund
our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;

exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our unhedged borrowings are at variable
rates of interest;

limiting our ability to make strategic acquisitions or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures;

limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, share
repurchases, dividends, product or service line development, debt service requirements, acquisitions
and general corporate or other purposes; and

limiting our ability to adjust
disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged.

to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive

We and our subsidiaries have the ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the
restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes. If
new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.

We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may not be able to
refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms. If we are unable to do so, we may be forced to take other
actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial
condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and
to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you we will maintain a level
of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest
on our indebtedness.

In addition, we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly,

repayment of our
indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flows by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash
available to us by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be

31

permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is
a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to
obtain cash from our subsidiaries.

We may find it necessary or prudent to refinance our outstanding indebtedness, the terms of which may not
be favorable to us. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all, is directly affected by
the then current global economic and financial conditions. In addition, our ability to incur secured indebtedness
(which would generally enable us to achieve better pricing than the incurrence of unsecured indebtedness)
depends in part on the value of our assets, which depends, in turn, on the strength of our cash flows and results of
operations, and on economic and market conditions and other factors.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations or we are unable
to refinance our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to
sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be
successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If our operating results and
available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems
and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations.
We may not be able to consummate those dispositions, or the proceeds from the dispositions may not be
adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.

Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.

Our senior secured credit facilities and, to a lesser extent, the indentures governing our outstanding notes
contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit
our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:

•

•

incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;

pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other
restricted payments;

• make certain investments;

•

•

•

•

sell or transfer assets;

create liens;

consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and

enter into certain transactions with our affiliates.

Under our asset-based revolving credit facility, availability is subject to a borrowing base of 85% of eligible
accounts receivable less customary reserves, with any reduction in the borrowing base commensurately reducing
our ability to access this facility as a source of liquidity. In addition, under the asset-based revolving credit
facility, when (and for as long as) the combined availability under our asset-based revolving credit facility and
our senior secured revolving credit facility is less than a specified amount for a certain period of time or, if a
payment or bankruptcy event of default has occurred and is continuing, funds deposited into any of our
depository accounts will be transferred on a daily basis into a blocked account with the administrative agent and
applied to prepay loans under the asset-based revolving credit facility and to collateralize letters of credit issued
thereunder.

Under our senior secured credit facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios.
Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no
assurance we will continue to meet those ratios. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default
under both the cash flow credit facility and the asset-based revolving credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an

32

event of default under these senior secured credit facilities, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all
amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate
all commitments to extend further credit, which would also result in an event of default under a significant
portion of our outstanding indebtedness. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the senior
secured credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. We
have pledged a significant portion of our assets under our senior secured credit facilities and that collateral is also
pledged as collateral under our first lien notes. If any of the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities
accelerate the repayment of borrowings, there can be no assurance there will be sufficient assets to repay the
senior secured credit facilities, the first lien notes and our other indebtedness.

Our hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers.

The health care business is highly competitive, and competition among hospitals and other health care
providers for patients has intensified in recent years. Generally, other hospitals in the communities we serve
provide services similar to those offered by our hospitals. In addition, CMS publicizes on its Hospital Compare
website performance data related to quality measures and data on patient satisfaction surveys hospitals submit in
connection with their Medicare reimbursement. Federal law provides for the future expansion of the number of
quality measures that must be reported. Additional quality measures and future trends toward clinical
transparency may have an unanticipated impact on our competitive position and patient volumes. Further, every
hospital must establish and update annually a public listing of the hospital’s standard charges for items and
services. If any of our hospitals achieve poor results (or results that are lower than our competitors) on these
quality measures or on patient satisfaction surveys or if our standard charges are higher than our competitors, our
patient volumes could decline.

In addition, the number of freestanding specialty hospitals, surgery centers, emergency departments, urgent
care centers and diagnostic and imaging centers in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased. As a
result, most of our hospitals operate in a highly competitive environment, which may put pressure on our pricing
as high margin services transition to outpatient facilities and may also place pressure on the Company’s strategy
for volume growth. Some of the facilities that compete with our hospitals are physician-owned or are owned by
governmental agencies or not-for-profit corporations supported by endowments, charitable contributions and/or
tax revenues and can finance capital expenditures and operations on a tax-exempt basis. Recent consolidations of
not-for-profit hospital entities may intensify this competitive pressure. There is also increasing consolidation in
the third-party payer industry, including vertical integration efforts among third-party payers and health care
providers. Health care industry participants are increasingly implementing physician alignment strategies, such as
employing physicians, acquiring physician practice groups and participating in ACOs or other clinical integration
models. Other industry participants, such as large employer groups and their affiliates, may intensify competitive
pressure and affect the industry in ways that are difficult to predict.

Our hospitals compete with specialty hospitals and with both our own and unaffiliated freestanding surgery
centers for market share in certain high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel. If ASCs are
better able to compete in this environment than our hospitals, our hospitals may experience a decline in patient
volume, and we may experience a decrease in margin, even if those patients use our ASCs. In states that do not
require a CON or other type of approval for the purchase, construction or expansion of health care facilities or
services, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent. Further, if our
competitors are better able to attract patients, make capital expenditures and maintain modern and
technologically upgraded facilities and equipment, recruit physicians, expand services or obtain favorable third-
party payer contracts at their facilities than our hospitals and ASCs, we may experience an overall decline in
patient volume. See Item 1, “Business — Competition.”

33

A deterioration in the collectability of uninsured and patient due accounts could adversely affect our results of
operations.

The primary collection risks for our accounts receivable relate to the uninsured patient accounts and patient
accounts for which the primary third-party payer has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but
patient responsibility amounts (exclusions, deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. The provision for
doubtful accounts relates primarily to amounts due directly from patients. Medicare reimburses hospitals for 65%
of eligible Medicare bad debts. To be eligible for reimbursement, the amounts claimed must meet certain criteria,
including that the debt is related to unpaid deductible or coinsurance amounts and that the hospital first attempted
to collect the fees from the Medicare beneficiary.

The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon management’s assessment of historical
write-offs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions,
trends in federal and state
governmental and private employer health care coverage, the rate of growth in uninsured patient admissions and
other collection indicators. At December 31, 2017, our allowance for doubtful accounts represented 100% of the
$5.488 billion patient due accounts receivable balance. The sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured
discounts and charity care increased from $18.287 billion for 2015 to $20.455 billion for 2016 and to
$23.420 billion for 2017.

Any increase in the amount or deterioration in the collectability of uninsured accounts receivable will
adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. Our facilities may experience growth in bad debts,
uninsured discounts and charity care as a result of a number of factors, including conditions impacting the overall
economy and high unemployment. In 2017, Congress eliminated the financial penalty associated with the Health
Reform Law’s individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019, which may result in fewer individuals electing to
purchase health insurance. The presidential administration and a number of members of Congress continue to
make other efforts to repeal or significantly change the Health Reform Law. Even if the Health Reform Law
remains in effect, we will continue to experience collectability issues and provide uninsured discounts and
charity care for individuals residing in states that choose not to implement the Medicaid expansion, for
undocumented aliens who are not permitted to enroll in an Exchange or government health care programs and for
certain others who may not have insurance coverage. Further, some patients may choose to enroll in lower cost
Medicaid plans or other health insurance plans with lower reimbursement levels. We may also be adversely
affected by the growth in patient responsibility accounts as a result of increases in the adoption of health plan
structures that shift greater responsibility for care to individuals through greater exclusions and copayment and
deductible amounts.

Changes in government health care programs may adversely affect our revenues.

A significant portion of our patient volume is derived from government health care programs, principally
Medicare and Medicaid. Specifically, we derived 41.8% of our revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid
programs in 2017. Changes in government health care programs may reduce the reimbursement we receive and
could adversely affect our business and results of operations. The Health Reform Law has made significant
changes to Medicare and Medicaid, and future health reform efforts or efforts to repeal or significantly change
the Health Reform Law may impact these programs.

In recent years, legislative and regulatory changes have resulted in limitations on and, in some cases,
reductions in levels of payments to health care providers for certain services under the Medicare program.
Congress has established automatic spending reductions that extend through 2027. However, the percentage
reduction for Medicare may not be more than 2% for a fiscal year, with a uniform percentage reduction across all
Medicare programs. We are unable to predict what other deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by
Congress. These reductions are in addition to reductions mandated by the Health Reform Law, which provides
for material reductions in the growth of Medicare program spending, including reductions in Medicare market
basket updates and Medicare DSH funding. Further, from time to time, CMS revises the reimbursement systems
used to reimburse health care providers, including changes to the MS-DRG system and other payment systems,

34

which may result in reduced Medicare payments. For example, under a site neutrality policy, certain items and
services provided by off-campus provider-based departments that were formerly paid under the outpatient PPS
are now paid under the Physician Fee Schedule, subject to certain exceptions.

Because most states must operate with balanced budgets and because the Medicaid program is often a
state’s largest program, some states have enacted or may consider enacting legislation designed to reduce their
Medicaid expenditures. Further, many states have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce
coverage, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs and/or impose additional taxes on hospitals to
help finance or expand the states’ Medicaid systems. Periods of economic weakness may increase the budgetary
pressures on many states, and these budgetary pressures may result in decreased spending, or decreased spending
growth, for Medicaid programs and CHIP in many states. Some states that provide Medicaid supplemental
payments are reviewing these programs or have filed waiver requests with CMS to replace these programs, and
CMS has performed and continues to perform compliance reviews of some states’ programs, which could result
in Medicaid supplemental payments being reduced or eliminated. For example, in December 2017, CMS
announced that it will phase out funding for Designated State Health Programs under certain types of Medicaid
waivers. Further, legislation and administrative actions at the federal level may significantly alter the funding for,
or structure of, the Medicaid program. For example, from time to time, Congress considers proposals to
restructure the Medicaid program to involve block grants that would be administered by the states.

In some cases, private third-party payers rely on all or portions of Medicare payment systems to determine
payment rates. Changes to government health care programs that reduce payments under these programs may
negatively impact payments from private third-party payers.

Current or future health care reform and deficit reduction efforts, changes in laws or regulations regarding
government health care programs, other changes in the administration of government health care programs and
changes by private third-party payers in response to health care reform and other changes to government health
care programs could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.

Our results of operations may be adversely affected by health care reform efforts, particularly efforts to
repeal, replace or otherwise significantly change the Health Reform Law. We are unable to predict what, if
any, and when such changes will be made in the future.

The Health Reform Law represents a significant shift in the way health care services are delivered, covered,
and reimbursed. Although it reduced our Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, the Health Reform Law also
reduced the number of uninsured patients to whom we provide health care services, primarily through the
Exchanges and Medicaid expansion. However, many insurers have exited the Exchanges in the markets served
by the Company. To the extent some markets lack a sufficient number of health insurers participating in the
Exchanges, it could threaten the continued viability of the Exchanges in those markets.

In addition, the presidential administration and a number of members of Congress continue to attempt to
repeal, amend or replace the law, or make significant changes to its implementation. In 2017, Congress
eliminated the financial penalty associated with the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019. It is difficult
to predict the impact of this change, but it may result in fewer individuals electing to purchase health insurance.
Further, the President of the United States has also signed an executive order that directs agencies to minimize
“economic and regulatory burdens” of the Health Reform Law, which may result in additional changes in how
the law is implemented. CMS has indicated that it intends to increase flexibility in state Medicaid programs,
including by expanding the scope of waivers under which states may implement Medicaid expansion provisions,
impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions, or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal
standards. There is uncertainty regarding whether, when, and how the Health Reform Law may be further
changed. Changes by Congress or government agencies could eliminate or alter provisions beneficial to us, and it
is difficult to predict the impact of changes on other health care industry participants. Government efforts to
repeal or change the Health Reform Law may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash
flow, capital resources, and liquidity.

35

If our volume of patients with private health insurance coverage declines or we are unable to retain and
negotiate favorable contracts with private third-party payers, including managed care plans, our revenues
may be reduced.

Private third-party payers, including HMOs, PPOs and other managed care plans, typically reimburse health
care providers at a higher
rate than Medicare, Medicaid or other government health care programs.
Reimbursement rates are set forth by contract when our facilities are in-network, and payers utilize plan
structures to encourage or require the use of in-network providers. Revenues derived from private third-party
payers (domestic only) accounted for 56.9%, 56.5% and 55.2% of our revenues for 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. As a result, our ability to maintain or increase patient volumes covered by private third-party payers
and to maintain and obtain favorable contracts with private third-party payers significantly affects the revenues
and operating results of our facilities.

Private third-party payers, including managed care plans, continue to demand discounted fee structures, and
the trend toward consolidation among payers tends to increase their bargaining power over fee structures. Payers
may utilize plan structures such as narrow networks and tiered networks that limit beneficiary provider choices or
impose significantly higher cost sharing obligations when care is obtained from providers in a disfavored tier.
Other health care providers may impact our ability to enter into managed care contracts or negotiate increases in
our reimbursement and other favorable terms and conditions. For example, some of our competitors may
negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of managed care plans
to contract with us. In addition to increasing negotiating leverage of private third-party payers, alignment efforts
between third-party payers and health care providers may also result in other competitive advantages, such as
greater access to performance and pricing data. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to retain
and renew our third-party payer contracts and enter into new contracts on terms favorable to us. Cost-reduction
strategies by large employer groups and their affiliates may also limit our ability to negotiate favorable terms in
our contracts and otherwise intensify competitive pressure. It is not clear what impact, if any, future health
reform efforts or the repeal of, or changes to, the Health Reform Law will have on our ability to negotiate
reimbursement increases and participate in third-party payer networks on favorable terms. If we are unable to
retain and negotiate favorable contracts with third-party payers or experience reductions in payment increases or
amounts received from third-party payers, our revenues may be reduced.

Our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians.

The success of our hospitals depends in part on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical
staffs of our hospitals, the admitting and utilization practices of those physicians, maintaining good relations with
those physicians and controlling costs related to the employment of physicians. Although we employ some
physicians, physicians are often not employees of the hospitals at which they practice, and, in many of the
markets we serve, most physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals. Such
physicians may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time. We may face increased challenges in
this area as the physician population reaches retirement age, especially if there is a shortage of physicians willing
and able to provide comparable services. If we are unable to provide adequate support personnel or
technologically advanced equipment and hospital facilities that meet the needs of those physicians and their
patients, they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities, admissions may decrease and our
operating performance may decline.

Our hospitals face competition for staffing, which may increase labor costs and reduce profitability.

Our operations are dependent on the efforts, abilities and experience of our management and medical
support personnel, such as nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians, as well as our physicians. We compete with
other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified management and support personnel responsible
for the daily operations of each of our hospitals,
including nurses and other nonphysician health care
professionals. In some markets, the availability of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a

36

significant operating issue to health care providers. We may be required to continue to enhance wages and
benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or
contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs could increase. We also depend on the available labor pool of
semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. Certain proposed changes in
federal labor laws and the NLRB’s modification of its election procedures could increase the likelihood of
employee unionization attempts. To the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, it is possible
our labor costs could increase materially. When negotiating collective bargaining agreements with unions,
whether such agreements are renewals or first contracts, there is the possibility that strikes could occur during the
negotiation process, and our continued operation during any strikes could increase our labor costs. In addition,
the states in which we operate could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse
staffing ratios already in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs and
have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit admissions in order to meet the required ratios. If
our labor costs increase, we may not be able to raise rates to offset these increased costs. Because a significant
percentage of our revenues consists of fixed, prospective payments, our ability to pass along increased labor costs
is constrained. Our failure to recruit and retain qualified management, nurses and other medical support
personnel, or to control labor costs, could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations.

We may be unable to attract, hire, and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce, including key
management.

The talents and efforts of our employees, particularly our key management, are vital to our success. Our
management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. In addition, institutional
knowledge may be lost in any potential managerial transition. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other
highly qualified employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of
the labor market. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified and diverse employee
talent, or failure to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team, could disrupt
our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success.

If we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations, we could suffer penalties or be required
to make significant changes to our operations.

The health care industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the

federal, state and local government levels relating to, among other things:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

billing and coding for services and properly handling overpayments;

appropriateness and classification of level of care provided, including proper classification of inpatient
admissions, observation services and outpatient care;

relationships with physicians and other referral sources and referral recipients;

necessity and adequacy of medical care;

quality of medical equipment and services;

qualifications of medical and support personnel;

confidentiality, maintenance, data breach, identity theft and security issues associated with health-
related and personal information and medical records;

screening, stabilization and transfer of individuals who have emergency medical conditions;

licensure, certification and enrollment with government programs;

hospital rate or budget review;

debt collection;

37

•

•

•

•

•

•

communications with patients and consumers;

preparing and filing of cost reports;

operating policies and procedures;

activities regarding competitors;

addition of facilities and services; and

environmental protection.

Among these laws are the federal Anti-kickback Statute, the federal Stark Law, the FCA and similar state
laws. We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians and others who either refer or influence the
referral of patients to our hospitals, other health care facilities and employed physicians or who are the recipients
of referrals, and these laws govern those relationships. The OIG has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline
practices deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback Statute. While we endeavor to comply
with the applicable safe harbors, certain of our current arrangements, including joint ventures and financial
relationships with physicians and other referral sources and persons and entities to which we refer patients, do
not qualify for safe harbor protection. Failure to qualify for a safe harbor does not mean the arrangement
necessarily violates the Anti-kickback Statute but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny. However, we
cannot offer assurance that practices outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the Anti-kickback
Statute. Allegations of violations of the Anti-kickback Statute may be brought under the federal Civil Monetary
Penalty Law, which requires a lower burden of proof than other fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-
kickback Statute.

Our financial relationships with referring physicians and their immediate family members must comply with
the Stark Law by meeting an exception. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet an exception to the
Stark Law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex, and we cannot provide
assurance that every relationship complies fully with the Stark Law. Unlike the Anti-kickback Statute, failure to
meet an exception under the Stark Law results in a violation of the Stark Law, even if such violation is technical
in nature.

Additionally, if we violate the Anti-kickback Statute or Stark Law, or if we improperly bill for our services,
we may be found to violate the FCA, either under a suit brought by the government or by a private person under
a qui tam, or “whistleblower,” suit. See Item 1, “Business — Regulation and Other Factors.”

We also operate health care facilities in the United Kingdom and have operations and commercial
relationships with companies in other foreign jurisdictions and, as a result, are subject to certain U.S. and foreign
laws applicable to businesses generally, including anti-corruption laws. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
regulates U.S. companies in their dealings with foreign officials, prohibiting bribes and similar practices, and
requires that they maintain records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and appropriate internal
accounting controls. In addition, the United Kingdom Bribery Act has wide jurisdiction over certain activities
that affect the United Kingdom.

A variety of state, national, foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use,
retention, protection, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data. Many foreign data
privacy regulations (including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which becomes effective in the
European Union on May 25, 2018) are more stringent than those in the United States. These laws and regulations
are rapidly evolving and changing, and could have an adverse effect on our operations. Companies’ obligations
and requirements under these laws and regulations are subject to uncertainty in how they may be interpreted by
government authorities and regulators. The costs of compliance with, and the other burdens imposed by, these
and other laws or regulatory actions may increase our operational costs, result in interruptions or delays in the
availability of systems and/or result in a patient volume decline. In the case of non-compliance with a material
provision of the GDPR (such as non-adherence to the core principles of processing personal data), regulators

38

have the authority to levy a fine in an amount that is up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of global annual
turnover in the prior year. If it is determined that non-compliance is related to a non-material provision (such as
failure to comply with technical measures), regulators may impose a fine in an amount that is up to the greater of
€10 million or 2% of the global annual turnover from the prior year. These administrative fines are discretionary
and based, in each case, on a multi-factored approach. We may also face audits or investigations by one or more
domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations. An adverse outcome
under any such investigation or audit could result in liability, result in adverse publicity, and adversely affect our
business.

We engage in consumer debt collection for HCA-affiliated hospitals and certain non-affiliated hospitals.
The federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and Telephone Consumer Protection Act restrict the methods that
companies may use to contact and seek payment from consumer debtors regarding past due accounts. Many
states impose additional requirements on debt collection practices, and some of those requirements may be more
stringent than the federal requirements.

If we fail to comply with these or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to liabilities,
including civil penalties, the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities, exclusion of one or more
facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs and
criminal penalties.

We do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and
regulations. In the future, different interpretations or enforcement of, or amendment to, these or other laws and
regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require
us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating
expenses. A determination that we have violated these or other laws, or the public announcement that we are
being investigated for possible violations of these or other laws, could have a material, adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects, and our business reputation could suffer
significantly. In addition, other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level may be adopted that
adversely affect our business.

We have been and could become the subject of government investigations, claims and litigation.

Health care companies are subject to numerous investigations by various government agencies. Further,
under the FCA, private parties have the right to bring qui tam, or “whistleblower,” suits against companies that
submit false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments from, the government. Some states have
adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. Certain of our individual facilities have received,
and other facilities may receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject to investigation by, federal and
state agencies. Depending on whether the underlying conduct in these or future inquiries or investigations could
be considered systemic, their resolution could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position, results of
operations and liquidity.

Government agencies and their agents, such as the MACs, fiscal intermediaries and carriers, as well as the
OIG, CMS and state Medicaid programs, conduct audits of our health care operations. Private third-party payers
may conduct similar post-payment audits, and we also perform internal audits and monitoring. Depending on the
nature of the conduct found in such audits and whether the underlying conduct could be considered systemic, the
resolution of these audits could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and
liquidity.

CMS contracts with RACs on a contingency fee basis to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct
improper payments in the fee-for-service Medicare program. The Health Reform Law expanded the RAC
program’s scope to include managed Medicare plans and Medicaid claims. RAC denials are appealable;
however, there are currently significant delays in the assignment of new Medicare appeals to Administrative Law

39

Judges, which negatively impacts our ability to appeal RAC payment denials. In addition, CMS employs MICs to
perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify overpayments, and state Medicaid agencies and
other contractors have increased their review activities.

Should we be found out of compliance with any of these laws, regulations or programs, depending on the
nature of the findings, our business, our financial position and our results of operations could be negatively
impacted.

Changes to physician utilization practices and treatment methodologies, third-party payer controls designed to
reduce inpatient services or surgical procedures and other factors outside our control that impact demand for
medical services may reduce our revenues.

Controls imposed by Medicare, managed Medicare, Medicaid, managed Medicaid and private third-party
payers designed to reduce admissions, intensity of services, surgical volumes and lengths of stay, in some
instances referred to as “utilization review,” have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities.
Utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by third-party payers.
The Medicare program also issues national or local coverage determinations that restrict the circumstances under
which Medicare pays for certain services. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates
continue to be negatively affected by third-party payers preadmission authorization requirements, coverage
restrictions, utilization review and by pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery
services for less acutely ill patients. Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue.
Additionally, trends in physician treatment protocols and managed care health plan design, such as health plans
that shift increased costs and accountability for care to patients, could reduce our surgical volumes and
admissions in favor of lower intensity and lower cost treatment methodologies.

Volume, admission and case-mix trends may be impacted by other factors beyond our control, such as
changes in volume of certain high acuity services, variations in the prevalence and severity of outbreaks of
influenza and other illnesses and medical conditions, seasonal and severe weather conditions, changes in
treatment regimens and medical technology and other advances. These factors may reduce the demand for
services we offer and decrease the reimbursement that we receive. Significant limits on the scope of services
reimbursed, cost controls, changes to physician utilization practices, treatment methodologies, reimbursement
rates and fees and other factors beyond our control could have a material, adverse effect on our business,
financial position and results of operations.

Our overall business results may suffer during periods of general economic weakness.

Budget deficits at federal, state and local government entities have had a negative impact on spending, and
may continue to negatively impact spending, for health and human service programs, including Medicare,
Medicaid and similar programs, which represent significant third-party payer sources for our hospitals. We
anticipate that the federal deficit, the growing magnitude of Medicare expenditures and the aging of the United
States population will continue to place pressure on government health care programs. Other risks we face during
periods of economic weakness and high unemployment include potential declines in the population covered
under managed care agreements, increased patient decisions to postpone or cancel elective and nonemergency
health care procedures (including delaying surgical procedures), potential
increases in the uninsured and
underinsured populations, increased adoption of health plan structures that shift financial responsibility to
patients and further difficulties in collecting patient receivables for copayment and deductible receivables.

The industry trend toward value-based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues.

There is a trend in the health care industry toward value-based purchasing of health care services. These
value-based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events
tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities. Governmental programs including Medicare
currently require hospitals to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates. In addition,

40

Medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events (also called “never events”).
The Health Reform Law also prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse
providers for medical assistance provided to treat HACs. The 25% of hospitals with the worst risk-adjusted HAC
rates in the designated performance period receive a 1% reduction in their inpatient PPS Medicare payments.

Hospitals with excess readmission rates for conditions designated by HHS will receive a reduction in their
inpatient PPS operating Medicare payments for all Medicare inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to
the conditions subject to the excess readmission standard. The reduction in payments to hospitals with excess
readmissions can be up to 3% of a hospital’s base payments.

HHS has implemented a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services that reduces
inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by 2% in federal fiscal year 2017 and for subsequent years. HHS
pools the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed
certain quality performance standards established by HHS. HHS estimates that $1.9 billion in value-based
incentive payments will be available to hospitals in federal fiscal year 2018 based on achievement (relative to
other hospitals) and improvement (relative to the hospital’s own past performance). Hospitals that meet or exceed
the quality performance standards will receive greater reimbursement under the value-based purchasing program
than they would have otherwise.

CMS has developed several alternative payment models that are intended to reduce costs and improve
quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries. Examples of alternative payment models include bundled payment
models in which, depending on whether overall CMS spending per episode exceeds or falls below a target
specified by CMS and whether quality standards are met, hospitals may receive supplemental Medicare
payments or owe repayments to CMS. Generally, participation in bundled payment programs is voluntary, but
CMS requires hospitals in selected markets to participate in a bundled payment initiative for orthopedic services.
Participation in mandatory or voluntary demonstration projects, particularly demonstrations with the potential to
affect payment, may negatively impact our results of operations.

Many large private third-party payers currently require hospitals to report quality data, and several private
third-party payers do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events. Further, we have
implemented a policy pursuant to which we do not bill patients or third-party payers for fees or expenses incurred
due to certain preventable adverse events.

We expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient
outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts.
CMS has announced aggressive goals for adopting alternative payment models, which may include additional
bundled payment programs, and private third-party payers may also transition away from fee-for-service
payment models. We are unable at this time to predict our future payments or whether we will be subject to
payment reductions under these programs or how this trend will affect our results of operations, but it could
negatively impact our revenues.

Our operations could be impaired by a failure of our information systems.

The performance of our information systems is critical to our business operations. In addition to our shared
services initiatives, our information systems are essential to a number of critical areas of our operations,
including:

•

•

•

•

accounting and financial reporting;

billing and collecting accounts;

coding and compliance;

clinical systems;

• medical records and document storage;

41

inventory management;
negotiating, pricing and administering managed care contracts and supply contracts; and

•
•
• monitoring quality of care and collecting data on quality measures necessary for full Medicare payment

updates.

Information systems may be vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications
or network failures, human acts and natural disasters. We have taken precautionary measures to prevent
unanticipated problems that could affect our information systems. Nevertheless, we may experience system
failures. The occurrence of any system failure could result in interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of data
and cessations or interruptions in the availability of systems, all of which could have a material, adverse effect on
our financial position and results of operations and harm our business reputation.

A cybersecurity incident could result in the compromise of a facility, confidential data or critical data systems
and give rise to potential harm to patients, remediation and other expenses, expose us to liability under
HIPAA, consumer protection laws, or other common law theories, subject us to litigation and foreign, federal
and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business.

We, independently and through third-party vendors, collect and store on our networks sensitive information,
including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our
patients and employees. In addition, we have made significant investments in technology to adopt and utilize
EHR and to become meaningful users of health information technology. The secure maintenance of this
information and technology is critical to our business operations. We have implemented multiple layers of
security measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of this data and the systems and devices
that store and transmit such data. We utilize current security technologies, and our defenses are monitored and
routinely tested internally and by external parties. Despite these efforts, threats from malicious persons and
groups, new vulnerabilities and advanced new attacks against information systems create risk of cybersecurity
incidents. We are regularly the target of attempted cybersecurity and other threats that could have a security
impact. There can be no assurance that we or our third-party vendors will not be subject to cybersecurity
incidents that bypass our security measures, impact the integrity, availability or privacy of personal health
information or other data subject to privacy laws or disrupt our information systems, devices or business,
including our ability to provide various health care services. As a result, cybersecurity, physical security and the
continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our
facilities, information systems and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. As
cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to
modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The
occurrence of any of these events could result in (i) harm to patients; (ii) business interruptions and delays;
(iii) the loss, misappropriation, corruption or unauthorized access of data; (iv) litigation and potential liability
under privacy, security and consumer protection laws or other applicable laws; (v) reputational damage and
(vi) foreign, federal and state governmental inquiries, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our
financial position and results of operations and harm our business reputation.

If we fail to continue to demonstrate meaningful use of certified electronic health record systems, our
operations could be adversely affected.

Eligible hospitals and eligible professionals that fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR
technology in an applicable prior reporting period are subject to reduced payments from Medicare. Failure to
continue to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology could have a material, adverse effect on our
financial position and results of operations.

The emergence and effects related to a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease could
adversely affect our operations.

If a pandemic, epidemic, outbreak of an infectious disease or other public health crisis were to occur in an
area in which we operate, our operations could be adversely affected. Such a crisis could diminish the public trust

42

in health care facilities, especially hospitals that fail to accurately or timely diagnose, or are treating (or have
treated) patients affected by infectious diseases. If any of our facilities were involved, or perceived as being
involved, in treating patients from such an infectious disease, patients might cancel elective procedures or fail to
seek needed care at our facilities. Further, a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak might adversely affect our
operations by causing a temporary shutdown or diversion of patients, by disrupting or delaying production and
delivery of materials and products in the supply chain or by causing staffing shortages in our facilities. We have
disaster plans in place and operate pursuant to infectious disease protocols, but the potential emergence of a
pandemic, epidemic or outbreak is difficult to predict and could adversely affect our operations.

State efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to
operate and expand our operations.

Some states, particularly in the eastern part of the country, require health care providers to obtain prior
approval, often known as a CON, for the purchase, construction or expansion of health care facilities, to make
certain capital expenditures or to make changes in services or bed capacity. In giving approval, these states
consider the need for additional or expanded health care facilities or services. We currently operate health care
facilities in a number of states with CON laws or that require other types of approvals for the establishment or
expansion of certain facility types or services. The failure to obtain any required CON or other required approval
could impair our ability to operate or expand operations. Any such failure could, in turn, adversely affect our
ability to attract patients and physicians to our facilities and grow our revenues, which would have an adverse
effect on our results of operations.

We may encounter difficulty acquiring hospitals and other health care businesses, encounter challenges
integrating the operations of acquired hospitals and other health care businesses and become liable for
unknown or contingent liabilities as a result of acquisitions.

A component of our business strategy is acquiring hospitals and other health care businesses. We may
encounter difficulty acquiring new facilities or other businesses as a result of competition from other purchasers
that may be willing to pay purchase prices that are higher than we believe are reasonable. Some states require
CONs in order to acquire a hospital or other facility or to expand facilities or services. In addition, the acquisition
of health care facilities often involves licensure approvals or reviews and complex change of ownership
processes for Medicare and other payers. Further, many states have laws that restrict the conversion or sale of
not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities. These laws may require prior approval from the state attorney
general, advance notification of the attorney general or other regulators and community involvement. Attorneys
general in states without specific requirements may exercise broad discretionary authority over transactions
involving the sale of not-for-profits under their general obligations to protect the use of charitable assets. These
conversion legislative and administrative efforts often focus on the appropriate valuation of the assets divested
and the use of the proceeds of the sale by the non-profit seller and may include consideration of commitments for
capital improvements and charity care by the purchaser. Also, the increasingly challenging regulatory and
enforcement environment may negatively impact our ability to acquire health care businesses if they are found to
have material unresolved compliance issues, such as repayment obligations. Resolving compliance issues as well
as completion of oversight, review or approval processes could seriously delay or even prevent our ability to
acquire hospitals or other businesses and increase our acquisition costs.

We may be unable to timely and effectively integrate hospitals and other businesses that we acquire with
our ongoing operations, or we may experience delays implementing operating procedures and systems. Hospitals
and other health care businesses that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including liabilities
for failure to comply with health care and other laws and regulations, medical and general professional liabilities,
workers’ compensation liabilities and tax liabilities. Although we typically exclude significant liabilities from
our acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers for these matters, we could experience
difficulty enforcing those obligations, experience liability in excess of any indemnification obtained or otherwise
incur material liabilities for the pre-acquisition conduct of acquired businesses. Such liabilities and related legal
or other costs could harm our business and results of operations.

Our facilities are heavily concentrated in Florida and Texas, which makes us sensitive to regulatory,
economic, environmental and competitive conditions and changes in those states.

We operated 179 hospitals at December 31, 2017, and 91 of those hospitals are located in Florida and Texas.
Our Florida and Texas facilities’ combined revenues represented approximately 48% of our consolidated
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. This concentration makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory,
economic, environmental and competitive conditions and changes in those states. Any material change in the
current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in those states could
have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results.

In addition, our hospitals in Florida, Texas and other coastal states are located in hurricane-prone areas. In
the past, hurricanes have had a disruptive effect on the operations of our hospitals in Florida, Texas and other
coastal states and the patient populations in those states. Our business activities could be harmed by a particularly
active hurricane season or even a single storm, and the property insurance we obtain may not be adequate to
cover losses from future hurricanes or other natural disasters.

We may be subject to liabilities from claims by taxing authorities.

We are subject to examination by federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. Management believes HCA
Healthcare, Inc., its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in
accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the IRS, state and foreign taxing authorities
and final resolution of any disputes will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or
financial position. However, if payments due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our recorded estimates,
such resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.

We may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities.

We are subject to litigation relating to our business practices, including claims and legal actions by patients
and others in the ordinary course of business alleging malpractice, product liability or other legal theories. Many
of these actions seek large sums of money as damages and involve significant defense costs. We insure a portion
of our professional liability risks through a 100% owned subsidiary. Management believes our reserves for self-
insured retentions and insurance coverage are sufficient to cover insured claims arising out of the operation of
our facilities. Our 100% owned liability insurance subsidiary has entered into certain reinsurance contracts;
however, the subsidiary remains liable to the extent that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the
reinsurance contracts. If payments for claims exceed actuarially determined estimates, are not covered by
insurance, or reinsurers, if any, fail to meet their obligations, our results of operations and financial position
could be adversely affected.

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in the market values of securities and interest rate changes.

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. The investment securities of
our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries were $472 million at December 31, 2017. These investments are carried
at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive
income. At December 31, 2017, we had a net unrealized gain of $10 million on the insurance subsidiaries’
investment securities.

We are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. Investment securities of our 100% owned
insurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. Should the 100% owned
insurance subsidiaries require significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims
and other expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be
forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market
environment. We may be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairments on long-term investments in
future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market valuations of the securities
deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue specific factors.

We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, and we periodically enter into
interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. Our interest rate swap agreements
involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on common

44

notional principal amounts and maturity dates. The notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances
used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities.

There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends.

In January 2018, the Board of Directors initiated a cash dividend program under which the Company
expects to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend. The Board declared the first quarterly cash dividend of $0.35
per share of common stock to be paid to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 1, 2018,
with a payment date of March 30, 2018. The declaration, amount and timing of such dividends are subject to
capital availability and determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our
stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and our agreements applicable to the declaration and
payment of cash dividends. Our ability to pay dividends will depend upon, among other factors, our cash flows
from operations, our available capital and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions,
including acquisitions, debt service requirements, share repurchases and investing in our existing markets as well
as our results of operations, financial condition and other factors beyond our control that our Board of Directors
may deem relevant. A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our
stock price.

Uncertainties in the interpretation and application of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could materially affect
our tax obligations and effective tax rate.

The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act
significantly revises U.S. corporate income taxes, including lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to
21% beginning in 2018 and imposing a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed foreign earnings. Due
to the complexity and uncertainty regarding numerous provisions of the Tax Act, we have not completed our
accounting for its effects. However, we have made reasonable estimates and recorded provisional amounts in our
financial statements as of December 31, 2017.

As we complete our analysis of the Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional
guidance issued by federal and state taxing authorities or other standard-setting bodies, we may make
adjustments to the provisional amounts and record additional amounts for those federal, state, and foreign tax
assets and liabilities for which we were unable to make reasonable estimates as of December 31, 2017. Any
adjustments or additional amounts recorded may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective
tax rate in the periods in which they are made.

Certain of our investors may continue to have influence over us.

On November 17, 2006, HCA Inc. was acquired by a private investor group, including affiliates of HCA
founder, Dr. Thomas F. Frist, Jr. and certain other investors. Through their investment in Hercules Holding II and
other holdings, certain of the Frist-affiliated investors continue to hold a significant interest in our outstanding
common stock (approximately 20% as of January 31, 2018). In addition, pursuant to a shareholders agreement
we entered into with Hercules Holding II and the Frist-affiliated investors, certain representatives of these
investors have the continued right to nominate certain of the members of our Board of Directors. As a result,
certain of these investors potentially have the ability to influence our decisions to enter into corporate
transactions (and the terms thereof) and prevent changes in the composition of our Board of Directors and any
transaction that requires stockholder approval.

In addition to the hospitals listed in the above table, we directly or indirectly operate 120 freestanding
surgery centers. We also operate medical office buildings in conjunction with some of our hospitals. These office
buildings are primarily occupied by physicians who practice at our hospitals. Fourteen of our general, acute care
hospitals and two of our other properties have been mortgaged to support our obligations under our senior
secured cash flow credit facility and first lien secured notes.

We maintain our headquarters in approximately 2,300,000 square feet of space in the Nashville, Tennessee
area. In addition to the headquarters in Nashville, we maintain regional service centers related to our shared
services initiatives. These service centers are located in markets in which we operate hospitals.

We believe our headquarters, hospitals and other facilities are suitable for their respective uses and are, in
general, adequate for our present needs. Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local statutes and
ordinances regulating their operation. Management does not believe that compliance with such statutes and
ordinances will materially affect our financial position or results of operations.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

We operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry. As a result, various lawsuits, claims and legal and
regulatory proceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or asserted against us. We are also subject
to claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims for personal injuries or wrongful
restriction of, or interference with, physicians’ staff privileges. In certain of these actions the claimants may seek

46

punitive damages against us which may not be covered by insurance. We are also subject to claims by various
taxing authorities for additional taxes and related interest and penalties. The resolution of any such lawsuits,
claims or legal and regulatory proceedings could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations,
financial position or liquidity.

Government Investigations, Claims and Litigation

Health care companies are subject to numerous investigations by various governmental agencies. Under the
federal False Claims Act (“FCA”), private parties have the right to bring qui tam, or “whistleblower,” suits
against companies that submit false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments from, the
government. Some states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. Certain of our
individual facilities have received, and from time to time, other facilities may receive, government inquiries
from, and may be subject to investigation by, federal and state agencies. Depending on whether the underlying
conduct in these or future inquiries or investigations could be considered systemic, their resolution could have a
material, adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) (symbol “HCA”). There were no
dividends or distributions declared during 2017 or 2016. On January 30, 2018, our Board of Directors initiated
and declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share on our common stock payable on March 30, 2018 to
stockholders of record on March 1, 2018. Future declarations of quarterly dividends and the establishment of
future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. Our ability to
declare future dividends may also from time to time be limited by the terms of our debt agreements.

(c) Represents the total number of patients admitted to our hospitals and is used by management and certain

investors as a general measure of inpatient volume.

(d) Equivalent admissions are used by management and certain investors as a general measure of combined
inpatient and outpatient volume. Equivalent admissions are computed by multiplying admissions (inpatient
volume) by the sum of gross inpatient revenue and gross outpatient revenue and then dividing the resulting
amount by gross inpatient revenue. The equivalent admissions computation “equates” outpatient revenue to
the volume measure (admissions) used to measure inpatient volume, resulting in a general measure of
combined inpatient and outpatient volume.

2017 Operations Summary

Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. totaled $2.216 billion, or $5.95 per diluted share, for 2017,
compared to $2.890 billion, or $7.30 per diluted share, for 2016. The 2017 results include additional expenses
and losses of revenues estimated at approximately $140 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, associated with the
impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma on our Texas, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina facilities and an
increase in provision for income taxes of $301 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, related to the remeasurement
of our deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The amount
associated with the hurricanes is prior to any insurance recoveries which we may receive. The 2017 results also
include net gains on sales of facilities of $8 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, and losses on retirement of debt
of $39 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. The 2016 results include net gains on sales of facilities of $23 million,
or $0.05 per diluted share, losses on retirement of debt of $4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, and legal claim
benefits of $246 million, or $0.39 per diluted share. Our provisions for income taxes for 2017 and 2016 included
tax benefits of $82 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, and $162 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, respectively,
related to employee equity award settlements. Our provision for income taxes for 2016 also included tax benefits
of $51 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, primarily related to the resolution of federal income tax issues for our
2011 and 2012 tax years. All “per diluted share” disclosures are based upon amounts net of the applicable income
taxes. Shares used for diluted earnings per share were 372.221 million shares and 395.851 million shares for the
years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During 2017 and 2016, we repurchased 25.092 million
and 36.325 million shares, respectively, of our common stock.

Revenues increased to $43.614 billion for 2017 from $41.490 billion for 2016. Revenues increased 5.1%
and 3.8%, respectively, on a consolidated basis and on a same facility basis for 2017, compared to 2016. The
consolidated revenues increase can be attributed to the combined impact of a 2.1% increase in revenue per
equivalent admission and a 3.0% increase in equivalent admissions. The same facility revenues increase resulted
from a 2.2% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.5% increase in same facility
equivalent admissions.

During 2017, consolidated admissions increased 2.4% and same facility admissions increased 1.1%,
compared to 2016. Inpatient surgical volumes increased 1.7% on a consolidated basis and increased 0.3% on a
same facility basis during 2017, compared to 2016. Outpatient surgical volumes increased 0.3% on a
consolidated basis and declined 1.3% on a same facility basis during 2017, compared to 2016. Emergency room
visits increased 2.9% on a consolidated basis and increased 1.4% on a same facility basis during 2017, compared
to 2016.

For 2017, the provision for doubtful accounts increased $782 million, compared to 2016. The self-pay
revenue deductions for charity care and uninsured discounts increased $710 million and $1.473 billion,
respectively, for 2017, compared to 2016. The sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts

2017 Operations Summary (continued)

and charity care, as a percentage of the sum of revenues, the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts
and charity care, was 34.9% for 2017, compared to 33.0% for 2016. Same facility uninsured admissions
increased 5.9% and same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 2.4% for 2017, compared to 2016.
Same facility uninsured admissions increased 3.8% and same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased
4.5% for 2016, compared to 2015.

Interest expense totaled $1.690 billion for 2017, compared to $1.707 billion for 2016. The $17 million

decline in interest expense for 2017 was due to the decline in the average interest rate.

Cash flows from operating activities declined $227 million, from $5.653 billion for 2016 to $5.426 billion
for 2017. The decline in cash flows from operating activities was primarily related to the net impact of the
decline of net income of $689 million, offset by positive changes related to depreciation and amortization of
$165 million and income taxes of $310 million.

Business Strategy

We are committed to providing the communities we serve with high quality, cost-effective health care while
growing our business, increasing our profitability and creating long-term value for our stockholders. To achieve
these objectives, we align our efforts around the following growth agenda:

Grow Our Presence in Existing Markets. We believe we are well positioned in a number of large and
growing markets that will allow us the opportunity to generate long-term, attractive growth through the
expansion of our presence in these markets. We plan to continue recruiting and strategically collaborating with
the physician community and adding attractive service lines such as cardiology, emergency services, oncology
and women’s services. Additional components of our growth strategy include expanding our footprint through
developing various outpatient access points,
including surgery centers, urgent care clinics, freestanding
emergency care facilities and walk-in clinics.

Achieve Industry-Leading Performance in Clinical and Satisfaction Measures. Achieving high levels of
patient safety, patient satisfaction and clinical quality are central goals of our business model. To achieve these
goals, we have implemented a number of initiatives including infection reduction initiatives, hospitalist
programs, advanced health information technology and evidence-based medicine programs. We routinely analyze
operational practices from our best-performing hospitals to identify ways to implement organization-wide
performance improvements and reduce clinical variation. We believe these initiatives will continue to improve
patient care, help us achieve cost efficiencies, grow our revenues and favorably position us in an environment
where our constituents are increasingly focused on quality, efficacy and efficiency.

Recruit and Employ Physicians to Meet the Needs for High Quality Health Services. We depend on the
quality and dedication of the health care providers and other team members who serve at our facilities. We
believe a critical component of our growth strategy is our ability to successfully recruit and strategically
collaborate with physicians and other professionals to provide high quality care. We attract and retain physicians
by providing high quality, convenient facilities with advanced technology, by expanding our specialty services
and by building our outpatient operations. We believe our continued investment in the employment, recruitment
and retention of physicians will improve the quality of care at our facilities.

54

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Business Strategy (continued)

Continue to Leverage Our Scale and Market Positions to Enhance Profitability. We believe there is
significant opportunity to continue to grow the profitability of our company by fully leveraging the scale and
scope of our franchise. We are currently investing in initiatives such as additional care navigators, clinical data
exchange and centralized patient transfer operations, which will enable us to improve coordination of care and
patient retention across our markets. We believe our centrally managed business processes and ability to leverage
cost-saving practices across our extensive network will enable us to continue to manage costs effectively. We
continue to invest in our Parallon subsidiary group to leverage key components of our support infrastructure,
including revenue cycle management, health care group purchasing, supply chain management and staffing
functions.

Pursue a Disciplined Development Strategy. We continue to believe there are significant growth
opportunities in our markets. We will continue to provide financial and operational resources to analyze and
develop our in-market opportunities. To complement our in-market growth agenda, we intend to focus on
selectively developing and acquiring new hospitals, outpatient facilities and other health care service providers.
We believe the challenges faced by the hospital industry may continue to spur consolidation and we believe our
size, scale, national presence and access to capital will position us well to participate in any such consolidation.
We have a strong record of successfully acquiring and integrating hospitals and entering into joint ventures and
intend to continue leveraging this experience.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various
other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing
basis and make changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information
becomes known. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates

used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenues

Revenues are recorded during the period the health care services are provided, based upon the estimated
amounts due from payers. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health plans are based upon
the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Laws and regulations governing the Medicare
and Medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation. The estimated reimbursement amounts are
made on a payer-specific basis and are recorded based on the best information available regarding management’s
interpretation of the applicable laws, regulations and contract terms. Management continually reviews the
contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent
changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals. We have
invested significant resources to refine and improve our billing systems and the information system data used to
make contractual allowance estimates. We have developed standardized calculation processes and related
employee training programs to improve the utility of our patient accounting systems.

The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (“EMTALA”) requires any hospital participating in the
Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the

55

HCA HEALTHCARE, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)

Revenues (continued)

hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition,
to either stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the
condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an
individual’s ability to pay for treatment. Federal and state laws and regulations, including but not limited to
EMTALA, require, and our commitment to providing quality patient care encourages, the provision of services to
patients who are financially unable to pay for the health care services they receive.

We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who meet our guidelines to qualify for charity
care; therefore, these amounts are not reported in revenues. We provide discounts from our gross charges to
uninsured amounts related to patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. After the discounts are
applied, we are still unable to collect a significant portion of uninsured patients’ accounts, and we record
significant provisions for doubtful accounts (based upon our historical collection experience) related to uninsured
patients in the period the services are provided.

Due to the complexities involved in the classification and documentation of health care services authorized
and provided, the estimation of revenues earned and the related reimbursement are often subject to interpretations
that could result in payments that are different from our estimates. Adjustments to estimated Medicare and
Medicaid reimbursement amounts and disproportionate-share funds, which resulted in net increases to revenues,
related primarily to cost reports filed during the respective year were $41 million, $31 million and $48 million in
2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The adjustments to estimated reimbursement amounts, which resulted in net
increases to revenues, related primarily to cost reports filed during previous years were $56 million, $90 million
and $85 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We expect adjustments during the next 12 months related
to Medicare and Medicaid cost report filings and settlements will result in increases to revenues generally similar
to the amounts recorded during these years.

Provision for Doubtful Accounts and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The collection of outstanding receivables from Medicare, Medicaid, managed care payers, other third-party
payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. The primary
collection risks relate to uninsured patient accounts, including patient accounts for which the primary insurance
carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles
and copayments) remain outstanding. The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful
accounts relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is
recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the aging of those accounts. Accounts are written off when all
reasonable internal and external collection efforts have been performed. Our collection policies include a review
of all accounts against certain standard collection criteria, upon completion of our primary internal collection
efforts. Accounts determined to possess positive collectibility attributes are forwarded to a secondary internal or
external collection agency and the other accounts are written off. The accounts that are not collected by the
secondary collection agency are written off when secondary collection efforts are completed (usually within 12
months). Writeoffs are based upon specific identification and the writeoff process requires a writeoff adjustment
entry to the patient accounting system. We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients that meet our
guidelines to qualify as charity care.

The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon management’s assessment of historical
writeoffs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state, and private

56

HCA HEALTHCARE, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)

Provision for Doubtful Accounts and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (continued)

employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. Management relies on the results of detailed
reviews of historical writeoffs and recoveries at facilities that represent a majority of our revenues and accounts
receivable (the “hindsight analysis”) as a primary source of information in estimating the collectibility of our
accounts receivable. We perform the hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months accounts
receivable collection and writeoff data. We believe our quarterly updates to the estimated allowance for doubtful
accounts at each of our hospital facilities provide reasonable valuations of our accounts receivable. These
routine, quarterly changes in estimates have not resulted in material adjustments to our allowance for doubtful
accounts, provision for doubtful accounts or period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations. At
December 31, 2017 and 2016, the allowance for doubtful accounts represented 100% of the $5.488 billion and
98% of the $5.116 billion, respectively, patient due accounts receivable balance. The patient due accounts
receivable balance represents the estimated uninsured portion of our accounts receivable. The estimated
uninsured portion of Medicaid pending and uninsured discount pending accounts is included in our patient due
accounts receivable balance.

To quantify the total impact of and trends related to uninsured accounts, we believe it is beneficial to view
the revenue deductions related to uninsured accounts (charity care and uninsured discounts) and provision for
doubtful accounts in combination, rather than each separately. A summary of these amounts for the years ended
December 31, follows (dollars in millions):

Professional Liability Claims

We, along with virtually all health care providers, operate in an environment with professional liability
risks. Our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per
occurrence, subject to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention. The insurance subsidiary has obtained
reinsurance for professional liability risks generally above a retention level of $25 million per occurrence. We
purchase excess insurance on a claims-made basis for losses in excess of $50 million per occurrence. Provisions
for losses related to professional liability risks were $466 million, $430 million and $344 million for the years
ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Reserves for professional liability risks represent the estimated ultimate cost of all reported and unreported
losses incurred through the respective consolidated balance sheet dates. The estimated ultimate cost includes
estimates of direct expenses and fees paid to outside counsel and experts, but does not include the general
overhead costs of our insurance subsidiary or corporate office. Individual case reserves are established based
upon the particular circumstances of each reported claim and represent our estimates of the future costs that will
be paid on reported claims. Case reserves are reduced as claim payments are made and are adjusted upward or
downward as our estimates regarding the amounts of future losses are revised. Once the case reserves for known
claims are determined, information is stratified by loss layers and retentions, accident years, reported years, and
geographic location of our hospitals. Several actuarial methods are employed to utilize this data to produce
estimates of ultimate losses and reserves for incurred but not reported claims, including: paid and incurred
extrapolation methods utilizing paid and incurred loss development to estimate ultimate losses; frequency and
severity methods utilizing paid and incurred claims development to estimate ultimate average frequency (number

of claims) and ultimate average severity (cost per claim); and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods which add expected
development to actual paid or incurred experience to estimate ultimate losses. These methods use our company-
specific historical claims data and other information. Company-specific claim reporting and payment data
collected over an approximate 20-year period is used in our reserve estimation process. This company-specific
data includes information regarding our business, including historical paid losses and loss adjustment expenses,
historical and current case loss reserves, actual and projected hospital statistical data, professional liability
retentions for each policy year, geographic information and other data.

Reserves and provisions for professional liability risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates. The
estimated reserve ranges, net of amounts receivable under reinsurance contracts, were $1.456 billion to
$1.743 billion at December 31, 2017 and $1.358 billion to $1.625 billion at December 31, 2016. Our estimated
reserves for professional liability claims may change significantly if future claims differ from expected trends.
We perform sensitivity analyses which model the volatility of key actuarial assumptions and monitor our
reserves for adequacy relative to all our assumptions in the aggregate. Based on our analysis, we believe the
estimated professional liability reserve ranges represent the reasonably likely outcomes for ultimate losses. We
consider the number and severity of claims to be the most significant assumptions in estimating reserves for
professional liabilities. A 2.5% change in the expected frequency trend could be reasonably likely and would
increase the reserve estimate by $30 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $29 million. A 2.5% change in the
expected claim severity trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve estimate by $106 million
or reduce the reserve estimate by $98 million. We believe adequate reserves have been recorded for our
professional liability claims; however, due to the complexity of the claims, the extended period of time to resolve
the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes, our ultimate liability for professional liability claims could
change by more than the estimated sensitivity amounts and could change materially from our current estimates.

The reserves for professional liability risks cover approximately 2,500 and 2,700 individual claims at
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and estimates for unreported potential claims. The time period
required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or
litigated. The average time period between the occurrence and final resolution for our professional liability
claims is approximately four years, although the facts and circumstances of each individual claim can result in an
occurrence-to-resolution timeframe that varies from this average. The estimation of the timing of payments
beyond a year can vary significantly.

Reserves for professional liability risks were $1.627 billion and $1.539 billion at December 31, 2017 and
2016, respectively. The current portion of these reserves, $429 million and $391 million at December 31, 2017
and 2016, respectively, is included in “other accrued expenses.” Obligations covered by reinsurance and excess
insurance contracts are included in the reserves for professional liability risks, as we remain liable to the extent
reinsurers and excess insurance carriers do not meet their obligations. Reserves for professional liability risks
(net of $24 million and $45 million receivable under reinsurance and excess insurance contracts at December 31,
2017 and 2016, respectively) were $1.603 billion and $1.494 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016,
respectively. The estimated total net reserves for professional liability risks at December 31, 2017 and 2016 are
comprised of $751 million and $830 million, respectively, of case reserves for known claims and $852 million
and $664 million, respectively, of reserves for incurred but not reported claims.

Income Taxes

We calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences that arise from the recognition of
items in different periods for tax and accounting purposes. Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effects
of amounts expensed in our income statement for which tax deductions will be claimed in future periods.

Although we believe we have properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with
applicable laws, federal, state or foreign taxing authorities may challenge our tax positions upon audit.
Significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of uncertain tax positions. We report a
liability for unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our income
tax returns. During each reporting period, we assess the facts and circumstances related to uncertain tax
positions. If the realization of unrecognized tax benefits is deemed probable based upon new facts and
circumstances, the estimated liability and the provision for income taxes are reduced in the current period. Final
audit results may vary from our estimates.

Revenue/Volume Trends

Our revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the ancillary services and therapy programs ordered
by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charge and negotiated
payment rates for such services. Gross charges typically do not reflect what our facilities are actually paid. Our
facilities have entered into agreements with third-party payers, including government programs and managed
care health plans, under which the facilities are paid based upon the cost of providing services, predetermined
rates per diagnosis, fixed per diem rates or discounts from gross charges. We do not pursue collection of amounts
related to patients who meet our guidelines to qualify for charity care; therefore, they are not reported in
revenues. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care.

Revenues increased 5.1% to $43.614 billion for 2017 from $41.490 billion for 2016 and increased 4.6% for
2016 from $39.678 billion for 2015. The increase in revenues in 2017 can be attributed to the combined impact
of a 2.1% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 3.0% increase in equivalent admissions compared
to the prior year. The increase in revenues in 2016 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 2.3%
increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 2.2% increase in equivalent admissions compared to the prior
year.

Same facility revenues increased 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2016 and increased 4.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2015. The 3.8% increase for 2017 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 2.2%
increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.5% increase in same facility equivalent
admissions. The 4.1% increase for 2016 can be attributed to the combined impact of a 2.2% increase in same
facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.9% increase in same facility equivalent admissions.

Consolidated admissions increased 2.4% during 2017 compared to 2016 and increased 1.2% during 2016
compared to 2015. Consolidated surgeries increased 0.8% during 2017 compared to 2016 and increased 2.1%
during 2016 compared to 2015. Consolidated emergency room visits increased 2.9% during 2017 compared to
2016 and increased 4.1% during 2016 compared to 2015.

Same facility admissions increased 1.1% during 2017 compared to 2016 and during 2016 compared to 2015.
Same facility surgeries declined 0.7% during 2017 compared to 2016 and increased 1.3% during 2016 compared
to 2015. Same facility emergency room visits increased 1.4% during 2017 compared to 2016 and increased 3.8%
during 2016 compared to 2015.

Same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 2.4% and same facility uninsured admissions
increased 5.9% during 2017 compared to 2016. Same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 4.5%
and same facility uninsured admissions increased 3.8% during 2016 compared to 2015.

At December 31, 2017, we owned and operated 45 hospitals and 32 surgery centers in the state of Florida.
Our Florida facilities’ revenues totaled $10.168 billion, $9.522 billion and $9.059 billion for the years ended
December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2017, we owned and operated 46 hospitals
and 27 surgery centers in the state of Texas. Our Texas facilities’ revenues totaled $10.634 billion, $9.898 billion
and $9.517 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During 2017, 2016 and
2015, 56% of our admissions and 48%, 47% and 47%, respectively, of our revenues were generated by our
Florida and Texas facilities. Uninsured admissions in Florida and Texas represented 70%, 69% and 68% of our
uninsured admissions during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

We receive a significant portion of our revenues from government health programs, principally Medicare
and Medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. In December 2017, the
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) announced that it will phase out federal matching funds for
Designated State Health Programs under waivers granted under section 1115 of the Social Security Act due to
concerns that the funds were not used as an integral part of Medicaid demonstrations focused on delivery system
reform or coverage reform.

Texas currently operates its Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program pursuant to a
Medicaid waiver (the “Texas Waiver Program”). In December 2017, CMS approved an extension of this waiver
through September 30, 2022, but indicated that it will phase out some of the federal funding. As currently
structured, the Texas Waiver Program includes two primary components: an uncompensated care component and
a Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (“DSRIP”) component. Initiatives under the DSRIP program are
designed to provide incentive payments to hospitals and other providers for their investments in delivery system
reforms that increase access to health care, improve the quality of care and enhance the health of patients and
families they serve. CMS will provide level DSRIP funding for two years, decreased funding for the following
two years, and no DSRIP funding beginning October 1, 2021. In addition, the disbursement methodology for
uncompensated care pool funding will be revised to align with federal policies. Beginning October 1, 2019,
Texas will not receive any federal financial participation for uncompensated care pool payments until CMS
approves revised uncompensated care protocol policies for
the state that will govern how hospitals’
uncompensated care entitlement is calculated and the size of the statewide uncompensated care pool. Based on
the waiver renewal terms, we expect the statewide uncompensated care pool size will ultimately be reduced, but

62

Revenue/Volume Trends (continued)

it is presently unclear whether our share of the pool and its corresponding uncompensated care payments will
increase or decrease. We provide charity care services directly to patients in several communities in the state of
Texas, in affiliation with other hospitals. As a result of additional charitable care being provided directly to
patients by private hospitals, public hospital districts or counties in Texas have available funds that were
previously devoted to indigent care. The public hospital districts or counties are under no contractual or legal
obligation to provide such indigent care. The public hospital districts or counties have elected to transfer some
portion of these available funds to the state’s Medicaid program. Such action is at the sole discretion of the public
hospital districts or counties. It is anticipated that these contributions to the state will be matched with federal
Medicaid funds, as they have been for the past twelve years in Texas. The state then may make supplemental
payments to hospitals in the state for Medicaid services rendered. Hospitals receiving Medicaid supplemental
payments may include those that are providing additional indigent care services.

Our Texas Medicaid revenues included $351 million ($108 million DSRIP related and $243 million
uncompensated care related), $370 million ($101 million DSRIP related and $269 million uncompensated care
related) and $347 million ($95 million DSRIP related and $252 million uncompensated care related) during
2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of Medicaid supplemental waiver payments. We cannot predict whether the
Texas Medicaid Waiver Program will be further extended or revised beyond September 30, 2022.

In addition, we receive supplemental payments in several other states. We are aware these supplemental
payment programs are currently being reviewed by certain state agencies and some states have made waiver
requests to CMS to replace their existing supplemental payment programs. It is possible these reviews and
waiver requests will result in the restructuring of such supplemental payment programs and could result in the
payment programs being reduced or eliminated. Because deliberations about these programs are ongoing, we are
unable to estimate the financial impact the program structure modifications, if any, may have on our results of
operations.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Results of Operations (continued)

Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016

Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. totaled $2.216 billion, or $5.95 per diluted share, for 2017,
compared to $2.890 billion, or $7.30 per diluted share, for 2016. Financial results for 2017 include additional
expenses and losses of revenues estimated at approximately $140 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, associated
with the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma on our Texas, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina facilities and
an increase in provision for income taxes of $301 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, related to the revaluation of
our deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The amount
associated with the hurricanes is prior to any insurance recoveries which we may receive. Financial results for
2017 also include tax benefits of $82 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, related to employee equity award
settlements, net gains on sales of facilities of $8 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, and losses on retirement of
debt of $39 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. Financial results for 2016 include tax benefits of $51 million, or
$0.13 per diluted share, related to the resolution of federal income tax issues for our 2011 and 2012 tax years and
$162 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, related to employee equity award settlements. Financial results for 2016
also include net gains on sales of facilities of $23 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, losses on retirement of debt
of $4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, and legal claim benefits of $246 million, or $0.39 per diluted share,
related to the settlement of the Health Midwest litigation. All “per diluted share” disclosures are based upon
amounts net of the applicable income taxes. Shares used for diluted earnings per share were 372.221 million
shares and 395.851 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During 2017
and 2016, we repurchased 25.092 million and 36.325 million shares, respectively, of our common stock.

During 2017, consolidated admissions increased 2.4% and same facility admissions increased 1.1%
compared to 2016. Consolidated inpatient surgeries increased 1.7% and same facility inpatient surgeries
increased 0.3% during 2017 compared to 2016. Consolidated outpatient surgeries increased 0.3%, and same
facility outpatient surgeries declined 1.3% during 2017 compared to 2016. Emergency room visits increased
2.9% on a consolidated basis and increased 1.4% on a same facility basis during 2017 compared to 2016.

Revenues before provision for doubtful accounts increased 6.5% to $47.653 billion for 2017 from
$44.747 billion for 2016. The provision for doubtful accounts increased $782 million from $3.257 billion in 2016
to $4.039 billion in 2017. The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate
primarily to uninsured amounts due directly from patients, including copayment and deductible amounts for
patients who have health care coverage. The self-pay revenue deductions for charity care and uninsured discounts
increased $710 million and $1.473 billion, respectively, during 2017 compared to 2016. The sum of the provision
for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, as a percentage of the sum of revenues, the provision
for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, was 34.9% for 2017 compared to 33.0% for 2016. At
December 31, 2017, our allowance for doubtful accounts represented 100% of the $5.488 billion total patient due
accounts receivable balance, including accounts, net of estimated contractual discounts, related to patients for
which eligibility for Medicaid coverage or uninsured discounts was being evaluated.

Revenues increased 5.1% to $43.614 billion for 2017 from $41.490 billion for 2016. The increase in
revenues was due to the combined impact of a 2.1% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 3.0%
increase in equivalent admissions compared to 2016. Same facility revenues increased 3.8% due primarily to the
combined impact of a 2.2% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.5% increase in
same facility equivalent admissions compared to 2016.

Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenues, were 46.0% in 2017 and 45.5% in 2016. Salaries and
benefits per equivalent admission increased 3.1% in 2017 compared to 2016. Same facility labor rate increases

averaged 3.0% for 2017 compared to 2016. Share-based compensation expense increased from $251 million in
2016 to $270 million in 2017.

Supplies, as a percentage of revenues, were 16.8% in 2017 and 16.7% in 2016. Supply costs per equivalent
admission increased 2.5% in 2017 compared to 2016. Supply costs per equivalent admission increased 4.9% for
medical devices, 0.3% for pharmacy supplies and 1.7% for general medical and surgical items in 2017 compared
to 2016.

Other operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was 18.4% in 2017 and 18.1% in 2016. Other
operating expenses are primarily comprised of contract services, professional fees, repairs and maintenance, rents
and leases, utilities, insurance (including professional liability insurance) and nonincome taxes. Provisions for
losses related to professional liability risks were $466 million and $430 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Equity in earnings of affiliates was $45 million for 2017 and $54 million for 2016.

Depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of revenues, was 4.9% in 2017 and 4.8% in 2016.

Depreciation expense was $2.111 billion for 2017 and $1.946 billion for 2016.

Interest expense declined to $1.690 billion for 2017 from $1.707 billion for 2016. The decline in interest
expense was due to a decline in the average interest rate. Our average debt balance was $32.082 billion for 2017
compared to $31.048 billion for 2016. The average interest rate for our long-term debt declined from 5.5% for
2016 to 5.3% for 2017.

Net gains on sales of facilities were $8 million and $23 million, respectively, for 2017 and 2016 and related

to sales of real estate and other investments.

During 2017, we issued $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.500% senior secured notes due 2047.
We used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding the purchase of certain hospital
acquisitions, and the redemption of all $500 million aggregate principal amount of our existing 8.000% senior
notes maturing in October 2018. The pretax loss on retirement of debt was $39 million. During 2016, we issued
$1.200 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.500% senior secured notes due 2027. We used the net proceeds
for general corporate purposes and to retire a portion of one of our senior secured term loans. We also entered
into a joinder agreement to retire the remaining portion of this senior secured term loan using proceeds from a
new $1.200 billion senior secured term loan facility maturing in February 2024. The pretax loss on retirement of
debt was $4 million.

The effective tax rates were 42.5% and 32.3% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The effective tax rate
computations exclude net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as it relates to consolidated partnerships.
Our provision for income taxes for 2017 included increases of $301 million related to the remeasurement of our
deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and $14 million related
to reductions in interest expense (net of tax). Our provision for income taxes for 2017 and 2016 also included tax
benefits of $82 million and $162 million, respectively, related to employee equity award settlements. Our
provision for income taxes for 2016 also included tax benefits of $51 million primarily related to the resolution
of federal income tax issues for our 2011 and 2012 tax years. Excluding the effect of these adjustments, the
effective tax rates for 2017 and 2016 would have been 37.2% and 37.3%, respectively.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests declined from $542 million for 2016 to $527 million for
2017. The decline in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests related primarily to a joint venture in a
Texas market.

Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015

Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. totaled $2.890 billion, or $7.30 per diluted share, for 2016,
compared to $2.129 billion, or $4.99 per diluted share, for 2015. Financial results for 2016 include tax benefits of

2012 tax years and $162 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, related to employee equity award settlements.
Financial results for 2016 also include net gains on sales of facilities of $23 million, or $0.05 per diluted share,
losses on retirement of debt of $4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, and legal claim benefits of $246 million, or

sales of facilities of $5 million, losses on retirement of debt of $135 million, or $0.20 per diluted share and legal
claim costs of $249 million, or $0.37 per diluted share. All “per diluted share” disclosures are based upon
amounts net of the applicable income taxes. Shares used for diluted earnings per share were 395.851 million
shares and 426.721 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During 2016
and 2015, we repurchased 36.325 million and 31.991 million shares, respectively, of our common stock.

During 2016, consolidated admissions increased 1.2% and same facility admissions increased 1.1%
compared to 2015. Consolidated and same facility inpatient surgeries each increased 1.4% during 2016 compared
to 2015. Consolidated outpatient surgeries increased 2.5%, and same facility outpatient surgeries increased 1.2%
during 2016 compared to 2015. Emergency room visits increased 4.1% on a consolidated basis and increased
3.8% on a same facility basis during 2016 compared to 2015.

Revenues before provision for doubtful accounts increased 2.7% to $44.747 billion for 2016 from
$43.591 billion for 2015. The provision for doubtful accounts declined $656 million from $3.913 billion in 2015
to $3.257 billion in 2016. The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate
primarily to uninsured amounts due directly from patients, including copayment and deductible amounts for
patients who have health care coverage. The self-pay revenue deductions for charity care and uninsured discounts
increased $469 million and $2.355 billion, respectively, during 2016 compared to 2015. The sum of the provision
for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, as a percentage of the sum of revenues, the provision
for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, was 33.0% for 2016 compared to 31.5% for 2015. At
December 31, 2016, our allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 97.5% of the $5.116 billion
total patient due accounts receivable balance, including accounts, net of estimated contractual discounts, related
to patients for which eligibility for Medicaid coverage or uninsured discounts was being evaluated.

Revenues increased 4.6% to $41.490 billion for 2016 from $39.678 billion for 2015. The increase in
revenues was due primarily to the combined impact of a 2.3% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a
2.2% increase in equivalent admissions compared to 2015. Same facility revenues increased 4.1% due to the
combined impact of a 2.2% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.9% increase in

and leases, utilities, insurance (including professional liability insurance) and nonincome taxes. Provisions for
losses related to professional liability risks were $430 million and $344 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The increase in provision for losses related to professional liability risks for 2016 compared to 2015 was
primarily due to $64 million of favorable development related to prior years’ claims recorded in 2015.

Equity in earnings of affiliates was $54 million for 2016 and $46 million for 2015.

Depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of revenues, was 4.8% in both 2016 and 2015. Depreciation

expense was $1.946 billion for 2016 and $1.880 billion for 2015.

Interest expense increased to $1.707 billion for 2016 from $1.665 billion for 2015. The increase in interest
expense was due to an increase in the average debt balance. Our average debt balance was $31.048 billion for
2016 compared to $29.718 billion for 2015. The average interest rate for our long-term debt declined from 5.6%
for 2015 to 5.5% for 2016.

Net gains on sales of facilities were $23 million for 2016 and related to sales of real estate and other
investments. Net losses on sales of facilities were $5 million for 2015 and related to sales of real estate and other
investments.

During 2016, we issued $1.200 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.500% senior secured notes due 2027.
We used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and to retire a portion of one of our senior secured term
loans. We also entered into a joinder agreement to retire the remaining portion of this senior secured term loan
using proceeds from a new $1.200 billion senior secured term loan facility maturing in February 2024. The
pretax loss on retirement of debt was $4 million. During 2015, we redeemed all $1.525 billion aggregate
principal amount of 7 3⁄4 % senior notes due 2021 and all $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of our
outstanding 6.500% senior notes due 2016. We also entered into a joinder agreement to retire certain of our
existing senior secured term loans. The pretax losses on retirement of debt related to these redemptions were
$135 million.

We reached a settlement agreement with the Health Care Foundation of Greater Kansas City related to a
previously disclosed contractual dispute regarding our obligation to fund certain capital expenditures in
connection with our purchase of hospitals from Health Midwest in 2003. The settlement agreement enabled us to
reduce the accrual for this claim by $290 million and resulted in the recognition of net legal claim benefits of
$246 million related to this litigation for 2016. We recorded $129 million of legal claim costs during 2015 related
to this matter. We also recorded $120 million of legal claim costs during 2015 to settle a securities class action
lawsuit and related derivative actions.

The effective tax rates were 32.3% and 37.2% for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate
computations exclude net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as it relates to consolidated partnerships.

Our provision for income taxes for 2016 included tax benefits of $51 million primarily related to the resolution of
federal income tax issues for our 2011 and 2012 tax years and $162 million related to excess tax benefits from
employee equity award settlements. Excluding the effect of these adjustments, the effective tax rate for 2016
would have been 37.3%.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests declined from $567 million for 2015 to $542 million for
2016. The decline in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests related primarily to joint ventures in our
United Kingdom market, a Texas market and an Oklahoma market.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary cash requirements are paying our operating expenses, servicing our debt, capital expenditures
on our existing properties, acquisitions of hospitals and other health care entities, repurchases of our common
stock, distributions to stockholders and distributions to noncontrolling interests. Our primary cash sources are
cash flows from operating activities, issuances of debt and equity securities and dispositions of hospitals and
other health care entities.

Cash provided by operating activities totaled $5.426 billion in 2017 compared to $5.653 billion in 2016 and
$4.734 billion in 2015. Working capital totaled $3.819 billion at December 31, 2017 and $3.252 billion at
December 31, 2016. The $227 million decline in cash provided by operating activities for 2017, compared to
2016, was primarily related to the $689 million decline in net income, offset by increases related to depreciation
and amortization of $165 million and income taxes of $310 million. The $919 million increase in cash provided
by operating activities for 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily related to the $736 million increase in net
income. Cash payments for interest and income taxes declined $16 million for 2017 compared to 2016 and
increased $85 million for 2016 compared to 2015.

Cash used in investing activities was $4.279 billion, $3.240 billion and $2.583 billion in 2017, 2016 and
2015, respectively. Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures were $3.015 billion in 2017, $2.760 billion in
2016 and $2.375 billion in 2015. We expended $1.212 billion, $576 million and $351 million for acquisitions of
hospitals and health care entities during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Planned capital expenditures are
expected to approximate $3.5 billion in 2018. At December 31, 2017, there were projects under construction
which had an estimated additional cost to complete and equip over the next five years of approximately
$3.1 billion. We expect to finance capital expenditures with internally generated and borrowed funds.

Cash used in financing activities totaled $1.061 billion in 2017, $2.508 billion in 2016 and $1.976 billion in
2015. During 2017, we had a net increase of $1.509 billion in our indebtedness and used cash of $2.051 billion
for repurchases of common stock. During 2016, we had a net increase of $815 million in our indebtedness and
used cash of $2.751 billion for repurchases of common stock. During 2015, we had a net increase of $778 million
in our indebtedness and used cash of $2.397 billion for repurchases of common stock. During 2017, 2016 and
2015, we made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $448 million, $434 million and $495 million,
respectively. We paid debt issuance costs of $26 million, $40 million and $50 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. We, or our affiliates, may in the future repurchase portions of our debt or equity securities, subject
to certain limitations, from time to time in either the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in
accordance with applicable SEC and other legal requirements. The timing, prices, and sizes of purchases depend
upon prevailing trading prices, general economic and market conditions, and other factors, including applicable
securities laws. At December 31, 2017, $1.802 billion of share repurchase authorization remained available under
the $2 billion share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors during October 2017. Funds for the

repurchase of debt or equity securities have, and are expected to, come primarily from cash generated from
operations and borrowed funds. On January 30, 2018, our Board of Directors initiated and declared a quarterly
dividend of $0.35 per share on our common stock payable on March 30, 2018 to stockholders of record on
March 1, 2018. The timing and amount of future cash dividends will vary based on a number of factors,
including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, share repurchases and investing in our existing
markets, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, changes to applicable tax
laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that
cash dividends are in the best interest of stockholders and are in compliance with all applicable laws and
agreements of the Company.

In addition to cash flows from operations, available sources of capital include amounts available under our
senior secured credit facilities ($2.047 billion as of December 31, 2017 and $1.827 billion as of January 31,
2018) and anticipated access to public and private debt and equity markets.

Investments of our insurance subsidiaries, to maintain statutory equity and pay claims, totaled $472 million
and $385 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The insurance subsidiary maintained net reserves
for professional liability risks of $194 million and $215 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence;
however, this coverage is subject to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention. Net reserves for the self-
insured professional liability risks retained were $1.409 billion and $1.279 billion at December 31, 2017 and
2016, respectively. Claims payments, net of reinsurance recoveries, during the next 12 months are expected to
approximate $424 million. We estimate that approximately $378 million of the expected net claim payments
during the next 12 months will relate to claims subject to the self-insured retention.

Financing Activities

We are a highly leveraged company with significant debt service requirements. Our debt

totaled
$33.058 billion and $31.376 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our interest expense was
$1.690 billion for 2017 and $1.707 billion for 2016.

During March 2016, we issued $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.250% senior secured notes
due 2026. We used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and to retire a portion of one of our senior
secured term loans. We also entered into a joinder agreement to retire the remaining portion of this senior
secured term loan using proceeds from a new $1.500 billion senior secured term loan facility maturing in March
2023.

During August 2016, we issued $1.200 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.500% senior secured notes
due 2027. We used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and to retire a portion of one of our senior
secured term loans. We also entered into a joinder agreement to retire the remaining portion of this senior
secured term loan using proceeds from a new $1.200 billion senior secured term loan facility maturing in
February 2024. The pretax loss on retirement of debt was $4 million.

During June 2017, we issued $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.500% senior secured notes due
2047. We used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding the purchase of certain
hospital acquisitions, and the redemption, during July 2017, of all $500 million aggregate principal amount of
our existing 8.000% senior notes maturing in October 2018. The pretax loss on retirement of debt was
$39 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)

During June 2017, we amended our senior secured revolving credit facilities by (i) increasing the
commitments under the senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility to $3.750 billion, (ii) extending the
maturity date of the revolving credit commitments to June 28, 2022, (iii) amending the incremental facility
provisions to permit the incurrence of additional incremental credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of
$1.5 billion and (iv) providing that the commitment fee for unutilized commitments under the senior secured
asset-based revolving credit facility shall be 0.250% per annum.

Management believes that cash flows from operations, amounts available under our senior secured credit
facilities and our anticipated access to public and private debt markets will be sufficient to meet expected

Commitment Expiration by Period

(a) We have not included obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits of $439 million at December 31,

2017, as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing or amounts of cash payments, if any, at this time.

(b) Estimates of interest payments assume that interest rates and borrowing spreads at December 31, 2017,

remain constant during the period presented.

(c) The estimation of the timing of payments for professional

liability claims beyond a year can vary
significantly. The time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and
whether the claim is settled or litigated.

(d) Amounts relate to future operating lease obligations, purchase obligations and other obligations and are not
recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. Amounts also include physician commitments that are recorded
in our consolidated balance sheet.

(f)

(e) Amounts relate primarily to instances in which we have agreed to indemnify various commercial insurers
and lenders who have provided surety bonds and letters of credit to cover utility and construction deposits
and Medicaid provider bonds.
In consideration for physicians relocating to the communities in which our hospitals are located and
agreeing to engage in private practice for the benefit of the respective communities, we make advances to
physicians, normally over a period of one year, to assist in establishing the physicians’ practices. The actual
amount of these commitments to be advanced often depends upon the financial results of the physicians’
private practice during the recruitment agreement payment period. The physician commitments reflected
were based on our maximum exposure on effective agreements at December 31, 2017.

Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. The investments in our
100% owned insurance subsidiaries were $472 million at December 31, 2017. These investments are carried at
fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive
income. At December 31, 2017, we had a net unrealized gain of $10 million on the insurance subsidiaries’
investment securities.

We are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. Investments in debt and equity securities of our
100% owned insurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. Should the
100% owned insurance subsidiaries require significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to
pay claims and other expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely
manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a normal
market environment. We may be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairments on our investment
securities in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market valuations of the
securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue-specific factors.

We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, and we periodically enter into
interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. Our interest rate swap agreements
involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on common
notional principal amounts and maturity dates. The notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances
used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities. Our credit risk related to these
agreements is considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions. The
interest payments under these agreements are settled on a net basis. These derivatives have been recognized in
the financial statements at their respective fair values. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives, which are
designated as cash flow hedges, are included in other comprehensive income.

to our

With respect

interest-bearing liabilities, approximately $5.072 billion of long-term debt at
December 31, 2017 was subject to variable rates of interest, while the remaining balance in long-term debt of
$27.986 billion at December 31, 2017 was subject to fixed rates of interest. Both the general level of interest
rates and, for the senior secured credit facilities, our leverage affect our variable interest rates. Our variable debt
is comprised primarily of amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities. Borrowings under the
senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either (a) a
base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (2) the prime rate of
Bank of America or (b) a LIBOR rate for the currency of such borrowing for the relevant interest period. The
applicable margin for borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities may fluctuate according to a leverage
ratio. The average effective interest rate for our long-term debt declined from 5.5% for 2016 to 5.3% for 2017.

The estimated fair value of our total long-term debt was $34.689 billion at December 31, 2017. The
estimates of fair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues of long-term debt
with the same maturities. Based on a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates, the potential annualized reduction
to future pretax earnings would be approximately $51 million. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest
rates, we generally target a majority of our debt portfolio to be maintained at fixed rates.

We are exposed to currency translation risk related to our foreign operations. We currently do not consider
the market risk related to foreign currency translation to be material to our consolidated financial statements or
our liquidity.

Financial Instruments

Derivative financial instruments are employed to manage risks, including interest rate exposures, and are not
used for trading or speculative purposes. We recognize derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap
agreements, in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are
recognized periodically either in earnings or in stockholders’ equity, as a component of other comprehensive
income, depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so,
whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash
flow hedges, to the extent they are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, and subsequently
reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of the hedged items when they occur.

The net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps is recognized as interest expense. Gains and losses
resulting from the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are deferred and amortized as adjustments
to expense over the remaining period of the debt originally covered by the terminated swap.

Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices

Various federal, state and local laws have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit our ability to increase
prices. Revenues for general, acute care hospital services rendered to Medicare patients are established under the
federal government’s prospective payment system. Total fee-for-service Medicare revenues were 21.7%, 21.4%
and 21.8% of our revenues for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Management believes hospital industry operating margins have been, and may continue to be, under
significant pressure because of changes in payer and service mix and growth in operating expenses in excess of
the increase in prospective payments under the Medicare program. In addition, as a result of increasing
regulatory and competitive pressures, our ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to
non-Medicare patients is limited.

Tax Examinations

During 2016, the IRS completed its examination, resolving all outstanding federal income tax issues for our
2011 and 2012 tax years. We are subject to examination by the IRS for tax years 2014 and later as well as by
state and foreign taxing authorities.

Management believes HCA Healthcare, Inc., its predecessors and affiliates properly reported taxable income
and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the IRS, state and foreign
taxing authorities and final resolution of any disputes will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of
operations or financial position. However, if payments due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our
recorded estimates, such resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
position.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

1. Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as
such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the “Exchange Act”). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this
annual report.

2. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

(a) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems
determined to be effective, can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation
and presentation.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on our
assessment under the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework, our management concluded that
our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017.

Ernst & Young, LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated
financial statements included in this Form 10-K, has issued a report on our internal control over financial
reporting, which is included herein.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
HCA Healthcare, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited HCA Healthcare, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017,
based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, HCA
Healthcare, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of HCA Healthcare, Inc. as of December 31, 2017 and
2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ deficit, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and our report
dated February 23, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management

is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a
public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
HCA Healthcare, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of HCA Healthcare, Inc. (the “Company”)
as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
stockholders’ deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the
related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements present
the Company at
December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

the financial position of

in all material

respects,

fairly,

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017,
based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 23, 2018
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the
risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1994.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Reporting Entity

HCA Healthcare, Inc. is a holding company whose affiliates own and operate hospitals and related health
care entities. The term “affiliates” includes direct and indirect subsidiaries of HCA Healthcare, Inc. and
partnerships and joint ventures in which such subsidiaries are partners. At December 31, 2017, these affiliates
owned and operated 179 hospitals, 120 freestanding surgery centers and provided extensive outpatient and
ancillary services. HCA Healthcare, Inc.’s facilities are located in 20 states and England. The terms “Company,”
“HCA,” “we,” “our” or “us,” as used herein and unless otherwise stated or indicated by context, refer to HCA
Healthcare, Inc. and its affiliates. The terms “facilities” or “hospitals” refer to entities owned and operated by
affiliates of HCA and the term “employees” refers to employees of affiliates of HCA.

Basis of Presentation

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The consolidated financial statements include all subsidiaries and entities controlled by HCA. We generally
define “control” as ownership of a majority of the voting interest of an entity. The consolidated financial
statements include entities in which we absorb a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receive a majority of the
entity’s expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the
entity. The accounts of acquired entities are included in our consolidated financial statements for periods
subsequent
intercompany transactions have been
eliminated. Investments in entities we do not control, but in which we have a substantial ownership interest and
can exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method.

to our acquisition of controlling interests. Significant

The majority of our expenses are “cost of revenue” items. Costs that could be classified as general and
administrative include our corporate office costs, which were $373 million, $373 million and $327 million for the
years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

Revenues

Revenues consist primarily of net patient service revenues that are recorded based upon established billing
rates less allowances for contractual adjustments. Revenues are recorded during the period the health care
services are provided, based upon the estimated amounts due from the patients and third-party payers. Third-
party payers include federal and state agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs), managed care
health plans and commercial
insurance companies (including plans offered through the health insurance
exchanges), and employers. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health plans are based upon
the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Contractual payment terms in managed care
agreements are generally based upon predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem rates or discounted
fee-for-service rates. Revenues related to uninsured patients and uninsured copayment and deductible amounts
for patients who have health care coverage may have discounts applied (uninsured discounts and contractual
discounts). We also record a provision for doubtful accounts (based primarily on historical collection experience)
related to uninsured accounts to record net self pay revenues at the estimated amounts we expect to collect. Our
revenues from third party payers and other (including uninsured patients) for the years ended December 31, are
summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):

Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex and subject

to
interpretation. As a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility recorded estimates will change by a material
amount. Estimated reimbursement amounts are adjusted in subsequent periods as cost reports are prepared and
filed and as final settlements are determined (in relation to certain government programs, primarily Medicare,
this is generally referred to as the “cost report” filing and settlement process). The adjustments to estimated
Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement amounts and disproportionate-share funds related primarily to cost
reports filed during the respective year resulted in net increases to revenues of $41 million, $31 million and
$48 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The adjustments to estimated reimbursement amounts related
primarily to cost reports filed during previous years resulted in net increases to revenues of $56 million,
$90 million and $85 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (“EMTALA”) requires any hospital participating in the
Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the
hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition,
to either stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the
condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an

individual’s ability to pay for treatment. Federal and state laws and regulations require, and our commitment to
providing quality patient care encourages, us to provide services to patients who are financially unable to pay for
the health care services they receive. Prior to November 2017, patients treated at hospitals for nonelective care,
who have income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, are eligible for charity care. During November
2017, we expanded our charity care policy to limit the patient responsibility amounts for patients who have
income above 200%, but at or below 400%, of the federal poverty level to a percentage of their annual household
income, computed on a sliding scale based upon their annual income and the applicable multiple of the federal
poverty level. The federal poverty level is established by the federal government and is based on income and
family size. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not
reported in revenues. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care.
In implementing the uninsured discount policy, we may first attempt to provide assistance to uninsured patients
to help determine whether they may qualify for Medicaid, other federal or state assistance or charity care. If an
uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.

To quantify the total impact of and trends related to uninsured accounts, we believe it is beneficial to view
charity care, uninsured discounts and the provision for doubtful accounts in combination, rather than each
separately. A summary of these amounts for the years ended December 31, follows (dollars in millions):

Recent Pronouncements

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and the International Accounting
Standards Board issued a final, converged, principles-based standard on revenue recognition. Companies across
all industries will use a five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. The new standard, which
replaces nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance, will require significant management judgments and
change the way many companies recognize revenue in their financial statements. In July 2015, the FASB decided
to defer the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year to annual and interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2017 for public entities and permit entities to adopt one year earlier if they choose. We believe the
most significant impact of adopting the new standard will be to the presentation of our income statement where
the provision for doubtful accounts will be recorded as a direct reduction to revenues and will not be presented as
a separate line item. We expect to adopt the new standard using the full retrospective application, and we do not
believe the adoption will have a significant impact on our recognition of net revenues or related disclosures for
any period.

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (“ASU 2016-02”), which
requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for public business
entities for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are
continuing to evaluate the provisions of ASU 2016-02 (and developments concerning its transition provision
options) to determine how our financial statements will be affected, and we believe the primary effect of
adopting the new standard will be to record right-of-use assets and obligations for our leases currently classified
as operating leases.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when
purchased. Our insurance subsidiaries’ cash equivalent investments in excess of the amounts required to pay
estimated professional
liability claims during the next twelve months are not included in cash and cash
equivalents as these funds are not available for general corporate purposes. Carrying values of cash and cash
equivalents approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

Our cash management system provides for daily investment of available balances and the funding of
outstanding checks when presented for payment. Outstanding, but unpresented, checks totaling $480 million and
$565 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, have been included in “accounts payable” in the
consolidated balance sheets. Upon presentation for payment, these checks are funded through available cash
balances or our credit facility.

Accounts Receivable

We receive payments for services rendered from federal and state agencies (under the Medicare and
Medicaid programs), managed care health plans, commercial insurance companies, employers and patients. We
recognize that revenues and receivables from government agencies are significant to our operations, but do not
believe there are significant credit risks associated with these government agencies. We do not believe there are
any other significant concentrations of revenues from any particular payer that would subject us to any
significant credit risks in the collection of our accounts receivable.

NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

Accounts Receivable (continued)

Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made by means of the provision for doubtful accounts.
Accounts written off as uncollectible are deducted from the allowance for doubtful accounts and subsequent
recoveries are added. The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon management’s assessment
of historical and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state and private
employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. The provision for doubtful accounts and the
allowance for doubtful accounts relate to “uninsured” amounts due directly from patients (including copayment
and deductible amounts from patients who have health care coverage). Accounts are written off when all
reasonable internal and external collection efforts have been performed. We consider the return of an account
from the secondary collection agency to be the culmination of our reasonable collection efforts and the timing
basis for writing off the account balance. Writeoffs are based upon specific identification and the writeoff
process requires a writeoff adjustment entry to the patient accounting system. Management relies on the results
of detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and recoveries at facilities that represent a majority of our revenues and
accounts receivable (the “hindsight analysis”) as a primary source of information to utilize in estimating the
collectibility of our accounts receivable. We perform the hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-
months accounts receivable collection and writeoff data. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the allowance for
doubtful accounts represented 100% and 98%, respectively, of the $5.488 billion and $5.116 billion, respectively,
patient due accounts receivable balance. The patient due accounts receivable balance represents the estimated
uninsured portion of our accounts receivable. The estimated uninsured portion of Medicaid pending and
uninsured discount pending accounts is included in our patient due accounts receivable balance. Days revenues in
accounts receivable were 52 days, 50 days and 53 days at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Changes in general economic conditions, patient accounting service center operations, payer mix, or federal or
state governmental health care coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and results
of operations.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.

Property and Equipment

Depreciation expense, computed using the straight-line method, was $2.111 billion in 2017, $1.946 billion
in 2016 and $1.880 billion in 2015. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over estimated useful lives
ranging generally from 10 to 40 years. Estimated useful lives of equipment vary generally from four to 10 years.

When events, circumstances or operating results indicate the carrying values of certain long-lived assets
expected to be held and used might be impaired, we prepare projections of the undiscounted future cash flows
expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If the projections indicate the recorded
amounts are not expected to be recoverable, such amounts are reduced to estimated fair value. Fair value may be
estimated based upon internal evaluations that include quantitative analyses of revenues and cash flows, reviews
of recent sales of similar assets and independent appraisals.

Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair value less
costs to sell or close. The estimates of fair value are usually based upon recent sales of similar assets and market
responses based upon discussions with and offers received from potential buyers.

Investments of Insurance Subsidiaries

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the investments of our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries were classified
as “available-for-sale” as defined in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) No. 320, Investments—Debt
and Equity Securities and are recorded at fair value. The investment securities are held for the purpose of
providing a funding source to pay liability claims covered by the insurance subsidiaries. We perform quarterly
assessments of individual investment securities to determine whether declines in market value are temporary or
other-than-temporary. Our investment securities evaluation process involves subjective judgments, often involves
estimating the outcome of future events, and requires a significant level of professional judgment in determining
whether an impairment has occurred. We evaluate, among other things, the financial position and near term
prospects of the issuer, conditions in the issuer’s industry, liquidity of the investment, changes in the amount or
timing of expected future cash flows from the investment, and recent downgrades of the issuer by a rating
agency, to determine if, and when, a decline in the fair value of an investment below amortized cost is considered
other-than-temporary. The length of time and extent to which the fair value of the investment is less than
amortized cost and our ability and intent to retain the investment, to allow for any anticipated recovery of the
investment’s fair value, are important components of our investment securities evaluation process.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests. In addition to the annual impairment
review, impairment reviews are performed whenever circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist.
Impairment testing for goodwill is done at the reporting unit level. Reporting units are one level below the
business segment level, and our impairment testing is performed at the operating division level. We compare the
fair value of the reporting unit assets to the carrying amount, on at least an annual basis, to determine if there is
potential impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit assets is less than their carrying value, an impairment
loss is recognized. Fair value is estimated based upon internal evaluations of each reporting unit that include
quantitative analyses of market multiples, revenues and cash flows and reviews of recent sales of similar
facilities. No goodwill impairments were recognized during 2017, 2016 and 2015. Since January 1, 2000, we
have recognized total goodwill impairments of $102 million in the aggregate. None of the goodwill impairments
related to evaluations of goodwill at the reporting unit level, as all recognized goodwill impairments during this
period related to goodwill allocated to asset disposal groups.

During 2017, goodwill increased by $693 million related to acquisitions and by $12 million related to
foreign currency translation and other adjustments. During 2016, goodwill increased by $41 million related to
acquisitions and declined by $49 million related to sales, foreign currency translation and other adjustments.

During 2017, identifiable intangible assets declined by $15 million due to amortization, foreign currency
translation and other adjustments. During 2016, identifiable intangible assets declined by $19 million due to
amortization, foreign currency translation and other adjustments. Identifiable intangible assets are amortized over
estimated lives ranging generally from three to 10 years. The gross carrying amount of identifiable intangible
assets at both December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $184 million and accumulated amortization was $94 million and
$79 million, respectively. The gross carrying amount of indefinite-lived identifiable intangible assets at both
December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $269 million. Indefinite-lived identifiable intangible assets are not amortized
but are subject to annual impairment tests, and impairment reviews are performed whenever circumstances
indicate a possible impairment may exist.

NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

Debt Issuance Costs

Debt issuance costs are amortized based upon the terms of the respective debt obligations. The gross
carrying amount of debt issuance costs at December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $353 million and $334 million,
respectively, and accumulated amortization was $189 million and $164 million, respectively. Amortization of
debt issuance costs is included in interest expense and was $31 million, $34 million and $35 million for 2017,
2016 and 2015, respectively.

Professional Liability Claims

Reserves for professional liability risks were $1.627 billion and $1.539 billion at December 31, 2017 and
2016, respectively. The current portion of the reserves, $429 million and $391 million at December 31, 2017 and
2016, respectively, is included in “other accrued expenses” in the consolidated balance sheets. Provisions for
losses related to professional liability risks were $466 million, $430 million and $344 million for 2017, 2016 and
2015, respectively, and are included in “other operating expenses” in our consolidated income statements.
Provisions for losses related to professional liability risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates. Loss
and loss expense reserves represent the estimated ultimate net cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred
through the respective consolidated balance sheet dates. The reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses are
estimated using individual case-basis valuations and actuarial analyses. Those estimates are subject to the effects
of trends in loss severity and frequency. The estimates are continually reviewed and adjustments are recorded as
experience develops or new information becomes known. Adjustments to the estimated reserve amounts are
included in current operating results. The reserves for professional liability risks cover approximately 2,500 and
2,700 individual claims at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and estimates for unreported potential
claims. The time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether
the claim is settled or litigated. During both 2017 and 2016, $357 million of net payments were made for
professional and general liability claims. The estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year can vary
significantly. Although considerable variability is inherent in professional liability reserve estimates, we believe
the reserves for losses and loss expenses are adequate; however, there can be no assurance the ultimate liability
will not exceed our estimates.

A portion of our professional liability risks is insured through a 100% owned insurance subsidiary. Subject
to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention, our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance
subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence. The insurance subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for
professional liability risks generally above a retention level of $25 million per occurrence. We also maintain
professional liability insurance with unrelated commercial carriers for losses in excess of amounts insured by our
insurance subsidiary.

The obligations covered by reinsurance and excess insurance contracts are included in the reserves for
professional liability risks, as we remain liable to the extent the reinsurers and excess insurance carriers do not
meet their obligations under the reinsurance and excess insurance contracts. The amounts receivable under the
reinsurance contracts include $19 million and $36 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, recorded
in “other assets,” and $5 million and $9 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, recorded in “other
current assets.”

Financial Instruments

Derivative financial instruments are employed to manage interest rate risks, and are not used for trading or
speculative purposes. We recognize our interest rate swap derivative instruments in the consolidated balance

Financial Instruments (continued)

sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized periodically in stockholders’ equity,
as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), provided the derivative financial instrument qualifies for
hedge accounting. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are
effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), and subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset
the impact of the forecasted transactions when they occur. In the event the forecasted transaction to which a cash
flow hedge relates is no longer likely, the amount in other comprehensive income (loss) is recognized in earnings
and generally the derivative is terminated.

The net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps is recognized as interest expense. Gains and losses
resulting from the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are deferred and amortized as adjustments
to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt originally associated with the terminated swap.

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Entities

The consolidated financial statements include all assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of less than 100%
owned entities that we control. Accordingly, we have recorded noncontrolling interests in the earnings and equity
of such entities.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2017 presentation.

NOTE 2 — SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

Stock Incentive Plan

Our stock incentive plan is designed to promote the long term financial interests and growth of the Company
by attracting and retaining management and other personnel, motivating them to achieve long range goals and
aligning their interests with those of our stockholders through opportunities for increased stock, or stock-based,
ownership in the Company. Portions of the options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and restricted share units
(“RSUs”) granted vest solely based upon continued employment over a specific period of time, and portions of
the options, SARs and RSUs, and all performance share units (“PSUs”) vest based both upon continued
employment over a specific period of time and upon the achievement of predetermined financial targets over
time. We granted 1,879,100 and 1,601,300 SARs and 2,787,700 and 2,628,500 RSUs and PSUs during 2017 and
2016, respectively. At December 31, 2017, there were 11,284,400 exercisable stock options and SARs, and there
were 22,755,600 shares available for future grants under the stock incentive plan.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) provides our participating employees an opportunity to obtain
shares of our common stock at a discount (through payroll deductions over three-month periods). At
December 31, 2017, 8,681,600 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the ESPP provisions.
During 2017 and 2016, the Company recognized $9 million and $8 million, respectively, of compensation
expense for each year related to the ESPP.

Stock Option, SAR, RSU and PSU Activity

The fair value of each stock option and SAR award is estimated on the grant date, using valuation models
and the weighted average assumptions indicated in the following table. Awards under our stock incentive plan
generally vest based on continued employment (“Time Stock Options and SARs” and “Time RSUs”) and based
upon continued employment and the achievement of certain financial targets (“Performance Stock Options and
SARs”, “Performance RSUs” and “PSUs”). PSUs have a three-year cumulative earnings per share target, and the
number of PSUs earned can vary from zero (for actual performance of less than 80% of target) to two times the
original PSU grant (for actual performance of 120% or more of target). Each grant is valued as a single award
with an expected term equal to the average expected term of the component vesting tranches. We use historical
exercise behavior data and other factors to estimate the expected term of the options and SARs. The expected
term of the share-based award is limited by the contractual term, and employee post-vesting termination behavior
is incorporated in the historical exercise behavior data.

Compensation cost is recognized on the straight-line attribution method. The straight-line attribution method
requires that total compensation expense recognized must at least equal the vested portion of the grant-date fair
value. The expected volatility is derived using historical stock price information for our common stock and the
volatility implied by the trading of options to purchase our stock on open-market exchanges. The risk-free
interest rate is the approximate yield on United States Treasury Strips having a life equal to the expected share-
based award life on the date of grant. The expected life is an estimate of the number of years a share-based award
will be held before it is exercised.

NOTE 3 — ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

During 2017, we paid $1.000 billion to acquire eight hospital facilities and $212 million to acquire
nonhospital health care entities. During 2016, we paid $343 million to acquire three hospital facilities and
$233 million to acquire nonhospital health care entities. During 2015, we paid $15 million to acquire a hospital
and $336 million to acquire nonhospital health care entities. Purchase price amounts have been allocated to the
related assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values. The purchase price paid in
excess of the fair value of identifiable net assets of these acquired entities aggregated $693 million, $41 million
and $323 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts and operations of the acquired entities subsequent to the respective acquisition dates. The pro forma
effects of these acquired entities on our results of operations for periods prior to the respective acquisition dates
were not significant.

During 2017, we received proceeds of $25 million and recognized a net pretax gain of $8 million
($5 million after tax) related to sales of real estate and other investments. During 2016, we received proceeds of
$26 million and recognized a net pretax gain of $23 million ($19 million after tax) related to sales of real estate
and other investments. During 2015, we received proceeds of $73 million and recognized a net pretax loss of
$5 million ($3 million after tax) related to the sale of a hospital facility and sales of real estate and other
investments.

Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 included an increase of $301 million
related to the estimated impact of tax rate changes under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) on our
deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2017 and
2016 also included tax benefits of $82 million and $162 million, respectively, related to the settlement of
employee equity awards. The provision for income taxes reflects $14 million and $15 million of reductions in
interest expense (net of tax) and $7 million of interest expense (net of tax) for the years ended December 31,
2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During 2016, the IRS completed its examination of our 2011 and 2012 tax
years, resolving all outstanding federal tax issues. We reduced our provision for income taxes for the year ended
December 31, 2016 by $51 million, including interest (net of tax), as a result of this resolution. Our foreign
pretax income was $91 million, $149 million and $178 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and
2015, respectively.

The Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act significantly revises U.S. corporate income
taxes, including lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018 and imposing a
mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed foreign earnings. Due to the complexity and uncertainty
regarding numerous provisions of the Tax Act, we have not completed our accounting for its effects. However,
we have made reasonable estimates and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of December
31, 2017.

A provisional amount of $301 million related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities,
primarily based on the lower tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, was recorded as a
component of our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017.

We also reclassified a provisional amount of $127 million from our deferred tax liabilities for the one-time
transition tax, based on our estimated undistributed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits. Because we had
previously recorded U.S. taxes on these earnings, the transition tax liability, which is payable over an 8-year
period, did not affect our 2017 provision for income taxes.

As we complete our analysis of the Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional
guidance issued by federal and state taxing authorities or other standard-setting bodies, we may make
adjustments to the provisional amounts and record additional amounts for those federal, state, and foreign tax
assets and liabilities for which we were unable to make reasonable estimates as of December 31, 2017. Any
adjustments or additional amounts recorded may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective
tax rate in the periods in which they are made.

NOTE 4 — INCOME TAXES (continued)

We are subject to examination by the IRS for tax years 2014 and later as well as by state and foreign taxing
authorities. Depending on the resolution of any federal, state and foreign tax disputes, the completion of
examinations by federal, state or foreign taxing authorities, or the expiration of statutes of limitation for specific
taxing jurisdictions, we believe it is reasonably possible that our liability for unrecognized tax benefits may
significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months. However, we are currently unable to estimate the
range of any possible change.

NOTE 5 — EARNINGS PER SHARE

We compute basic earnings per share using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
We compute diluted earnings per share using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus
the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, SARs, RSUs and PSUs, computed using the treasury stock
method. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we repurchased 25.092 million shares, 36.325 million shares and
31.991 million shares, respectively, of our common stock. The following table sets forth the computations of

NOTE 7 — FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Interest Rate Swap Agreements

We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
These swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties
based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively
convert variable rate obligations to fixed interest rate obligations. The interest payments under these agreements
are settled on a net basis. The net interest payments, based on the notional amounts in these agreements,
generally match the timing of the related liabilities, for the interest rate swap agreements which have been
designated as cash flow hedges. The notional amounts of the swap agreements represent amounts used to
calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities. Our credit risk related to these
agreements is considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions.

NOTE 8 — ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE

Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”)
emphasizes fair value is a market-based measurement, and fair value measurements should be determined based
on the assumptions market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities. ASC 820 utilizes a fair value
hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources
independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the
reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within
Level 3 of the hierarchy).

Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2
inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets,
as well as inputs observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign
exchange rates, and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable
inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity’s own assumptions, as there is little, if any,
related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs
from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair
value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input significant to the fair value measurement in its
entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety
requires judgment.

F-23

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

NOTE 8 — ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE (continued)

Cash Traded Investments

Our cash traded investments are generally classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy
because they are valued using quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources
with reasonable levels of price transparency. Certain types of cash traded instruments are classified within
Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because they trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price
transparency. The valuation of these securities involves the consideration of market factors and management’s
judgment.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
including
The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques,
discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual
terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including
interest rate curves and implied volatilities. We incorporate credit valuation adjustments to reflect both our own
nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of
these instruments.

Although we determined the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within Level 2 of the
fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such
as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties. We
assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our
derivative positions, and at December 31, 2017 and 2016, we determined the credit valuation adjustments were
not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives.

The following tables summarize our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of
in the fair value hierarchy within which those

The $6 million reduction in the Level 3 investments of our insurance subsidiaries during 2017 resulted from
settlements. The estimated fair value of our long-term debt was $34.689 billion and $32.833 billion at

aggregating $33.222 billion and $31.546 billion, respectively. The estimates of fair value are generally based
upon the quoted market prices or quoted market prices for similar issues of long-term debt with the same

NOTE 9 — LONG-TERM DEBT (continued)

2017 Activity

During June 2017, we issued $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.500% senior secured notes due
2047. We used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding the purchase of certain
hospital acquisitions, and the redemption, during July 2017, of all $500 million aggregate principal amount of
our existing 8.000% senior notes maturing in October 2018. The pretax loss on retirement of debt was
$39 million.

During June 2017, we amended our senior secured revolving credit facilities by (i) increasing the
commitments under the senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility to $3.750 billion, (ii) extending the
maturity date of the revolving credit commitments to June 28, 2022, (iii) amending the incremental facility
provisions to permit the incurrence of additional incremental credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of
$1.5 billion and (iv) providing that the commitment fee for unutilized commitments under the senior secured
asset-based revolving credit facility shall be 0.250% per annum.

Senior Secured Credit Facilities And Other Senior Secured Debt

We have entered into the following senior secured credit facilities: (i) a $3.750 billion asset-based revolving
credit facility maturing on June 28, 2022 with a borrowing base of 85% of eligible accounts receivable, subject to
customary reserves and eligibility criteria ($3.680 billion outstanding at December 31, 2017) (the “ABL credit
facility”); (ii) a $2.000 billion senior secured revolving credit facility maturing on June 28, 2022 (none
outstanding at December 31, 2017 without giving effect
to certain outstanding letters of credit); (iii) a
$1.225 billion senior secured term loan A-5 facility maturing on June 10, 2020; (iv) a $1.188 billion senior
secured term loan B-8 facility maturing on February 15, 2024; and (v) a $1.478 billion senior secured term loan
B-9 facility maturing on March 18, 2023. We refer to the facilities described under (ii) through (v) above,
collectively, as the “cash flow credit facility” and, together with the ABL credit facility, the “senior secured
credit facilities.”

Borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (a) a
base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (2) the prime rate of
Bank of America or (b) a LIBOR rate for the currency of such borrowing for the relevant interest period, plus, in
each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin for borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities
may be reduced subject to attaining certain leverage ratios.

The senior secured credit facilities contain a number of covenants that restrict, subject to certain exceptions,
indebtedness, repay subordinated
our (and some or all of our subsidiaries’) ability to incur additional
indebtedness, create liens on assets, sell assets, make investments,
loans or advances, engage in certain
transactions with affiliates, pay dividends and distributions, and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In
addition, we are required to satisfy and maintain a maximum total leverage ratio covenant under the cash flow
credit facility and, in certain situations under the ABL credit facility, a minimum interest coverage ratio
covenant.

Senior secured notes consists of (i) $3.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.50% first lien notes due
2020; (ii) $1.350 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.875% first lien notes due 2022; (iii) $1.250 billion
aggregate principal amount of 4.75% first lien notes due 2023; (iv) $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of
3.75% first lien notes due 2019; (v) $2.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.00% first lien notes due 2024;
(vi) $600 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% first lien notes due 2019; (vii) $1.400 billion aggregate

principal amount of 5.25% first lien notes due 2025; (viii) $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.25%
first lien notes due 2026; (ix) $1.200 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.50% first lien notes due 2027; and
(x) $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.50% first lien notes due 2047. Capital leases and other secured
debt totaled $599 million at December 31, 2017.

We use interest rate swap agreements to manage the variable rate exposure of our debt portfolio. At
December 31, 2017, we had entered into effective interest rate swap agreements, in a total notional amount of
$2.500 billion, in order to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable rate interest payments associated with the
senior secured credit facilities. The effect of the interest rate swaps is reflected in the effective interest rates for
the senior secured credit facilities.

Senior Unsecured Notes

Senior unsecured notes consist of (i) $7.891 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes with
maturities ranging from 2022 to 2033; (ii) an aggregate principal amount of $125 million medium-term notes
maturing 2025; (iii) an aggregate principal amount of $736 million debentures with maturities ranging from 2023
to 2095; and (iv) an aggregate principal amount of $1.000 billion senior notes due 2021.

General Debt Information

The senior secured credit facilities and senior secured notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by
substantially all existing and future, direct and indirect, 100% owned material domestic subsidiaries that are
“Unrestricted Subsidiaries” under our Indenture (the “1993 Indenture”) dated December 16, 1993 (except for
certain special purpose subsidiaries that only guarantee and pledge their assets under our ABL credit facility).

All obligations under the ABL credit facility, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to
permitted liens and other exceptions, by a first-priority lien on substantially all of the receivables of the
borrowers and each guarantor under such ABL credit facility (the “Receivables Collateral”).

All obligations under the cash flow credit facility and the guarantees of such obligations are secured, subject

to permitted liens and other exceptions, by:

•

•

a first-priority lien on the capital stock owned by HCA Inc., or by any U.S. guarantor, in each of their
respective first-tier subsidiaries;

a first-priority lien on substantially all present and future assets of HCA Inc. and of each U.S. guarantor
other than (i) “Principal Properties” (as defined in the 1993 Indenture), (ii) certain other real properties
and (iii) deposit accounts, other bank or securities accounts, cash, leaseholds, motor-vehicles and
certain other exceptions; and

•

a second-priority lien on certain of the Receivables Collateral.

Our senior secured notes and the related guarantees are secured by first-priority liens, subject to permitted
liens, on our and our subsidiary guarantors’ assets, subject to certain exceptions, that secure our cash flow credit
facility on a first-priority basis and are secured by second-priority liens, subject to permitted liens, on our and our
subsidiary guarantors’ assets that secure our ABL credit facility on a first-priority basis and our other cash flow
credit facility on a second-priority basis.

NOTE 9 — LONG-TERM DEBT (continued)

General Debt Information (continued)

Maturities of long-term debt in years 2019 through 2022, excluding amounts under the ABL credit facility,

are $2.284 billion, $4.177 billion, $1.078 billion and $3.449 billion, respectively.

NOTE 10 — CONTINGENCIES

We operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry. As a result, various lawsuits, claims and legal and
regulatory proceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or asserted against us. We are also subject
to claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims for personal injuries or wrongful
restriction of, or interference with, physicians’ staff privileges. In certain of these actions the claimants may seek
punitive damages against us which may not be covered by insurance. We are also subject to claims by various
taxing authorities for additional taxes and related interest and penalties. The resolution of any such lawsuits,
claims or legal and regulatory proceedings could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations,
financial position or liquidity.

Government Investigations, Claims and Litigation

Health care companies are subject to numerous investigations by various governmental agencies. Under the
federal False Claims Act (“FCA”), private parties have the right to bring qui tam, or “whistleblower,” suits
against companies that submit false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments from, the
government. Some states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. Certain of our
individual facilities have received, and from time to time, other facilities may receive, government inquiries
from, and may be subject to investigation by, federal and state agencies. Depending on whether the underlying
conduct in these or future inquiries or investigations could be considered systemic, their resolution could have a
material, adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

NOTE 11 — LEASES

We lease medical office buildings and certain equipment under operating lease agreements. Commitments
relating to noncancellable operating leases for each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows (dollars in

NOTE 13 — EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

We maintain defined contribution benefit plans that are available to employees who meet certain minimum
requirements. Certain of the plans require that we match specified percentages of participant contributions up to
certain maximum levels (generally, 100% of the first 3% to 9%, depending upon years of vesting service, of
compensation deferred by participants). The cost of these plans totaled $471 million for 2017, $444 million for
2016 and $432 million for 2015. Our contributions have been funded periodically during each year.

We maintain the noncontributory, nonqualified Restoration Plan to provide certain retirement benefits for
eligible employees. Eligibility for the Restoration Plan is based upon earning eligible compensation in excess of
the Social Security Wage Base and attaining 1,000 or more hours of service during the plan year. Company
credits to participants’ account balances (the Restoration Plan is not funded) depend upon participants’

compensation, years of vesting service and certain IRS limitations related to the HCA 401(k) plan. Benefits
expense under this plan was $40 million for 2017, $20 million for 2016 and $20 million for 2015. Accrued
benefits liabilities under this plan totaled $201 million at December 31, 2017 and $175 million at December 31,
2016.

We maintain a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”) for certain executives (the SERP is not
funded). The plan is designed to ensure that upon retirement the participant receives the value of a prescribed life
annuity from the combination of the SERP and our other benefit plans. Benefits expense under the plan was
$28 million for 2017, $22 million for 2016 and $33 million for 2015. Accrued benefits liabilities under this plan
totaled $223 million at December 31, 2017 and $222 million at December 31, 2016.

We maintain defined benefit pension plans which resulted from certain hospital acquisitions in prior years.
Benefits expense under these plans was $14 million for 2017, $21 million for 2016, and $25 million for 2015.
Accrued benefits liabilities under these plans totaled $118 million at December 31, 2017 and $111 million at

NOTE 14 — SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION (continued)

Adjusted segment EBITDA is defined as income before depreciation and amortization, interest expense,
losses (gains) on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt, legal claim costs (benefits), income taxes and net
income attributable to noncontrolling interests. We use adjusted segment EBITDA as an analytical indicator for
purposes of allocating resources to geographic areas and assessing their performance. Adjusted segment
EBITDA is commonly used as an analytical indicator within the health care industry, and also serves as a
measure of leverage capacity and debt service ability. Adjusted segment EBITDA should not be considered as a
measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles, and the items excluded from
adjusted segment EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance.
Because adjusted segment EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, adjusted segment EBITDA, as presented,
may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The geographic distributions of our
revenues, equity in earnings of affiliates, adjusted segment EBITDA, depreciation and amortization, assets and
goodwill and other intangible assets are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 17 — SUPPLEMENTAL CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND
OTHER COLLATERAL-RELATED INFORMATION (continued)

The above supplemental condensed consolidating financial information as of December 31, 2016, and for
the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, has been adjusted to properly record the impact of certain
subsidiaries that were non-guarantors becoming guarantors, primarily related to the Company acquiring previous
noncontrolling interests of non-guarantor subsidiaries that then became guarantor subsidiaries. We believe the
impact of these adjustments was immaterial as they had no impact to our consolidated income statements,
balance sheets or statements of cash flows, had no impact on any liquidity measures of the Company, nor did
they impact any financial ratios based on our consolidated balance sheets or income statements. There was also
no impact to our loan covenant reporting or compliance. The impact of the adjustments was limited to
reclassifications between the Subsidiary Guarantors and Subsidiary Non-Guarantors columns of the condensed
consolidating financial statements. The application of these adjustments to the consolidating information for
2016 and 2015 is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):

Healthtrust, Inc. — The Hospital Company (“Healthtrust”) is the first-tier subsidiary of HCA Inc. The
common stock of Healthtrust has been pledged as collateral for the senior secured credit facilities and senior
secured notes described in Note 9. Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act requires the filing of
separate financial statements for any affiliate of the registrant whose securities constitute a substantial portion of
the collateral for any class of securities registered or being registered. We believe the separate financial
statements requirement applies to Healthtrust due to the pledge of its common stock as collateral for the senior
secured notes. Due to the corporate structure relationship of HCA and Healthtrust, HCA’s operating subsidiaries
are also the operating subsidiaries of Healthtrust. The corporate structure relationship, combined with the
application of push-down accounting in Healthtrust’s consolidated financial statements related to HCA’s debt
and financial instruments, results in the consolidated financial statements of Healthtrust being substantially
identical to the consolidated financial statements of HCA. The consolidated financial statements of HCA and
Healthtrust present
total
stockholders’ deficit, net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash
used in financing activities. Certain individual line items in the HCA consolidated statements of stockholders’
deficit are combined into one line item in the Healthtrust consolidated statements of stockholder’s deficit.
