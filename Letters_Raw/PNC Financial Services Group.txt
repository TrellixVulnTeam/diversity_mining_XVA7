SOME
DAY 
STARTS 
TODAY

We all have hopes and dreams. Someday I’ll buy that car or 
that house. Someday we’ll start a family. Someday the kids 
will go to college. Someday we’ll open a small business … 
or grow a small business into a big one. Someday we’ll have 
enough to retire, to travel the world, to really enjoy life.

The difference between those who just dream about someday 
and those who actually achieve their dreams is in what they 
choose to do today.

At PNC, we work to understand our customers’ dreams, to 
help them turn their dreams into plans, and to walk alongside 
them through every stage of life. We’re there when they need 
us, and we’re there when they begin to think about what they 
might need down the road. Because, no matter where our 
customers are or how big their dreams may be, the journey 
to SOMEDAY STARTS TODAY.

law in December. We recognized an 
income tax beneﬁ t of $1.2 billion, 
primarily attributable to the revaluation 
of deferred tax liabilities at the lower 
statutory tax rate. 

Even without the tax beneﬁ t, our 

underlying business performance was 
strong in 2017. We grew loans by 
$9.6 billion, or 5 percent, and deposits 
by $7.9 billion, or 3 percent. We added 
customers across our businesses. And 
total revenue increased $1.2 billion, 
or 8 percent, driven by the growth in 
net interest income as well as record 
fee income for the year, which grew 
7 percent over 2016. 

Expenses were up year over year 

in 2017, reﬂ ecting more business 
activity and ongoing investments 
in our businesses. However, they 
increased less than revenues, and we 
were able to achieve positive operating 
leverage as a result. As we begin 2018, 
we remain focused on disciplined 
expense management throughout 
the organization. 

THE BENEFITS OF TAX REFORM
The tax legislation enacted in 
December gives us increased ﬂ exibility 
as we continue to invest in our 
businesses, people and communities.

Upon news that the legislation 
had been signed by the president, 
PNC announced a number of 
important investments. 

DEAR 
SHAREHOLDER,

PNC had a successful year 
in 2017. We grew revenue, 
loans and deposits, and 
we deepened relationships 
with our customers as 
we helped them achieve 
their ﬁ nancial goals. 
We enhanced our product 
and service offerings, 
maintained our risk 
proﬁ le, and executed on 
our strategic priorities. 

For the full year, PNC reported record 
net income of $5.4 billion, or $10.36 per 
diluted common share. Our return on 
average assets was 1.45 percent, and 
our return on average common equity 
was 12.09 percent.

As an industry, we began 2017 with 

hopes for an improving interest rate 
environment, along with regulatory and 
tax reform. We did see three interest 
rate increases, which helped to lift 
PNC’s net interest income by 9 percent 
for the year despite a ﬂ attening yield 
curve and rates that are still low by 
historical standards. Our net interest 
margin increased meaningfully by 14 
basis points to 2.87 percent in 2017.

Our results beneﬁ ted from new 
federal tax legislation signed into

CAPITAL RETURNED 
TO SHAREHOLDERS

We continued to invest in our 

employees by providing a $1,500 credit 
to the pension accounts of employees 
who participate in the PNC pension 
plan. Additionally, for about 90 percent 
of our approximately 53,000 employees, 
we announced a one-time cash 
payment of $1,000. We also announced 
plans to raise our minimum hourly 
pay rate to $15 for eligible employees 
by the end of 2018. Collectively, our 
investment in the careers of our lower-
paid employees has reduced turnover 
substantially over the last year. We 
believe employee engagement and 
retention are key to delivering 
a superior customer experience.

For our communities, we made a 
$200 million contribution to the PNC 
Foundation, which oversees our work 
on early childhood education as well 
as our support for other important 
causes that help our communities 
thrive, including the arts, culture and 
our partnership with United Way.

RETURNING CAPITAL AND 
CREATING LONG-TERM VALUE 
FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS
Shareholders’ equity increased 
4 percent to $47.5 billion at year 
end 2017 compared with 2016, 
and our strong capital position gives 
us ﬂ exibility going forward. Share 
repurchases totaled 18.6 million 
common shares for $2.3 billion, 
and we paid $1.3 billion in common 

stock dividends, including raising the 
quarterly dividend on our common 
stock to 75 cents per share in the 
third quarter. 

PNC continued to grow tangible book 

value in 2017 to $72.28 per common 
share as of December 31, an increase 
of 7 percent over the prior year.

And, PNC stock reached an all-

time-high share price in 2017. As of 
December 31, 2017, PNC’s ﬁ ve-year 
annualized total shareholder return 
was 23 percent. 

MUCH TO CELEBRATE HEADING 
INTO 2018
By virtually all measures, 2017 was 
a good year for PNC. Beyond the 
ﬁ nancials, we received a ﬁ rst-place 
ranking in the J.D. Power 2017 National 
Bank Satisfaction Study, which 
provides a comprehensive view of retail 
customer experiences with all bank 
product lines and channels at the six 
largest national banks.  

We earned the No. 2 ranking among 

superregional banks on FORTUNE 
magazine’s list of the Most Admired 
Companies for 2018. 

And, PNC received a number of 

awards throughout 2017 for the work 
we’ve done to build a talent culture 
deﬁ ned by our values and focused on 
assembling high-performing, diverse 
teams; establishing a welcoming and 
inclusive environment; and creating

career paths that offer every employee

BUT WE ARE NOT RESTING ON 
OUR LAURELS
We have delivered through time 
for our shareholders, customers, 
communities and employees because 
we are steadfastly committed to three 
things: doing right by the people we 
serve, building strong and lasting 
relationships, and working each day 
to be better at what we do. Those are 
simple concepts, really, but they require 
discipline. It takes knowing what we’re 
working toward, knowing how we’re 
going to get there and then executing 
with intense focus.  

At PNC, we are making progress on 
our three strategic priorities with a lot 
of near-term actions underway to help 
us achieve them:

4  | FROM THE CEO  |  MARCH 1, 2018

1. Expanding our leading banking 
franchise to new markets and digital 
platforms
In recent years, we have worked to 
build our business in the Southeast 
atop the retail branch network we 
acquired from RBC Bank (USA) in 
2012 and using the Regional Presidents 
model that has been so successful 
for PNC in the markets where we’ve 
operated for decades. We continue 
to be pleased with the growth of our 
business across the Southeast, and 
we have learned important lessons 
about our ability to grow in markets 
where we do not have a robust retail 
branch presence.

Last year, that led our Corporate & 

Institutional Bank (C&IB) to expand our 
middle market banking business to 
three new markets — Dallas, Kansas 
City and Minneapolis — where our 
national businesses like Commercial 
Real Estate and Business Credit were 
operating with existing employees. 

As part of our multi-year expansion, 
we are working to build or grow 
relationships with best-in-class 
companies by proactively offering 
ideas that create value for them. We 
are now delivering our full suite of 
commercial products and services to 
new middle market and larger clients 
and embedding ourselves in those 
communities. And, based on our early 
success, we are now actively expanding 
our middle market franchise into 
Denver, Houston and Nashville.

Through time, we will evaluate the 

potential beneﬁ ts of opening retail 
branches in these markets. Studies 
have shown that the fastest-growing 
consumer segment is thin-branch-
ready, meaning they place importance 
on a branch but use it infrequently. 
Across our existing retail footprint, PNC 
has one of the country’s largest branch 
and ATM networks but, as customers 
have demonstrated their increasing 
preference for mobile and self-service 
channels, we have reduced our branch 
network by about 15 percent over the 
last ﬁ ve years. The expense savings 
we have generated have been 
reinvested in technology.  

Keeping our customers at the 

forefront of our thinking throughout 
this transformation effort has enabled 
us to retain 98 percent of households 
and 97 percent of deposits from closed 
branches, and customer satisfaction 
across our network remains high.

of consumer customers primarily 
digital vs. 35% ﬁ ve years ago

Keeping our customers 
at the forefront of our 
thinking throughout this 
transformation effort 
has enabled us to retain 
98 percent of households 
and 97 percent of deposits 
from closed branches, 
and customer satisfaction 
across our network 
remains high.

PNC RANKED

in the J.D. Power 2017 
National Bank Satisfaction Study

among superregional banks on 
FORTUNE magazine’s list of the 
Most Admired Companies for 2018

Our branches and the people in 

We are transitioning all of our lines 

them will always be an important part 
of our retail bank. But with more than 
60 percent of the 8 million consumer 
customers we serve now identiﬁ ed 
as primarily digital, the pace at which 
digital sales are growing signiﬁ es 
tremendous opportunity. So, as this 
year unfolds, you can expect to hear 
about our efforts to expand the reach of 
our retail bank nationally on a primarily 
digital platform. 

2. Deepening customer relationships 
by delivering a superior banking 
experience and ﬁ nancial solutions
When it comes to the experience — 
whether in the branch, over the phone, 
through our digital products and 
services, or in the ﬁ eld — customers 
expect us to make it easy. They want 
options that enable them to engage 
with us when, where and how they 
choose. They want the experience to 
be seamless, especially as they move 
across our channels.

We are making important 

investments in our relationships with 
our customers and how we serve them 
to make banking and investing easier. 
Across our lines of business, we are 
working to simplify our business model 
in ways that enable our employees 
to better focus on understanding our 
customers’ needs and exceeding 
their expectations. 

of business to a single customer 
relationship management platform that 
will make it easier for us to see and 
better service the whole relationship 
over time. We also are investing for 
constant improvement across our 
product and service offerings. 

In C&IB, for example, we announced 

the acquisitions in 2017 of ECN’s 
U.S.-based commercial and vendor 
ﬁ nance business, the Trout Group, and 
Fortis Advisors in order to bolster our 
existing capabilities. And, we launched 
new products and services, including 
real-time payments (RTP). RTP is 
enabling clients to conduct business 
with greater speed, efﬁ ciency and 
security as it makes everyday ﬁ nancial 
tasks such as paying bills, issuing 
invoices, making payroll or settling 
insurance claims faster, safer and 
more satisfying for businesses 
and consumers.

Within our Asset Management Group 

(AMG), we have real advantages by 
which to grow the business, including 
our retail and commercial customer 
base, a well-recognized brand, a 
solid record of risk management, and 
a broad product suite. As we enter 
2018, we are investing to offer more 
products and services, innovate, and 
— importantly — attract and retain 
the best talent, all for the purpose of 
delivering superior client experiences.

Inside our Retail Bank, we have 
focused signiﬁ cant efforts this past 
year on improving the quality of our 
credit product offerings. And, we 
have made terriﬁ c progress on our 
multi-year initiative to redesign the 
home lending process by combining 
mortgage and home equity lending on 
a common platform. Our new platform 
for mortgage originations and servicing 
is now up and running. 

Additionally, our services are more 

stable and more secure. The agile 
development approach we are adopting 
has resulted in about a one-third 
reduction in the time it takes to release 
a new product or enhancement, 
which is incredibly important given 
the increasing pace at which our 
customers are adopting digital 
products and services.

service we have ever launched.

3. Leveraging technology to innovate 
and enhance products, services, 
security and processes
Within Retail and beyond, we are 
meeting customers where they are and 
providing tools for how they want to 
bank through our investments in digital 
technologies. In recent years, we have 
made major investments to bolster our 
infrastructure. We have now reached 
a point at which these investments 
are beginning to power signiﬁ cant 
enhancements in the products and 
services our customers want.

Because of the work we have done 

to modernize our data centers and 
build a private cloud, we are now able 
to analyze data in ways we never could 
before. We are gaining important 
insight into how our customers use our 
products and services, which is helping 
us to better meet their ﬁ nancial needs, 
as well as their evolving service and 
digital experience expectations.

launched enhancements to our digital 
direct auto application process to make 
it simpler and to optimize it for mobile 
devices, and for the third and fourth 
quarters, 44 percent of all direct auto 
loan applications came through our 
digital channels. Similarly, credit card 
and installment loan applicants are 
coming to us online at an increasing 
pace. Customers continue to embrace 
e-statement, online bill pay and mobile 
deposit services. And, we recently 
launched a new version of our popular 
Virtual Wallet personal checking 
account app for online and mobile 
users that is simpler, faster and boasts 
smart new features.  

Our mobile offerings now include 

PNC Pay and Zelle, which are changing 
the way customers make payments 
in real time. PNC Pay is integrated in 
our mass market mobile application 
so that customers can use credit, 
debit or prepaid cards to make instant 
purchases more securely. And Zelle 

digital products and services require 
continual updating to enhance features 
for a better customer experience and to 
keep up with the latest best practices 
in cybersecurity and fraud prevention. 
We invest heavily in our cybersecurity 
efforts, most of which happen behind 
the scenes, but we also are making 
important investments in security 
and fraud prevention features such as 
multi-factor authentication, ﬁ ngerprint 
veriﬁ cation and facial recognition to 
help keep our customers’ sensitive 
ﬁ nancial information and assets safe 
and secure.

In 2018, we are leveraging application 

programming interfaces, known as 
APIs, to create consumable digital 
services by which PNC is extending 
its core business processes and data 
beyond the walls of a traditional bank 
to enhance the quality and value of our 
client interactions, expand our capacity 
for innovation internally and with 
partners, and explore opportunities

created by an evolving ecosystem to 
redeﬁ ne business models. And, we 
expect to further improve both the 
banking experience and the efﬁ ciency 
of our operations with investments 
in artiﬁ cial intelligence and robotics, 
which promise reduced instances of 
human error and greater speed of 
fulﬁ llment in service of our customers.

DOING RIGHT BY OUR PEOPLE AND 
DOING GOOD IN OUR COMMUNITIES
In addition to the steps we took on 
behalf of employees at the end of the 
year, throughout 2017 we continued 
to build on investments we have been 
making for a number of years to 
enhance beneﬁ ts and compensation 
in order to make PNC an employer 
of choice for top talent and to make 
managers throughout the organization 
more accountable not only for the 
performance of their teams, but also 
for the career development of the 
people they lead.

In September, I announced to 

employees that beginning this year 
PNC would introduce a $2,000 
minimum earnings credit to the PNC 
pension plan. We announced higher 
health savings account contributions 
to employees under certain income 
levels. We made the decision to absorb 
the rising cost of health insurance 
so that employees would see no 
increase in their per-pay healthcare 
premiums from 2017 to 2018. And, we 

increased vacation eligibility, expanded 
bereavement leave, and promoted 
additional ﬁ nancial education programs 
to help our employees achieve greater 
ﬁ nancial well-being.

In our communities, PNC played an 
important role above and beyond most 
years as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma 
caused billions of dollars in damages 
in markets that we serve and where we 
have both employees and customers. 
In response, PNC waived certain fees 
and contributed more than $900,000 in 
disaster relief, including matching gifts 
to encourage employee donations.

Across our markets, PNC provided 

more than $2.9 billion in ﬁ nancing that 
beneﬁ ted low- and moderate-income 
families and communities, including 
nearly $2 billion in community 
development loans. The PNC 
Foundation and PNC Bank provided 
$72 million in charitable giving and 
sponsorships, the majority 
of which supports education, the arts 
and economic development.

And our signature philanthropic 

effort, PNC Grow Up Great, continues 
to open doors and create paths to 
quality early childhood education. In 
2017, the PNC Foundation distributed 
$15.4 million in grants through 
Grow Up Great, and we launched 
an important partnership with 
DonorsChoose.org, funding hundreds 
of pre-K classroom requests as

Just a few weeks into 2018, PNC marked the 
beginning of an exciting new partnership as 
we announced our sponsorship of the No. 
9 Honda IndyCar, owned by Chip Ganassi 
Racing. Ganassi; IndyCar’s winningest active 
driver, Scott Dixon; PNC CEO Bill Demchak; 
and PNC Regional President Connie Bond 
Stuart were on hand at the Indianapolis 
Motor Speedway on February 6 to announce 
PNC’s ﬁ rst primary sponsorship on the 
IndyCar race circuit and to unveil the new 
design for the car. Throughout the 2018 
IndyCar season, Dixon will drive the No. 9 
car and wear PNC colors in 17 races across 
the country. He also will make appearances 
on behalf of PNC in many of our markets 
on the circuit. At the announcement, 
Dixon said that he is looking forward to 
representing the PNC brand, engaging with 
PNC clients and getting involved as an active 
partner with PNC Grow Up Great.

address some of the most pressing 
needs identiﬁ ed by early childhood 
education professionals. 

Additionally, PNC employees

community support in the 2017 PNC

SOMEDAY STARTS TODAY
We have a lot to be proud of as we look 
at what we accomplished in 2017, and 
we have much to be excited about as 
2018 begins. For the ﬁ rst time in a long 
time, as an industry we are operating in 
an environment with wind in our sails. 
The economy is strong, and conﬁ dence 
remains high among both consumers 
and business leaders.

There are tremendous opportunities 

in front of us, and PNC is well-
positioned to grow and deepen 
relationships with our customers as 
a result of the investments we have 
been making in our business, products, 
services, communities and people.

We have signiﬁ cant challenges ahead 

as competition intensiﬁ es and as both 
technology and consumer behaviors 
continue to evolve.

I am excited about the team I have 

the privilege to lead, the things we will 
accomplish together in the year ahead 
and all of the “someday” dreams we 
will help our customers achieve.
I’d like to thank the employees 
who worked so hard on behalf of 
our customers, communities and 
— ultimately — our shareholders in 
2017. I’d like to also thank our board of 
directors and the members of the PNC 
Executive Committee for their vision 
and leadership. And to that end, I’d like 
to acknowledge four retiring members 
of our board — Kay Coles James, Jane 
Pepper, Lorene Steffes and Dennis 
Strigl — along with Orlando Esposito,

ITEM 1 – BUSINESS

Business Overview
Headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, we are one of the 
largest diversified financial services companies in the United 
States. We have businesses engaged in retail banking, 
including residential mortgage, corporate and institutional 
banking and asset management, providing many of our 
products and services nationally. Our primary geographic 
markets are located in 19 states in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest 
and Southeast. We also provide certain products and services 
internationally. At December 31, 2017, our consolidated total 
assets, total deposits and total shareholders’ equity were 
$380.8 billion, $265.1 billion and $47.5 billion, respectively.

We were incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania in 1983 with the consolidation of Pittsburgh 
National Corporation and Provident National Corporation. 
Since 1983, we have diversified our geographical presence, 
business mix and product capabilities through internal growth, 
strategic bank and non-bank acquisitions and equity 
investments, and the formation of various non-banking 
subsidiaries.

Review of Business Segments
In addition to the following information relating to our 
businesses, we incorporate the information under the caption 
Business Segments Review in Item 7 of this Report here by 
reference. Also, we include the financial and other information 
by business in Note 22 Segment Reporting in the Notes To 
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report 
here by reference.

Effective for the first quarter of 2017, as a result of changes to 
how we manage our businesses, we realigned our segments 
and, accordingly, changed the basis of presentation of our 
segments, resulting in four reportable business segments:

•  Retail Banking
•  Corporate & Institutional Banking
•  Asset Management Group
•  BlackRock

See the Business Segments Review section in Item 7 for 
additional detail on our first quarter 2017 change.

Assets, revenue and earnings attributable to foreign activities 
were not material in the periods presented. We periodically 
refine our internal methodologies as management reporting 
practices are enhanced. To the extent significant and 
practicable, retrospective application of new methodologies is 
made to prior period reportable business segment results and 
disclosures to create comparability with the current period. 
See Note 22 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated 
Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for information 
on adjustments made in the first quarter of 2017 to our internal 
funds transfer pricing methodology.

Retail Banking provides deposit, lending, brokerage, 
insurance services, investment management and cash 
management products and services to consumer and small 
business customers within our primary geographic markets. 
Our customers are serviced through our branch network, 
ATMs, call centers, online banking and mobile channels. The 
branch network is located primarily in Pennsylvania, Ohio, 
New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois, Maryland, Indiana, Florida, 
North Carolina, Kentucky, Washington, D.C., Delaware,

Carolina. Deposit products include checking, savings and 
money market accounts and certificates of deposit. Lending 
products include residential mortgages, home equity loans and 
lines of credit, auto loans, credit cards, education loans and 
personal and small business loans and lines of credit. The 
residential mortgage loans are directly originated within our 
branch network and nationwide, and are typically underwritten 
to government agency and/or third-party standards, and either 
sold, servicing retained, or held on our balance sheet. 
Brokerage, investment management and cash management 
products and services include managed, education, retirement 
and trust accounts.

Supervision and Regulation
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. is a bank holding 
company (BHC) registered under the Bank Holding Company 
Act of 1956 (BHC Act) and a financial holding company 
under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act).

We are subject to numerous governmental regulations, some 
of which are highlighted below. See Note 18 Regulatory 
Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in 
Item 8 of this Report for additional information regarding our 
regulatory matters. Applicable laws and regulations restrict 
our permissible activities and investments, impose conditions 
and requirements on the products and services we offer and 
the manner in which they are offered and sold, and require 
compliance with protections for loan, deposit, brokerage, 
fiduciary, investment management and other customers, 
among other things. They also restrict our ability to repurchase 
stock or pay dividends, or to receive dividends from our bank 
subsidiary, and impose capital adequacy and liquidity 
requirements. The consequences of noncompliance with these, 
or other applicable laws or regulations, can include substantial 
monetary and nonmonetary sanctions.

In addition, we are subject to comprehensive supervision and 
periodic examination by, among other regulatory bodies, the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal 
Reserve) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
(OCC). These examinations consider not only compliance 
with applicable laws, regulations and supervisory policies of 
the agency, but also capital levels, asset quality, risk 
management effectiveness, the ability and performance of 
management and the board of directors, the effectiveness of 
internal controls, earnings, liquidity and various other factors. 

The results of examination activity by any of our federal bank 
regulators potentially can result in the imposition of 
significant limitations on our activities and growth. These 
regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose 
restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated 
entity and take enforcement action, including the imposition of 
substantial monetary penalties and nonmonetary requirements, 
against a regulated entity where the relevant agency 
determines, among other things, that such operations fail to 
comply with applicable law or regulations or are conducted in 
an unsafe or unsound manner. This supervisory framework, 
including the examination reports and supervisory ratings 
(which are not publicly available) of the agencies, could 
materially impact the conduct, growth and profitability of our 
operations.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is 
responsible for examining PNC Bank and its affiliates 
(including PNC) for compliance with most federal consumer 
financial protection laws, including the laws relating to fair 
lending and prohibiting unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or 
practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of 
consumer financial products or services, and for enforcing 
such laws with respect to PNC Bank and its affiliates. The 
results of the CFPB’s examinations (which are not publicly 
available) also can result in restrictions or limitations on the 
operations of a regulated entity as well as enforcement actions 
against a regulated entity, including the imposition of 
substantial monetary penalties and nonmonetary requirements.

We also are subject to regulation by the SEC by virtue of our 
status as a public company and by the SEC and the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) due to the 
nature of some of our businesses. Our businesses with 
operations outside the United States are also subject to 
regulation by appropriate authorities in the foreign 
jurisdictions in which they do business.

As a regulated financial services firm, our relationships and 
good standing with regulators are of fundamental importance 
to the operation and growth of our businesses. The Federal 
Reserve, OCC, CFPB, SEC, CFTC and other domestic and 
foreign regulators have broad enforcement powers, and certain 
of the regulators have the power to approve, deny, or refuse to 
act upon our applications or notices to conduct new activities, 
acquire or divest businesses, assets or deposits, or reconfigure 
existing operations.

Among the areas that have been receiving a high level of 
regulatory focus are compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act 
and anti-money laundering laws, capital and liquidity 
management, fair lending and other consumer protection 
issues, including retail sales practices, fee assessment and 
collection, cyber-security, capital planning and stress testing, 
the oversight of arrangements with third-party vendors and 
suppliers, the protection of confidential customer information, 
and the structure and effectiveness of enterprise risk 
management frameworks.

New legislation, changes in rules promulgated by federal 
financial regulators, other federal and state regulatory 
authorities and self-regulatory organizations, or changes in the 
interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, may 
directly affect the method of operation and profitability of our 
businesses. We anticipate new legislative and regulatory 
initiatives over the next several years, focused specifically on 
banking and other financial services in which we are engaged. 
Legislative and regulatory developments to date, as well as 
those that come in the future, have had and are likely to 
continue to have an impact on the conduct of our business. 
The more detailed description of the significant regulations to 
which we are subject included in this Report is based on 
current laws and regulations and is subject to potentially 
material change. See also the additional information included 
as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Report discussing the 
impact of financial regulatory initiatives on the regulatory 
environment for us and the financial services industry, 
including ongoing implementation of Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) reforms.

The profitability of our businesses could also be affected by 
rules and regulations that impact the business and financial 
sectors in general, including changes to the laws governing 
taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, federal tax reform legislation, 
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was enacted and, among other 
provisions, lowered the statutory tax rate for corporations to 
21% from 35% effective January 1, 2018. PNC's consolidated 
financial statements for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 
reflect reasonable estimates of the impact of the tax legislation 
as of December 31, 2017, and the amounts could be adjusted 
during the measurement period, which will end in December 
2018. See the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments 
section in Item 7 of this Report for more detail.

There are numerous rules governing the regulation of financial 
services institutions and their holding companies. Accordingly, 
the following discussion is general in nature and does not 
purport to be complete or to describe all of the laws, 
regulations and supervisory policies that apply to us. To a 
substantial extent, the purpose of the regulation and 
supervision of financial services institutions and their holding 
companies is not to protect our shareholders and our non-
customer creditors, but rather to protect our customers 
(including depositors) and the financial markets and financial 
system in general.

Banking Regulation and Supervision
Regulatory Capital Requirements, Stress Testing and Capital 
Planning. PNC and PNC Bank are subject to the regulatory 
capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve and 
the OCC, respectively. The foundation of the agencies’ 
regulatory capital rules is the international regulatory capital 
framework developed by the Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision (Basel Committee), the international body 
responsible for developing global regulatory standards for 
banking organizations for consideration and adoption by 
national jurisdictions. The regulatory capital rules establish 
minimum requirements for the ratio of a banking 
organization’s regulatory capital to its risk-weighted assets, 
referred to as risk-based capital requirements, as well as for 
the ratio of its regulatory capital to measures of assets and 
other exposures, referred to as leverage capital requirements. 
The agencies’ regulatory capital rules have undergone 
significant change since 2013, when the agencies adopted final 
rules to implement changes to the Basel Committee's 
international regulatory capital framework, known as “Basel 
III”, as well as certain provisions of Dodd-Frank. Many 
provisions of these rules, referred to as the Basel III capital 
rules, are subject to multi-year phase-in periods, with the rules 
generally fully phased-in as of January 1, 2019. Certain 
provisions (described below) of these rules apply only to 
banking organizations that have $250 billion or more in total 
consolidated assets (such as PNC and PNC Bank) or that have 
$10 billion or more in on-balance sheet foreign exposure 
(referred to as advanced approaches banking organizations).

The regulatory capital rules generally divide regulatory capital 
into three components: common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital, 
additional Tier 1 capital (which, together with CET1 capital, 
comprises Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. CET1 capital is 
generally common stock, retained earnings, qualifying 
minority interest and, for PNC and PNC Bank as advanced 
approaches banking organizations, accumulated other 
comprehensive income related to both available for sale 
securities and pension and other post-retirement plans, less the 
deductions required to be made from CET1 capital. Additional 
Tier 1 capital generally includes, among other things, 
perpetual preferred stock and qualifying minority interests, 
less the deductions required to be made from additional Tier 1 
capital. Tier 2 capital generally comprises qualifying 
subordinated debt, less any required deductions from Tier 2 
capital. There are significant limits on the extent to which 
minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries (including 
minority interests in the form of REIT preferred securities) 
may be included in regulatory capital. 

Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, less 
the deductions required from total capital. Significant common 
stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, as 
well as mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets, must 
be deducted from CET1 regulatory capital (subject to a phase-
in schedule and net of associated deferred tax liabilities) to the 
extent such items individually exceed 10%, or in the aggregate 
exceed 15%, of our adjusted Basel III CET1 regulatory 
capital. Our common stock investment in BlackRock is treated 

as a significant common stock investment in an 
unconsolidated financial institution for these purposes.

The regulatory capital rules include a standardized approach 
for determining a banking organization’s risk-weighted assets 
for purposes of calculating the risk-based capital ratios. To 
determine risk-weighted assets under the standardized 
approach, a banking organization must allocate its assets and 
specified off-balance sheet financial exposures and 
instruments into risk-weighted categories. The standardized 
approach for risk-weighted assets takes into account credit and 
market risk. To calculate risk-weighted assets under the 
standardized approach for credit risk, the nominal dollar 
amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance 
sheet items are generally multiplied by risk weights set forth 
in the rules, which increase as the perceived credit risk of the 
relevant asset or exposure increases. For certain types of 
exposures, such as securitization exposures, the standardized 
approach establishes one or more methodologies that are to be 
used to calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for the 
exposure. High volatility commercial real estate, past due, 
securitization and equity exposures, as well as investments in 
unconsolidated financial institutions, mortgage servicing 
rights and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from 
capital are generally subject to higher risk weights than other 
types of exposures.

Advanced approaches banking organizations (such as PNC 
and PNC Bank) are also required to calculate risk-weighted 
assets using a separate methodology, referred to as the 
advanced approaches, that is based on the Basel II capital 
framework. The Basel II framework, seeks to provide more 
risk-sensitive regulatory capital calculations and promote 
enhanced risk management practices among large, 
internationally active banking organizations. Advanced 
approaches risk-weighted assets take into account credit, 
market and operational risk and rely to a significant extent on 
internal models. Prior to fully implementing the advanced 
approaches to calculate risk-weighted assets, PNC and PNC 
Bank must successfully complete a “parallel run” qualification 
phase. PNC and PNC Bank entered this parallel run 
qualification phase on January 1, 2013. As discussed further in 
Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report, the Basel Committee in 
2017 finalized additional, significant changes to the 
international capital framework for banking organizations.The 
extent to and manner in which these or similar changes would 
be implemented by the U.S. banking agencies, and the 
implications of any such developments on the U.S. regulatory 
capital framework (including the advanced approaches and the 
parallel run qualification period for PNC and PNC Bank) are 
not fully known at this time.

As a result of the phase-in period for provisions of the Basel 
III capital rules, as well as the fact that we remain in the 
parallel run qualification phase for the advanced approaches, 
our regulatory risk-based capital ratios in 2017 were based on 
the definitions of, and deductions from, regulatory capital (as 
such definitions and deductions were phased-in for 2017) and 
the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted 
assets. Until we have exited parallel run, our regulatory risk-

based capital ratios will be calculated using the standardized 
approach for determining risk-weighted assets, and the 
definitions of, and deductions from, capital (as such 
definitions and deductions are phased-in). Once we exit 
parallel run, our regulatory risk-based capital ratios will be the 
lower of the ratios calculated under the standardized approach 
and the advanced approaches. We refer to the capital ratios 
calculated using the phased-in Basel III provisions as the 
Transitional Basel III ratios. The Transitional Basel III 
regulatory capital ratios of PNC and PNC Bank as of 
December 31, 2017 exceeded the applicable minimum levels. 
For additional information regarding the Transitional Basel III 
capital ratios of PNC and PNC Bank as of December 31, 2017, 
as well as the levels needed to be considered “well 
capitalized”, see the Liquidity and Capital Management 
portion of the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this 
Report.

The risk-based capital rules establish certain minimum 
standards for the capital ratios of banking organizations, 
including PNC and PNC Bank. Banking organizations must 
maintain a minimum CET1 ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio 
of 6.0%, and a total capital ratio of 8.0%, in each case in 
relation to risk-weighted assets, to be considered “adequately 
capitalized.” Banking organizations also must maintain a 
capital conservation buffer requirement above the minimum 
risk-based capital ratio requirements in order to avoid 
limitations on capital distributions (including dividends and 
repurchases of any Tier 1 capital instrument, such as common 
and qualifying preferred stock) and certain discretionary 
incentive compensation payments. The capital conservation 
buffer requirement is subject to a multi-year phase-in period. 
For 2018, banking organizations (including PNC and PNC 
Bank) are required to maintain a risk-based CET1 capital ratio 
of at least 6.375%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 7.875%, and 
a total capital ratio of at least 9.875% to avoid limitations on 
capital distributions and certain discretionary incentive 
compensation payments. When fully phased-in on January 1, 
2019, banking organizations must maintain a CET1 capital 
ratio of at least 7.0%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8.5%, 
and a total capital ratio of at least 10.5%, in each case in 
relation to risk-weighted assets, to avoid limitations on capital 
distributions and certain discretionary incentive compensation 
payments.

For advanced approaches banking organizations (such as PNC 
and PNC Bank), these higher capital conservation buffer 
levels above the regulatory minimums could be supplemented 
by a countercyclical capital buffer based on U.S. credit 
exposures of up to an additional 2.5% of risk-weighted assets 
(once fully phased-in). This buffer is currently set at zero in 
the U.S. A 2016 Federal Reserve policy statement establishes 
the framework and factors the Federal Reserve would use in 
setting and adjusting the amount of the U.S. countercyclical 
capital buffer. Covered banking organizations would generally 
have 12 months after the announcement of any increase in the 
countercyclical capital buffer to meet the increased buffer 
requirement, unless the Federal Reserve determines to 
establish an earlier effective date. Under the phase-in schedule 
for the countercyclical capital buffer, the maximum potential 

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  5

countercyclical capital buffer amount is 1.875% in 2018 and 
2.5% in 2019 and thereafter. When fully phased-in and if the 
full countercyclical buffer amount is implemented, PNC and 
PNC Bank could be required to maintain a risk-based CET1 
capital ratio of at least 9.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 
11%, and a total capital ratio of at least 13% to avoid 
limitations on capital distributions and certain discretionary 
incentive compensation payments.

PNC and PNC Bank are not subject to the additional risk-
based CET1 capital surcharge, minimum long-term debt 
requirement, or minimum total loss-absorbing capacity 
(TLAC) requirement that applies to U.S. firms identified as 
globally systemically important banks (GSIBs).

The regulatory capital rules also require that banking 
organizations maintain a minimum amount of Tier 1 capital to 
average consolidated assets, referred to as the leverage ratio. 
Banking organizations are required to maintain a minimum 
leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets of 4.0%. As of 
December 31, 2017, the leverage ratios of PNC and PNC 
Bank were above the required minimum level.

Advanced approaches banking organizations (such as PNC 
and PNC Bank) also are subject to a minimum 3.0% 
supplementary leverage ratio that took effect on January 1, 
2018. The supplementary leverage ratio is calculated by 
dividing Tier 1 capital by total leverage exposure, which takes 
into account on-balance sheet assets as well as certain off-
balance sheet items, including loan commitments and potential 
future exposure under derivative contracts. BHCs with total 
consolidated assets of more than $700 billion or assets under 
custody of more than $10 trillion, as well as the insured 
depository institution subsidiaries of these BHCs, are subject 
to a higher supplementary leverage ratio requirement. These 
higher supplementary leverage requirements do not apply to 
PNC or PNC Bank.

Failure to meet applicable capital requirements could subject a 
banking organization to a variety of enforcement remedies 
available to the federal banking agencies, including a 
limitation on the ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares, 
the issuance of a capital directive to increase capital and, in 
severe cases, the termination of deposit insurance by the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the 
appointment of a conservator or receiver. In some cases, the 
extent of these powers depends upon whether the institution in 
question is considered “well capitalized,” “adequately 
capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly 
undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Generally, 
the smaller an institution’s capital base in relation to its risk-
weighted or total assets, the greater the scope and severity of 
the agencies’ powers. Business activities may also be affected 
by an institution’s capital classification. For example, as a 
financial holding company, PNC and PNC Bank must remain 
“well capitalized.” At December 31, 2017, PNC and PNC 
Bank exceeded the required ratios for classification as “well 
capitalized.” The thresholds at which an insured depository 
institution is considered “well capitalized,” “adequately 
capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly 

6    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized” are based on 
(i) the institution’s CET1, Tier 1 and total risk-based capital 
ratios; (ii) the institution’s leverage ratio; and (iii) for the 
definitions of “adequately capitalized” and “undercapitalized”, 
the institution’s supplementary leverage ratio. For additional 
discussion of capital adequacy requirements, see the Liquidity 
and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management 
section of Item 7 of this Report and to Note 18 Regulatory 
Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in 
Item 8 of this Report.

In addition to potential changes to the U.S. capital rules as a 
result of developments at the Basel Committee, the U.S. 
banking agencies also are undertaking a review of the 
regulatory capital rules. In September 2017, the banking 
agencies jointly requested public comment on a proposal that 
would implement certain changes to the Basel III regulatory 
capital rules. The proposal would reduce the risk weight (from 
150 percent to 130 percent) for high-volatility commercial real 
estate exposures under the standardized approach, while also 
making certain changes to the definition of such exposures and 
relabeling such exposures as either high-volatility acquisition, 
development or construction exposures. For non-advanced 
approaches banking organizations, the proposal also would 
modify the threshold deductions from CET1 regulatory capital 
for significant common stock investments in unconsolidated 
financial institutions, mortgage servicing rights and certain 
deferred tax assets. The public comment period on the 
proposal closed on December 26, 2017.

In addition to regulatory capital requirements, we are subject 
to the Federal Reserve’s capital plan rule, annual capital stress 
testing requirements and Comprehensive Capital Analysis and 
Review (CCAR) process, as well as the annual and mid-year 
Dodd-Frank capital stress testing (DFAST) requirements of 
the Federal Reserve (annual and mid-cycle) and the OCC 
(annual). As part of the CCAR process, the Federal Reserve 
undertakes a supervisory assessment of the capital planning 
process of BHCs, including PNC, that have $50 billion or 
more in total consolidated assets. For us, this capital planning 
assessment is based on a review of a comprehensive capital 
plan submitted to the Federal Reserve that describes the 
company’s planned capital actions, such as plans to pay or 
increase common stock dividends, reinstate or increase 
common stock repurchase programs, or issue or redeem 
preferred stock or other regulatory capital instruments, during 
the nine quarter review period, as well as the results of stress 
tests conducted by both the company and the Federal Reserve 
under different hypothetical macro-economic scenarios, 
including a supervisory adverse scenario and severely adverse 
scenario provided by the Federal Reserve. The Federal 
Reserve can object to our capital plan for qualitative or 
quantitative reasons. If the Federal Reserve objects to a BHC’s 
capital plan, the BHC cannot make capital distributions 
without Federal Reserve approval.

In evaluating capital plans of advanced approaches BHCs 
(such as PNC) or BHCs with $75 million or more in nonbank 
assets, the Federal Reserve considers a number of qualitative 
factors, which have become increasingly important in the 

CCAR process in recent years. The Federal Reserve’s 
supervisory expectations for the capital planning and stress 
testing processes at large and complex BHCs, including PNC, 
are heightened relative to smaller and less complex BHCs. In 
assessing a BHC’s capital planning and stress testing 
processes, the Federal Reserve considers whether the BHC has 
sound and effective governance to oversee these processes. 
The Federal Reserve’s evaluation focuses on whether a BHC’s 
capital planning and stress testing processes are supported by a 
strong risk management framework to identify, measure and 
assess material risks and that provides a strong foundation to 
capital planning. The Federal Reserve also considers the 
comprehensiveness of a BHC’s control framework and 
evaluates a BHC’s policy guidelines for capital planning and 
assessing capital adequacy. A BHC’s stress testing scenario 
design processes and approaches for estimating the impact of 
stress on its capital position, including stress testing models 
and non-model qualitative approaches, are comprehensively 
reviewed to ensure that projections reflect the impact of 
appropriately stressful conditions, as well as risks 
idiosyncratic to the BHC, on its capital position. Significant 
deficiencies in a BHC’s capital planning and stress testing 
processes may result in a qualitative objection by the Federal 
Reserve to its capital plan.

From a quantitative perspective, the Federal Reserve considers 
whether under different hypothetical macro-economic 
scenarios, including the supervisory severely adverse scenario, 
the BHC would be able to maintain, throughout each quarter 
of the nine quarter review period, projected regulatory risk-
based and leverage capital ratios that exceed the applicable 
minimums. In making these estimates, the Federal Reserve 
assumes that the BHC would continue its base case capital 
actions in each supervisory scenario, including the severely 
adverse scenario. Failure to meet a minimum regulatory risk-
based or leverage capital requirement on a projected stress 
basis is grounds for objection to a BHC’s capital plan.

In connection with the 2018 CCAR exercise, we must file our 
capital plan and stress testing results using financial data as of 
December 31, 2017 with the Federal Reserve by April 5, 2018. 
We expect to receive the Federal Reserve’s response (either a 
non-objection or objection) to the capital plan submitted as 
part of the 2018 CCAR in June 2018.

As part of the CCAR and annual DFAST processes, both we 
and the Federal Reserve release certain revenue, loss and 
capital results from stress testing exercises. For the 2018 
exercises, the Federal Reserve has announced that it intends to 
publish its supervisory revenue, loss and capital projections 
for participating BHCs under the supervisory adverse and 
severely adverse macro-economic scenarios using the 
common assumptions concerning capital distributions 
established by the Federal Reserve in its DFAST regulations 
(DFAST capital action assumptions), as well as capital ratio 
information using the company’s proposed base case capital 
actions. Within 15 days of the Federal Reserve publishing its 
DFAST results, we also are required to publicly disclose our 
own estimates of certain capital, revenue and loss information 
under the same hypothetical supervisory severely adverse 

macro-economic scenario and applying the DFAST capital 
action assumptions.

Federal Reserve regulations also require that we and other 
large BHCs conduct a separate, mid-cycle stress test using 
financial data as of June 30 and three company-derived macro-
economic scenarios (base, adverse and severely adverse) and 
publish a summary of the results under the severely adverse 
scenario. For the 2018 mid-cycle stress test cycle, we must 
publish our results in the period between October 5 and 
November 4, 2018.

The Federal Reserve’s capital plan rule provides that a BHC 
must resubmit a new capital plan prior to the annual 
submission date if, among other things, there has been or will 
be a material change in the BHC’s risk profile, financial 
condition or corporate structure since its last capital plan 
submission. Under the “de minimis” safe harbor of the Federal 
Reserve’s capital plan rule, we may make limited repurchases 
of common stock or other capital distributions in amounts that 
exceed the amounts included in our most recently approved 
capital plan subject to certain conditions, including that the 
Federal Reserve does not object to the additional repurchases 
or distributions. Such additional distributions may not exceed, 
in the aggregate, 0.25% of Tier 1 capital during the relevant 
12-month period.

Regulatory Liquidity Standards and Liquidity Risk 
Management Requirements. The Basel Committee's Basel III 
framework included short-term liquidity standards (Liquidity 
Coverage Ratio or LCR) and long-term funding standards (Net 
Stable Funding Ratio or NSFR).

The U.S. banking agencies' LCR rules are designed to ensure 
that covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level 
of cash and high quality, unencumbered liquid assets (HQLA) 
to meet estimated net liquidity needs in a short-term stress 
scenario using liquidity inflow and outflow assumptions 
prescribed in the rules (net cash outflow). A company’s LCR is 
the amount of its HQLA, as defined and calculated in 
accordance with the haircuts and limitations in the rule, 
divided by its net cash outflows, with the quotient expressed 
as a percentage. The regulatory minimum LCR that covered 
banking organizations are required to maintain is 100%. As of 
December 31, 2017, the LCR for PNC and PNC Bank 
exceeded the fully phased-in requirement of 100%.

Top-tier BHCs (like PNC) that are subject to the advanced 
approaches for regulatory capital purposes, as well as any 
subsidiary depository institution of such a company that has 
$10 billion or more in total consolidated assets (such as PNC 
Bank), are subject to the full LCR (rather than the less 
stringent modified LCR). PNC and PNC Bank are required to 
calculate the LCR on a daily basis. Under the full LCR, an 
institution required to calculate the LCR on a daily basis must 
promptly provide its regulator with a plan for achieving 
compliance with the minimum LCR requirement if its LCR is 
below the minimum requirement for three consecutive 
business days.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  7

The Federal Reserve requires large BHCs, including PNC, to 
publicly disclose certain quantitative and qualitative measures 
of their LCR-related liquidity profile. These disclosures 
include major components used to calculate the LCR (e.g., 
HQLA, cash outflows and inflows for the consolidated parent 
company), and a qualitative discussion of the BHC’s LCR 
results, including, among other things, key drivers of the 
results, composition of HQLA and concentration of funding 
sources. We are required to make these disclosures starting 
with the second quarter of 2018.

The NSFR is designed to promote a stable maturity structure 
of assets and liabilities of banking organizations over a one-
year time horizon. In 2016, the federal banking agencies 
requested comment on proposed rules that would implement 
the NSFR in the United States. The proposed rules would 
require a covered BHC to calculate its NSFR as the ratio of its 
available stable funding (ASF) to its required stable funding 
(RSF) amount, each as defined in the proposed rules, over a 
one-year horizon. The regulatory minimum ratio for all 
covered banking organizations is 100%. For BHCs with assets 
of $50 billion or more, but less than $250 billion, and on-
balance sheet foreign exposure of less than $10 billion, the 
RSF amount is scaled by a factor of 70%. The proposal also 
includes requirements for quarterly quantitative and 
qualitative NSFR disclosures. Although the impact on us will 
not be fully known until the rules are finalized, we have taken 
several actions to prepare for implementation of the NSFR and 
we expect to be in compliance with the NSFR requirements if 
and when they become effective.

PNC is also subject to Federal Reserve rules that require 
BHCs with $50 billion or more in consolidated total assets to, 
among other things, conduct internal liquidity stress tests over 
a range of time horizons, maintain a buffer of highly liquid 
assets sufficient to meet projected net outflows under the 
BHC’s 30-day liquidity stress test, and maintain a contingency 
funding plan that meets detailed requirements.

For additional discussion of regulatory liquidity requirements, 
please refer to the Liquidity and Capital Management portion 
of the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report.

Source of Parent Company Liquidity and Dividends. The 
principal source of our liquidity at the parent company level is 
dividends from PNC Bank. PNC Bank is subject to various 
restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to PNC Bancorp, 
Inc., its direct parent, which is a wholly-owned direct 
subsidiary of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. PNC 
Bank is also subject to federal laws limiting extensions of 
credit to its parent holding company and non-bank affiliates as 
discussed in Note 18 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To 
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. 
Further information on bank level liquidity and parent 
company liquidity is also available in the Liquidity and 
Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section 
of Item 7 of this Report

Federal Reserve rules provide that a BHC is expected to serve 
as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks and to 
commit resources to support such banks if necessary. Dodd-
Frank requires that the Federal Reserve jointly adopt new rules 
with the OCC and the FDIC to implement this source of 
strength requirement. These joint rules have not yet been 
proposed. Consistent with this source of strength policy for 
subsidiary banks, the Federal Reserve has stated that, as a 
matter of prudent banking, a BHC generally should not 
maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income 
available to common shareholders has been sufficient to fully 
fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings 
retention appears to be consistent with the corporation’s 
capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. 
Further, in providing guidance to the large BHCs participating 
in the 2018 CCAR, discussed above, the Federal Reserve 
stated that it expects capital plans submitted in 2018 to reflect 
conservative dividend payout ratios, and that requests that 
imply common dividend payout ratios above 30% of projected 
after-tax net income available to common shareholders will 
receive particularly close scrutiny.

Enhanced Prudential Requirements. Under Federal Reserve 
rules, PNC (and other BHCs with total consolidated assets of 
$50 billion or more) are subject to enhanced prudential 
standards related to liquidity risk management and overall risk 
management. These rules, among other things, establish 
liquidity stress testing requirements (described further below) 
and certain oversight and governance responsibilities for the 
chief risk officer, the board of directors, and the risk 
committee of the board of directors of a covered company. 
These standards also require the Federal Reserve to impose a 
maximum 15-to-1 debt to equity ratio on a BHC, if the federal 
agencies that comprise the Financial Stability Oversight 
Council (FSOC), determine that the company poses a grave 
threat to the financial stability of the United States and that the 
imposition of such a debt-to-equity requirement would 
mitigate such risk.

The Federal Reserve is also required to establish single 
counterparty credit limits and early remediation requirements 
for BHCs with more than $50 billion in total assets. The 
Federal Reserve requested comment on proposed rules to 
implement a single counterparty credit limit in March 2016. 
Under those rules, the aggregate net credit exposure by PNC, 
to any single, unaffiliated counterparty, including its 
subsidiaries, would have to be calculated on a daily basis and 
could not exceed 25 percent of our Tier 1 capital. The 
proposed limit would cover credit exposure resulting from, 
among other transactions, extensions of credit, repurchase and 
reverse repurchase transactions, purchases or investments in 
securities, and derivative transactions, although certain 
exposures, including, among others, exposures to the U.S. 
government, would be excluded. Compliance with the 
proposed rules would be required one year after the effective 
date. The proposed rule, if finalized, would not have a material 
impact on our credit relationships with third parties.

The Federal Reserve is also required to establish early 
remediation requirements for BHCs with more than $50 
billion in total assets and continues to work towards finalizing 
these requirements.

In addition, the Federal Reserve may continue to develop the 
set of enhanced prudential standards that apply to large BHCs 
in order to further promote the resiliency of such firms and the 
U.S. financial system. For additional information see Item 1A 
Risk Factors of this Report.

Additional Powers Under the GLB Act. The GLB Act permits 
a qualifying BHC to become a “financial holding company” 
and thereby engage in, or affiliate with financial companies 
engaging in, a broader range of activities than would 
otherwise be permitted for a BHC. Permitted affiliates include 
securities underwriters and dealers, insurance companies, 
insurance agents and companies engaged in other activities 
that are determined by the Federal Reserve, in consultation 
with the Secretary of the Treasury, to be “financial in nature or 
incidental thereto” or are determined by the Federal Reserve 
unilaterally to be “complementary” to financial activities. We 
became a financial holding company as of March 13, 2000. A 
BHC qualifies to become a financial holding company if the 
BHC and its subsidiary depository institutions are “well 
capitalized” and “well managed” and its subsidiary depository 
institutions have a rating under the Community Reinvestment 
Act (CRA) of Satisfactory or better. Among other activities, 
we currently rely on our status as a financial holding company 
to conduct merchant banking activities and securities 
underwriting and dealing activities. As subsidiaries of a 
financial holding company under the GLB Act, our non-bank 
subsidiaries are generally allowed to conduct new financial 
activities, and we are generally permitted to acquire non-bank 
financial companies that have less than $10 billion in assets, 
with after-the-fact notice to the Federal Reserve.

In addition, the GLB Act permits qualifying national banks to 
engage in expanded activities through a “financial subsidiary.” 
PNC Bank has filed a financial subsidiary certification with 
the OCC and currently engages in insurance agency activities 
through financial subsidiaries. PNC Bank may also generally 
engage through a financial subsidiary in any activity that is 
determined to be financial in nature or incidental to a financial 
activity by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with 
the Federal Reserve (other than insurance underwriting 
activities, insurance company investment activities and 
merchant banking). In order to establish a financial subsidiary, 
a national bank and each of its depository institution affiliates 
must be “well capitalized” and “well managed” and the 
national bank and each of its depository institution affiliates 
must have a CRA rating of Satisfactory or better.

If a financial holding company or a national bank with a 
financial subsidiary fails to continue to meet the applicable 
“well capitalized” or “well managed” criteria, the financial 
holding company or national bank must enter into an 
agreement with the Federal Reserve or the OCC, respectively, 
that, among other things, identifies how the capital or 
management deficiencies will be corrected. Until such 

deficiencies are corrected, the relevant agency may impose 
limits or conditions on the activities of the company or bank, 
and the company or bank may not engage in, or acquire a 
company engaged in, the types of expanded activities only 
permissible for a financial holding company or financial 
subsidiary without prior approval of the relevant agency.

In addition, a financial holding company generally may not 
engage in a new financial activity authorized by the GLB Act, 
or acquire a company engaged in such a new activity, if any of 
its insured depository institutions receives a CRA rating of less 
than Satisfactory rating. A national bank’s financial subsidiary 
generally may not engage in a new financial activity 
authorized by the GLB Act, or acquire a company engaged in 
such a new financial activity, if the national bank or any of its 
insured depository institution affiliates received a CRA rating 
of less than Satisfactory.

Volcker Rule. Banking entities of any size, including PNC, are 
prohibited under the Volcker Rule and its implementing 
regulations from engaging in short-term trading as principal 
and having certain ownership interests in and relationships 
with hedge funds, private equity funds, and certain other 
private funds (together, “covered funds”), unless an exemption 
or exception applies. For example, the exemptions under the 
Volcker Rule allow PNC to trade as principal for securities 
underwriting, market making and risk-mitigating hedging 
purposes, subject to a variety of conditions.

To date, the prohibitions under the final Volcker Rule 
regulations have not had, and we do not expect them to have 
in the future, a material effect on our businesses or revenue. 
However, the conditions for engaging in exempted trading 
activities and having permissible relationships with a private 
fund under the regulations could, depending on the agencies’ 
approach to interpreting them, cause us to forego engaging in 
hedging or other transactions that we would otherwise 
undertake in the ordinary course of business and, thus, to some 
extent, may limit our ability to most effectively hedge our 
risks, manage our balance sheet or provide products or 
services to our customers.

The final Volcker Rule regulations impose significant 
compliance and reporting obligations on banking entities.  We 
are subject to the enhanced compliance program requirements 
and have adopted an enterprise Volcker compliance program.  
We have also divested prohibited investments in covered funds 
and received extensions allowing an extended conformance 
period for our remaining $.2 billion interests in illiquid 
covered funds (as defined by the applicable requirements).  

Other Federal Reserve and OCC Regulation and Supervision. 
The federal banking agencies also possess broad powers to 
take corrective action as deemed appropriate for an insured 
depository institution and its holding company, and the 
Federal Reserve and the OCC have the ability to take 
enforcement action against PNC and PNC Bank, respectively, 
to prevent and remedy acts and practices that the agencies 
determine to be unfair or deceptive.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  9

Moreover, less than satisfactory examination ratings, lower 
capital ratios than peer group institutions, or regulatory 
concerns regarding management, controls, assets, operations 
or other factors can all potentially result in practical 
limitations on the ability of a bank or BHC to engage in new 
activities, grow, acquire new businesses, repurchase its stock 
or pay dividends, or to continue to conduct existing activities. 
Furthermore, the OCC has established certain heightened risk 
management and governance standards for large banks, 
including PNC Bank, as enforceable guidelines under section 
39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act). The 
guidelines, among other things, establish minimum standards 
for the design and implementation of a risk governance 
framework, describe the appropriate risk management roles 
and responsibilities of front line units, independent risk 
management, internal audit, and the board of directors, and 
provide that a covered bank should have a comprehensive 
written statement that articulates its risk appetite and serves as 
a basis for the framework (a risk appetite statement). If the 
OCC determines that a covered national bank is not in 
compliance with these or other guidelines established under 
section 39 of the FDI Act (including the guidelines relating to 
information security standards), the OCC may require the 
bank to submit a corrective action plan and may initiate 
enforcement action against the bank if an acceptable plan is 
not submitted or the bank fails to comply with an approved 
plan.

In August 2017, the Federal Reserve requested public 
comment on a proposal that would introduce a new 
supervisory rating system for BHCs with $50 billion or more 
in total consolidated assets, including PNC. Under the 
proposal, covered BHCs would receive separate ratings from 
the Federal Reserve for (i) capital planning and positions, (ii) 
liquidity risk management and positions and (iii) governance 
and controls. Each of these component areas would receive 
one of the following four ratings: (i) Satisfactory, (ii) 
Satisfactory Watch, (iii) Deficient-1 or (iv) Deficient-2. As 
proposed, a covered BHC would have to maintain a rating of 
Satisfactory Watch or better for each of the three components 
to be considered “well managed”. The public comment period 
for the proposal closed on February 15, 2018, with initial 
ratings under the new framework to be assigned during 2018.

Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the 
Federal Reserve’s implementing regulation, Regulation W, 
place quantitative and qualitative restrictions on covered 
transactions between a bank and its affiliates (for example 
between PNC Bank, on the one hand, and The PNC Financial 
Services Group, Inc. and its nonbank subsidiaries, on the other 
hand). In general, section 23A and Regulation W limit the total 
amount of covered transactions between a bank and any single 
affiliate to 10 percent of the bank’s capital stock and surplus, 
limit the total amount of covered transactions between a bank 
and all its affiliates to 20 percent of the bank’s capital stock 
and surplus, prohibit a bank from purchasing low-quality 
assets from an affiliate, and require certain covered 
transactions to be secured with prescribed amounts of 
collateral. Section 23B generally requires that transactions 
between a bank and its affiliates be on terms that are at least as 

10    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

favorable to the bank as the terms that would apply in 
comparable transactions between the bank and a third party. 
Dodd-Frank amended section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act 
to include as a covered transaction the credit exposure of a 
bank to an affiliate arising from a derivative transaction with 
the affiliate. The Federal Reserve has yet to propose rules to 
implement these revisions.

The Federal Reserve and the OCC have provided guidance 
regarding incentive and other elements of compensation 
provided to executives and other employees at financial 
services companies they regulate, both as general industry-
wide guidance and guidance specific to select larger 
companies, including PNC. These guidelines are intended to 
ensure that the incentive compensation practices of covered 
banking organizations do not encourage excessive risk-taking.  
The Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the SEC and two 
other regulatory agencies jointly proposed regulations in 2011 
and again in 2016 to implement the incentive compensation 
requirements of Section 956 of Dodd-Frank. Regulation of 
compensation provided by us to our executives and other 
employees, whether through guidance or rules and regulations, 
could hamper our ability to attract and retain quality 
employees.

The Federal Reserve’s prior approval is required whenever we 
propose to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any 
bank, to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of 
more than 5% of any class of voting securities of any bank or 
BHC, or to merge or consolidate with any other BHC. The 
BHC Act and other federal law enumerates the factors the 
Federal Reserve must consider when reviewing the merger of 
BHCs, the acquisition of banks or the acquisition of voting 
securities of a bank or BHC. These factors include the 
competitive effects of the proposal in the relevant geographic 
markets; the financial and managerial resources and future 
prospects of the companies and banks involved in the 
transaction; the effect of the transaction on the financial 
stability of the United States; the organizations’ compliance 
with anti-money laundering laws and regulations; the 
convenience and needs of the communities to be served; and 
the records of performance under the CRA of the insured 
depository institutions involved in the transaction. 

The Federal Reserve’s prior approval is also required, and 
similar factors are considered, to acquire direct or indirect 
ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting 
securities of a savings association or savings and loan holding 
company, or to merge or consolidate with a savings and loan 
holding company. In cases involving interstate bank 
acquisitions, the Federal Reserve also must consider the 
concentration of deposits nationwide and in certain individual 
states. Under Dodd-Frank, a BHC is generally prohibited from 
merging or consolidating with, or acquiring, another company 
if upon consummation the resulting company would control 
10% or more of deposits in the U.S or a state, or if the 
resulting company’s liabilities would exceed 10% of the 
aggregate liabilities of the U.S. financial sector (including the 
U.S. liabilities of foreign financial companies). In 
extraordinary cases, the FSOC, in conjunction with the 

Federal Reserve, could order the break-up of financial firms 
that are deemed to present a grave threat to the financial 
stability of the United States. 

impose a one-time shortfall assessment on insured depository 
institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or 
more (including PNC Bank). 

OCC prior approval is required for PNC Bank to acquire 
another insured bank or savings association by merger or to 
acquire deposits or substantially all of the assets of such 
institutions. In deciding whether to approve such a transaction, 
the OCC is required to consider factors similar to those that 
must be considered by the Federal Reserve in connection with 
the acquisition of a bank or BHC. Approval of the FDIC is 
required to merge a nonbank entity into PNC Bank. Our 
ability to grow through acquisitions or reorganize our 
operations could be limited by these approval requirements.

At December 31, 2017, PNC Bank had an Outstanding rating 
with respect to the CRA.

Based on the Federal Reserve’s interpretation of the BHC Act, 
the Federal Reserve has indicated that it considers BlackRock 
to be a subsidiary of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. 
for purposes of the BHC Act due to PNC’s current and 
historical ownership interest in, as well as  other relationships 
with, BlackRock and, thus, subject to the supervision and 
regulation of the Federal Reserve.

FDIC Insurance and Related Matters. PNC Bank is insured by 
the FDIC and subject to deposit premium assessments. 
Regulatory matters could increase the cost of FDIC deposit 
insurance premiums to an insured bank as FDIC deposit 
insurance premiums are “risk based.” Therefore, higher fee 
percentages would be charged to banks that have lower capital 
ratios or higher risk profiles. These risk profiles take into 
account, among other things, weaknesses that are found by the 
primary federal banking regulator through its examination and 
supervision of the bank and the bank’s holdings of assets or 
liabilities classified as higher risk by the FDIC. A negative 
evaluation by the FDIC or a bank’s primary federal banking 
regulator could increase the costs to a bank and result in an 
aggregate cost of deposit funds higher than that of competing 
banks in a lower risk category.

Federal banking laws and regulations also apply a variety of 
requirements or restrictions on insured depository institutions 
with respect to brokered deposits. For instance, only a “well 
capitalized” insured depository institution may accept 
brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. In 
addition, brokered deposits are generally subject to higher 
outflow assumptions than other types of deposits for purposes 
of the LCR.

The FDIC has imposed a deposit insurance assessment 
surcharge on insured depository institutions with total 
consolidated assets of $10 billion or more (including PNC 
Bank), which will continue in effect until the earlier of (i) the 
date on which the Designated Reserve Ratio (the balance in 
the Deposit Insurance Fund divided by estimated insured 
deposits) reaches 1.35% (estimated by the FDIC to occur 
before the end of 2018), or (ii) December 31, 2018. If the ratio 
does not reach 1.35% by December 31, 2018, the FDIC will 

Resolution and Recovery Planning. BHCs that have 
$50 billion or more in assets, such as PNC, are required to 
periodically submit to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a 
resolution plan that includes, among other things, an analysis 
of how the company could be resolved in a rapid and orderly 
fashion if the company were to fail or experience material 
financial distress. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC may 
jointly impose restrictions on a covered BHC, including 
additional capital requirements or limitations on growth, if the 
agencies jointly determine that the company’s plan is not 
credible or would not facilitate a rapid and orderly resolution 
of the company under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or other 
applicable resolution framework), and additionally could 
require the company to divest assets or take other actions if the 
company did not submit an acceptable resolution plan within 
two years after any such restrictions were imposed. The FDIC 
also requires large insured depository institutions, including 
PNC Bank, to periodically submit a resolution plan to the 
FDIC that includes, among other things, an analysis of how 
the institution could be resolved under the FDI Act in a 
manner that protects depositors and limits losses or costs to 
creditors of the bank in accordance with the FDI Act. PNC and 
PNC Bank are required to provide the Federal Reserve and 
FDIC a public summary of their resolution plans, which the 
agencies then make available to the public. Depending on how 
the agencies conduct their review of the resolution plans 
submitted by PNC and PNC Bank, these requirements could 
affect the ways in which PNC structures and conducts its 
business and result in higher compliance and operating costs. 

PNC Bank also is subject to OCC guidelines under section 39 
of the FDI Act that establish standards for recovery planning. 
These guidelines require a covered bank to develop and 
maintain a recovery plan that, among other things, identifies a 
range of options that could be undertaken by the covered bank 
to restore its financial strength and viability should identified 
triggering events occur. The recovery plan guidelines are 
enforceable in the same manner as the other guidelines the 
OCC has established under section 39 of the FDI Act.

CFPB Regulation and Supervision. The CFPB examines PNC 
and PNC Bank for compliance with a broad range of federal 
consumer financial laws and regulations, including the laws 
and regulations that relate to deposit products, credit card, 
mortgage, automobile, student and other consumer loans, and 
other consumer financial products and services that we offer. 
The CFPB also has authority to take enforcement actions to 
prevent and remedy acts and practices relating to consumer 
financial products and services that it deems to be unfair, 
deceptive or abusive, and to impose new disclosure 
requirements for any consumer financial product or service.

The CFPB may issue regulations that impact products and 
services offered by PNC Bank. The regulations could reduce 
the fees that we receive, alter the way we provide our products 
and services, or expose us to greater risk of private litigation 
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  11

or regulatory enforcement action. The CFPB may engage in 
rulemakings affecting prepaid cards, data on small business 
lending, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and payday, 
vehicle title, and certain high-cost installment loans.

Securities and Derivatives Regulation
Our registered broker-dealer and investment adviser 
subsidiaries are subject to the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, respectively, 
and related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC.

Our investment adviser subsidiary that serves as adviser to 
registered investment companies is also subject to the 
requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and 
related regulations. The Financial Industry Regulatory 
Authority (FINRA) is the primary self-regulatory organization 
for our registered broker-dealer subsidiaries. Our broker-dealer 
and investment adviser subsidiaries also are subject to 
additional regulation by states or local jurisdictions.

The SEC and FINRA have active enforcement functions that 
oversee broker-dealers and investment advisers and can bring 
actions that result in fines, restitution, a limitation on 
permitted activities, disqualification to continue to conduct 
certain activities and an inability to rely on certain favorable 
exemptions. Certain types of infractions and violations also 
can affect our ability to expeditiously issue new securities into 
the capital markets. In addition, certain changes in the 
activities of a broker-dealer require approval from FINRA, 
and FINRA takes into account a variety of considerations in 
acting upon applications for such approval, including internal 
controls, capital levels, management experience and quality, 
prior enforcement and disciplinary history and supervisory 
concerns.

Dodd-Frank imposed comprehensive and significant 
regulations on the activities of financial institutions that are 
active in the U.S. over-the-counter derivatives and foreign 
exchange markets. These regulations were intended to 
(i) address systemic risk issues, (ii) bring greater transparency 
to the derivatives markets, (iii) provide enhanced disclosures 
and protections to customers and (iv) promote market 
integrity. Among other things, Dodd-Frank: (i) requires the 
registration of both “swap dealers” and “major swap 
participants” with one or both of the CFTC (in the case of non 
security-based swaps) and the SEC (in the case of security-
based swaps); (ii) requires that most standardized swaps be 
centrally cleared through a regulated clearing house and traded 
on a centralized exchange or swap execution facility; 
(iii) subjects swap dealers and major swap participants to 
capital and margin requirements in excess of historical 
practice; (iv) subjects swap dealers and major swap 
participants to comprehensive new recordkeeping and real-
time public reporting requirements; (v) subjects swap dealers 
and major swap participants to new business conduct 
requirements, including the provision of daily marks to 
counterparties and disclosing to counterparties (pre-execution) 
the material risks, material incentives, and any conflicts of 
interest associated with their swap; (vi) imposes special duties 
on swap dealers and major swap participants when transacting 

12    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

a swap with a “special entity” (e.g., governmental agency 
(federal, state or local) or political subdivision thereof, 
pension plan or endowment); and (vii) imposes margin 
requirements on swaps that are not centrally cleared through a 
regulated clearing house.

As a registered swap dealer with the CFTC, PNC Bank's 
derivatives and foreign exchange businesses are subject to the 
regulations and requirements imposed on registered swap 
dealers, and the CFTC (and for certain delegated 
responsibilities, the National Futures Association) has a 
meaningful supervisory role with respect to PNC Bank’s 
derivatives and foreign exchange businesses. Because of the 
limited volume of our security-based swap activities, PNC 
Bank has not registered with the SEC as a security-based swap 
dealer. The regulations and requirements applicable to swap 
dealers have and will continue to impose compliance burdens 
on PNC Bank and introduces additional legal risks (including 
as a result of applicable anti-fraud and anti-manipulation 
provisions and private rights of action). In addition, failure to 
comply with the "pay-to-play" regulations that govern our 
swap and municipal securities businesses could result in 
limitations on PNC Bank's ability to conduct swap and 
municipal securities business with state or local governments 
and their authorities.

BlackRock has subsidiaries in securities and related businesses 
subject to SEC, other governmental agencies, state, local and 
FINRA regulation, and a federally chartered nondepository 
trust company subsidiary subject to supervision and regulation 
by the OCC. For additional information about the regulation 
of BlackRock by these agencies and otherwise, see the 
discussion under the “Regulation” section of Item 1 Business 
in BlackRock’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, 
which may be obtained electronically at the SEC’s website at 
www.sec.gov.

Regulations of Other Agencies
In addition to regulations issued by the federal banking, 
securities and derivatives regulators, we also are subject to 
regulations issued by other federal agencies with respect to 
certain financial products and services we offer. For example, 
certain of our fiduciary, brokerage and investment 
management activities are subject to regulations issued by the 
Department of Labor (DOL) under the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, and 
related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and certain of 
our student lending and servicing activities are subject to 
regulation by the Department of Education. Certain provisions 
of final rules issued by the DOL expanding the definition of 
“investment advice” for retirement accounts and certain other 
accounts took effect in June 2017. The rules increased the 
scope of activities that give rise to fiduciary status under 
ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code and primarily apply to 
aspects of our Retail Banking and Asset Management Group 
segments. Certain requirements of the amended rules that had 
been scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2018 have been 
delayed until July 1, 2019 and the DOL is expected to propose 
amendments to the rules during the delay.

Competition
We are subject to intense competition from other regulated 
banking organizations, as well as various other types of 
financial institutions and non-bank entities that can offer a 
number of similar products and services without being subject 
to bank regulatory supervision and restrictions.

PNC Bank competes for deposits and/or loans with:

•  Other commercial banks,
• 
Savings banks,
•  Credit unions,
•  Consumer finance companies,
•  Leasing companies,
•  Other non-bank lenders,
• 
•  Treasury management service companies,
• 
• 

Financial technology companies,

Insurance companies, and
Issuers of commercial paper and other securities, 
including mutual funds.

In providing asset management services, our businesses 
compete with:

Investment management firms,

• 
•  Large banks and other financial institutions,
•  Brokerage firms,
• 
•  Mutual fund complexes, and
• 

Financial technology companies,

Insurance companies.

Our various non-bank businesses engaged in investment 
banking and alternative investment activities compete with:

Investment banking firms,

•  Commercial banks,
• 
•  Collateralized loan obligation (CLO) managers,
•  Hedge funds,
•  Mutual fund complexes,
•  Merchant banks,
• 
• 
•  Other investment vehicles.

Insurance companies,
Private equity firms, and

Loan pricing, structure and credit standards are extremely 
important in the current environment as we seek to achieve 
appropriate risk-adjusted returns. Traditional deposit-taking 
activities are also subject to pricing pressures and to customer 
migration as a result of intense competition for deposits and 
investments. Competitors may seek to compete with us 
through traditional channels such as physical locations or 
through digital channels such as internet or mobile. We 
include here by reference the additional information regarding 
competition and factors affecting our competitive position 
included in the Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report.

Employees
Employees totaled 52,906 at December 31, 2017. This total 
included 50,358 full-time and 2,548 part-time employees, of 
which 29,604 full-time and 2,368 part-time employees were 
employed by our Retail Banking business.

hypothetical severely adverse economic scenarios, as well as 
information concerning our capital stress testing processes, 
pursuant to the stress testing regulations adopted by the 
Federal Reserve and the OCC. We are also required to make 
certain additional regulatory capital-related public disclosures 
about our capital structure, risk exposures, risk assessment 
processes, risk-weighted assets and overall capital adequacy, 
including market risk-related disclosures, under the regulatory 
capital rules adopted by the Federal banking agencies. Under 
these regulations, we may satisfy these requirements through 
postings on our website, and we have done so and expect to 
continue to do so without also providing disclosure of this 
information through filings with the SEC.

ITEM 1A – RISK FACTORS
We are subject to a number of risks potentially impacting our 
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash 
flows. As a financial services organization, certain elements of 
risk are inherent in what we do and the business decisions we 
make. Thus, we encounter risk as part of the normal course of 
our business, and we design risk management processes to 
help manage these risks.

Our success is dependent on our ability to identify, understand 
and manage the risks presented by our business activities so 
that we can appropriately balance revenue generation and 
profitability. We categorize the risks we face as credit risk, 
liquidity risk, capital management, market risk, operational 
risk and compliance risk. We discuss our principal risk 
management processes and, in appropriate places, related 
historical performance and other metrics in the Risk 
Management section included in Item 7 of this Report.

The following are the key risk factors that affect us. Any one 
or more of these risk factors could have a material adverse 
impact on our business, financial condition, results of 
operations or cash flows, in addition to presenting other 
possible adverse consequences, including those described 
below. These risk factors and other risks we face are also 
discussed further in other sections of this Report.

Our business and financial performance are vulnerable to 
the impact of adverse economic conditions.

As a financial services company, our business and overall 
financial performance are affected to a significant extent by 
economic conditions. Adverse economic conditions generally 
result in reduced business activity, which may decrease the 
demand for our products and services, can impair the ability of 
borrowers to repay loans, and may lead to turmoil and 
volatility in financial markets. Such effects would likely have 
an adverse impact on financial institutions such as PNC, with 
the significance of the impact generally depending on the 
severity of the adverse economic conditions, increasing 
typically under recessionary conditions.

Even when economic conditions are relatively good or stable, 
specific economic factors can negatively affect the 
performance of financial institutions, especially as these 
factors relate to particular industries or geographical regions. 
For example, shifting consumer behavior with respect to retail 

purchases over the internet rather than in physical stores has 
negatively impacted performance by some retailers, 
potentially decreasing demand for financial services in that 
sector and impairing the creditworthiness of some shopping 
malls and retail companies. 

Given the geographic scope of our business and operations, 
we are most exposed to issues within the United States 
economy and financial markets and, within the United States, 
most exposed to issues within our primary geographic 
footprint concentrated in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and 
Southeast.

International economic conditions, however, can impact our 
business and financial performance both directly to the extent 
of our international business activities and, possibly more 
significantly, indirectly due to the possibility that poor 
economic conditions impacting other major economies around 
the world will have an impact on the United States. For 
example, the prospect of the United Kingdom’s impending 
exit from the European Union has led to uncertainty regarding 
the impact on the United Kingdom’s economy and capital 
markets as well as that of the remaining countries in the 
European Union. It is also possible that other countries might 
seek to exit the European Union in the future. The extent to 
which these uncertainties will affect the United States 
economy and capital markets is unclear.

The recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will impact 
PNC’s business and financial results, including likely 
resultant changes in customer behavior.

In December 2017, Congress passed and the President signed 
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, representing the most significant 
change in U.S. federal tax law in decades. Although the direct 
impact of this legislation on PNC is likely to be positive, 
primarily as a result of a reduction in the corporate tax rate 
from 35% to 21%, there are specific aspects that will have a 
negative impact, including the disallowance of deductions for 
FDIC deposit insurance premiums and for a portion of our 
executive incentive compensation. 

In addition, we anticipate that business and retail customers 
will modify behavior going forward in response to changes in 
the tax law, some of which are likely to be favorable to PNC 
over time, but some changes in customer behavior could be 
detrimental to our business. For example, in addition to 
various potential positive impacts, new or modified limitations 
on the ability of individuals to deduct mortgage and home 
equity interest expense could adversely affect demand for our 
home lending products. As another example, there could be 
reduced demand for commercial borrowing, due to factors 
such as improved cash flow resulting from lower tax rates or 
funds repatriated from outside the U.S. or utilization of other 
financing options.

It is not possible at present to determine the likely overall 
impact of the new tax law on PNC as a result of changes in 
economic activity and customer behavior, either in terms of 
magnitude or timing.

The monetary policies of governmental agencies, including 
the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest 
rates and overall financial market performance.

Governmental monetary policies, including those of the 
Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates 
and overall financial market performance. These governmental 
policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations 
of banking companies such as PNC. An important function of 
the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank 
credit and certain interest rates. The actions of the Federal 
Reserve influence the rates of interest that we charge on loans 
and that we pay on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits 
and can also affect the value of our on-balance sheet and off-
balance sheet financial instruments. Both due to the impact on 
rates and by controlling access to direct funding from the 
Federal Reserve Banks, the Federal Reserve’s policies also 
significantly influence our cost of funding. 

We cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in 
monetary policies or the precise effects that they may have on 
our activities and financial results. The very low interest rate 
environment that has prevailed since the financial crisis has 
had a negative impact on our ability to increase our net interest 
income. Although the Federal Reserve started increasing its 
benchmark interest rate in December 2015, ending 
approximately seven years of near zero rates, and has 
continued to do so through 2017, with expectations that it will 
continue to do so in 2018, there is no assurance that it will do 
so or that it will do so in a manner that will be consistent with 
market expectations. Should the Federal Reserve not continue 
raising rates, it could affect consumer and business behavior in 
ways that are adverse to us in addition to continuing to affect 
our net interest income. Even if the Federal Reserve continues 
to increase the interest rates it directly influences, there may 
be a prolonged period before interest rates return to more 
historically typical levels. Recent and pending changes in the 
membership of the Federal Reserve Board, including its Chair, 
may create additional uncertainty regarding the direction of 
policy by the Federal Reserve.

After an extended period during which the Federal Reserve 
increased its balance sheet substantially above historical levels 
through the purchase of debt securities, the Federal Reserve 
has indicated an intention to start reducing its balance sheet 
from these elevated levels. It is unclear what impact this will 
have on the economy or on the markets for and values of 
financial assets, including assets of the types that we hold, 
purchase and sell.

In addition, monetary policy actions by governmental 
authorities in the European Union or other countries could 
have an impact on global interest rates, which could affect 
rates in the United States as well as rates on instruments 
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, any of 
which could have one or more of the potential effects on us 
described above. While we have not experienced negative 
interest rates in the United States, and in recent periods the 
Federal Reserve has been gradually increasing rates, some 
central banks in Europe and Asia have cut interest rates below 

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  15

zero. If U.S. interest rates were to fall below zero, it could 
significantly affect our businesses and results of operation in 
ways that cannot easily be predicted.

Other government legislation, regulation and policy 
potentially impacting the economy can have an adverse 
effect on our business and financial performance.

Changes in law or governmental policy affecting the economy, 
business activity, or personal spending, investing or saving 
activities may cause consumers and businesses to alter 
behavior in ways that impact demand for our products and 
services. PNC may also adjust the types of transactions we 
seek to pursue under those circumstances. Uncertainty 
regarding future law or policy may have similar impacts. 
Concern regarding the ability of Congress and the President 
collectively to reach agreement on federal budgetary matters 
(including the debt ceiling), or prolonged stalemates leading to 
total or partial governmental shutdowns, also can have adverse 
economic consequences and create the risk of economic 
instability or market volatility with potential adverse 
consequences to our business and financial performance.

As a regulated financial services firm, we are subject to 
numerous governmental regulations, and the financial 
services industry as a whole continues to be subject to 
significant regulatory reform initiatives in the United 
States and elsewhere.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. is a bank holding 
company (BHC) and a financial holding company and is 
subject to numerous governmental regulations involving both 
its business and organization.

Our businesses are subject to regulation by multiple banking, 
consumer protection, securities and derivatives regulatory 
bodies. In recent years, we, together with the rest of the 
financial services industry, have faced intense regulation, with 
many new regulatory initiatives and vigorous oversight and 
enforcement on the part of numerous regulatory bodies. 
Legislatures and regulators have pursued a broad array of 
initiatives intended to promote the safety and soundness of 
financial institutions, financial market stability, the 
transparency and liquidity of financial markets, and consumer 
and investor protection. As a result, we have experienced 
significantly increased compliance costs and have needed to 
adjust our business practices to accommodate new 
requirements and limitations, impacting some of our revenue 
opportunities. 

Applicable laws and regulations restrict our ability to 
repurchase stock or to receive dividends from subsidiaries that 
operate in the banking and securities businesses and impose 
capital adequacy requirements. PNC’s ability to service its 
obligations and pay dividends to shareholders is largely 
dependent on the receipt of dividends and advances from its 
subsidiaries, primarily PNC Bank. The Federal Reserve 
requires a BHC to act as a source of financial and managerial 
strength for its subsidiary banks. The Federal Reserve could 
require PNC to commit resources to PNC Bank when doing so 

16    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

is not otherwise in the interests of PNC or its shareholders or 
creditors.

Applicable laws and regulations also restrict permissible 
activities and investments and require compliance with 
provisions designed to protect loan, deposit, brokerage, 
fiduciary, mutual fund and other customers, and for the 
protection of customer information, among other things. We 
are also subject to laws and regulations designed to combat 
money laundering, terrorist financing, and transactions with 
persons, companies or foreign governments designated by 
U.S. authorities.

The current presidential administration has indicated an intent 
to pursue the regulation of the financial services industry 
differently than under the previous administration. There is, 
however, significant uncertainty regarding the direction this 
administration will take and its ability to implement its 
policies and objectives. In addition, the ultimate impact on 
potential new regulatory initiatives and the enforcement of 
existing laws and regulations is not known. Even to the extent 
that the current administration takes a different approach to 
regulation of the financial services industry than had 
previously been the case, and even if that is overall favorable 
to us, we would still expect compliance with regulations to be 
a meaningful burden presenting significant risk. In addition, 
there could be an increase in state regulation of aspects of our 
business and in foreign regulation that impacts our operations. 
Different approaches to regulation by different jurisdictions 
could increase our compliance costs.

There are currently pending numerous additional regulatory 
proposals, and other new initiatives are likely to be pursued in 
the future. The implementation of new regulatory 
requirements and limitations could further increase our 
compliance costs and the risks associated with non-
compliance and could affect our ability to pursue or take full 
advantage of some desirable business opportunities.

A failure to comply, or to have adequate policies and 
procedures designed to comply, with regulatory requirements 
and expectations could expose us to damages, fines and 
regulatory penalties and other regulatory actions or 
consequences, such as limitations on activities otherwise 
permissible for us or additional requirements for engaging in 
new activities, and could also injure our reputation with 
customers and others with whom we do business.

See Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this Report for 
more information concerning the regulation of PNC and recent 
initiatives to reform financial institution regulation, including 
some of the matters discussed in this Risk Factor. Note 18 
Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial 
Statements in Item 8 of this Report also discusses some of the 
regulation applicable to us.

Current and likely future capital and liquidity standards 
will result in banks and bank holding companies needing 
to maintain more and higher quality capital and greater 
liquidity than has historically been the case.

We are subject to regulatory capital and liquidity requirements 
established by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, and discuss 
these requirements and standards in the Supervision and 
Regulation section included in Item 1 of this Report and the 
Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk 
Management section of Item 7 of this Report.

The regulatory capital requirements applicable to banks and 
BHCs have undergone significant changes. For example, the 
final rules adopted by the U.S. banking agencies in July 2013 
to implement the new international guidelines for determining 
regulatory capital established by the Basel Committee known 
as “Basel III,” as well as to implement certain provisions of 
Dodd-Frank, fundamentally altered the U.S. regulatory capital 
requirements for U.S. BHCs and banks. Significant parts of 
these rules are now effective for us, although as a result of the 
staggered effective dates of the rules, many provisions are 
being phased-in over a period of years, with the rules 
generally to be fully phased-in as of January 1, 2019. The 
Basel Committee recently finalized additional, significant 
changes to the international capital framework for banking 
organizations, including modifications that would: (i) 
significantly alter the international frameworks governing the 
market risk capital requirements for trading positions and the 
standardized risk weighting approach for credit risk, (ii) 
introduce a new standardized measure of operational risk to 
replace the current methodology under the advanced 
approaches, and (iii) establish a standardized approach floor 
for capital ratios calculated by banking organizations that use 
the advanced approaches for the risk weighting of assets. 
Moreover, the Basel Committee continues to consider other 
changes to the international regulatory capital framework to 
enhance the transparency and consistency of capital 
requirements among banks and jurisdictions, including, among 
others, the treatment of securitization positions. It is unclear 
how these or other initiatives by the Basel Committee may be 
implemented in the U.S. and, thus, we are unable to estimate 
what potential impact such initiatives may have on us.

The liquidity standards applicable to large U.S. banking 
organizations also are expected to be supplemented in the 
coming years. For example, the Basel Committee, in October 
2014, released the final framework for the NSFR standard, 
which is designed to ensure that banking organizations 
maintain a stable, long-term funding profile in relation to their 
asset composition and off-balance sheet activities. In May 
2016, the U.S. banking agencies proposed rules to implement 
the NSFR but these rules have not yet been finalized. Thus, 
the potential impact of the NSFR on us remains unclear.

The need to maintain more and higher quality capital, as well 
as greater liquidity, going forward than historically has been 
required could limit our business activities, including lending, 
and our ability to expand, either organically or through 
acquisitions. It could also result in us taking steps to increase 

our capital that may be dilutive to shareholders, being limited 
in our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to 
shareholders, or selling or refraining from acquiring assets, for 
which the capital requirements appear inconsistent with the 
assets’ underlying risks. In addition, the new liquidity 
standards require us to maintain holdings of highly liquid 
short-term investments, thereby reducing our ability to invest 
in longer-term or less liquid assets, even if more desirable 
from a balance sheet or interest rate risk management 
perspective. In addition, PNC, as a BHC that is subject to the 
advanced approaches for regulatory capital purposes, is 
subject to a higher LCR requirement than other BHCs that 
have more than $50 billion in total assets but are not subject to 
the advanced approaches. Until the scope and terms of 
pending or future rulemakings relating to capital, liquidity or 
liability composition are known, the extent to which such rules 
may apply to us and the potential impact of such rules on us 
will remain uncertain.

The planned discontinuance of the requirement that banks 
submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR presents risks to 
the financial instruments originated or held by PNC that 
use LIBOR as a reference rate.

LIBOR is the reference rate for many transactions in which we 
lend and borrow money, issue, purchase and sell securities and 
enter into derivatives to manage our or our customers’ risk of 
these transactions. LIBOR has been the subject of recent 
national and international regulatory guidance and proposals 
for reform. The United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, 
which regulates the process for establishing LIBOR, 
announced in July 2017 that it intends to stop persuading or 
compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR 
to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. It is not possible to 
predict the effect of this announcement, including whether 
LIBOR will continue in place, and if so what changes will be 
made to it, what rates may replace LIBOR in use going 
forward, and how LIBOR will be determined for purposes of 
loans, securities and derivative instruments currently 
referencing it if it ceases to exist at some point. Any change in 
the availability or calculation of LIBOR may adversely affect 
the yield on loans or securities held by us, amounts paid on 
securities we have issued, or amounts received and paid on 
derivative instruments we have entered into, the value of such 
loans, securities, or derivative instruments, the trading market 
for LIBOR-based securities, the terms of new loans being 
made using different or modified reference rates, or our ability 
to effectively use derivative instruments to manage risk. 

Any of the reform proposals or the general increased 
regulatory scrutiny of LIBOR could increase the costs and 
risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting 
of LIBOR and complying with any such regulations or 
requirements. Such factors may have the effect of 
discouraging market participants from continuing to 
administer or contribute to LIBOR or lead to the ultimate 
discontinuance or unavailability of quotes of LIBOR. It is 
impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will 
continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator 
of LIBOR.

Our business and financial results are subject to risks 
associated with the creditworthiness of our customers and 
counterparties.

Credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and 
results from, among other things, extending credit to 
customers, purchasing securities, and entering into financial 
derivative transactions and certain guarantee contracts. Credit 
risk is one of our most significant risks, particularly given the 
high percentage of our assets represented directly or indirectly 
by loans and securities and the importance of lending activity 
to our overall business. We manage credit risk by assessing 
and monitoring the creditworthiness of our customers and 
counterparties, by diversifying our loan portfolio and by 
investing primarily in high quality securities. 

A borrower’s ability to repay a loan can be adversely affected 
by several factors. Individual borrowers can be affected by, 
among other things, declines in income, job losses, health 
issues or family issues. Commercial borrowers can be affected 
by, among other things, poor business performance or 
catastrophe losses. A weak or deteriorating economy and 
changes in the domestic or global markets would typically 
adversely impact the ability of our borrowers to repay 
outstanding loans. We may also be exposed to credit risk if we 
fail to evaluate properly at origination the likely ability of a 
borrower to repay a loan or fail to identify declining 
creditworthiness of a borrower at a time when remedial 
actions may reduce our exposure. Any decrease in our 
borrowers’ ability to repay loans would result in higher levels 
of nonperforming loans, net charge-offs, provision for credit 
losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale.

Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of 
trading, clearing, lending, counterparty and other 
relationships. We have exposure to many different industries 
and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with 
counterparties in the financial services industry, including 
brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, 
mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many 
of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of 
default of our counterparty or client.

Despite maintaining a diversified loan and securities portfolio, 
in the ordinary course of business, we may have concentrated 
credit exposure to a particular person or entity, industry, region 
or financial market. Loans secured by commercial and 
residential real estate represent a significant percentage of our 
overall credit portfolio, as well as of the assets underlying our 
investment securities. Events adversely affecting specific 
customers or counterparties, industries, regions or financial 
markets, including a decline in their creditworthiness or a 
worsening overall risk profile, could adversely affect us.

Our credit risk may be exacerbated when collateral held by us 
to secure obligations to us cannot be realized upon or is 
liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full 
amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us.

18    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

We reserve for credit losses on our loan and lease portfolio, as 
well as for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit,  
through our Allowances for loan and lease losses and 
unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit, with changes 
in the allowances reflected in Net income through Provision 
for credit losses. An increase in credit risk would likely lead to 
an increase in Provision for credit losses with a resulting 
reduction in our Net income and would increase our 
allowances.

Our business and financial performance is impacted 
significantly by market interest rates and movements in 
those rates. 

As a result of the high percentage of our assets and liabilities 
that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related 
instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield 
curve, or in spreads between different market interest rates can 
have a material effect on our business, our profitability and the 
value of our financial assets and liabilities. For example:

•  Changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads can 

affect the difference between the interest that we earn 
on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities, 
which impacts our overall net interest income and 
margin as well as our profitability.
Such changes can affect the ability of borrowers to 
meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate 
loans and other debt instruments, and can, in turn, 
affect our loss rates on those assets.
Such changes may decrease the demand for interest 
rate-based products and services, including loans and 
deposit accounts.
Such changes can also affect our ability to hedge 
various forms of market and interest rate risk and may 
decrease the effectiveness of those hedges in helping 
to manage such risks.

•  Movements in interest rates also affect mortgage 

prepayment speeds and could result in impairments of 
mortgage servicing assets or otherwise affect the 
profitability of such assets.
Increases in interest rates can lower the price we 
would receive on fixed-rate customer obligations if 
we were to sell them.

We discuss the impact of governmental monetary policy on 
interest rates in “The monetary policies of governmental 
agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant 
impact on interest rates and overall financial market 
performance” Risk Factor in this Item 1A.

Our business and financial performance are vulnerable to 
the impact of changes in the values of financial assets.

As a financial institution, a substantial majority of our assets 
and liabilities are financial in nature (items such as loans, 
securities, servicing rights, deposits and borrowings). Such 
assets and liabilities will fluctuate in value, often significantly, 
due to movements in the financial markets or market volatility 
as well as developments specific to the asset or liability in 
question. Credit-based assets and liabilities will fluctuate in 

value due to changes in the perceived creditworthiness of 
borrowers or other counterparties and also due to changes in 
market interest rates.

In addition, changes in loan prepayment speeds, usually based 
on fluctuations in market interest rates, could adversely impact 
the value of our mortgage servicing rights. Additionally, the 
underlying value of assets under lease or securing an 
obligation may decrease due to supply and demand for the 
asset or the condition of the asset. This could cause the ability 
to collect fully on, or the value of, the secured obligation to 
decline.

In many cases, we mark our assets and liabilities to market on 
our financial statements, either through our Net income and 
Retained earnings or through adjustments to Accumulated 
other comprehensive income on our balance sheet. We may 
need to record losses in the value of financial assets even 
where our expectation of realizing the face value of the 
underlying instrument has not changed.

In addition, asset management revenue is primarily based on a 
percentage of the value of the assets being managed and thus 
is impacted by general changes in market valuations. Thus, 
although we are not directly impacted by changes in the value 
of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would 
affect related noninterest income.

Our asset and liability valuations and the determination of 
the amount of loss allowances and impairments taken on 
our assets are highly subjective. Inaccurate estimates could 
materially impact our results of operations or financial 
position.

We must use estimates, assumptions and judgments when 
assets and liabilities are measured and reported at fair value. 
Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a 
higher degree of financial statement volatility. Changes in 
underlying factors or assumptions in any of the areas 
underlying our estimates could materially impact our future 
financial condition and results of operations. During periods of 
market disruption, it may be more difficult to value certain 
assets if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data 
becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes 
that were historically traded in active markets with significant 
observable data that rapidly become illiquid due to market 
volatility, a loss in market confidence or other factors. In 
addition, we have certain assets and liabilities carried at fair 
value that are estimated using unobservable inputs that are 
significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Further, 
rapidly changing and unprecedented market conditions in any 
particular market could materially impact the valuation of 
assets as reported within our consolidated financial statements.

The determination of the amount of loss allowances and asset 
impairments varies by asset type and is based upon our 
periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent 
risks associated with the respective asset class. Management 
updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in 
allowances and impairments in operations as such evaluations 

are revised. Although we have policies and procedures in 
place to determine loss allowance and asset impairments, due 
to the subjective nature of this area, there can be no assurance 
that our management has accurately assessed the level of 
impairments taken and allowances reflected in our financial 
statements. Furthermore, additional impairments may need to 
be taken or allowances provided for in the future. Historical 
trends may not be indicative of future impairments or 
allowances.

Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain 
customers for our products and services, which may be 
negatively impacted by a lack of consumer and business 
economic confidence as well as our actions, including our 
ability to anticipate and satisfy customer demands for 
products and services.

As a financial institution, our performance is subject to risks 
associated with declines in customer demand for our products 
and services, including as a result of a loss of economic 
confidence or customer trust in us.

Economic and market developments may affect consumer and 
business confidence levels. If customers lose confidence due 
to a weak or deteriorating economy or uncertainty surrounding 
the future of the economy, the demand for our products and 
services could suffer. We may also fail to attract or retain 
customers if we are unable to develop and market products 
and services that meet evolving customer needs or demands or 
if we are unable to deliver them effectively and securely to our 
customers, particularly to the extent that our competitors are 
better able to do so.

News or other publicity that impairs our reputation, or the 
reputation of our industry generally, also could cause a loss of 
customers. Financial companies are highly vulnerable to 
reputational damage when they are found to have harmed 
customers, particularly retail customers, through conduct that 
is illegal or viewed as unfair, deceptive, manipulative or 
otherwise wrongful. The negative impact of such reputational 
damage on our business may be disproportionate to the actual 
harm caused customers. In addition, we could suffer 
reputational harm and a loss of customer trust as a result of 
conduct of others in which we have not engaged.

If we fail to attract and retain customers, demand for our loans 
and other financial products and services could decrease and 
we could experience adverse changes in payment patterns. We 
could lose interest income from a decline in credit usage and 
noninterest income from a decline in product sales, 
investments and other transactions. Our customers could 
remove money from checking, savings or other types of 
deposit accounts in favor of other banks or other types of 
investment products. Deposits are a low cost source of funds 
for us. Therefore, losing deposits could increase our funding 
costs and reduce our net interest income.

The United States is just starting to emerge from an extended 
period of very low interest rates. Very low interest rates 
decrease the attractiveness of alternatives to bank checking 
and savings accounts, which may lack deposit insurance and 
some of the convenience associated with more traditional 
banking products. As interest rates rise, and the spread 
between the rates we offer and those offered by alternatives to 
bank accounts widens, customers may be less willing to 
maintain balances in noninterest bearing or low interest bank 
accounts, which could result in a relatively higher cost of 
funds to us and negatively affect net interest income. This 
could also result in a loss of noninterest income.

In our asset management business, investment performance is 
an important factor influencing the level of assets that we 
manage. Poor investment performance could impair revenue 
and growth as existing clients might withdraw funds in favor 
of better performing products. Additionally, the ability to 
attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish. 
Overall economic conditions may limit the amount that 
customers are able or willing to invest as well as the value of 
the assets they do invest. The failure or negative performance 
of products of other financial institutions could lead to a loss 
of confidence in similar products offered by us without regard 
to the performance of our products. Such a negative contagion 
could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in 
such products and have a material adverse impact on our 
assets under management and asset management revenues and 
earnings.

We operate in a highly competitive environment, in terms 
of the products and services we offer and the geographic 
markets in which we conduct business, as well as in our 
labor markets where we compete for talented employees. 
Competition could adversely impact our customer 
acquisition, growth and retention, as well as our credit 
spreads and product pricing, causing us to lose market 
share and deposits and revenues.

We are subject to intense competition from various financial 
institutions as well as from non-bank entities that engage in 
many similar activities without being subject to bank 
regulatory supervision and restrictions. This competition is 
described in Item 1 of this Report under “Competition.” 

In all, the principal bases for competition are pricing 
(including the interest rates charged on loans or paid on 
interest-bearing deposits), product structure, the range of 
products and services offered and the quality of customer 
service (including convenience and responsiveness to 
customer needs and concerns). The ability to access and use 
technology is an increasingly important competitive factor in 
the financial services industry. Having the right technology is 
a critically important component to customer satisfaction as it 
affects our ability to deliver the products and services that 
customers desire and in a manner that they find convenient 
and attractive. Banks generally are facing the risk of increased 
competition from products and services offered by non-bank 
financial technology companies, particularly related to 
payment services and lending.

20    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

Consolidation in our industry, including among smaller banks 
combining to form more competitive larger ones and between 
banks and non-bank entities offering financial products and 
services, could result in PNC facing more intense competition, 
particularly in impacted regions or with respect to particular 
products. 

Another increasingly competitive factor in the financial 
services industry is the competition to attract and retain 
talented employees across many of our business and support 
areas. This factor presents greater risk when we are expanding 
into new markets, developing new product lines, or need to 
significantly enhance staffing in certain areas. This 
competition leads to increased expenses in many business 
areas and can also cause us to not pursue certain business 
opportunities. Limitations on the manner in which regulated 
financial institutions can compensate their officers and 
employees, including those contained in pending rule 
proposals implementing requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, 
may make it more difficult for regulated financial institutions, 
including PNC, to compete with unregulated financial 
institutions for talent.

A failure to adequately address the competitive pressures we 
face could make it harder for us to attract and retain customers 
across our businesses. On the other hand, meeting these 
competitive pressures could require us to incur significant 
additional expense or to accept risk beyond what we would 
otherwise view as desirable under the circumstances. In 
addition, in our interest rate sensitive businesses, pressures to 
increase rates on deposits or decrease rates on loans could 
reduce our net interest margin with a resulting negative impact 
on our net interest income.

We continually encounter technological change and need 
to keep pace with this change in order to maintain or 
enhance the competitiveness of our businesses.

The financial services industry is undergoing rapid 
technological change with frequent introductions of new 
technology-driven products and services. Examples at the 
present time include expanded use of cloud computing, 
artificial intelligence and machine learning, virtual and 
augmented reality, biometric authentication, voice and natural 
language, and data protection enhancements, as well as 
increased on-line and mobile device interaction with 
customers. The effective use of technology increases 
efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve 
customers and to reduce costs. We have been investing in 
technology and connectivity in order to automate functions 
previously performed manually, to facilitate the ability of 
customers to engage in financial transactions, and otherwise to 
enhance the customer experience with respect to our products 
and services. On the retail side, this has included 
developments such as more sophisticated ATMs (including the 
ability to cash checks using exact change), cashless bank 
branches, and expanded access to banking transactions 
(including mobile deposits, instant availability of funds, and 
real time payment processing) through the internet, smart 
phones, tablets and other mobile devices. These efforts have 

all been in response to actual and anticipated customer 
behavior and expectations. Our continued success depends, in 
part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by 
using technology to provide products and services that satisfy 
customer demands, including demands for faster and more 
secure payment services, and create efficiencies in our 
operations. A failure to maintain or enhance our competitive 
position with respect to technology, whether because we fail to 
anticipate customer expectations or because our technological 
developments fail to perform as desired or are not rolled out in 
a timely manner, may cause us to lose market share or incur 
additional expense.

We depend on the effectiveness and integrity of our 
employees, systems and controls to manage operational 
risks.

We are a large organization that offers a wide variety of 
products and services to a broad and diverse group of 
customers. We are dependent on our employees, systems and 
controls to assure that we properly enter into, record and 
manage processes, transactions and other relationships with 
customers, suppliers and other parties with whom we do 
business, as well as to assure that we identify and mitigate the 
risks that are inherent in these relationships.

We necessarily rely on our employees or, in some cases, 
employees of third parties to perform these tasks and manage 
the resulting risks. As a result, we are vulnerable to human 
error, misconduct or malfeasance, leading potentially to 
operational breakdowns or other errors. In addition, when we 
change processes or procedures or introduce new products or 
services, we may fail to adequately identify or manage 
operational risks resulting from such changes. We have taken 
measures to manage and mitigate this risk, but our controls 
may not be adequate to prevent problems resulting from 
human involvement in our business, including risks associated 
with the design, operation and monitoring of automated 
systems.

Errors by our employees or those of third parties, whether 
accidental, intentional or fraudulent, or other failures of our 
systems and controls, including systems and controls that are 
automated, could result in customer remediation costs, 
regulatory fines or penalties, litigation or enforcement actions, 
or limitations on our business activities. They also could result 
in damage to our reputation and to our ability to attract and 
retain customers, with the reputational impact likely greater to 
the extent that the mistakes or failures are pervasive, long-
standing or affect a significant number of customers, 
particularly retail consumers. It is possible that the damage to 
our reputation may be disproportionate to the actual harm 
suffered by our customers or may be severe even if we fully 
remediate any harm suffered by our customers.

It is not possible to prevent all errors of these types, and over 
the last several years, financial services organizations have 
been reported to have failed to adequately prevent, identify or 
respond to a broad range of operational risk matters with 
resulting consequences to the other organizations of the types 

described above. Recent examples include unauthorized 
account openings, assessment of inappropriate fees, and 
failure to report information timely to the government.

We depend on technology, both internally and through 
third-parties, to conduct our business and could suffer a 
material adverse impact from interruptions in the effective 
operation of, or security breaches affecting, those systems.

As a large financial company, we handle a substantial volume 
of customer and other financial transactions on a continuous 
basis. As a result, we rely heavily on information systems to 
conduct our business and to process, record and monitor our 
transactions and those of our customers. Over time, we have 
increased substantially in size, scope and complexity. We have 
also seen more customer usage of technological solutions for 
financial needs as well as higher expectations of customers 
and regulators regarding effective and safe systems operation. 
We expect these trends to continue for the foreseeable future. 
The need to ensure proper functioning and resiliency of these 
systems has become more challenging, and the costs involved 
in that effort are greater than ever.

The risks to these systems result from a variety of factors, both 
internal and external. In some cases, these factors relate to the 
potential for bad acts on the part of hackers, criminals, foreign 
governments or their agents, employees and others, and to 
some extent will be beyond our ability to prevent. In other 
cases, our systems could fail to operate as needed, including 
failures to prevent access in an unauthorized manner, due to 
factors such as design or performance issues, human error, 
unexpected transaction volumes or inadequate measures to 
protect against unauthorized access or transmissions. We are 
also at risk for the impact of natural or other disasters, 
terrorism, international hostilities and the like on our systems 
or for the effect of outages or other failures involving power, 
communications, or payment, clearing and settlement systems 
operated by others. In addition, we face a variety of types of 
cyber attacks, some of which are discussed in more detail 
below. Cyber attacks often include efforts to disrupt our ability 
to provide services or to gain access to, or destroy, 
confidential or proprietary company and customer 
information.

We rely on other companies for the provision of a broad range 
of products and services. Many of these products and services 
rely on information systems maintained by third parties or 
involve the use of such systems in connection with providing 
our products or services. In some cases, these other companies 
provide the infrastructure that supports communications, 
payment, clearing and settlement systems, or information 
processing and storage. These other companies are generally 
subject to many of the same risks we face with respect to our 
systems. To the extent we rely on these other companies, we 
could be adversely affected if they are impacted by system 
failures, cyber attacks or employee misconduct.

All of these types of events, whether resulting from cyber 
attacks or other internal or external sources, expose customer 
and other confidential information to security risks. They also 

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  21

could disrupt our ability to use our accounting, deposit, loan 
and other systems and could cause errors in transactions or 
system functionality with customers, vendors or other parties.

In addition, our customers often use their own devices, such as 
computers, smartphones and tablets, to do business with us 
and may provide their PNC customer information (including 
passwords) to a third party in connection with obtaining 
services from the third party. Although we take steps to 
provide safety and security for our customers’ transactions 
with us and their customer information to the extent they are 
utilizing their own devices or providing third parties access to 
their accounts, our ability to assure such safety and security is 
necessarily limited.

We are faced with ongoing efforts by others to breach data 
security at financial institutions or with respect to financial 
transactions. Some of these involve efforts to enter our 
systems directly by going through or around our security 
protections. Others involve the use of schemes such as 
“phishing” to gain access to identifying customer information, 
often from customers themselves. Most corporate and 
commercial transactions are now handled electronically, and 
our retail customers increasingly use online access and mobile 
devices to bank with us. The ability to conduct business with 
us in this manner depends on the transmission of confidential 
information, which increases the risk of data security 
breaches.

As our customers regularly use PNC-issued credit and debit 
cards to pay for transactions with retailers and other 
businesses, there is the risk of data security breaches at those 
other businesses covering PNC account information. When 
our customers use PNC-issued cards to make purchases from 
those businesses, card account information may be provided to 
the business. If the business’s systems that process or store 
card account information are subject to a data security breach, 
holders of our cards who have made purchases from that 
business may experience fraud on their card accounts. We may 
suffer losses associated with reimbursing our customers for 
such fraudulent transactions on customers’ card accounts, as 
well as for other costs related to data security compromise 
events, such as replacing cards associated with compromised 
card accounts. In addition, we provide card transaction 
processing services to some merchant customers under 
agreements we have with payment networks such as Visa and 
MasterCard. Under these agreements, we may be responsible 
for certain losses and penalties if one of our merchant 
customers suffers a data security breach.

Over the last few years, several large companies disclosed that 
they had suffered substantial data security breaches 
compromising millions of user accounts and credentials. To 
date, our losses and costs related to these breaches have not 
been material, but other similar events in the future could be 
more significant to us.

There have been other recent publicly announced cyber 
attacks that were not focused on gaining access to credit card 
or user credential information but instead sought access to a 

22    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

range of other types of confidential information including 
internal emails and other forms of customer financial 
information. Ransomware attacks have sought to deny access 
to data and possibly shut down systems and devices 
maintained by target companies. In a ransomware attack, 
system data is encrypted or access is otherwise denied, 
accompanied by a demand for ransom to restore access to the 
data. 

Other types of attacks in recent years have included distributed 
denial of service (DDoS) attacks, in which individuals or 
organizations flood commercial websites with extraordinarily 
high volumes of traffic with the goal of disrupting the ability 
of commercial enterprises to process transactions and possibly 
making their websites unavailable to customers for extended 
periods of time. We (as well as other financial services 
companies) have been subject to such attacks.

To date, these types of attacks have not had a material 
financial impact on us, but attacks on others demonstrate the 
risks posed by new and evolving types of cyber attacks. We 
could suffer material financial and reputational losses in the 
future from any of these or other types of attacks.

Methods used by others to attack information systems change 
frequently (with generally increasing sophistication), often are 
not recognized until launched against a target, may be 
supported by foreign governments or other well-financed 
entities, and may originate from less regulated and remote 
areas around the world. As a result, we may be unable to 
address these methods in advance of attacks, including our 
inability to implement adequate preventive measures.

In addition to threats from people external to us, insider threats 
represent a significant risk to us. Insiders, having legitimate 
access to our systems and the information contained in them, 
have the easiest opportunity to make inappropriate use of the 
systems and information. Addressing that risk requires 
understanding not only how to protect us from unauthorized 
use and disclosure of data, but also how to engage behaviorial 
analytics to identify potential internal threats before any 
damage is done.

We have policies, procedures and systems (including business 
continuity programs) designed to prevent or limit the effect of 
possible failures, interruptions or breaches in security of 
information systems. We design our business continuity and 
other information and technology risk management programs 
to manage our capabilities to provide services in the case of an 
event resulting in material disruptions of business activities 
affecting our employees, facilities, technology or suppliers. 
We regularly seek to test the effectiveness of and enhance 
these policies, procedures and systems. Nonetheless, we 
cannot guarantee the effectiveness of our policies, procedures 
and systems to protect us in any particular future situation.

Our ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such 
occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our business 
continuity planning, our ability to understand threats to us 
from a holistic perspective, and our ability to anticipate the 

timing and nature of any such event that occurs. The adverse 
impact of natural and other disasters, terrorist activities, 
international hostilities and the like could be increased to the 
extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of 
national or regional governments, including emergency 
responders, or on the part of other organizations and 
businesses with which we deal, particularly those on which we 
depend, many of which we have little or no control over.

In recent years, we have incurred significant expense towards 
improving the reliability of our systems and their security 
against external and internal threats. Even with our proactive 
and defensive measures in place, there remains the risk that 
one or more adverse events might occur. If one does occur, we 
might not be able to remediate the event or its consequences 
timely or adequately, particularly to the extent that it 
represents a novel or unusual threat. To the extent that the risk 
relates to products or services provided by others, we seek to 
engage in due diligence and monitoring to limit the risk, but 
here, as well, we cannot eliminate it. Should an adverse event 
affecting another company’s systems occur, we may not have 
indemnification or other protection from the other company 
sufficient to compensate us or otherwise protect us from the 
consequences.

The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach 
of any of our information or communications systems, or the 
systems of other companies on which we rely, could result in a 
wide variety of adverse consequences to us. This risk is 
greater if the issue is widespread or results in financial losses 
to our customers. Possible adverse consequences include 
damage to our reputation or a loss of customer business. We 
also could face litigation or additional regulatory scrutiny, 
which in turn could lead to liability or other sanctions, 
including fines and penalties or reimbursement of customers 
adversely affected by a systems problem or security breach. 
Even if we do not suffer any material adverse consequences as 
a result of events affecting us directly, successful attacks or 
systems failures at other financial institutions could lead to a 
general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions, 
including us. Also, systems problems, including those 
resulting from third party attacks, whether at PNC or at our 
competitors, would likely broadly increase regulatory and 
customer concerns regarding the functioning, safety and 
security of such systems. In that case, we would expect to 
incur even higher levels of costs with respect to prevention 
and mitigation of these risks.

There are risks resulting from the extensive use of models 
in our business.

We rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to 
estimate certain financial values. Models may be used in such 
processes as determining the pricing of various products, 
grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and 
other market risks, predicting or estimating losses, assessing 
capital adequacy, and calculating economic and regulatory 
capital levels, as well as to estimate the value of financial 
instruments and balance sheet items. Poorly designed or 
implemented models present the risk that our business 

decisions based on information incorporating model output 
will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that 
information. Also, information we provide to the public or to 
our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented 
models could be inaccurate or misleading. Some of the 
decisions that our regulators make, including those related to 
capital distributions to our shareholders, could be affected 
adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models 
used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.

Our business and financial results could be impacted 
materially by adverse results in legal proceedings.

Many aspects of our business involve substantial risk of legal 
liability. We have been named or threatened to be named as 
defendants in various lawsuits arising from our business 
activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies 
we have acquired). In addition, we are regularly the subject of 
governmental investigations and other forms of regulatory 
inquiry. We also are at risk when we have agreed to indemnify 
others for losses related to legal proceedings they face, 
including litigation and governmental investigations and 
inquiries, such as in connection with the sale of a business or 
assets by us. The results of these legal proceedings could lead 
to significant monetary damages or penalties, restrictions on 
the way in which we conduct our business, or reputational 
harm.

Although we establish accruals for legal proceedings when 
information related to the loss contingencies represented by 
those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the 
amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, we do not have 
accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss. 
In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments 
and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, 
amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us 
from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, our ultimate 
losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the 
amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies. We discuss 
further the unpredictability of legal proceedings and describe 
certain of our pending legal proceedings in Note 19 Legal 
Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial 
Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

We grow our business in part by acquiring other financial 
services companies or assets from time to time, and these 
acquisitions present a number of risks and uncertainties 
related both to the acquisition transactions themselves and 
to the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC 
after closing.

Acquisitions of other financial services companies, financial 
assets and related deposits and other liabilities present risks 
and uncertainties to us in addition to those presented by the 
nature of the business acquired.

In general, acquisitions may be substantially more expensive 
or take longer to complete than anticipated (including 
unanticipated costs incurred in connection with the integration 
of the acquired company). Anticipated benefits (including 
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  23

could lead, for example, to an increase in delinquencies, 
bankruptcies or defaults that could result in our experiencing 
higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and 
provisions for credit losses.

Our ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such 
occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our 
resiliency planning, and our ability, if any, to anticipate the 
nature of any such event that occurs. The adverse impact of 
disasters or terrorist activities or international hostilities also 
could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of 
preparedness on the part of national or regional emergency 
responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses 
that we deal with, particularly those that we depend upon but 
have no control over.

ITEM 1B – UNRESOLVED STAFF 
COMMENTS
There are no SEC staff comments regarding PNC’s periodic or 
current reports under the Exchange Act that are pending 
resolution.

ITEM 2 – PROPERTIES
Our executive and primary administrative offices are currently 
located at The Tower at PNC Plaza, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
The 33-story structure is owned by PNC Bank, National 
Association.

We own or lease numerous other premises for use in 
conducting business activities, including operations centers, 
offices, and branches and other facilities. We consider the 
facilities owned or occupied under lease by our subsidiaries to 
be adequate for the purposes of our business operations. We 
include here by reference the additional information regarding 
our properties in Note 8 Premises, Equipment and Leasehold 
Improvements in the Notes To Consolidated Financial 
Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

ITEM 3 – LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
See the information set forth in Note 19 Legal Proceedings in 
the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of 
this Report, which is incorporated here by reference.

ITEM 4 – MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES
Not applicable

anticipated cost savings and strategic gains, for example 
resulting from being able to offer product sets to a broader 
potential customer base) may be significantly harder or take 
longer to achieve than expected or may not be achieved in 
their entirety as a result of unexpected factors or events.

Our ability to achieve anticipated results from acquisitions is 
often dependent also on the extent of credit losses in acquired 
loan portfolios and the extent of deposit attrition, which are, in 
part, related to the state of economic and financial markets.

Also, litigation and governmental investigations that may be 
pending at the time of the acquisition or be filed or 
commenced thereafter, as a result of an acquisition or 
otherwise, could impact the timing or realization of anticipated 
benefits to us. 

Integration of an acquired company’s business and operations 
into PNC, including conversion of the acquired company’s 
different systems and procedures, may take longer or be more 
costly than originally anticipated or have unanticipated 
adverse results relating to the acquired company’s or our 
existing businesses. In some cases, acquisitions involve our 
entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets, 
and these situations also present risks and uncertainties in 
instances where we may be inexperienced in these new areas.

Our ability to analyze the risks presented by prospective 
acquisitions, as well as our ability to prepare in advance of 
closing for integration, depends, in part, on the information we 
can gather with respect to the target, which is more limited 
than the information we have regarding companies we already 
own. As a regulated financial institution, our ability to pursue 
or complete attractive acquisition opportunities could be 
negatively impacted by regulatory delays or other regulatory 
issues. In addition, our ability to make large acquisitions in the 
future may be negatively impacted by regulatory rules or 
future regulatory initiatives designed to limit systemic risk and 
the potential for a financial institution to become “too big to 
fail.”

Our business and financial performance could be 
adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by disasters, 
natural or otherwise, by terrorist activities or by 
international hostilities.

Neither the occurrence nor the potential impact of disasters 
(such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and other 
severe weather conditions, pandemics, dislocations, fires, 
explosions, and other catastrophic accidents or events), 
terrorist activities and international hostilities can be 
predicted. However, these occurrences could impact us 
directly (for example, by causing significant damage to our 
facilities or preventing us from conducting our business in the 
ordinary course), or indirectly as a result of their impact on 
our borrowers, depositors, other customers, suppliers or other 
counterparties. We could also suffer adverse consequences to 
the extent that disasters, terrorist activities or international 
hostilities affect the financial markets or the economy in 
general or in any particular region. These types of impacts

PART II
ITEM 5 – MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S 
COMMON EQUITY, RELATED 
STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER 
PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

(a) (1) Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock 
Exchange and is traded under the symbol “PNC.” At the close 
of business on February 16, 2018, there were 57,157 common 
shareholders of record.

Holders of PNC common stock are entitled to receive 
dividends when declared by our Board of Directors out of 
funds legally available for this purpose. Our Board of 
Directors may not pay or set apart dividends on the common 
stock until dividends for all past dividend periods on any 
series of outstanding preferred stock and certain outstanding 
capital securities issued by the parent company have been paid 
or declared and set apart for payment. The Board of Directors 
presently intends to continue the policy of paying quarterly 
cash dividends. The amount of any future dividends will 
depend on economic and market conditions, our financial 
condition and operating results, and other factors, including 
contractual restrictions and applicable government regulations 
and policies (such as those relating to the ability of bank and 
non-bank subsidiaries to pay dividends to the parent company 
and regulatory capital limitations). The amount of our 
dividend is also currently subject to the results of the 
supervisory assessment of capital adequacy and capital 
planning processes undertaken by the Federal Reserve and our 
primary bank regulators as part of the Comprehensive Capital 
Analysis and Review (CCAR) process as described in the 
Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 of this Report.

The Federal Reserve has the power to prohibit us from paying 
dividends without its approval. For further information 
concerning dividend restrictions and other factors that could 
limit our ability to pay dividends, as well as restrictions on 
loans, dividends or advances from bank subsidiaries to the 
parent company, see the Supervision and Regulation section in 
Item 1, Item 1A Risk Factors, the Capital and Liquidity 
Management portion of the Risk Management section in Item 
7, and Note 10 Borrowed Funds, Note 15 Equity and Note 18 
Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial 
Statements in Item 8 of this Report, which we include here by 
reference.

We include here by reference additional information relating 
to PNC common stock under the Common Stock Prices/
Dividends Declared section in the Statistical Information 
(Unaudited) section of Item 8 of this Report.

We include here by reference the information regarding our 
compensation plans under which PNC equity securities are 
authorized for issuance as of December 31, 2017 in the table 
(with introductory paragraph and notes) in Item 12 of this 
Report.

(a) 

Includes PNC common stock purchased in connection with our various 
employee benefit plans generally related to forfeitures of unvested 
restricted stock awards and shares used to cover employee payroll tax 
withholding requirements. Note 11 Employee Benefit Plans and Note 12 
Stock Based Compensation Plans in the Notes To Consolidated 
Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report include additional 
information regarding our employee benefit and equity compensation 
plans that use PNC common stock.

(b)  On March 11 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors approved 

the establishment of a stock repurchase program authorization in the 
amount of 100 million shares of PNC common stock, effective April 1, 
2015. Repurchases are made in open market or privately negotiated 
transactions and the timing and exact amount of common stock 
repurchases will depend on a number of factors including, among others, 
market and general economic conditions, regulatory capital 
considerations, alternative uses of capital, the potential impact on our 
credit ratings, and contractual and regulatory limitations, including the 
results of the supervisory assessment of capital adequacy and capital 
planning processes undertaken by the Federal Reserve as part of the 
CCAR process. In June 2017, we announced share repurchase programs 
of up to $2.7 billion for the four quarter period beginning with the third 
quarter of 2017, including repurchases of up to $300 million related to 
employee benefit plans, in accordance with PNC's 2017 capital plan. In 
the fourth quarter of 2017,we repurchased 3.7 million shares of common 
stock on the open market, with an average price of $139.05 per share 
and an aggregate repurchase price of $.5 billion. See the Liquidity and 
Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in Item 7 
of this Report for more information on the share repurchase programs 
for the period July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018 included in the 2017 
capital plan accepted by the Federal Reserve.

Common Stock Performance Graph
This graph shows the cumulative total shareholder return (i.e., 
price change plus reinvestment of dividends) on our common 
stock during the five-year period ended December 31, 2017, as 
compared with: (1) a selected peer group as set forth below 
and referred to as the “Peer Group;” (2) an overall stock 
market index, the S&P 500 Index; and (3) a published industry 
index, the S&P 500 Banks. The yearly points marked on the 
horizontal axis of the graph correspond to December 31 of 
each year. The stock performance graph assumes that $100 
was invested on January 1, 2013 for the five-year period and 
that any dividends were reinvested. The table below the graph 
shows the resultant compound annual growth rate for the 
performance period.

Includes assets and liabilities for which we have elected the fair value option. See the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Note 6 Fair Value in Item 8 of this Report for additional 
information.
Includes balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland of $28.3 billion, $25.1 billion, $30.0 billion, $31.4 billion and $11.7 billion as of December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015, 
2014 and 2013, respectively.
Includes our equity interest in BlackRock.
Includes long-term borrowings of $43.1 billion, $38.3 billion, $43.6 billion, $41.5 billion and $27.6 billion for 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Borrowings which mature 
more than one year after December 31, 2017 are considered to be long-term.

(e)  As a result of certain investment advisory services performed by one of our registered investment advisors, certain assets were previously reported as both discretionary client assets 

under management and nondiscretionary client assets under administration. Effective for the first quarter of 2017, these amounts are only reported as discretionary assets under 
management. Prior periods were adjusted to remove amounts previously included in nondiscretionary assets under administration of approximately $9 billion, $6 billion, $5 billion and 
$4 billion at December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

(f)  Calculated as taxable-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets. To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest margins, we use net interest income on a 
taxable-equivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable 
investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP in the Consolidated Income Statement. For additional information, see Reconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest 
Income Statistical Information (Unaudited) in Item 8 of this Report.

(g)  The full year 2017 results benefited from the new federal tax legislation. Certain tax legislation amounts are considered reasonable estimates as of December 31, 2017. See the Critical 

Accounting Estimates and Judgments section in Item 7 of this Report for additional details. 

(h)  Calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to us during each period presented. 
(i) 

See capital ratios discussion in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 and in the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in Item 7 of this 
Report for additional discussion on these capital ratios.
See additional information on the pro forma ratios, Transitional Basel III ratios and the Basel I ratios in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section in Item 8 of this Report.

(j) 
(k)  The pro forma ratios for all periods presented were calculated under the standardized approach. The 2013 ratio has not been updated to reflect the first quarter 2014 adoption of ASU 

2014-01 related to investments in low income housing tax credits.

In addition, our success will depend upon, among other things:
•  Effectively managing capital and liquidity including:

•  Continuing to maintain and grow our deposit 

• 

base as a low-cost stable funding source;
Prudent liquidity and capital management to 
meet evolving regulatory capital, capital 
planning, stress testing and liquidity 
standards; and

•  Actions we take within the capital and other 

financial markets.

•  Management of credit risk in our portfolio;
•  Execution of our strategic priorities;
•  Our ability to manage and implement strategic 

business objectives within the changing regulatory 
environment;

•  The impact of legal and regulatory-related 

contingencies; and

•  The appropriateness of reserves needed for critical 

accounting estimates and related contingencies.

Our outlook for certain financial information for full year and 
first quarter 2018 is compared to full year and fourth quarter 
2017 results as adjusted for the tax legislation and significant 
items described in the Income Statement Highlights section of 
this Executive Summary. For additional information on 
financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017, see the 
Selected Quarterly Financial Data section in the Statistical 
Information (Unaudited) section of Item 8 of this Report.

For full year 2018 compared to full year 2017 on an adjusted 
basis, we expect:

•  Loan growth to be up mid-single digits, on a 

•  Revenue to increase mid-single digits, on a 

percentage basis;

percentage basis;

•  Noninterest expense to increase by low-single digits, 

on a percentage basis; and

•  The effective tax rate to be approximately 17%.

For the first quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of  
2017 on an adjusted basis, we expect:

•  Modest loan growth;
• 
• 

Stable net interest income;
Fee income to decrease by low mid-single digits, on a 
percentage basis, mainly attributable to lower first 
quarter client activity and elevated fourth quarter fees. 
Fee income consists of asset management, consumer 
services, corporate services, residential mortgage and 
service charges on deposits;

•  Other noninterest income to be between $250 million 

and $300 million;
Provision for credit losses to be between $100 million 
and $150 million; and

•  Noninterest expense to decrease by low-single digits, 

• 

on a percentage basis.

See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk 
Management section of this Item 7 for more detail on our 2017 
capital and liquidity actions as well as our capital ratios.

Our ability to take certain capital actions, including plans to 
pay or increase common stock dividends or to repurchase 
shares under current or future programs, is subject to the 
results of the supervisory assessment of capital adequacy 
undertaken by the Federal Reserve as part of the CCAR 
process. For additional information, see the Supervision and 
Regulation section in Item 1 Business of this Report.
 
Business Outlook
Statements regarding our business outlook are forward-
looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation 
Reform Act of 1995. Our forward-looking statements are 
subject to the risk that economic and financial market 
conditions will be substantially different than those we are 
currently expecting and do not take into account potential 
legal and regulatory contingencies. These statements are based 
on our current view that U.S. economic growth will accelerate 
somewhat in 2018, in light of the recently passed corporate 
and personal income tax cuts that are expected to support 
business investment and consumer spending, respectively. 
Further gradual improvement in the labor market this year, 
including job gains and rising wages, is another positive for 
consumer spending. Other sources of growth for the U.S. 
economy in 2018 will be the global economic expansion and 
the housing market. Although inflation slowed in 2017, it 
should pick up as the labor market continues to tighten. Short-
term interest rates and bond yields are expected to rise 
throughout 2018; PNC’s baseline forecast is for three 
increases in the federal funds rate in 2018, pushing the rate to 
a range of 2.00 to 2.25 percent by the end of the year. Longer-
term rates are also expected to increase as the Federal Reserve 
slowly reduces the size of its balance sheet and the federal 
government borrows more, but at a slower pace than short-
term rates, so we anticipate the yield curve will flatten but not 
invert. See the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-
Looking Information section in this Item 7 and Item 1A Risk 
Factors in this Report for other factors that could cause future 
events to differ, perhaps materially, from those anticipated in 
these forward-looking statements.

CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW
Our Consolidated Income Statement is presented in Item 8 of this Report.

Net income for 2017 was $5.4 billion, or $10.36 per diluted common share, an increase of 35% compared with $4.0 billion, or $7.30 
per diluted common share, for 2016. Higher net income was driven by an 8% increase in total revenue and a tax benefit from the new 
federal tax legislation, partially offset by a 10% increase in noninterest expense. Revenue growth resulted from a 9% increase in net 
interest income and a 7% increase in noninterest income.

(a) 

Interest income calculated as taxable-equivalent interest income. To provide more meaningful comparisons of interest income and yields for all interest-earning assets, as 
well as net interest margins, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income 
earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated 
Income Statement. For more information, see Reconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section in Item 8 of this 
Report.

Changes in net interest income and margin result from the 
interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning 
assets and related yields, interest-bearing liabilities and related 
rates paid, and noninterest-bearing sources of funding. See the 
Statistical Information (Unaudited) – Average Consolidated 
Balance Sheet And Net Interest Analysis and Analysis Of 
Year-To-Year Changes In Net Interest Income in Item 8 of this 
Report.

Net interest income increased $717 million, or 9%, in 2017 
compared with 2016 due to increases in loan and securities 
balances and yields, partially offset by an increase in 
borrowing and deposit costs. Net interest margin increased 
largely reflecting the benefit to loans and securities yields 
from higher interest rates in 2017.

Average investment securities increased $3.0 billion, or 4%, 
reflecting net purchases of U.S. Treasury and government 
agency securities of $2.9 billion and agency residential 
mortgage-backed securities of $2.8 billion, partially offset by 
declines in average commercial mortgage-backed securities of 
$1.6 billion and non-agency residential mortgage-backed 
securities of $.8 billion. Total investment securities were 23% 
of average interest-earning assets in both 2017 and 2016.

Average loans grew by $8.5 billion, or 4%, reflecting an 
increase in average commercial lending of $8.4 billion driven 
by broad-based growth in our Corporate Banking, Real Estate, 
Equipment Finance and Business Credit businesses in our 
Commercial & Institutional Banking segment. Growth in 
Equipment Finance included the impact of the acquisition of a 
commercial and vendor finance business with $1.0 billion of 
loans and leases in the second quarter of 2017. Average 
consumer lending increased $.1 billion in the comparison, as 
growth in average residential real estate, automobile and credit 
card loans was substantially offset by declines in average 
home equity and education loans. These declines reflected 
run-off in the non-strategic consumer loan portfolios of 
brokered home equity and government guaranteed education 
loans. Average loans represented 67% of average interest-
earning assets in 2017 compared to 66% in 2016.

Average total deposits increased $7.2 billion, or 3%, primarily 
due to growth in average interest-bearing deposits of $6.7 
billion, or 4%, driven by higher average savings deposits of 
$13.1 billion. This increase reflected a shift, in part, to 
relationship-based savings products from money market 
deposits, which decreased $9.2 billion. Additionally, average 
interest-bearing demand deposits grew $4.3 billion, mainly 
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  33

attributable to the higher interest rate environment and 
customer growth. Average interest-bearing deposits 
represented 76% of average interest-bearing liabilities in 2017 
compared to 77% in 2016.

Further details regarding average loans and deposits are 
included in the Business Segments Review section of this Item 
7.

Noninterest income as a percentage of total revenue was 44% 
for 2017 and 45% for 2016.

Asset management revenue increased reflecting higher 
earnings from our equity investment in BlackRock, including 
a $254 million flow through impact of the new federal tax 
legislation on our equity investment. Additionally, the impact 
of stronger equity markets contributed to the increase. 
Discretionary client assets under management in our Asset 
Management Group segment increased to $151 billion at 
December 31, 2017 compared with $137 billion at 
December 31, 2016, primarily attributable to higher equity 
markets.

Growth in consumer service fees was primarily due to a $25 
million increase in credit card fees, net of rewards, and debit 
card fees, which reflected continued momentum in customer 
activity in both transaction trends and customer growth. In 
addition, brokerage fees increased $17 million, driven by 
higher brokerage assets under management. These increases 
were partially offset by individually insignificant items. 

Corporate services revenue reflected broad based growth, 
including higher merger and acquisition (M&A) advisory fees 
of $65 million and an increase in loan syndication and agency 
fees of $28 million, both of which reflected continued 
momentum in the M&A market. Higher treasury management 
revenue also contributed to the increase in corporate services 
revenue.

Lower residential mortgage revenue reflected a decline of 
$122 million in residential mortgage servicing rights 
valuation, net of economic hedge, which included a $71 
million negative adjustment for mortgage servicing rights fair 
value assumption updates in the fourth quarter of 2017. In 
addition, the decrease reflected lower loan sales revenue of 

34    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

$85 million, which was driven by lower origination volume 
and compressed pricing margins.

Higher service charges on deposits reflected net growth of $30 
million related to fee income on personal deposit accounts, 
reflecting higher levels of customer activity.

The increase in other noninterest income included higher 
revenue from private equity investments of $172 million and 
$119 million for the appreciation of BlackRock common stock 
used to fund PNC's fourth quarter 2017 contribution to the 
PNC Foundation. The increase in revenue from private equity 
investments reflected positive impacts from valuation 
adjustments on equity investments subject to the Volcker Rule 
provision of Dodd-Frank. Additionally, operating lease income 
increased related to the commercial and vendor finance 
business acquired in the second quarter of 2017. 

These increases were largely offset by the impact of negative 
derivative fair value adjustments related to Visa Class B 
common shares of $280 million in 2017, including $248 
million in the fourth quarter primarily related to the extension 
of anticipated timing of litigation resolution. Derivative fair 
value adjustments relate to swap agreements with purchasers 
of Visa shares in connection with all prior sales to date. In 
2016, gains on sales of Visa Class B common shares, net of 
derivative fair value adjustments, were $32 million.

Other noninterest income typically fluctuates from period to 
period depending on the nature and magnitude of transactions 
completed. Further details regarding our customer-related 
trading activities are included in the Market Risk 
Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk portion of the 
Risk Management section of this Item 7. Further details 
regarding private and other equity investments are included in 
the Market Risk Management – Equity and Other Investment 
Risk section, and further details regarding gains or losses 
related to our equity investment in BlackRock are included in 
the Business Segments Review section of this Item 7.

Effective for the first quarter of 2018, and as a result of the 
commercial and vendor finance business we acquired in the 
second quarter of 2017, we intend to classify operating lease 
income as corporate services noninterest income on the 
Consolidated Income Statement. In 2017 and prior years, this 
revenue was classified as other noninterest income, and these 
periods will be reclassified to reflect this change.

Provision for Credit Losses
Overall credit quality remained stable in 2017. The provision 
for credit losses was $441 million compared to $433 million in 
2016. The provision for 2017 reflected loan growth, including 
an initial provision for the loan and lease portfolio obtained 
through the business acquired in the second quarter of 2017, 
mostly offset by lower provisions in the oil, gas and coal 
sectors. 

The Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management 
section of this Item 7 includes additional information 
regarding factors impacting the provision for credit losses.

Noninterest expense increased reflecting higher levels of 
business activity and ongoing investments in technology and 
business infrastructure. The increase in personnel expense also 
included the fourth quarter 2017 announcement of employee 
cash payments and pension account credits totaling $105 
million. In addition, charges for real estate dispositions and 
exits, including data centers, totaled $197 million in the fourth 
quarter of 2017, primarily within other noninterest expense.

Other noninterest expense for 2017 included the fourth quarter 
$200 million contribution of BlackRock common stock to the 
PNC Foundation. Contributions to the PNC Foundation in 
2016 were $75 million.

During 2017, we completed actions and achieved our 2017 
continuous improvement program savings goal of 
$350 million, which funded a significant portion of our 
business and technology investments, including our Retail 
branch strategy, enhanced digital capabilities and our home 
lending transformation. In 2018, we have a goal of 
$250 million in cost savings through our continuous 
improvement program, which we expect will partially fund 
our ongoing business and technology investments.

Effective Income Tax Rate
An income tax benefit of $1.2 billion was recorded in the 
fourth quarter of 2017 related to the new tax legislation and 
was primarily attributable to the revaluation of net deferred tax 
liabilities at the lower statutory tax rate of 21%. As a result, 
the effective income tax rate for 2017 was 1.9% compared 
with 24.1% for 2016. Certain tax legislation amounts are 
considered reasonable estimates as of December 31, 2017. See 
the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section in 
this Item 7 for additional details. 

The effective tax rate is generally lower than the statutory rate 
primarily due to tax credits we receive from our investments 
in low income housing and new markets investments, as well 
as earnings in other tax exempt investments. 

Additional information regarding our effective tax rate is 
included in the Reconciliation of Statutory and Effective Tax 
Rates table in Note 17 Income Taxes in the Notes To 
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.

In Corporate Banking, commercial loans increased $3.9 
billion, or 8%, largely due to increased lending related to 
M&A activity and strong growth in middle market lending. In 
Business Credit, new originations and higher utilization 
resulted in an increase of $2.0 billion, or 14%, in the 
comparison. 

Additionally, commercial loans and equipment lease financing 
loans increased as a result of new production in the Equipment 
Finance business, as well as the acquisition of a commercial 
and vendor finance business with $1.0 billion of loans and 
leases during the second quarter of 2017.

For commercial loans by industry and commercial real estate 
loans by geography, see Loan Portfolio Characteristics and 
Analysis in the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk 
Management section in this Item 7.

Growth in consumer lending balances was driven by higher 
residential real estate, automobile and credit card loans, 
partially offset by lower home equity and education loans. 

Residential real estate loans increased as a result of growth in 
originations of nonconforming residential mortgage loans, 
both nationwide and within our branch network. 
Nonconforming residential mortgage loans are those with loan 
amounts above government agency standards for conforming 
loan amount limits. 

Automobile loans grew in part due to continued expansion in 
our Southeast markets. Higher credit card balances reflected 
an increase in new accounts, due in part to the introduction of 
a new credit card product, as well as higher purchase volume. 
Decreases in home equity and education loans included the 
continued runoff in our non-strategic brokered home equity 
and government guaranteed education loan portfolios. The 
decline in home equity also reflected decreases due to 
paydowns and payoffs exceeding new originated volume. For 
information on home equity and residential real estate loans, 
including by geography, and automobile loans, see Loan 
Portfolio Characteristics and Analysis in the Credit Risk 
Management portion of the Risk Management section in this 
Item 7.

For additional information regarding our loan portfolio, see 
the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management 
section in this Item 7 and Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 3 
Asset Quality and Note 4 Allowance for Loan and Lease 
Losses in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements 
included in Item 8 of this Report.

The summarized balance sheet data in Table 4 is based upon 
our Consolidated Balance Sheet in Item 8 of this Report.

Our balance sheet grew compared to December 31, 2016 and 
we had strong liquidity and capital positions at December 31, 
2017.

•  Total assets increased driven by strong loan growth and 

higher interest-earning deposits with banks;

•  Total liabilities increased due to deposit growth and 

higher borrowed funds;

•  Total equity increased due to higher retained earnings 

driven by net income, partially offset by common share 
repurchases and a decline in noncontrolling interests 
related to the redemption of Perpetual Trust Securities in 
the first quarter of 2017.

The following discussion provides additional information 
about the major components of our balance sheet. Information 
regarding our capital and regulatory compliance is included in 
the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk 
Management section of this Item 7 and in Note 18 Regulatory 
Matters in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements

Investment securities increased $.2 billion at December 31, 
2017 compared to December 31, 2016. Growth in investment 
securities was driven by net purchases of agency residential 
mortgage-backed securities of $2.7 billion and U.S. Treasury 
and government agencies securities of $1.6 billion, partially 
offset by declines in commercial mortgage-backed securities 
of $2.2 billion, asset-backed securities of $.9 billion and non-
agency residential mortgage-backed securities of $.6 billion.

The level and composition of the investment securities 
portfolio fluctuates over time based on many factors including 
market conditions, loan and deposit growth, and balance sheet 
management activities.  We manage our investment securities 
portfolio to optimize returns, while providing a reliable source 
of liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering 
LCR and other internal and external guidelines and 
constraints.

Table 6 presents the distribution of our investment securities 
portfolio by credit rating. We have included credit ratings 
information because we believe that the information is an 
indicator of the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed, 
which could affect our risk-weighted assets and, therefore, our 
risk-based regulatory capital ratios under the regulatory capital 
rules. Changes in credit ratings classifications could indicate 
increased or decreased credit risk and could be accompanied 
by a reduction or increase in the fair value of our investment 
securities portfolio.

At least quarterly, we conduct a comprehensive security-level 
impairment assessment on all securities. If economic 
conditions, including home prices, were to deteriorate from 
current levels, and if market volatility and liquidity were to 
deteriorate from current levels, or if market interest rates were 
to increase or credit spreads were to widen appreciably, the 
valuation of our investment securities portfolio would likely 
be adversely affected and we could incur additional other than 
temporary impairment (OTTI) credit losses that would impact 
our Consolidated Income Statement.

The duration of investment securities was 3.2 years at 
December 31, 2017. We estimate that at December 31, 2017 
the effective duration of investment securities was 3.4 years 
for an immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest 
rates and 3.0 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel 
decrease in interest rates. Comparable amounts at December 
31, 2016 for the effective duration of investment securities 
were 3.1 years and 2.9 years, respectively.

Based on expected prepayment speeds, the weighted-average 
expected maturity of the investment securities portfolio 
(excluding other) was 5.2 years at December 31, 2017 
compared to 5.0 years at December 31, 2016.

The level and composition of borrowed funds fluctuates over 
time based on many factors including market conditions, loan, 
investment securities and deposit growth, and capital 
considerations. We manage our borrowed funds to provide a 
reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other activities, 
considering LCR and other internal and external guidelines 
and constraints.

See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk 
Management section of this Financial Review for additional 
information regarding our 2017 capital and liquidity activities.

Shareholders’ Equity
Total shareholders’ equity was $47.5 billion at December 31, 
2017, an increase of $1.8 billion compared to December 31, 
2016. Higher retained earnings, which reflected net income of 
$5.4 billion reduced by $1.5 billion of common and preferred 
dividends, was partially offset by common share repurchases 
of $2.3 billion. 

Common shares outstanding were 473 million and 485 million 
at December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively, 
as repurchases of 18.6 million shares during 2017 were 
partially offset by share issuances from treasury stock related 
to warrants exercised and stock-based compensation activity.

Growth in savings deposits reflected, in part, a shift from 
consumer money market to relationship-based savings 
products. Money market deposits declined due to the shift to 
savings products, which was partially offset by growth of $3.5 
billion in commercial interest-bearing money market deposits. 
Interest-bearing demand deposits reflected growth in 
consumer deposits of $1.7 billion and higher commercial 
deposits of $1.0 billion. 

Growth in both bank notes and senior debt and FHLB 
borrowings were driven by new issuances outpacing maturities 
and calls. These increases were partially offset by 
subordinated debt maturities.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS REVIEW

Effective for the first quarter of 2017, as a result of changes to 
how we manage our businesses, we realigned our segments 
and, accordingly, have changed the basis of presentation of our 
segments, resulting in four reportable business segments:

•  Retail Banking
•  Corporate & Institutional Banking
•  Asset Management Group
•  BlackRock

Our changes in business segment presentation resulting from 
the realignment included the following:

•  The Residential Mortgage Banking segment was 
combined into Retail Banking as a result of our 
strategic initiative to transform the home lending 
process by integrating mortgage and home equity 
lending to enhance product capability and speed of 
delivery for a better customer experience and to 
improve efficiency. In conjunction with this shift, 
residential mortgages previously reported within the 
“Other” category were also moved to Retail Banking. 

•  The Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio segment was 

eliminated. The segment’s remaining consumer assets 
were moved to the “Other” category as they are 
unrelated to the ongoing strategy of any segment, 
while its commercial assets were transferred to 
Corporate & Institutional Banking in order to 
continue the relationships we have with those 
customers. 

•  A portion of business banking clients was moved 
from Retail Banking to Corporate & Institutional 
Banking to facilitate enhanced product offerings to 
meet the financial needs of our business banking 
clients. 

Net interest income in business segment results reflects our 
internal funds transfer pricing methodology. Assets receive a 
funding charge and liabilities and capital receive a funding 
credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that 
incorporates product repricing characteristics, tenor and other 
factors. Effective for the first quarter of 2017, we made certain 
adjustments to our internal funds transfer pricing methodology 
primarily relating to weighted average lives of certain non-
maturity deposits based on our recent historical experience. 
These changes in methodology affected business segment 
results, primarily adversely impacting net interest income for 
Corporate & Institutional Banking and Retail Banking, offset 
by increased net interest income in the “Other” category. 

All prior periods presented were revised to conform to the new 
segment alignment and to our change in internal funds transfer 
pricing methodology. 

Business segment results and a description of each business 
are included in Note 22 Segment Reporting included in the 
Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this 
Report. Certain amounts included in this Business Segments 
Review differ from those amounts shown in Note 22, 
primarily due to the presentation in this Item 7 of business net 
interest revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Note 22 
presents results of businesses for 2017, 2016 and 2015. 

Our business segment results reflect the allocation of the 
impact of the new tax legislation to our business segments, 
primarily the revaluation of the net deferred tax positions 
allocated to the segments. Certain tax legislation amounts are 
considered reasonable estimates as of December 31, 2017. See 
the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section in 
this Item 7 for additional details. 

Total business segment financial results differ from total 
consolidated net income. The impact of these differences is 
reflected in the “Other” category in the business segment 
tables. “Other” includes residual activities that do not meet the 
criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such 
as asset and liability management activities including net 
securities gains or losses, other-than-temporary impairment of 
investment securities, certain trading activities, certain non-
strategic runoff consumer loan portfolios, private equity 
investments, intercompany eliminations, most corporate 
overhead, tax adjustments that are not allocated to business 
segments, gains or losses related to BlackRock transactions, 
integration costs, exited businesses, and differences between 
business segment performance reporting and financial 
statement reporting (GAAP), including the presentation of net 
income attributable to noncontrolling interests as the 
segments’ results exclude their portion of net income 
attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Retail Banking earned $530 million in 2017 compared with 
$1.0 billion in 2016. The decrease in earnings was driven by 
lower noninterest income, increased noninterest expense and 
income tax expense, which reflected the impact of new federal 
tax legislation, partially offset by higher net interest income.

Noninterest income declined in the comparison due to 
negative derivative fair value adjustments related to Visa Class 
B common shares of $280 million in 2017, including $248 
million in the fourth quarter primarily related to the extension 
of anticipated timing of litigation resolution. Derivative fair 
value adjustments relate to swap agreements with purchasers 
of Visa shares in connection with all prior sales to date. In 
2016, gains on sales of Visa Class B common shares, net of 
derivative fair value adjustments, were $32 million. 
Residential mortgage loan sales revenue declined as a result of 
lower origination volume and compressed pricing margins 
compared to 2016. Residential mortgage servicing rights

Net interest income increased due to higher interest rate spread 
on the value of deposits and increases in deposit balances, 
partially offset by interest rate spread compression on the 
value of loans. 

• 

•  Average commercial and commercial real estate loans 
declined as paydowns and payoffs on loans exceeded 
new volume. 
In 2017, average loan balances for the education and 
other loan portfolios decreased $746 million, or 10%, 
compared to 2016, driven by declines in the 
government guaranteed education and indirect other 
portfolios, which are primarily runoff portfolios.

Nonperforming assets decreased compared to December 31, 
2016 due to declines in both consumer and commercial 
nonperforming loans. 

Retail Banking continued to focus on its strategy of 
reinventing the retail banking experience by transforming the 
customer experience through transaction migration, branch 
network and home lending transformations and multi-channel 
engagement and service strategies.   

• 

• 

In 2017, approximately 62% of consumer customers 
used non-teller channels for the majority of their 
transactions compared with 58% for 2016.  

 

•  Deposit transactions via ATM and mobile channels 

increased to 53% of total deposit transactions in 2017 
compared with 49% for 2016.  

•  We had a network of 2,459 branches and 9,051 ATMs 

at December 31, 2017. 
Instant debit card issuance, which enables us to print 
a customer’s debit card in minutes, was available in 
90% of the branch network as of December 31, 2017.

Retail Banking continued to make progress on its multi-year 
initiative to redesign the home lending process by integrating 
mortgage and home equity lending into a common platform to 
enhance product capability and improve speed of delivery and 
convenience. 

•  We implemented a new mortgage origination system 

in the fourth quarter of 2017.

•  Loans continue to be originated primarily through 
direct channels under Federal National Mortgage 
Association (FNMA), Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Corporation (FHLMC) and Federal Housing

Affairs agency guidelines.

updates in the fourth quarter of 2017. These decreases were 
partially offset by higher debit card, brokerage and credit card 
fees, net of rewards, as well as higher service charges on 
deposits.

Provision for credit losses increased in the comparison, 
reflecting loan growth and higher delinquencies in auto and 
credit card.

The increase in noninterest expense in the comparison 
primarily resulted from investments in technology and higher 
personnel and compliance expense.

Income taxes reflected $139 million of expense as a result of 
the new federal tax legislation relating to the revaluation of net 
deferred tax assets.

Retail Banking continues to enhance the customer experience 
with refinements to product and service offerings that drive 
value for consumers and small businesses. We are focused on 
meeting the financial needs of our customers by providing a 
broad range of liquidity, banking and investment products.

The deposit strategy of Retail Banking is to remain disciplined 
on pricing and focused on growing and retaining relationship-
based balances, executing on market-specific deposit growth 
strategies and providing a source of low-cost funding and 
liquidity to PNC. In 2017, average total deposits increased 
compared to 2016, driven by growth in savings deposits 
reflecting, in part, a shift from money market deposits to 
relationship-based savings products. Additionally, demand 
deposits increased, partially offset by a decline in certificates 
of deposit due to the net runoff of maturing accounts.

Retail Banking average total loans grew in 2017 compared 
with 2016:  

•  Average residential mortgages increased as a result of 

growth in originations of nonconforming residential 
mortgage loans, both nationwide and within our 
branch network. 

•  Average automobile loans increased primarily due to 
portfolio growth, including growth in our Southeast 
markets.

•  Average credit card balances increased as a result of 

organic growth as we continued to focus on 
delivering on our long-term objective of deepening 
penetration within our existing customer base.  

 

•  Average home equity loans decreased as paydowns 

and payoffs on loans exceeded new originated 
volume. The weighted-average updated FICO scores 
for this portfolio were 749 at December 31, 2017 and 
746 at December 31, 2016.

mortgage banking activities in the Product Revenue section of this Corporate & Institutional Banking section.
Includes amounts reported in net interest income and noninterest income, predominantly in corporate service fees. 
Includes other noninterest income for valuations on commercial mortgage loans held for sale and related commitments, derivative valuations, originations fees, 
gains on sale of loans held for sale and net interest income on loans held for sale. 
Includes net interest income and noninterest income (primarily in corporate service fees) from loan servicing net of reduction in commercial mortgage servicing rights due to 
time decay and payoffs. Commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge is shown separately. 
Includes amounts reported in corporate service fees. 

Includes nonperforming loans of $.5 billion and $.6 billion at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.

Average loans increased compared with 2016 reflecting 
broad-based growth:

•  Corporate Banking provides lending, treasury 

• 

management and capital markets-related products 
and services to midsized and large corporations, 
government and not-for-profit entities.  Average 
loans for this business grew in the comparison 
reflecting increased lending to large and midsized 
corporate clients as well as strong production in 
specialty lending verticals.
PNC Real Estate provides banking, financing and 
servicing solutions for commercial real estate clients 
across the country. Higher average loans for this 
business were primarily due to growth in commercial 
mortgage and commercial loans, and to a lesser 
extent project loans.
PNC Business Credit provides asset-based lending. 
The loan portfolio is relatively high yielding, with 
acceptable risk as the loans are mainly secured by 
short-term assets. Average loans for this business 
increased due to new originations and increased 
utilization, partially offset by payoffs.
PNC Equipment Finance provides equipment 
financing solutions for clients throughout the U.S. 
and Canada. Average loans, including commercial 
loans and finance leases, and operating leases totaled 
$14.3 billion in 2017, an increase of $1.8 billion 
compared with 2016 due to new production and the 
business acquired in the second quarter of 2017.
•  Commercial Banking provides lending, treasury 

• 

• 

management and capital markets-related products and 
services to smaller corporations and businesses. 
Average loans for this business decreased slightly 
primarily due to strategic risk/return considerations. 

(e) 
(f)  As of December 31.
(g) 
 
Corporate & Institutional Banking earned $2.5 billion in 2017 
compared to $1.9 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily 
due to higher revenue and lower income tax expense, which 
reflected the impact of new federal tax legislation, partially 
offset by higher noninterest expense.  We continue to focus on 
building client relationships where the risk-return profile is 
attractive.

Net interest income increased in the comparison, reflecting 
higher average loan and deposit balances as well as interest 
rate spread expansion on deposits.

Growth in noninterest income was primarily driven by higher 
capital markets-related revenue, including merger and 
acquisition advisory fees, loan syndication fees and 
underwriting fees. Additionally, operating lease income 
increased, mainly due to the acquisition of a commercial and 
vendor finance business with $1.0 billion of loans and leases 
in the second quarter of 2017. Higher treasury management 
fees also contributed to the increase in noninterest income.

The decrease in provision for credit losses reflected lower 
provision in the oil, gas and coal sectors, partially offset by an 
initial provision for the loan and lease portfolio obtained 
through the acquired business and loan growth.

Noninterest expense increased in the comparison largely 
driven by higher variable compensation commensurate with 
increased business activity, operating expenses related to the 
acquired business and continued investments in technology 
and infrastructure.

Income tax expense reflected a benefit of $373 million as a 
result of the new tax legislation, primarily related to 
revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities.

44    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

The deposit strategy of Corporate & Institutional Banking is to 
remain disciplined on pricing and focus on growing and 
retaining relationship-based balances over time, executing on 
customer and segment-specific deposit growth strategies and 
continuing to provide funding and liquidity to PNC.  In 2017, 
average total deposits increased compared to 2016 driven by 
growth in interest-bearing demand deposits reflecting in part a 
shift from noninterest-bearing deposits in the rising rate 
environment.  We continue to monitor and balance the 
relationship between increases in rates paid and overall 
profitability of our deposit balances.

In 2017, Corporate & Institutional Banking opened offices in 
Dallas, Kansas City and Minneapolis as part of a multi-year 
expansion of our middle market banking business. These 
locations complement national Corporate & Institutional 
Banking businesses with operations in these cities, and build 
on past success in markets where PNC’s retail banking 
presence was limited, such as in the Southeast. We plan to 
offer our entire suite of commercial products and services. We 
have also formalized plans to expand our middle market 
business into the Denver, Houston and Nashville markets in 
2018. 

Product Revenue
In addition to credit and deposit products for commercial 
customers, Corporate & Institutional Banking offers other 
services, including treasury management, capital markets-
related products and services, and commercial mortgage 
banking activities, for customers of all business segments. On 
a consolidated basis, the revenue from these other services is 
included in net interest income, corporate service fees and 
other noninterest income. From a segment perspective, the 
majority of the revenue and expense related to these services 
is reflected in the Corporate & Institutional Banking segment 
results and the remainder is reflected in the results of other 
businesses. The Other Information section in Table 10 
includes the consolidated revenue to PNC for these services. A 
discussion of the consolidated revenue from these services 
follows.

Treasury management services include cash and investment 
management, receivables management, disbursement services, 
funds transfer services, information reporting and global trade 
services. Treasury management revenue comprises fees from 
products and services and net interest income from customer 
deposit balances. Compared with 2016, treasury management 
revenue increased due to liquidity-related revenue associated 
with customer deposit balances, including interest rate spread 
expansion, and higher fee income.

Capital markets-related products and services include foreign 
exchange, derivatives, securities underwriting, loan 
syndications, mergers and acquisitions advisory and equity 
capital markets advisory related services. The increase in 
revenue in the comparison was broad based across most 
products and services and included higher merger and 
acquisition advisory fees and higher fees from loan 
syndications and underwriting activities. 

Commercial mortgage banking activities include revenue 
derived from commercial mortgage servicing (including net 
interest income and noninterest income) and revenue derived 
from commercial mortgage loans held for sale and related 
hedges. Total revenue from commercial mortgage banking 
activities decreased in the comparison as declines in 
commercial mortgage loan servicing income and commercial 
mortgage loans held for sale revenue were partially offset by a 
higher benefit from commercial mortgage servicing rights 
valuation, net of economic hedge.

46    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

Asset Management Group earned $202 million in 2017 
compared with $210 million in 2016. Earnings decreased as 
higher revenue and lower income tax expense, which reflected 
the impact of new federal tax legislation, was more than offset 
by higher noninterest expense. 

The increase in revenue in the comparison was driven by 
higher noninterest income from asset management fees due to 
stronger average equity markets. This increase was partially 
offset by lower net interest income due to lower average home 
equity loan balances and interest rate spread compression on 
residential mortgages.  

Noninterest expense increased in 2017 compared to 2016 
primarily attributable to higher compensation, technology and 
vendor-related expenses.

Asset Management Group’s strategy is focused on growing 
investable assets by continually evolving the client experience 
and products and services. The business offers an open 
architecture platform with a full array of investment products 
and banking solutions. 

Wealth Management and Hawthorn have nearly 100 offices 
operating in seven of the ten most affluent states in the U.S. 
with a majority co-located with retail banking branches. The 
businesses provide customized investments, wealth planning, 
trust and estate administration and private banking solutions to 
affluent individuals and ultra-affluent families. 

Institutional Asset Management provides advisory, custody 
and retirement administration services to institutional clients 
such as corporations, unions, municipalities, non-profits, 
foundations and endowments. The business also offers PNC 
proprietary mutual funds and investment strategies. 
Institutional Asset Management is strengthening its 
partnership with Corporate & Institutional Banking to drive 
growth and is focused on building retirement capabilities and 
expanding product solutions for all customers.  

Asset Management Group’s discretionary client assets under 
management increased compared with 2016, primarily 
attributable to higher equity markets as of December 31, 2017.

In addition to our investment in BlackRock reflected in 
Table 12, at December 31, 2017, we held approximately 
0.25 million shares of BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock

2016 VERSUS 2015 
Consolidated Income Statement Review

Summary Results
Net income for 2016 was $4.0 billion, or $7.30 per diluted 
common share, a decrease of 4% compared with $4.1 billion, 
or $7.39 per diluted common share, for 2015. The decrease 
was driven by higher provision for credit losses and a 3% 
decline in noninterest income, partially offset by 1% increase 
in net interest income. 

Net Interest Income
Net interest income increased by $113 million, or 1%, to $8.4 
billion in 2016 compared to 2015 due to increases in loan and 
securities balances and higher loan yields, partially offset by 
an increase in borrowing costs and lower securities yields. Net 
interest margin was 2.73% in 2016 and 2.74% in 2015. 

Noninterest Income
Noninterest income decreased $176 million, or 3%, to $6.8 
billion for 2016 compared to 2015. Noninterest income as a 
percentage of total revenue was 45% for 2016, down from 
46% for 2015.

Asset management revenue decreased $46 million, or 3%, to 
$1.5 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 mainly due to lower 
earnings from BlackRock and the impact from a $30 million 
trust settlement in 2015 in our asset management business 
segment. Discretionary client assets under management in the 
Asset Management Group were $137 billion at December 31, 
2016 compared with $134 billion at December 31, 2015.

Consumer service fees increased $53 million, or 4%, in 2016 
compared to 2015, primarily from growth in payment-related 
products including debit card and credit card, as well as higher 
brokerage fees.

Corporate service fees increased $13 million, or 1%, in 2016 
compared to 2015, reflecting higher treasury management fees 
and a higher benefit from commercial mortgage servicing 
rights valuation, net of economic hedge, partially offset by 
lower merger and acquisition advisory fees.

Other noninterest income decreased $213 million, or 16%, to 
$1.1 billion in 2016 compared with $1.3 billion in 2015. The 
decline was primarily attributable to the impact of lower net 
gains on sales of Visa Class B common shares and lower 
revenue from private equity investments. Net gains on sale of 
Visa shares for 2016 were $32 million compared with $166 
million in 2015. Net gains on Visa sales include derivative fair 
value adjustments related to swap agreements with purchasers 
of Visa shares in connection with all prior sales to date.

48    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

Provision For Credit Losses
The provision for credit losses increased to $433 million in 
2016 compared with $255 million in 2015, primarily 
attributable to a higher provision for energy related loans in 
the oil, gas, and coal sectors. Overall credit portfolio 
performance and loan growth also contributed to the higher 
provision.

Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense increased slightly by $13 million to $9.5 
billion in 2016 compared to 2015 as we continued to focus on 
disciplined expense management. Higher 2016 contributions 
to the PNC Foundation, a new FDIC deposit insurance 
surcharge and investments in technology and business 
infrastructure were offset by net lower contingency accruals. 

During 2016, we completed actions and achieved our 2016 
continuous improvement program savings goal of 
$400 million, which largely funded our investments in 
technology and business infrastructure. 

Effective Income Tax Rate
The effective income tax rate was 24.1% for 2016 compared 
with 24.8% for 2015. The effective tax rate is generally lower 
than the statutory rate primarily due to tax credits we receive 
from our investments in low income housing and new markets 
investments, as well as earnings in other tax exempt 
investments. The decline in the comparison reflected the tax 
favorability of the 2016 PNC Foundation contributions.

Consolidated Balance Sheet Review
Summary Results
Our balance sheet reflected asset growth and strong liquidity 
and capital positions at December 31, 2016. Total assets 
increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to increases 
in investment securities and loan balances. Total liabilities 
increased in 2016 compared to 2015 mainly due to deposit 
growth. Total equity increased in 2016 compared to 2015, 
reflecting increased retained earnings driven by net income, 
partially offset by share repurchases.

Loans
Loans increased $4.1 billion to $210.8 billion as of 
December 31, 2016 compared with December 31, 2015. Loan 
growth was driven by an increase in total commercial lending 
driven by higher commercial and commercial real estate loans, 
partially offset by a decline in consumer lending due to lower 
home equity and education loans.

Average total loans increased by $3.5 billion to $208.8 billion 
in 2016, which resulted from growth in average commercial 
real estate loans of $3.6 billion and average commercial loans 
of $2.2 billion, partially offset by a decrease in consumer loans 
of $2.6 billion. The decline in consumer loans was primarily 
attributable to lower nonstrategic consumer and government 
guaranteed education loan portfolios.

Investment Securities
Investment securities increased $5.4 billion to $75.9 billion at 
December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015. Growth 
in investment securities was driven by net purchases of U.S. 
Treasury and government agency securities and agency 
residential mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by 
prepayments of non-agency commercial mortgage-backed and 
non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities.

Average investment securities increased to $72.0 billion 
during 2016 compared to $61.7 billion during 2015, primarily 
due to increases in average agency residential mortgage-
backed securities and U.S. Treasury and government agency 
securities, partially offset by a decrease in average non-agency 
residential mortgage-backed securities.

The weighted-average expected maturity of the investment 
securities portfolio (excluding other) was 5.0 years at 
December 31, 2016 and 4.8 years at December 31, 2015.

Funding Sources
Total deposits increased $8.2 billion to $257.2 billion at 
December 31, 2016 compared with December 31, 2015, due to 
strong growth in demand and savings deposits which reflected 
in part a shift from money market deposits to relationship-
based savings products.

Average total deposits increased $10.5 billion to $250.8 billion 
in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in 
average interest-bearing deposits, which reflected higher 
average savings deposits and higher average interest-bearing 
demand deposits.

Total borrowed funds decreased $1.8 billion to $52.7 billion at 
December 31, 2016 compared with December 31, 2015 as 
maturities of FHLB borrowings were partially offset by higher 
bank notes and senior debt.

Shareholders’ Equity
Total shareholders’ equity grew $1.0 billion to $45.7 billion at 
December 31, 2016 compared with December 31, 2015. The 
increase was primarily due to higher retained earnings and 
capital surplus, which included the issuance of Series S 
preferred stock, partially offset by common share repurchases 
of $2.0 billion and a decrease in accumulated other 
comprehensive income primarily related to net unrealized 
securities losses. The growth in retained earnings resulted 
from 2016 net income of $4.0 billion, reduced by $1.3 billion 
of common and preferred dividends declared. Common shares 
outstanding were 485 million and 504 million at December 31, 
2016 and 2015, respectively, reflecting repurchases of 22.8 
million shares during 2016.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Enterprise Risk Management
We encounter risk as part of the normal course of operating 
our business. Accordingly, we design risk management 
processes to help manage this risk. We manage risk in light of 
our risk appetite to optimize long-term shareholder value 
while supporting our employees, customers and communities.
 
Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework is 
structurally aligned with enhanced prudential standards that 
establish minimum requirements for the design and 
implementation of a risk governance framework. This Risk 
Management section describes our ERM Framework which 
consists of risk culture, enterprise strategy (including risk 
appetite, strategic planning, capital planning and stress 
testing), risk governance and oversight, risk identification, risk 
assessments, risk controls and monitoring, and risk 
aggregation and reporting. The overall Risk Management 
section of this Item 7 also provides an analysis of our key 
areas of risk, which include but are not limited to credit, 
liquidity and capital, market, operational and compliance. Our 
use of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and 
liability risk management process is also addressed within this 
Risk Management section.

We operate within a rapidly evolving regulatory environment. 
Accordingly, we are actively focused on the timely adoption 
of regulatory pronouncements within our ERM Framework.

We view risk management as a cohesive combination of the 
following risk elements which form our ERM Framework:

              

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  49

Risk Culture
A strong risk culture helps us make well-informed decisions, 
ensures individuals conform to the established culture, reduces 
an individual’s ability to do something for personal gain, and 
rewards employees working toward a common goal rather 
than individual interests. Our risk culture reinforces the 
appropriate protocols for responsible and ethical behavior. 
These protocols are especially critical in terms of our risk 
awareness, risk-taking behavior and risk management 
practices.

Managing risk is every one of our employee’s responsibility. 
All of our employees individually and collectively assume 
responsibility for ensuring the organization is performing with 
the utmost integrity, is applying sound risk management 
practices and is striving to achieve our stated objectives rather 
than pursuing individual interests. All employees are 
responsible for understanding our Enterprise Risk Appetite 
Statement, the ERM Framework and how risk management 
applies to their respective roles and responsibilities. 
Employees are encouraged to collaborate across groups to 
identify and mitigate risks and elevate issues as required. We 
reinforce risk management responsibilities through a 
performance management system where employee 
performance goals include risk management objectives and 
incentives for employees to reinforce balanced measures of 
risk-adjusted performance.

Proactive communication, between groups and up to the Board 
of Directors, facilitates timely identification and resolution of 
risk issues. Our multi-level risk committee structure provides a 
formal channel to identify and report risk.

Enterprise Strategy
We ensure that our overall enterprise strategy is within 
acceptable risk parameters through our risk appetite, strategic 
planning, capital planning and stress testing processes. These 
components are reviewed and approved at least annually by 
the Board of Directors.

Risk Appetite: Our risk appetite represents the 
organization’s desired enterprise risk position, set within 
our capital based risk and liquidity capacity to achieve our 
strategic objectives and business plans. The Enterprise 
Risk Appetite Statement qualitatively describes the 
aggregate level of risk we are willing to accept in order to 
execute our business strategies. Qualitative guiding 
principles further define each of the risks within our 
taxonomy to support the risk appetite statement. Risk 
appetite metrics and limits, including forward-looking 
metrics, quantitatively measure whether we are operating 
within our stated Risk Appetite. Our risk appetite metrics 
reflect material risks, align with our established Risk 
Appetite Framework, balance risk and reward, leverage 
analytics, and adjust in a timely manner to changes in the 
external and internal risk environments.

Strategic Planning: Our enterprise and line of business 
strategic plans outline major objectives, strategies and 
goals which are expected to be achieved over the next five 
years while seeking to ensure we remain compliant with 

50    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

all capital, risk appetite and liquidity targets and 
guidelines. Our CEO and CFO lead the development of 
the strategic plan, the strategic objectives and the 
comprehensive identification of material risks that could 
hinder successful implementation and execution of 
strategies. Strategic planning is linked to our risk 
management and capital planning processes.

Capital Planning and Stress Testing: Capital planning 
helps to ensure we are maintaining safe and sound 
operations and viability. The capital planning process and 
the resulting capital plan evolve as our overall risks, 
activities and risk management practices change. Capital 
planning aligns with our strategic planning process.

Stress testing is an essential element of the capital 
planning process. Effective stress testing enables us to 
consider the estimated effect on capital of various 
hypothetical scenarios.

 

Risk Governance and Framework
We employ a comprehensive risk management governance 
framework to help ensure that risks are identified, balanced 
decisions are made that consider risk and return, and risks are 
adequately monitored and managed. Risk committees 
established within this risk governance and oversight 
framework provide oversight for risk management activities at 
the Board of Directors, executive, corporate and business 
levels. Committee composition is designed to provide 
effective oversight balanced across the three lines of defense 
in accordance with the OCC’s heightened risk management 
and governance expectations and guidelines. See discussion of 
the enhanced prudential standards in the Supervision and 
Regulation section in Item 1 of this Report.

To ensure the appropriate risks are being taken and effectively 
managed and controlled, risk is managed across three lines of 
defense. The Board of Directors’ and each line of defense’s 
responsibilities are detailed below:

Board of Directors – The Board of Directors oversees our 
risk-taking activities and is responsible for exercising 
sound, independent judgment when assessing risk.

First line of defense – The front line units are accountable 
for identifying, owning and managing risks to within 
acceptable levels while adhering to the risk management 
framework established by the Independent Risk 
Management department. Our businesses strive to 
enhance risk management and internal control processes 
within their areas. Integrated and comprehensive 
processes are designed to adequately identify, measure, 
manage, monitor and report risks which may significantly 
impact each business.

Second line of defense – The second line of defense is 
independent from the first line of defense and is 
responsible for establishing the standards for identifying, 
measuring, monitoring and controlling aggregate risks. As 
the second line of defense, the independent risk areas 
monitor the risks generated by the first line of defense, 

review and challenge the implementation of effective risk 
management practices, and report any issues or 
exceptions. The risk areas help to ensure the first line of 
defense is properly designed and operating as intended, 
and they may intervene directly in modifying and 
developing first line of defense risk processes and 
controls.

Third line of defense – As the third line of defense, 
Internal Audit is independent from the first and second 
lines of defense. Internal Audit provides the Board of 
Directors and executive management comprehensive 
assurance on the effectiveness of risk management 
practices across the organization.

Within the three lines of defense, the independent risk 
organization has sufficient authority to influence material 
decisions. Our business oversight and decision-making is 
supported through a governance structure at the Board of 
Directors and management level. Specific responsibilities 
include:

Board of Directors – Our Board of Directors oversees our 
business and affairs as managed by our officers and 
employees. The Board of Directors may receive 
assistance in carrying out its duties and may delegate 
authority through the following standing committees:
•  Audit Committee: monitors the integrity of our 

consolidated financial statements; monitors internal 
control over financial reporting; monitors compliance 
with our code of ethics; evaluates and monitors the 
qualifications and independence of our independent 
auditors; and evaluates and monitors the performance 
of our Internal Audit function and our independent 
auditors.

•  Nominating and Governance Committee: oversees the 

implementation of sound corporate governance 
principles and practices while promoting our best 
interests and those of our shareholders

•  Personnel and Compensation Committee: oversees 

the compensation of our executive officers and other 
specified responsibilities related to personnel 
compensation matters affecting us.

•  Risk Committee: oversees enterprise-wide risk 

structure and the processes established to identify, 
measure, monitor and manage the organization’s risks 
and evaluates and approves our risk governance 
framework. The Risk Committee has formed a 
Technology Subcommittee and a Compliance 
Subcommittee to facilitate Board-level oversight of 
risk management in these areas.

Corporate Committees – The corporate committees are 
responsible for overseeing risk standards and strategies, 
recommending risk limits, policies and metrics, 
monitoring risk exposures, reviewing risk profiles and key 
risk issues, and approving significant transactions and 
initiatives. We have established several senior 
management-level corporate committees to facilitate the 
review, evaluation and management of risk. The 
management-level Executive Committee is the corporate 
committee that is responsible for developing enterprise-
wide strategy and achieving our strategic objectives. The 
Executive Committee evaluates risk management, in part, 
by monitoring risk reporting from the other corporate 
committees which are the supporting committees for the 
Executive Committee.

Working Committees – The working committees are 
generally subcommittees of the corporate committees. 
Working committees are intended to assist in the 
implementation of key enterprise-level activities within a 
business or function; recommend and/or approve risk 
appetite metrics and limits; recommend and/or approve 
policies that are generally within the standards outlined in 
the applicable enterprise policy; and review and/or 
approve certain significant transactions or initiatives.

Policies and Procedures – We have established risk 
management policies and procedures to provide direction, 
guidance and clarity on roles and responsibilities to 
management and the Board of Directors. These policies 
and procedures are organized in a multi-tiered framework 
and require periodic review and approval by relevant 
committees within the governance structure.

We have established risk management policies, programs and 
procedures to support our ERM Framework, articulate our risk 
culture, define the parameters and processes within which 
employees are to manage risk and conduct our business 
activities and to provide direction, guidance and clarity on 
roles and responsibilities to management and the Board of 
Directors. These policies, programs and procedures are 
organized in a multi-tiered framework and require periodic 
review and approval by relevant committees within the 
governance structure.

Risk Identification
Risk identification takes place across a variety of risk types 
throughout the organization. These risk types consist of, but 
are not limited to, credit, liquidity and capital, market, 
operational and compliance. Risks are identified based on a 
balanced use of analytical tools and management judgment for 
both on- and off-balance sheet exposures. Our governance 
structure supports risk identification by facilitating assessment 
of key risk issues, emerging risks and idiosyncratic risks and 
implementation of mitigation strategies as appropriate. These 
risks are prioritized based on quantitative and qualitative 
analysis and assessed against the risk appetite. Multiple tools 
and approaches are used to help identify and prioritize risks, 
including Risk Appetite Metrics, Key Risk Indicators, Key 
Performance Indicators, Risk Control and Self-Assessments, 
scenario analysis, stress testing and special investigations.

Risks are aggregated and assessed within and across risk 
functions or businesses. The aggregated risk information is 
reviewed and reported at an enterprise level for adherence to 
the Risk Appetite Framework and approved by the Board of 
Directors or by appropriate committees. This enterprise 
aggregation and reporting approach promotes the 
identification and appropriate escalation of material risks 
across the organization and supports an understanding of the 
cumulative impact of risk in relation to our risk appetite.

Risk Assessment
Once risks are identified, they are evaluated based on 
quantitative and qualitative analysis to determine whether they 
are material. Risk assessments support the overall 
management of an effective ERM Framework and allow us to 
control and monitor our actual risk level through the use of 
risk measures. Comprehensive, accurate and timely 
assessments of risk are essential to an effective ERM 
Framework. Effective risk measurement practices will uncover 
reoccurring risks that have been experienced in the past; make 
the known risks easy to see, understand, compare and report; 
and reveal unanticipated risks that may not be easy to 
understand or predict.

Risk Controls and Monitoring
Our ERM Framework consists of policies, processes, 
personnel and control systems. Risk controls and limits 
provide the linkage from our Risk Appetite Statement and 
associated guiding principles to the risk taking activities of our 
businesses. In addition to risk appetite limits, a system of more 
detailed internal controls exists which oversees and monitors 
our various processes and functions. These control systems 
measure performance, help employees make correct decisions, 
ensure information is accurate and reliable, and document 
compliance with laws and regulations.

Our monitoring and evaluation of risks and controls provides 
assurance that policies, procedures and controls are effective 
and also results in the identification of control improvement 
recommendations. Risk monitoring is a daily, on-going 
process used by both the first and second line of defense to 
ensure compliance with our ERM Framework. Risk 
monitoring is accomplished in many ways, including 
performing risk assessments at the prime process and risk 
assessment unit level, monitoring an area’s key controls, the 
timely reporting of issues, and establishing a quality assurance 
and/or quality control function, as applicable.

Risk Aggregation and Reporting
Risk reporting is a comprehensive way to: (i) aggregate risks; 
(ii) identify concentrations; (iii) help ensure we remain within 
our established risk appetite; (iv) serve as a basis for 
monitoring our risk profile in relation to our risk appetite and 
(v) communicate risks to the Board of Directors and executive 
management.

Risk reports are produced at the line of business, functional 
risk and enterprise levels. The enterprise level risk report 
aggregates risks identified in the functional and business 
reports to define the enterprise risk profile. The enterprise risk 
profile is a point-in-time assessment of enterprise risk and 
represents our overall risk position in relation to the desired 
enterprise risk appetite. The determination of the enterprise 
risk profile is based on analysis of quantitative reporting of 
risk limits and other measures along with qualitative 
assessments. Quarterly aggregation of our risk profile enables 
a clear view of our risk level relative to our quantitative risk 
appetite. The enterprise level report is provided through the 
governance structure to the Board of Directors.
 
Each individual risk report includes an assessment of inherent 
risk, quality of risk management, residual risk, risk appetite, 
and risk outlook. The enterprise level risk report includes an 
aggregate view of risks identified in the individual report and 
provides a summary of our overall risk profile compared to 
our risk appetite.

Credit Risk Management 
Credit risk represents the possibility that a customer, counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. 
Credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and 
entering into financial derivative transactions and certain guarantee contracts. Credit risk is one of our most significant risks. Our 
processes for managing credit risk are embedded in our risk culture and in our decision-making processes using a systematic approach 
whereby credit risks and related exposures are identified and assessed, managed through specific policies and processes, measured and 
evaluated against our risk appetite and credit concentration limits, and reported, along with specific mitigation activities, to 
management and the Board of Directors through our governance structure. Our most significant concentration of credit risk is in our 
loan portfolio.

Loan Portfolio Characteristics and Analysis

Table 13: Details of Loans
Dollars in billions

We use several asset quality indicators, as further detailed in 
Note 3 Asset Quality, to monitor and measure our exposure to 
credit risk within our loan portfolio. The following provides 
additional information about our significant loan classes.

Commercial
Commercial loans comprised 50% and 48% of our total loan 
portfolio at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, 
respectively. Most of our commercial loans are secured by 
collateral that provides a secondary source of repayment for 
the loan should the borrower experience cash generation 
difficulties. Examples of this collateral include short-term 
assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory and securities, 
and long-lived assets, such as equipment, real estate and other 
business assets. 

We actively manage our commercial loans to assess any 
changes (both positive and negative) in the level of credit risk 
at both the borrower and portfolio level. To evaluate the level
of credit risk, we assign an internal risk rating reflecting the 
borrower’s probability of default (PD) and loss given default 
(LGD). This two-dimensional credit risk rating methodology 
provides granularity in the risk monitoring process and is 
updated on an ongoing basis through our credit risk 
management processes. In addition to continual monitoring of 
the level of credit risk, we also monitor concentrations of 
credit risk pertaining to both specific industries and geography 

that may exist in our portfolio. Our portfolio remains stable 
and well-diversified as evidenced by the following table which 
provides a breakout of our commercial loans by industry 
classification (classified based on the North American Industry 
Classification System (NAICS)).

bankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV, lien position and 
geographic concentration. 

The portfolio is primarily originated within our primary 
geographic markets, with only 5% of the portfolio in states 
outside of those markets as of December 31, 2017. The credit 
quality of newly originated loans in 2017 was strong overall as 
evidenced by a weighted- average LTV on originations of 67% 
and a weighted-average FICO score of 776.

The credit performance of the majority of the home equity 
portfolio where we hold the first lien position is superior to the 
portion of the portfolio where we hold the second lien 
position, but do not hold the first lien. Lien position 
information is generally based upon original LTV at the time 
of origination. We use an industry-leading third-party service 
provider to obtain updated loan, lien and collateral data that is 
aggregated from public and private sources.

Commercial Real Estate
Commercial real estate loans comprised $15.3 billion of real 
estate project loans and $13.7 billion related to commercial 
mortgages as of December 31, 2017. Comparable amounts 
were $16.3 billion and $12.7 billion, respectively, as of 
December 31, 2016.

We monitor credit risk associated with our commercial real 
estate projects and commercial mortgages similar to 
commercial loans by analyzing PD and LGD. Additionally, 
risks associated with types of credit activities tend to be 
correlated to the loan structure, collateral location, project 
progress and business environment. These attributes are also 
monitored and utilized in assessing credit risk. The portfolio is 
geographically diverse due to the nature of our business 
involving clients throughout the U.S. The following table 
presents our commercial real estate loans by geographic 
market.

Home Equity
Home equity loans comprised $16.8 billion of primarily 
variable-rate home equity lines of credit and $11.6 billion of 
closed-end home equity installment loans at December 31, 
2017. Comparable amounts were $17.7 billion and $12.2 
billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. 

We track borrower performance monthly, including obtaining 
original loan-to-value ratios (LTV), updated FICO scores at 
least quarterly, updated LTVs at least semi-annually, and other 
credit metrics at least quarterly, including the historical 
performance of any related mortgage loans regardless of lien 
position that we do or do not hold. This information is used for 
internal reporting and risk management. For internal reporting 
and risk management we also segment the population into 
pools based on product type (e.g., home equity loans, brokered 
home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, brokered home 
equity lines of credit). As part of our overall risk analysis and 
monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon the loan 
delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and

Residential Real Estate 
Residential real estate loans primarily consisted of residential 
mortgage loans at both December 31, 2017 and December 31, 
2016.

We track borrower performance of this portfolio monthly 
similar to home equity loans. This information is used for 
internal reporting and risk management. For internal reporting 
and risk management we also segment the mortgage portfolio 
into pools based on product type (e.g., FHA, conforming, 
etc.).  As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we 
also segment the portfolio based upon loan delinquency, 
nonperforming status, modification and bankruptcy status, 
FICO scores, LTV and geographic concentrations. Loan 
performance is evaluated by source originators and loan 
servicers.

The credit quality of newly originated loans that we retained 
on our balance sheet in 2017 was strong overall as evidenced 
by a weighted-average LTV on originations of 71% and a 
weighted-average FICO score of 768. 

We originate residential mortgage loans nationwide through 
our national mortgage business as well as within our branch 
network. Residential mortgage loans underwritten to 
government agency standards, including conforming loan 
amount limits, are typically sold with servicing retained by us. 
We also originate residential mortgage loans above the 
conforming loan amount limits, known as nonconforming 
mortgage loans, which we retain on our balance sheet. In 
recent years, including in 2017, we have increased the volume 
of nonconforming loans that we originate, including in 
California.

Automobile
Within auto loans, $11.4 billion resided in the indirect auto 
portfolio, $1.4 billion in the direct auto portfolio and $.1 
billion in securitized portfolios as of December 31, 2017. 
Comparable amounts as of December 31, 2016 were $10.8 
billion, $1.3 billion and $.3 billion, respectively. The indirect 
auto portfolio relates to loan applications generated from 
franchised automobile dealers. This business is strategically 
aligned with our core retail business.

We continue to focus on a strong origination profile as 
evidenced by a weighted-average loan origination FICO score 
during 2017 of 745 for indirect auto loans and 767 for direct 
auto loans. The weighted-average term of loan originations 
during 2017 was 72 months for indirect auto loans and 62 
months for direct auto loans. We offer both new and used 
automobile financing to customers through our various 
channels. The portfolio was composed of 54% new vehicle 
loans and 46% used vehicle loans at December 31, 2017.

The auto loan portfolio's performance is measured monthly, 
including updated collateral values that are obtained monthly 
and updated FICO scores that are obtained at least quarterly. 
For internal reporting and risk management, we analyze the 
portfolio by product channel and product type and regularly 
evaluate default and delinquency experience. As part of our 
overall risk analysis and monitoring, we segment the portfolio 
by loan structure, collateral attributes and credit metrics which 
include FICO score, LTV and term.

Nonperforming Assets and Loan Delinquencies

Nonperforming Assets
Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases 
for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of 
contractual principal and interest is not probable and include 
nonperforming troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), other real 
estate owned (OREO), foreclosed and other assets. Loans held 
for sale, certain government insured or guaranteed loans, 
purchased impaired loans and loans accounted for under the 
fair value option are excluded from nonperforming loans. 
Additional information regarding our nonperforming loans 
and nonaccrual policies is included in Note 1 Accounting 
Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in 
Item 8 of this report. A summary of the major categories of 
nonperforming assets are presented in Table 18. See Note 3 
Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial 
Statements in Item 8 of this Report for further detail of 
nonperforming asset categories.

As of December 31, 2017, approximately 90% of total 
nonperforming loans were secured by collateral which 
lessened reserve requirements and is expected to reduce credit 
losses in the event of default. As of December 31, 2017, 
commercial lending nonperforming loans were carried at 
approximately 62% of their unpaid principal balance, due to 
charge-offs recorded to date, before consideration of the 
Allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL).
 
Within consumer nonperforming loans, residential real estate 
TDRs comprise 75% of total residential real estate 
nonperforming loans at December 31, 2017, up from 70% at 
December 31, 2016. Home equity TDRs comprise 50% of 
home equity nonperforming loans at December 31, 2017
and 52% at December 31, 2016. TDRs generally remain in 
nonperforming status until a borrower has made at least six 
consecutive months of both principal and interest payments 
under the modified terms or ultimate resolution occurs. Loans 
where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability 
through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally 
reaffirmed their loan obligations to us and loans to borrowers 
not currently obligated to make both principal and interest 
payments under the restructured terms are not returned to 
accrual status.

At December 31, 2017, our largest nonperforming asset was 
$44 million in the Wholesale Trade industry. The ten largest 
individual nonperforming assets represented 12% of total 
nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2017.

Loan Delinquencies
We regularly monitor the level of loan delinquencies and 
believe these levels may be a key indicator of loan portfolio 
asset quality. Measurement of delinquency status is based on 
the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or 
more past due in terms of payment are considered delinquent. 
Loan delinquencies exclude loans held for sale and purchased 
impaired loans, but include government insured or guaranteed 
loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option.

Accruing loans past due 90 days or more decreased at 
December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 driven 
by declines in government insured residential real estate, and 
government insured education loans within other consumer. 
Accruing loans past due 90 days or more are not included in 
nonperforming loans and continue to accrue interest because 
they are well secured by collateral and are in the process of 
collection, or are managed in homogenous portfolios with 
specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory 
guidelines, or are certain government insured or guaranteed 
loans.

Loan Modifications and Troubled Debt Restructurings

Consumer Loan Modifications
We modify loans under government and PNC-developed 
programs based upon our commitment to help eligible 
homeowners and borrowers avoid foreclosure, where 
appropriate. Initially, a borrower is evaluated for a 
modification under a government program. If a borrower does 
not qualify under a government program, the borrower is then 
evaluated under a PNC program. Our programs utilize both 
temporary and permanent modifications and typically reduce 
the interest rate, extend the term and/or defer principal. Loans 
that are either temporarily or permanently modified under 
programs involving a change to loan terms are generally 
classified as TDRs. Further, loans that have certain types of 
payment plans and trial payment arrangements which do not 
include a contractual change to loan terms may be classified as 
TDRs.

A temporary modification, with a term up to 24 months, 
involves a change in original loan terms for a period of time 
and reverts to a calculated exit rate for the remaining term of 
the loan as of a specific date. A permanent modification, with 
a term greater than 24 months, is a modification in which the 
terms of the original loan are changed. Permanent 
modification programs generally result in principal 
forgiveness, interest rate reduction, term extension, 
capitalization of past due amounts, interest-only period or 
deferral of principal.

We also monitor the success rates and delinquency status of 
our loan modification programs to assess their effectiveness in 
serving our borrowers’ and servicing customers’ needs while 
mitigating credit losses. Table 21 provides the number of 
accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified consumer 
real estate related loans at the end of each year presented.

Commercial Loan Modifications
Modifications of terms for commercial loans are based on 
individual facts and circumstances. Commercial loan 
modifications may involve reduction of the interest rate, 
extension of the loan term and/or forgiveness of principal. 
Modified commercial loans are usually already nonperforming 
prior to modification. We evaluate these modifications for 
TDR classification based upon whether we granted a 
concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties.

Troubled Debt Restructurings
A TDR is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a 
manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing 
financial difficulties. TDRs result from our loss mitigation 
activities and include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, 
postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization and 
extensions, which are intended to minimize economic loss and 
to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Additionally, 
TDRs also result from court imposed concessions (e.g. a 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy where the debtor is discharged from 
personal liability to us and a court approved Chapter 13 
bankruptcy repayment plan).

Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded 
Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit
We maintain an ALLL to absorb losses from the loan and lease 
portfolio and determine this allowance based on quarterly 
assessments of the estimated probable credit losses incurred in 
the loan and lease portfolio. Our total ALLL of $2.6 billion at 
December 31, 2017 consisted of $1.6 billion and $1.0 billion 
established for the commercial lending and consumer lending 
categories, respectively. We maintain the ALLL at a level that 
we believe to be appropriate to absorb estimated probable 
credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolio as of the 
balance sheet date. The reserve calculation and determination 
process is dependent on the use of key assumptions. Key 
reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and are 
influenced by observed changes in loan and lease portfolio 
performance experience, the financial strength of the 
borrower, and economic conditions. Key reserve assumptions 
are periodically updated.

Reserves are established for non-impaired commercial loan 
classes based primarily on PD and LGD. 

Our commercial pool reserve methodology is sensitive to 
changes in key risk parameters such as PD and LGD. The 
results of these parameters are then applied to the loan balance 
and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit to 
determine the amount of the respective reserves. The majority 
of the commercial portfolio is secured by collateral, including 
loans to asset-based lending customers, which generally 
demonstrate lower LGD compared to loans not secured by 
collateral. Our PDs and LGDs are primarily determined using 
internal commercial loan loss data. This internal data is 
supplemented with third-party data and management 
judgment, as deemed necessary. We continue to evaluate and 
enhance our use of internal commercial loss data and will 
periodically update our PDs and LGDs as well as consider 
third-party data, regulatory guidance and management 
judgment.

Allowances for non-impaired consumer loan classes are 
primarily based upon transition matrices, including using a 
roll-rate model. The roll-rate model uses statistical 
relationships, calculated from historical data that estimate the 
movement of loan outstandings through the various stages of 
delinquency and ultimately charge-off.

We establish specific allowances for loans considered 
impaired using methods prescribed by GAAP. All impaired 
loans are subject to individual analysis, except leases and large 
groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans which may 
include, but are not limited to, credit card, residential real 
estate secured and consumer installment loans. Specific 
allowances for individual loans (including commercial and 
consumer TDRs) are determined based on an analysis of the 
present value of expected future cash flows from the loans 
discounted at their effective interest rate, observable market 
price or the fair value of the underlying collateral.

58    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

A portion of the ALLL is related to qualitative measurement 
factors. These factors may include, but are not limited to, the 
following:

Industry concentrations and conditions,

• 
•  Recent credit quality trends,
•  Recent loss experience in particular portfolios,
•  Recent macro-economic factors,
•  Model imprecision,
•  Changes in lending policies and procedures,
•  Timing of available information, including the 

performance of first lien positions, and
•  Limitations of available historical data.

Our determination of the ALLL for non-impaired loans is 
sensitive to the risk grades assigned to commercial loans and 
loss rates for consumer loans. There are several other 
qualitative and quantitative factors considered in determining 
the ALLL. This sensitivity analysis does not necessarily reflect 
the nature and extent of future changes in the ALLL. It is 
intended to provide insight into the impact of adverse changes 
to risk grades and loss rates only and does not imply any 
expectation of future deterioration in the risk ratings or loss 
rates. Given the current processes used, we believe the risk 
grades and loss rates currently assigned are appropriate.

Purchased impaired loans are initially recorded at fair value 
and applicable accounting guidance prohibits the carry over or 
creation of valuation allowances at acquisition. Because the 
initial fair values of these loans already reflect a credit 
component, additional reserves are established when 
performance is expected to be worse than our expectations as 
of the acquisition date. At December 31, 2017, we had 
established reserves of $.3 billion for purchased impaired 
loans. In addition, loans (purchased impaired and non-
impaired) acquired after January 1, 2009 were recorded at fair 
value. No allowance for loan losses was carried over and no 
allowance was created at the date of acquisition.

In determining the appropriateness of the ALLL, we make 
specific allocations to impaired loans and allocations to 
portfolios of commercial and consumer loans. We also allocate 
reserves to provide coverage for probable losses incurred in 
the portfolio at the balance sheet date based upon current 
market conditions, which may not be reflected in historical 
loss data. Commercial lending is the largest category of credits 
and is sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments 
underlying the determination of the ALLL.

In addition to the ALLL, we maintain an allowance for 
unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We report 
this allowance as a liability on our Consolidated Balance 
Sheet. We maintain the allowance for unfunded loan 
commitments and letters of credit at a level we believe is 
appropriate to absorb estimated probable losses on these 
unfunded credit facilities. We determine this amount using 
estimates of the probability of the ultimate funding and losses 
related to those credit exposures. Other than the estimation of 
the probability of funding, this methodology is very similar to 
the one we use for determining our ALLL.

See Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 3 Asset Quality in 
the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of 
this Report for further information on certain key asset quality 
indicators that we use to evaluate our portfolios and establish 
the allowances.

At December 31, 2017, total ALLL to total nonperforming 
loans was 140%. The comparable amount for December 31, 
2016 was 121%. These ratios are 102% and 89%, respectively, 
when excluding the $.7 billion of ALLL at both December 31, 
2017 and December 31, 2016 allocated to consumer loans and 
lines of credit not secured by residential real estate and 
purchased impaired loans. We have excluded these amounts 
from ALLL in these ratios as these asset classes are not 
included in nonperforming loans. See Table 18 within this 
Credit Risk Management section for additional information.

The ALLL balance increases or decreases across periods in 
relation to fluctuating risk factors, including asset quality 
trends, net charge-offs and changes in aggregate portfolio 
balances. During 2017, overall credit quality remained stable, 
which resulted in an essentially flat ALLL balance as of 
December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016.

Liquidity and Capital Management 

Liquidity risk has two fundamental components. The first is 
potential loss assuming we were unable to meet our funding 
requirements at a reasonable cost. The second is the potential 
inability to operate our businesses because adequate 
contingent liquidity is not available. We manage liquidity risk 
at the consolidated company level (bank, parent company, and 
nonbank subsidiaries combined) to help ensure that we can 
obtain cost-effective funding to meet current and future 
obligations under both normal “business as usual” and 
stressful circumstances, and to help ensure that we maintain an 
appropriate level of contingent liquidity.

Management monitors liquidity through a series of early 
warning indicators that may indicate a potential market, or 
PNC-specific, liquidity stress event. In addition, management 
performs a set of liquidity stress tests over multiple time 
horizons with varying levels of severity and maintains a 
contingency funding plan to address a potential liquidity stress 
event. In the most severe liquidity stress simulation, we 
assume that our liquidity position is under pressure, while the 
market in general is under systemic pressure. The simulation 
considers, among other things, the impact of restricted access 
to both secured and unsecured external sources of funding, 
accelerated run-off of customer deposits, valuation pressure on 
assets and heavy demand to fund committed obligations. 
Parent company liquidity guidelines are designed to help 
ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet our parent 
company obligations over the succeeding 24-month period. 
Liquidity-related risk limits are established within our 
Enterprise Liquidity Management Policy and supporting 
policies. Management committees, including the Asset and 
Liability Committee, and the Board of Directors and its Risk 
Committee regularly review compliance with key established 
limits.

In addition to these liquidity monitoring measures and tools 
described above, we also monitor our liquidity by reference to 
the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) which is further 
described in the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 
of this Report.  PNC and PNC Bank calculate the LCR on a 
daily basis and as of December 31, 2017, the LCR for PNC 
and PNC Bank exceeded the fully phased-in requirement of 
100%.
 
We provide additional information regarding regulatory 
liquidity requirements and their potential impact on us in the 
Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business and 
Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report.

Sources of Liquidity
Our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the 
customer deposit base generated by our banking businesses. 
These deposits provide relatively stable and low-cost funding. 
Total deposits increased to $265.1 billion at December 31, 
2017 from $257.2 billion at December 31, 2016, driven by 
higher consumer and commercial deposits.  Consumer 
deposits reflected in part a shift from money market deposits 
to relationship-based savings products.  Commercial deposits 
reflected a shift from demand deposits to money market 
deposits primarily due to higher interest rates in 2017.  
Additionally, certain assets determined by us to be liquid and 
unused borrowing capacity from a number of sources are also 
available to manage our liquidity position.

At December 31, 2017, our liquid assets consisted of short-
term investments (Federal funds sold, resale agreements, 
trading securities and interest-earning deposits with banks) 
totaling $33.0 billion and securities available for sale totaling 
$57.6 billion. The level of liquid assets fluctuates over time 
based on many factors, including market conditions, loan and 
deposit growth and balance sheet management activities. Of 
our total liquid assets of $90.6 billion, we had $3.2 billion of 
securities available for sale and trading securities pledged as 
collateral to secure public and trust deposits, repurchase 
agreements and for other purposes. In addition, $4.9 billion of 
securities held to maturity were also pledged as collateral for 
these purposes.

We also obtain liquidity through various forms of funding, 
including long-term debt (senior notes, subordinated debt and 
FHLB advances) and short-term borrowings (securities sold 
under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other 
short-term borrowings).  See Note 10 Borrowed Funds and the 
Funding Sources section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet 
Review in this Report for additional information related to our 
Borrowings.

Total senior and subordinated debt, on a consolidated basis, 
increased due to the following activity:

notes initially issued on November 3, 2015 increased to $1.5 billion.

 
See Note 23 Subsequent Events for information on the January 
2018 issuances of $900 million and $700 million of senior 
fixed rate notes and $400 million of senior floating rate notes 
by PNC Bank.

PNC Bank maintains additional secured borrowing capacity 
with the FHLB-Pittsburgh and through the Federal Reserve 
Bank discount window. The Federal Reserve Bank, however, 
is not viewed as a primary means of funding our routine 
business activities, but rather as a potential source of liquidity 
in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. At 
December 31, 2017, our unused secured borrowing capacity at 
the FHLB-Pittsburgh and the Federal Reserve Bank totaled 
$41.0 billion. 

PNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0 billion of its 
commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of 
December 31, 2017, there were no issuances outstanding 
under this program.

Parent Company Liquidity
In addition to managing liquidity risk at the bank level, we 
monitor the parent company’s liquidity. The parent company’s 
contractual obligations consist primarily of debt service 
related to parent company borrowings and funding non-bank 
affiliates. Additionally, the parent company maintains 
adequate liquidity to fund discretionary activities such as 
paying dividends to our shareholders, share repurchases, and 
acquisitions.

As of December 31, 2017, available parent company liquidity 
totaled $5.7 billion. Parent company liquidity is primarily held 
in intercompany short-term investments, the terms of which 
provide for the availability of cash in 31 days or less. 
Investments with longer durations may also be acquired, but if 
so, the related maturities are aligned with scheduled cash 
needs, such as the maturity of parent company debt 
obligations.

The principal source of parent company liquidity is the 
dividends it receives from PNC Bank, which may be impacted 
by the following:

•  Bank-level capital needs,
•  Laws and regulations,
•  Corporate policies,
•  Contractual restrictions, and
•  Other factors.

There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of 
a national bank to pay dividends or make other capital 
distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or its 
non-bank subsidiaries. See Note 18 Regulatory Matters in the 
Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this 
Report for a further discussion of these limitations.

In addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other sources of 
parent company liquidity include cash and investments, as 
well as dividends and loan repayments from other subsidiaries 
and dividends or distributions from equity investments. We 
can also generate liquidity for the parent company and PNC’s 
non-bank subsidiaries through the issuance of debt and equity 
securities, including certain capital instruments, in public or 
private markets and commercial paper. The parent company 
has the ability to offer up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper 
to provide additional liquidity.  As of December 31, 2017, 
there was $.1 billion of commercial paper issuances 
outstanding. 

The parent company has an effective shelf registration 
statement pursuant to which we can issue additional debt, 
equity and other capital instruments.

Parent company senior and subordinated debt outstanding 
totaled $6.8 billion at December 31, 2017 compared with 
$6.2 billion at December 31, 2016.

Credit Ratings
PNC’s credit ratings affect the cost and availability of short 
and long-term funding, collateral requirements for certain 
derivative instruments and the ability to offer certain products.

In general, rating agencies base their ratings on many 
quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital 
adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, level and 
quality of earnings, and the current legislative and regulatory 
environment, including implied government support. In 
addition, rating agencies themselves have been subject to 
scrutiny arising from the most recent financial crisis and could 
make or be required to make substantial changes to their 
ratings policies and practices, particularly in response to 
legislative and regulatory changes. Potential changes in the 
legislative and regulatory environment and the timing of those 
changes could impact our ratings, which as noted above, could 
impact our liquidity and financial condition. A decrease, or 
potential decrease, in credit ratings could impact access to the 
capital markets and/or increase the cost of debt, and thereby 
adversely affect liquidity and financial condition.

Capital Management
We manage our funding and capital positions by making 
adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing 
or redeeming debt, issuing equity or other capital instruments, 
executing treasury stock transactions and capital redemptions 
or repurchases, and managing dividend policies and retaining 
earnings.

For the full year 2017, we returned $3.6 billion of capital to 
shareholders. Repurchases totaled 18.6 million common 
shares for $2.3 billion and dividends on common shares were 
$1.3 billion.

We repurchase shares of PNC common stock under share 
repurchase authorization provided by our Board of Directors
in the amount of up to 100 million shares and consistent with 
capital plans submitted to, and accepted by, the Federal 
Reserve. Repurchases are made on the open market or in 
privately negotiated transactions and the extent and timing of 
share repurchases under authorizations depend on a number of 
factors including, among others, market and general economic 
conditions, economic and regulatory capital considerations, 
alternative uses of capital, the potential impact on our credit 
ratings, contractual and regulatory limitations, and the results 
of supervisory assessments of capital adequacy and capital 
planning processes undertaken by the Federal Reserve as part 
of the CCAR and DFAST processes. 

In relation to the 2016 capital plan accepted by the Federal 
Reserve, we announced new share repurchase programs of up 
to $2.0 billion for the four quarter period ended June 30, 2017, 
including repurchases of up to $.2 billion related to employee 
benefit plans. In January 2017, we announced a $.3 billion 
increase in our share repurchase programs for the four quarter 
period. For the four quarter period ended June 30, 2017, we 
repurchased 21.5 million shares of PNC common stock for 
$2.3 billion. Of the total repurchased, 10.7 million shares for 
$1.3 billion occurred in the first two quarters of 2017.

In connection with the 2017 CCAR process, the Federal 
Reserve accepted our capital plan, as approved by our Board 
of Directors, and did not object to our proposed capital actions 
in June 2017. As provided for in the 2017 capital plan, we 
announced new share repurchase programs of up to 
$2.7 billion for the four quarter period beginning in the third 
quarter of 2017, including repurchases of up to $.3 billion 
related to employee benefit plans. We repurchased 7.9 million 
common shares for $1.1 billion during the third and fourth 
quarters of 2017 under these share repurchase programs.

The quarterly cash dividend on common stock was increased 
to 75 cents from 55 cents effective with the August 5, 2017 
dividend payment date.

See the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business 
in this Report for further information concerning the CCAR 
process and the factors the Federal Reserve takes into 
consideration in its evaluation of capital plans.

(a)  Calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to us during 2017.
(b)  PNC utilizes the pro forma fully phased-in Basel III capital ratios to assess its capital position (without the benefit of phase-ins), as these ratios represent the regulatory 

capital standards that may ultimately be applicable to PNC under the final Basel III rules. Pro forma fully phased-in capital amounts, ratios and risk-weighted and leverage-
related assets are estimates.

(c)  Basel III capital ratios and estimates may be impacted by additional regulatory guidance or analysis and, in the case of those ratios calculated using the advanced approaches, 

may be subject to variability based on the ongoing evolution, validation and regulatory approval of PNC’s models integral to the calculation of advanced approaches risk-
weighted assets.

(d)  Under the Basel III rules, certain items such as significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions (primarily BlackRock), mortgage servicing 

rights and deferred tax assets must be deducted from capital (subject to a phase-in schedule and net of associated deferred tax liabilities) to the extent they individually 
exceed 10%, or in the aggregate exceed 15%, of PNC's adjusted common equity Tier 1 capital.
Includes credit and market risk-weighted assets.

(e) 
(f)  Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets are estimated based on the Basel III advanced approaches rules, and include credit, market, and operational risk-weighted 

assets. During the parallel run qualification phase, PNC has refined the data, models, and internal processes used as part of the advanced approaches for determining risk-
weighted assets. We anticipate additional refinements to this estimate through the parallel run qualification phase.

For comparative purposes only, the pro forma fully phased-in advanced approaches Basel III Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimate is 10.9%. This capital ratio is 
calculated using pro forma fully phased-in Common equity Tier 1 capital and dividing by estimated Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets.
For comparative purposes only, the pro forma fully phased-in advanced approaches Basel III Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio estimate is 12.2%. This capital ratio is calculated 
using fully phased-in Tier 1 capital and dividing by estimated Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets.

(k)  For comparative purposes only, the pro forma fully phased-in advanced approaches Basel III Total capital risk-based capital ratio estimate is 13.5%. This ratio is calculated 
using fully phased-in Total Basel III capital, which under the advanced approaches, Additional Tier 2 capital includes allowance for loan and lease losses in excess of Basel

64    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

For detailed information on regulatory capital requirements, 
see the Banking Regulation and Supervision portion of the 
Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business.

We refer to the capital ratios calculated using the phased-in 
Basel III provisions in effect for 2017 and, for the risk-based 
ratios, standardized approach risk-weighted assets, as the 2017 
Transitional Basel III ratios.

Federal banking regulators have stated that they expect the 
largest U.S. bank holding companies, including PNC, to have 
a level of regulatory capital well in excess of the regulatory 
minimum and have required the largest U.S. bank holding 
companies, including PNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient 
to withstand losses and allow them to meet the credit needs of 
their customers through estimated stress scenarios. We seek to 
manage our capital consistent with these regulatory principles, 
and believe that our December 31, 2017 capital levels were 
aligned with them.

At December 31, 2017, PNC and PNC Bank, our sole bank 
subsidiary, were both considered “well capitalized,” based on 
applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio requirements. To 
qualify as “well capitalized”, PNC must have Transitional 
Basel III capital ratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based 
capital and 10% for Total risk-based capital, and PNC Bank 
must have Transitional Basel III capital ratios of at least 6.5% 
for Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% for Tier 1 
risk-based capital, 10% for Total risk-based capital and a 
Leverage ratio of at least 5%.

We provide additional information regarding regulatory capital 
requirements and some of their potential impacts on us in 
Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 18 Regulatory Matters in the 
Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this 
Report. See the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section of 
this Report for details on our December 31, 2016 Transitional 
Basel III and Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III common 
equity tier 1 capital ratios.

Market Risk Management
Market risk is the risk of a loss in earnings or economic value 
due to adverse movements in market factors such as interest 
rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices 
and equity prices. We are exposed to market risk primarily by 
our involvement in the following activities, among others:

•  Traditional banking activities of gathering deposits 

and extending loans,

•  Equity and other investments and activities whose 
economic values are directly impacted by market 
factors, and
Fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign 
exchange activities, as a result of customer activities 
and securities underwriting.

• 

We have established enterprise-wide policies and 
methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report market 
risk. Market Risk Management provides independent 
oversight by monitoring compliance with established 
guidelines and reporting significant risks in the business to the 
Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.

Market Risk Management – Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking 
activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many 
factors, including economic and financial conditions, 
movements in interest rates and consumer preferences, affect 
the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and 
the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of our 
noninterest-bearing funding sources. Due to the repricing term 
mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these 
products, changes in market interest rates not only affect 
expected near-term earnings, but also the economic values of 
these assets and liabilities.

Our Asset and Liability Management group centrally manages 
interest rate risk as prescribed in our risk management 
policies, which are approved by management’s Asset and 
Liability Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board of 
Directors.

Sensitivity results and market interest rate benchmarks for the 
fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016 follow:

In addition to measuring the effect on net interest income 
assuming parallel changes in current interest rates, we 
routinely simulate the effects of a number of nonparallel 
interest rate environments. Table 32 reflects the percentage 
change in net interest income over the next two 12-month 
periods assuming (i) the PNC Economist’s most likely rate 
forecast, (ii) implied market forward rates and (iii) yield curve 
slope flattening (a 100 basis point yield curve slope flattening 
between one-month and ten-year rates superimposed on 
current base rates) scenario.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  65

We use value-at-risk (VaR) as the primary means to measure 
and monitor market risk in customer-related trading activities. 
VaR is used to estimate the probability of portfolio losses 
based on the statistical analysis of historical market risk 
factors. A diversified VaR reflects empirical correlations 
across different asset classes. We calculate a diversified VaR at 
a 95% confidence interval and the results for 2017 and 2016 
were within our acceptable limits.

To help ensure the integrity of the models used to calculate 
VaR for each portfolio and enterprise-wide, we use a process 
known as backtesting. The backtesting process consists of 
comparing actual observations of gains or losses against the 
VaR levels that were calculated at the close of the prior 
day. Our VaR measure assumes that exposures remain constant 
and that recent market variability is a good predictor of future 
variability. Actual observations include customer related 
revenue and intraday hedging which helps to reduce losses and 
can reduce the number of instances actual losses exceed the 
prior day VaR measure. There were one and two instances 
during 2017 and 2016, respectively, under our diversified VaR 
measure where actual losses exceeded the prior day VaR 
measure and those losses were insignificant. Our portfolio and 
enterprise-wide VaR models utilize a historical approach with 
a 500 day look back period.

Customer-related trading revenue was $255 million for full 
year 2017 compared with $203 million for full year 2016 and 
is recorded in Other noninterest income and Other interest 
income on our Consolidated Income Statement. The increase 
was mainly due to higher revenue from credit valuations on 
customer-related derivative activities and higher foreign 
exchange client sales revenues.

Market Risk Management – Equity And Other Investment 
Risk
Equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated 
with investing in both private and public equity markets. In 
addition to extending credit, taking deposits, underwriting 
securities and trading financial instruments, we make and 
manage direct investments in a variety of transactions, 
including management buyouts, recapitalizations and growth 
financings in a variety of industries. We also have investments 
in affiliated and non-affiliated funds that make similar 
investments in private equity. The economic and/or book value 
of these investments and other assets are directly affected by 
changes in market factors.

Various PNC business units manage our equity and other 
investment activities. Our businesses are responsible for 
making investment decisions within the approved policy limits 
and associated guidelines.

All changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to 
results in a base rate scenario where current market rates are 
assumed to remain unchanged over the forecast horizon.

When forecasting net interest income, we make assumptions 
about interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, the 
volume and characteristics of new business and the behavior 
of existing on- and off-balance sheet positions. These 
assumptions determine the future level of simulated net 
interest income in the base interest rate scenario and the other 
interest rate scenarios presented in Tables 31 and 32. These 
simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature, they 
are replaced or repriced at then current market rates.

The following graph presents the LIBOR/Swap yield curves 
for the base rate scenario and each of the alternate scenarios 
one year forward.

Table 33: Alternate Interest Rate Scenarios: One Year 
Forward 

The fourth quarter 2017 interest sensitivity analyses indicate 
that our Consolidated Balance Sheet is positioned to benefit 
from an increase in interest rates and an upward sloping 
interest rate yield curve. We believe that we have the deposit 
funding base and balance sheet flexibility to adjust, where 
appropriate and permissible, to changing interest rates and 
market conditions.

Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading 
Risk
We engage in fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign 
exchange transactions to support our customers’ investing and 
hedging activities. These transactions, related hedges and the 
credit valuation adjustment related to our customer derivatives 
portfolio are marked-to-market daily and reported as 
customer-related trading activities. We do not engage in 
proprietary trading of these products.

investment. Private equity investments carried at estimated 
fair value totaled $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 
2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. As of 
December 31, 2017, $1.1 billion was invested directly in a 
variety of companies and $.2 billion was invested indirectly 
through various private equity funds. See Item 1 Business –
Supervision and Regulation of this Report for discussion of 
the potential impacts of the Volcker Rule provisions of Dodd-
Frank on our interests in and of private funds covered by the 
Volcker Rule, including the five-year extension we received in 
February 2017 to conform certain equity investments subject 
to the Volcker Rule.

Included in our other equity investments are Visa Class B 
common shares, which are recorded at cost. At December 31, 
2017, the estimated value of our investment in Visa Class B 
common shares was approximately $661 million and our cost 
basis was not significant. Visa Class B common shares that we 
own are transferable only under limited circumstances until 
they can be converted into shares of the publicly-traded class 
of stock, which cannot happen until the settlement of the 
pending interchange litigation. See Note 6 Fair Value and Note 
19 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial 

Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information 
regarding our Visa agreements. In the fourth quarter of 2017, 
we recorded a negative derivative fair value adjustment of 
$248 million related to swap agreements with purchasers of 
Visa Class B common shares. These fair value adjustments 
were primarily related to the extension of anticipated timing of 
litigation resolution.

We also have certain other equity investments, the majority of 
which represent investments in affiliated and non-affiliated 
funds with both traditional and alternative investment 
strategies. Net gains related to these investments were not 
significant during 2017 and 2016.

Impact of Inflation
Our assets and liabilities are primarily financial in nature and 
typically have varying maturity dates. Accordingly, future 
changes in prices do not affect the obligations to pay or 
receive fixed and determinable amounts of money. However, 
during periods of inflation, there may be a subsequent impact 
affecting certain fixed costs or expenses, an erosion of 
consumer and customer purchasing power, and fluctuations in 
the need or demand for our products and services. Should 
significant levels of inflation occur, our business could 
potentially be impacted by, among other things, reducing our 
tolerance for extending credit or causing us to incur additional 
credit losses resulting from possible increased default rates.
 
Financial Derivatives
We use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall 
asset and liability risk management process to help manage 
exposure to market and credit risk inherent in our business 
activities. Substantially all such instruments are used to 
manage risk related to changes in interest rates. Interest rate 
swaps, interest rate caps and floors, swaptions, options, 
forwards and futures contracts are the primary instruments we 
use for interest rate risk management. We also enter into 
derivatives with customers to facilitate their risk management 
activities.

Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, market and 
credit risk. Periodic cash payments are exchanged for interest 
rate swaps, options and future contracts. Premiums are also 
exchanged for options contracts. Therefore, cash requirements 
and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the 
notional amount on these instruments.

Further information on our financial derivatives is presented in 
Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 6 Fair Value and Note 13 
Financial Derivatives in the Notes To Consolidated Financial 
Statements in Item 8 of this Report, which is incorporated here 
by reference.

Not all elements of market and credit risk are addressed 
through the use of financial derivatives, and such instruments 
may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to 
unanticipated market changes, among other reasons.

•  Third Party: Risk arising from failure of third party 

providers to conduct activity in a safe and sound 
manner and in compliance with contract provisions 
and applicable laws and regulations.

We utilize operational risk management programs within the 
framework, including Risk Control and Self-Assessments, 
scenario analysis, and internal and external loss event review 
and analysis, to assess existing risks, determine potential/
emerging risks and evaluate the effectiveness of internal 
controls. The program tools and methodology enable our 
business managers to identify potential risks and control gaps.

Lines of business are responsible for identifying, owning, 
managing, and monitoring the operational risks and controls 
associated with its business activities and product or service 
offerings to within acceptable levels. Centralized functions, 
such as Business Continuity, Enterprise Third Party 
Management, and Information Security, are responsible for the 
development, implementation and management of their 
individual programs and for the development and maintenance 
of the policies, procedures, methodologies, tools, and 
technology utilized across the enterprise to identify, assess, 
monitor, and report program risks. Additionally, independent 
risk management reviews and challenges line of business 
adherence to the framework to ensure proper controls are in 
place and appropriate risk mitigation plans are established as 
necessary.

Compliance Risk
Enterprise Compliance is responsible for coordinating the 
compliance risk component of our Operational Risk 
Management Framework. Compliance issues are identified 
and tracked through enterprise-wide monitoring and tracking 
programs. Key compliance risk issues are escalated through a 
comprehensive risk reporting process at both a business and 
enterprise level and incorporated, as appropriate, into the 
development and assessment of our operational risk profile. A  
committee, chaired by  the Chief Compliance Officer, is 
responsible for oversight of compliance and fiduciary risk 
management programs across PNC. In order to help 
understand and proactively address emerging regulatory issues 
where appropriate, Enterprise Compliance communicates 
regularly with various regulators having supervisory or 
regulatory responsibilities with respect to us, our subsidiaries, 
or businesses and participates in forums focused on regulatory 
and compliance matters in the financial services industry.

Operational Risk Management
Operational risk is the risk to the current or projected financial 
condition and resilience arising from inadequate or failed 
internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct, or 
adverse external events. Operational risk is inherent to the 
entire organization.

Operational risk management is embedded in our culture and 
decision-making processes through a systematic approach 
whereby operational risks and exposures are: 1) identified and 
assessed; 2) managed through the design and implementation 
of controls; 3) measured and evaluated against our risk 
tolerance limits; and 4) appropriately reported to management 
and the Risk Committee. Strong operational risk management 
and well-informed risk-based decisions benefit us by 
improving the customer experience, enhancing compliance, 
reducing reputational risk, minimizing losses, and establishing 
an appropriate amount of required operational risk capital held 
by us.

The Operational Risk Management Framework supports our 
effective and consistent management of operational risk. The 
primary purpose of the framework is to enable us to 
understand our operational risks and manage them to the 
desired risk profile, in line with our Risk Appetite. 
Additionally, the guidance established within the framework 
enables management to make well-informed risk-based 
business decisions.

The framework provides a disciplined and structured process 
for us to manage operational risk across eight operational risk 
domains. These domains provide a comprehensive view of 
operational risk and allow us to discuss operational risk in a 
standard way, facilitating reporting and ongoing risk 
mitigation.

The operational risk domains are:

•  Operations: Risk resulting from inadequate or failed 
internal processes, misconduct or errors of people or 
fraud.

•  Compliance: Risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, 

financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from 
failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, self-
regulatory standards, or other regulatory 
requirements.

•  Data Management: Risk associated with incomplete 

or inaccurate data.

•  Model: Risk associated with the design, 

implementation, and ongoing use and management of 
a model.

•  Technology and Systems: Risk associated with the 

• 

use, operation, and adoption of technology.
Information Security: Risk resulting from the failure 
to protect information and ensure appropriate access 
to, and use and handling of information assets.

•  Business Continuity: Risk of potential disruptive 

events to business activities.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared by 
applying certain accounting policies. Note 1 Accounting 
Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in 
Item 8 of this Report describes the most significant accounting 
policies that we use. Certain of these policies require us to 
make estimates or economic assumptions that may vary under 
different assumptions or conditions and such variations may 
significantly affect our reported results and financial position 
for the period or in future periods.

Fair Value Measurements
We must use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when 
assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted 
to reflect, fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value 
inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement 
volatility. Fair values and the information used to record 
valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are 
based on either quoted market prices or are provided by 
independent third-party sources, including appraisers and 
valuation specialists, when available. When such third-party

The majority of assets recorded at fair value are included in 
the securities available for sale portfolio. The majority of 
Level 3 assets represent non-agency residential mortgage-
backed securities in the securities available for sale portfolio, 
equity investments and mortgage servicing rights. The decline 
in Level 3 assets was driven by the transfer of certain 
commercial mortgage loans held for sale to Level 2 and 
settlements related to residential mortgage-backed securities 
available for sale during the period. For further information on 
fair value, see Note 6 Fair Value in the Notes To the 
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded 
Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit
We maintain the ALLL and the Allowance for Unfunded Loan 
Commitments and Letters of Credit at levels that we believe to 
be appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses 
incurred in the loan and lease portfolios and on these unfunded 
credit facilities as of the balance sheet date. Our determination 
of the allowances is based on periodic evaluations of the loan 
and lease portfolios and unfunded credit facilities and other 

information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily 
by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques. 
Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in 
any of these areas could materially impact our future financial 
condition and results of operations.

We apply ASC 820 – Fair Value Measurements. This guidance 
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell a 
financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date. This guidance requires a three level 
hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair 
value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the 
hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation 
methodology used in the measurement are observable or 
unobservable.
 
The following table summarizes the assets and liabilities 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 
2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and the portions of 
such assets and liabilities that are classified within Level 3 of 
the valuation hierarchy. Level 3 assets and liabilities are those 
where the fair value is estimated using significant 
unobservable inputs.

relevant factors. These critical estimates include significant 
use of our own historical data and complex methods to 
interpret them. We have an ongoing process to evaluate and 
enhance the quality, quantity and timeliness of our data and 
interpretation methods used in the determination of these 
allowances. These evaluations are inherently subjective, as 
they require material estimates and may be susceptible to 
significant change, and include, among others:

• 
Probability of default (PD),
•  Loss given default (LGD),
•  Outstanding balance of the loan,
•  Movement through delinquency stages,
•  Amounts and timing of expected future cash flows,
•  Value of collateral, which may be obtained from third 

parties, and

•  Qualitative factors, such as changes in current 

economic conditions, that may not be reflected in 
modeled results.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  69

For all loans, the ALLL is the sum of three components: 
(i) asset specific/individual impaired reserves, (ii) quantitative 
(formulaic or pooled) reserves and (iii) qualitative 
(judgmental) reserves. The reserve calculation and 
determination process is dependent on the use of key 
assumptions. Key reserve assumptions and estimation 
processes react to and are influenced by observed changes in 
loan portfolio performance experience, the financial strength 
of the borrower, and economic conditions. For unfunded 
commitments, the reserve estimate also includes estimation of 
the probability of funding. Key reserve assumptions are 
periodically updated.

To the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates, 
additional provision for credit losses may be required that 
would reduce future earnings. See the following for additional 
information:

•  Allowances For Loan And Lease Losses And 

Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters Of Credit 
in the Credit Risk Management section of this Item 7, 
and

Loan and Lease Losses in the Notes To Consolidated 
Financial Statements and Allocation of Allowance for 
Loan and Lease Losses in the Statistical Information 
(Unaudited) section of Item 8 of this Report.

Goodwill

Goodwill arising from business acquisitions represents the 
value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the 
business acquired. Most of our goodwill relates to value 
inherent in the Retail Banking and Corporate & Institutional 
Banking businesses.

The value of goodwill is supported by earnings, which is 
driven by our invested assets and transaction volume and, for 
certain businesses, the market value of assets under 
administration or for which processing services are provided. 
Lower earnings and realized profitability resulting from a lack 
of growth or our inability to deliver cost-effective services 
over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill, 
which could result in a current period charge to earnings. At 
least annually, in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if 
events occur or circumstances have changed significantly from 
the annual test date, management reviews the current 
operating environment and strategic direction of each 
reporting unit taking into consideration any events or changes 
in circumstances that may have an effect on the unit. For this 
review, inputs are generated and used in calculating the fair 
value of the reporting unit, which is compared to its carrying 
amount (“Step 1” of the goodwill impairment test) as further 
discussed below. The fair values of our reporting units are 
determined using a discounted cash flow valuation model with 
assumptions based upon market comparables. Additionally, we 
may also evaluate certain financial metrics that are indicative 
of fair value, including market quotes, price to earnings ratios 
and recent acquisitions involving other financial institutions. A 
reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level 
below an operating segment. If the fair value of the reporting 
unit is less than its carrying amount, the reporting unit’s 

70    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

goodwill would be evaluated for impairment. In this 
circumstance, the implied fair value of reporting unit 
goodwill, which is determined as if the reporting unit had been 
acquired in a business combination, would be compared to the 
carrying amount of that goodwill (“Step 2” of the goodwill 
impairment test). If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds 
the implied fair value of goodwill, the difference is recognized 
as an impairment loss.

The results of our annual 2017 impairment test indicated that 
the estimated fair values of our reporting units with goodwill 
exceeded their carrying values by at least 10% and are not 
considered to be at risk of not passing Step 1. By definition, 
assumptions utilized in estimating the fair value of a reporting 
unit are judgmental and inherently uncertain, but absent a 
significant change in economic conditions of a reporting unit, 
we would not expect the fair values of these reporting units to 
decrease below their respective carrying values. Similarly, 
there were no impairment charges related to goodwill in 2016 
or 2015.

See Note 7 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights in the 
Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this 
Report for additional information.
 
Residential and Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights
We elect to measure our residential and commercial mortgage 
servicing rights (MSRs) at fair value. This election was made 
to be consistent with our risk management strategy to hedge 
changes in the fair value of these assets. The fair value of 
residential and commercial MSRs is estimated by using a 
discounted cash flow valuation model which calculates the 
present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows, 
taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan 
prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs, and other 
factors which are determined based on current market 
conditions.

We employ risk management strategies designed to protect the 
value of MSRs from changes in interest rates and related 
market factors. The values of the residential and commercial 
MSRs are economically hedged with securities and 
derivatives, including interest-rate swaps, options, and forward 
mortgage-backed and futures contracts. As interest rates 
change, these financial instruments are expected to have 
changes in fair value negatively correlated to the change in 
fair value of the hedged MSR portfolios. The hedge 
relationships are actively managed in response to changing 
market conditions over the life of the MSRs. Selecting 
appropriate financial instruments to economically hedge 
residential or commercial MSRs requires significant 
management judgment to assess how mortgage rates and 
prepayment speeds could affect the future values of MSRs. 
Hedging results can frequently be less predictable in the short 
term, but over longer periods of time are expected to protect 
the economic value of the MSRs.

The following sections of this Report provide further 
information on residential and commercial MSRs:

Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this 
Report.

•  Note 7 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights 
included in the Notes To Consolidated Financial 
Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Income Taxes
In the normal course of business, we and our subsidiaries enter 
into transactions for which the tax treatment is unclear or 
subject to varying interpretations. In addition, filing 
requirements, methods of filing and the calculation of taxable 
income in various state and local jurisdictions are subject to 
differing interpretations.

We evaluate and assess the relative risks and merits of the tax 
treatment of transactions, filing positions, filing methods and 
taxable income calculations after considering statutes, 
regulations, judicial precedent, and other information, and 
maintain tax accruals consistent with our evaluation of these 
relative risks and merits. The result of our evaluation and 
assessment is by its nature an estimate. We and our 
subsidiaries are routinely subject to audit and challenges from 
taxing authorities. In the event we resolve a challenge for an 
amount different than amounts previously accrued, we will 
account for the difference in the period in which we resolve 
the matter.

Where our accounting of certain income tax effects of the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 is complete, 
these tax effects have been included in the financial 
statements. However, to the extent our accounting for certain 
income tax effects is incomplete, but can be reasonably 
estimated, the estimated effects are included as provisional 
amounts in the financial statements. During the measurement 
period, which will end on December 21, 2018, these estimates 
may be adjusted upon obtaining or analyzing additional 
information about facts and circumstances or clarification of 
uncertain aspects of the newly enacted tax law. If known, the 
adjustments would have affected the initially reported 
provisional amounts.

Legal Contingencies

For a description of the significant estimates and judgments 
associated with establishing reserves for legal contingencies, 
see Note 19 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated 
Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Revenue Recognition
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standard Board 
(FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This 
ASU clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and 
replaces nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance in 
U.S. GAAP with one accounting model. The core principle of 
the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue when it 
satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised 
good or service to a customer. The ASU requires additional 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures relating to the nature, 
amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows 
arising from contracts with customers.

We adopted this standard as of January 1, 2018 under the 
modified retrospective approach. The impact of adoption was 
immaterial to PNC's consolidated results of operations and 
financial position. The most significant impact of adoption 
will be expanded disclosures relating to disaggregation of in-
scope revenue, which will be included in our first quarter 2018 
Form 10-Q.

Financial Instruments
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial 
Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and 
Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. 
This ASU changes the accounting for certain equity 
investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option 
and presentation and disclosure requirements for financial 
instruments. Equity investments not accounted for under the 
equity method of accounting will be measured at fair value 
with any changes in fair value recognized in net income. For 
an equity investment which does not have a readily 
determinable fair value, an election can be made to measure 
the investment at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus 
changes in value resulting from observable price changes in 
identical or similar instruments of the issuer. The ASU also 
simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments 
for which fair value is not readily determinable. 

We adopted this standard as of January 1, 2018 under the 
modified retrospective approach, except for the amendment 
related to equity securities without readily determinable fair 
values, which is applied prospectively. The impact of adoption 
was immaterial to PNC's consolidated results of operations 
and financial position. 

Leases
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases 
(Topic 842). The primary change in the new guidance is the 
recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for 
operating leases. The ASU requires lessees to recognize a 
right-of-use asset and related lease liability for all leases with 
lease terms of more than 12 months. The recognition, 
measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows 
arising from a lease by a lessee will depend on its 
classification as a finance or operating lease. The ASU is 
effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those 
annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018 using a

modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect 
adjustment. Early adoption is permitted.

adoption date, as well as macroeconomic conditions and 
forecasts at that date.

Our implementation efforts are ongoing, including the 
deployment of a lease accounting software solution. We are 
currently evaluating the impact of various accounting policy 
elections, the discount rate to present value the future 
minimum payments under operating leases, and the impact of 
new disclosure requirements. We are substantially complete 
with the evaluation of our initial lease population. We expect, 
at a minimum, to recognize lease liabilities and corresponding 
right-of-use assets commensurate with the present value of the 
future minimum payments required under operating leases as 
disclosed in Note 8 Premises, Equipment and Leasehold 
Improvements in the Notes To Consolidated Financial 
Statements in this Report. We do not expect a material change 
to the timing of our expense recognition.

Credit Losses
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial 
Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of 
Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The ASU requires the 
use of an expected credit loss methodology; specifically, 
current expected credit losses (CECL) for the remaining life of 
the asset will be recognized at the time of origination or 
acquisition. The CECL methodology will apply to loans, debt 
securities, and other financial assets and net investment in 
leases not accounted for at fair value through net income. It 
will also apply to off-balance sheet credit exposures except for 
unconditionally cancellable commitments. Assets in the scope 
of the ASU will be presented at the net amount expected to be 
collected after deducting the allowance for credit losses from 
the amortized cost basis of the assets. Enhanced credit quality 
disclosures will be required including disaggregation of credit 
quality indicators by vintage. The ASU is effective for us for 
the first quarter of 2020 using a modified retrospective 
approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained 
earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. We do 
not plan to adopt the standard at its early adoption date in the 
first quarter of 2019.

The CECL methodology and new disclosures requires 
significant data collection, building or enhancement of loss 
models, and process re-development prior to adoption. We 
established a company-wide, cross-functional governance 
structure in the third quarter of 2016, which oversees overall 
strategy for implementation of Topic 326, including model 
methodology, technology, development, data enhancements 
and governance issues. We continue to design and develop 
CECL estimation methodologies and technological solutions. 
Concurrently, we are assessing and analyzing whether data 
that is required to comply with the standard is available and 
accurate.

We continue to believe that the adoption of the standard will 
result in an overall increase in the allowance for loan losses to 
cover credit losses over the estimated life of the financial 
assets. However, the magnitude of the increase in our 
allowance for loan losses at the adoption date will depend 
upon the nature and characteristics of the portfolio at the

Statement of Cash Flows
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of 
Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash 
Receipts and Cash Payments. The ASU provides guidance on 
eight specific issues related to classification within the 
statement of cash flows with the objective of reducing existing 
diversity in practice. The specific issues cover cash payments 
for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; cash 
outflows for settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or 
other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are 
insignificant; contingent consideration payments that are not 
made soon after a business combination; proceeds from the 
settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement 
of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-
owned life insurance policies; distributions received from 
equity method investees; beneficial interests received in 
securitization transactions; and clarifies that when no specific 
GAAP guidance exists and the source of the cash flows are not 
separately identifiable, then the predominant source of cash 
flows should be used to determine the classification for the 
item. We adopted the standard as of January 1, 2018 under the 
retrospective transition method. The impact of adoption was 
immaterial to our consolidated statement of cash flows.

Derivatives and Hedging
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives 
and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to 
Accounting for Hedging Activities. The ASU simplifies the 
application of hedge accounting by easing the requirements 
for effectiveness testing, hedge documentation and the 
application of critical terms match method. The ASU also 
provides new alternatives for applying hedge accounting to 
additional hedging strategies and measuring the hedged item 
in fair value hedges of interest rate risk.

The ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods 
within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 
2018 with early adoption permitted. All transition 
requirements and elections should be applied to hedging 
relationships existing on the date of adoption and the effect of 
adoption is required to be reflected as of the beginning of the 
fiscal year of adoption (i.e. modified retrospective application) 
through a cumulative-effect adjustment. The amended 
presentation and disclosure guidance is required only 
prospectively. One-time transition elections are available to 
modify existing hedge documentation. 

We adopted the standard on January 1, 2018 using the 
modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of 
initially applying ASU 2017-12 recognized at the date of 
initial application. The impact of adoption was immaterial to 
PNC's consolidated results of operations and financial 
position.

Comprehensive Income
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income 
Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): 
Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated 
Other Comprehensive Income. This ASU permits the 
reclassification to retained earnings of the income tax effects 
stranded within accumulated other comprehensive income 
(AOCI) as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs 
Act. This standard requires qualitative disclosures of the 
accounting policy relating to releasing income tax effects from 
AOCI and if the reclassification election is made, the impacts 
of the change on the financial statements. We adopted this 
standard as of January 1, 2018 and have elected to reclassify 
the income tax effects from AOCI to retained earnings at the 
beginning of the period of adoption. The impact of adoption 
was immaterial to PNC’s consolidated balance sheet.

which we have adopted.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND VARIABLE 
INTEREST ENTITIES
We engage in a variety of activities that involve entities that 
are not consolidated or otherwise reflected in our Consolidated

GLOSSARY OF TERMS
Adjusted average total assets – Primarily consisted of total 
average quarterly (or annual) assets plus/less unrealized losses 
(gains) on investment securities, less goodwill and certain 
other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes).

Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital – Common stock plus 
related surplus, net of treasury stock, plus retained earnings, 
plus accumulated other comprehensive income for securities 
currently and those transferred from available for sale and 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans, subject to 
phase-in limits, less goodwill, net of associated deferred tax 
liabilities, less other disallowed intangibles, net of deferred tax 
liabilities and plus/less other adjustments. Significant common 
stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, as 
well as mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets, must 
then be deducted to the extent such items individually exceed 
10%, or in the aggregate exceed 15%, of our adjusted Basel III 
common equity Tier 1 capital .

Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio – Common equity 
Tier 1 capital divided by period-end risk-weighted assets (as 
applicable).

Basel III Tier 1 capital – Common equity Tier 1 capital, plus 
qualifying preferred stock, plus certain trust preferred capital 
securities, plus certain noncontrolling interests that are held by 
others and plus/less other adjustments.

Basel III Tier 1 capital ratio – Tier 1 capital divided by period-
end risk-weighted assets (as applicable).

Basel III Total capital – Tier 1 capital plus qualifying 
subordinated debt, plus certain trust preferred securities, plus, 
under the Basel III transitional rules and the standardized 
approach, the allowance for loan and lease losses included in 
Tier 2 capital and other.

Basel III Total capital ratio – Total capital divided by period-
end risk-weighted assets (as applicable).

Charge-off – Process of removing a loan or portion of a loan 
from our balance sheet because it is considered uncollectible. 
We also record a charge-off when a loan is transferred from 
portfolio holdings to held for sale by reducing the loan 
carrying amount to the fair value of the loan, if fair value is 
less than carrying amount.

Combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) – This is the aggregate 
principal balance(s) of the mortgages on a property divided by 
its appraised value or purchase price.

the liquidation value of preferred stock.

Credit valuation adjustment – Represents an adjustment to the 
fair value of our derivatives for our own and counterparties’ 
non-performance risk.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  73

Criticized commercial loans – Loans with potential or 
identified weaknesses based upon internal risk ratings that 
comply with the regulatory classification definitions of 
“Special Mention,” “Substandard” or “Doubtful.”

Discretionary client assets under management – Assets over 
which we have sole or shared investment authority for our 
customers/clients. We do not include these assets on our 
Consolidated Balance Sheet.
 
Duration of equity – An estimate of the rate sensitivity of our 
economic value of equity. A negative duration of equity is 
associated with asset sensitivity (i.e., positioned for rising 
interest rates), while a positive value implies liability 
sensitivity (i.e., positioned for declining interest rates). For 
example, if the duration of equity is -1.5 years, the economic 
value of equity increases by 1.5% for each 100 basis point 
increase in interest rates.

Earning assets – Assets that generate income, which include: 
interest-earning deposits with banks; loans held for sale; loans; 
investment securities; and certain other assets.

Effective duration – A measurement, expressed in years, that, 
when multiplied by a change in interest rates, would 
approximate the percentage change in value of on- and off- 
balance sheet positions.

Efficiency – Noninterest expense divided by total revenue.

Fair value – The price that would be received to sell an asset 
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date.

Fee income – When referring to the components of 
Noninterest income, we use the term fee income to refer to the 
following categories within Noninterest income: Asset 
management; Consumer services; Corporate services; 
Residential mortgage; and Service charges on deposits.

FICO score – A credit bureau-based industry standard score 
created by Fair Isaac Co. which predicts the likelihood of 
borrower default. We use FICO scores both in underwriting 
and assessing credit risk in our consumer lending portfolio. 
Lower FICO scores indicate likely higher risk of default, 
while higher FICO scores indicate likely lower risk of default. 
FICO scores are updated on a periodic basis.

Foreign exchange contracts – Contracts that provide for the 
future receipt and delivery of foreign currency at previously 
agreed-upon terms.

Futures and forward contracts – Contracts in which the buyer 
agrees to purchase and the seller agrees to deliver a specific 
financial instrument at a predetermined price or yield. May be 
settled either in cash or by delivery of the underlying financial 
instrument.

GAAP – Accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States of America.

74    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

Home price index (HPI) – A broad measure of the movement 
of single-family house prices in the U.S.

Impaired loans – Loans are determined to be impaired when, 
based on current information and events, it is probable that all 
contractually required payments will not be collected. 
Impaired loans include commercial nonperforming loans and 
consumer and commercial TDRs, regardless of nonperforming 
status. Excluded from impaired loans are nonperforming 
leases, loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair 
value option, smaller balance homogenous type loans and 
purchased impaired loans.

Interest rate swap contracts – Contracts that are entered into 
primarily as an asset/liability management strategy to reduce 
interest rate risk. Interest rate swap contracts are exchanges of 
interest rate payments, such as fixed-rate payments for 
floating-rate payments, based on notional principal amounts.

Intrinsic value – The difference between the price, if any, 
required to be paid for stock issued pursuant to an equity 
compensation arrangement and the fair market value of the 
underlying stock.

Leverage ratio – Tier 1 capital divided by average quarterly 
adjusted total assets.

LIBOR – Acronym for London InterBank Offered Rate. 
LIBOR is the average interest rate charged when banks in the 
London wholesale money market (or interbank market) 
borrow unsecured funds from each other. LIBOR rates are 
used as a benchmark for interest rates on a global basis. Our 
product set includes loans priced using LIBOR as a 
benchmark.

Loan-to-value ratio (LTV) – A calculation of a loan’s collateral 
coverage that is used both in underwriting and assessing credit 
risk in our lending portfolio. LTV is the sum total of loan 
obligations secured by collateral divided by the market value 
of that same collateral. Market values of the collateral are 
based on an independent valuation of the collateral. For 
example, a LTV of less than 90% is better secured and has less 
credit risk than a LTV of greater than or equal to 90%.

Loss given default (LGD) – An estimate of loss, net of 
recovery based on collateral type, collateral value, loan 
exposure, and other factors. Each loan has its own LGD. The 
LGD risk rating measures the percentage of exposure of a 
specific credit obligation that we expect to lose if default 
occurs. LGD is net of recovery, through any means, including 
but not limited to the liquidation of collateral or deficiency 
judgments rendered from foreclosure or bankruptcy 
proceedings.

Nonaccrual loans – Loans for which we do not accrue interest 
income. Nonaccrual loans include nonperforming loans, in 
addition to loans accounted for under fair value option and 
loans accounted for as held for sale for which full collection of 
contractual principal and/or interest is not probable.

Nondiscretionary client assets under administration – Assets 
we hold for our customers/clients in a nondiscretionary, 
custodial capacity. We do not include these assets on our 
Consolidated Balance Sheet.
 
Nonperforming assets – Nonperforming assets include 
nonperforming loans and OREO, foreclosed and other assets, 
but exclude certain government insured or guaranteed loans 
for which we expect to collect substantially all principal and 
interest, loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair 
value option and purchased impaired loans. We do not accrue 
interest income on assets classified as nonperforming.

Nonperforming loans – Loans accounted for at amortized cost 
for which we do not accrue interest income. Nonperforming 
loans include loans to commercial, commercial real estate, 
equipment lease financing, home equity, residential real estate, 
credit card and other consumer customers as well as TDRs 
which have not returned to performing status. Nonperforming 
loans exclude certain government insured or guaranteed loans 
for which we expect to collect substantially all principal and 
interest, loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair 
value option and purchased impaired loans. Nonperforming 
loans exclude purchased impaired loans as we are currently 
accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans.

Notional amount – A number of currency units, shares, or 
other units specified in a derivative contract.

Operating leverage – The period to period dollar or percentage 
change in total revenue (GAAP basis) less the dollar or 
percentage change in noninterest expense. A positive variance 
indicates that revenue growth exceeded expense growth (i.e., 
positive operating leverage) while a negative variance implies 
expense growth exceeded revenue growth (i.e., negative 
operating leverage).

Options – Contracts that grant the purchaser, for a premium 
payment, the right, but not the obligation, to either purchase or 
sell the associated financial instrument at a set price during a 
specified period or at a specified date in the future.

Other real estate owned (OREO), foreclosed and other assets –
Assets taken in settlement of troubled loans primarily through 
deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or foreclosure. Foreclosed and 
other assets include real and personal property, equity interests 
in corporations, partnerships, and limited liability companies. 
Excludes certain assets that have a government guarantee 
which are classified as other receivables.

Probability of default (PD) – An internal risk rating that 
indicates the likelihood that a credit obligor will enter into 
default status.

Recovery – Cash proceeds received on a loan that we had 
previously charged off. We credit the amount received to the 
allowance for loan and lease losses.

Risk – The potential that an event or series of events could 
occur that would threaten our ability to achieve our strategic 
objectives, thereby negatively affecting shareholder value or 
reputation.

Risk appetite – A dynamic, forward-looking view on the 
aggregate amount of risk we are willing and able to take in 
executing business strategy in light of the current business 
environment.

Risk limits – Quantitative measures based on forward looking 
assumptions that allocate the firm’s aggregate risk appetite 
(e.g. measure of loss or negative events) to business lines, 
legal entities, specific risk categories, concentrations and as 
appropriate, other levels.

Risk profile – The risk profile is a point-in-time assessment of 
risk. The profile represents overall risk position in relation to 
the desired risk appetite. The determination of the risk 
profile’s position is based on qualitative and quantitative 
analysis of reported risk limits, metrics, operating guidelines 
and qualitative assessments.

Risk-weighted assets – Computed by the assignment of 
specific risk-weights (as defined by the Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System) to assets and off-balance sheet 
instruments.

Servicing rights – An intangible asset or liability created by an 
obligation to service assets for others. Typical servicing rights 
include the right to receive a fee for collecting and forwarding 
payments on loans and related taxes and insurance premiums 
held in escrow.

Taxable-equivalent interest income – The interest income 
earned on certain assets that is completely or partially exempt 
from federal income tax. These tax-exempt instruments 
typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To 
provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and margins 
for all interest-earning assets, we use interest income on a 
taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net 
interest margins by increasing the interest income earned on 
tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest 
income earned on other taxable investments. This adjustment 
is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income 
Statement.

Transitional Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital – 
Common equity Tier 1 capital calculated under Basel III using 
phased-in definitions and deductions applicable to us during 
the related presentation period and standardized approach risk-
weighted assets.

Troubled debt restructuring (TDR) – A loan whose terms have 
been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a 
borrower experiencing financial difficulties.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  75

Value-at-risk (VaR) – A statistically-based measure of risk that 
describes the amount of potential loss which may be incurred 
due to adverse market movements. The measure is of the 
maximum loss which should not be exceeded on 95 out of 100 
days for a 95% VaR.

Yield curve – A graph showing the relationship between the 
yields on financial instruments or market indices of the same 
credit quality with different maturities. For example, a 
“normal” or “positive” yield curve exists when long-term 
bonds have higher yields than short-term bonds. A “flat” yield 
curve exists when yields are the same for short-term and long-
term bonds. A “steep” yield curve exists when yields on long-
term bonds are significantly higher than on short-term bonds. 
An “inverted” or “negative” yield curve exists when short-
term bonds have higher yields than long-term bonds.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-
LOOKING INFORMATION
We make statements in this Report, and we may from time to 
time make other statements, regarding our outlook for 
earnings, revenues, expenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity 
levels and ratios, asset levels, asset quality, financial position, 
and other matters regarding or affecting us and our future 
business and operations that are forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform 
Act. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by 
words such as “believe,” “plan,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “see,” 
“look,” “intend,” “outlook,” “project,” “forecast,” “estimate,” 
“goal,” “will,” “should” and other similar words and 
expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to 
numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change 
over time.

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. 
We do not assume any duty to update forward-looking 
statements. Actual results or future events could differ, 
possibly materially, from those anticipated in forward-looking 
statements, as well as from historical performance.

Our forward-looking statements are subject to the following 
principal risks and uncertainties.

•  Our businesses, financial results and balance sheet 

values are affected by business and economic 
conditions, including the following:
–  Changes in interest rates and valuations in debt, 

equity and other financial markets.

–  Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial 

markets.

–  Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. 

Treasury and other government agencies, 
including those that impact money supply and 
market interest rates.

–  Changes in customer behavior due to newly 

enacted tax legislation, changing business and 
economic conditions or legislative or regulatory 
initiatives.

–  Changes in customers’, suppliers’ and other 

counterparties’ performance and creditworthiness.

76    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

–  Slowing or reversal of the current U.S. economic 

expansion.

–  Commodity price volatility.

•  Our forward-looking financial statements are subject 

to the risk that economic and financial market 
conditions will be substantially different than those we 
are currently expecting and do not take into account 
potential legal and regulatory contingencies. These 
statements are based on our current view that the U.S. 
economic growth will accelerate somewhat in 2018, in 
light of stimulus from recently passed corporate and 
personal income tax cuts that are expected to support 
business investment and consumer spending, 
respectively. Further gradual improvement in the labor 
market this year, including job gains and rising wages, 
is another positive for consumer spending. Other 
sources of growth for the U.S. economy in 2018 will 
be the global economic expansion and the housing 
market. Although inflation slowed in 2017, it should 
pick up as the labor market continues to tighten. 
Short-term interest rates and bond yields are expected 
to rise throughout 2018; our baseline forecast is for 
three increases in the federal funds rate in 2018, 
pushing the rate to a range of 2.00 to 2.25 percent by 
the end of the year. Longer-term rates are also 
expected to increase as the Federal Reserve slowly 
reduces the size of its balance sheet and the federal 
government borrows more, but at a slower pace than 
the short-term rates, so we anticipate the yield curve 
will flatten but not invert.

•  Our ability to take certain capital actions, including 
returning capital to shareholders, is subject to review 
by the Federal Reserve Board as part of our 
comprehensive capital plan for the applicable period 
in connection with the Federal Reserve Board’s 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) 
process and to the acceptance of such capital plan and 
non-objection to such capital actions by the Federal 
Reserve Board.

•  Our regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend 

on, among other things, the company’s financial 
performance, the scope and terms of final capital 
regulations then in effect (particularly those 
implementing the international regulatory capital 
framework developed by the Basel Committee on 
Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and 
management actions affecting the composition of our 
balance sheet. In addition, our ability to determine, 
evaluate and forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to 
take actions (such as capital distributions) based on 
actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent at 
least in part on the development, validation and 
regulatory approval of related models.

•  Legal and regulatory developments could have an 

impact on our ability to operate our businesses, 
financial condition, results of operations, competitive 
position, reputation, or pursuit of attractive acquisition 
opportunities. Reputational impacts could affect 
matters such as business generation and retention, 

liquidity, funding, and ability to attract and retain 
management. These developments could include:
–  Changes resulting from legislative and regulatory 
reforms, including changes affecting oversight of 
the financial services industry, consumer 
protection, pension, bankruptcy and other industry 
aspects, and changes in accounting policies and 
principles.

–  Changes to regulations governing bank capital 

and liquidity standards, including due to the 
Dodd-Frank Act and initiatives of the Basel 
Committee.

–  Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or 

other claims and regulatory and other 
governmental investigations or other inquiries. 
These matters may result in monetary judgments 
or settlements or other remedies, including fines, 
penalties, restitution or alterations in our business 
practices, and in additional expenses and 
collateral costs, and may cause reputational harm 
to us.

–  Results of the regulatory examination and 

supervision process, including our failure to 
satisfy requirements of agreements with 
governmental agencies.

–  Impact on business and operating results of any 

costs associated with obtaining rights in 
intellectual property claimed by others and of 
adequacy of our intellectual property protection in 
general.

•  Business and operating results are affected by our 

ability to identify and effectively manage risks 
inherent in our businesses, including, where 
appropriate, through effective use of systems and 
controls, third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital 
management techniques, and to meet evolving 
regulatory capital and liquidity standards.

•  Business and operating results also include impacts 
relating to our equity interest in BlackRock, Inc. and 
rely to a significant extent on information provided to 
us by BlackRock. Risks and uncertainties that could 
affect BlackRock are discussed in more detail by 
BlackRock in its SEC filings.

•  We grow our business in part through acquisitions. 

Acquisition risks and uncertainties include those 
presented by the nature of the business acquired, 
including in some cases those associated with our 
entry into new businesses or new geographic or other 
markets and risks resulting from our inexperience in 
those new areas, as well as risks and uncertainties 
related to the acquisition transactions themselves, 
regulatory issues, and the integration of the acquired 
businesses into PNC after closing.

•  Competition can have an impact on customer 
acquisition, growth and retention and on credit 
spreads and product pricing, which can affect market 
share, deposits and revenues. Our ability to anticipate 
and respond to technological changes can also impact 
our ability to respond to customer needs and meet 
competitive demands.

•  Business and operating results can also be affected by 

widespread natural and other disasters, pandemics, 
dislocations, terrorist activities, system failures, 
security breaches, cyberattacks or international 
hostilities through impacts on the economy and 
financial markets generally or on us or our 
counterparties specifically.

We provide greater detail regarding these as well as other 
factors in this Report, and elsewhere in this Report, including 
in the Risk Factors and Risk Management sections and the 
Legal Proceedings and Commitments Notes of the Notes To 
Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report. Our 
forward-looking statements may also be subject to other risks 
and uncertainties, including those discussed elsewhere in this 
Report or in our other filings with the SEC.

SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC 
ACCOUNTING FIRM

Financial Services Group, Inc.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control 
over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance 
sheets of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and its 
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, 
and the related consolidated statements of income, 
comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for 
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 
2017, including the related notes (collectively referred to as 
the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited 
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal 
Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred 
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of the Company as of  December 31, 2017 and 
December 31, 2016, and the results of their operations and 
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 
December 31, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in 
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, 
effective internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal 
Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these 
consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective 
internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment 
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, 
included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over 
Financial Reporting under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to 
express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial 
statements and on the Company’s internal control over 
financial reporting based on our audits.  We are a public 
accounting firm registered with the Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and 
are required to be independent with respect to the Company in 
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the 
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of 
the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform 
the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 

78    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

consolidated financial statements are free of material 
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether 
effective internal control over financial reporting was 
maintained in all material respects. 

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included 
performing procedures to assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether 
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond 
to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test 
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the 
consolidated financial statements.   Our audits also included 
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the 
overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. 
Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included 
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial 
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, 
and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. 
Our audits also included performing such other procedures as 
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that 
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over 
Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a 
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding 
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of 
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s 
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies 
and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records 
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded 
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made 
only in accordance with authorizations of management and 
directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s 
assets that could have a material effect on the financial 
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over 
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future 
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the 
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may 
deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
 
BUSINESS
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) is one of the 
largest diversified financial services companies in the United 
States and is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

We have businesses engaged in retail banking, including 
residential mortgage, corporate and institutional banking and 
asset management, providing many of our products and 
services nationally. Our primary geographic markets are 
located in 19 states in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and 
Southeast. We also provide certain products and services 
internationally.
NOTE 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Financial Statement Presentation
Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of 
the parent company and its subsidiaries, most of which are 
wholly-owned, certain partnership interests, and variable 
interest entities.

We prepared these consolidated financial statements in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in 
the United States of America (GAAP). We have eliminated 
intercompany accounts and transactions. We have also 
reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the 2017 
presentation, which did not have a material impact on our 
consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

We have also considered the impact of subsequent events on 
these consolidated financial statements.

Use of Estimates
We prepared these consolidated financial statements using 
financial information available at the time of preparation, 
which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that 
affect the amounts reported. Our most significant estimates 
pertain to our fair value measurements and allowances for loan 
and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of 
credit. Actual results may differ from the estimates and the 
differences may be material to the consolidated financial 
statements.

Investment in BlackRock, Inc.
We account for our investment in the common stock and 
Series B Preferred Stock of BlackRock (deemed to be in-
substance common stock) under the equity method of 
accounting. The investment in BlackRock is reflected on our 
Consolidated Balance Sheet in Equity investments, while our 
equity in earnings of BlackRock is reported on our 
Consolidated Income Statement in Asset management 
noninterest income.

We also hold shares of Series C Preferred Stock of BlackRock 
pursuant to our obligation to partially fund a portion of certain 
BlackRock long-term incentive plan (LTIP) programs. Since 
these preferred shares are not deemed to be in-substance 
common stock, we have elected to account for these preferred 
shares at fair value and the changes in fair value will offset the 
impact of marking-to-market the obligation to deliver these 
shares to BlackRock. Our investment in the BlackRock Series 
C Preferred Stock is included on our Consolidated Balance 
Sheet in Other assets. Our obligation to transfer these shares to 
BlackRock is classified as a derivative not designated as a 
hedging instrument under GAAP as disclosed in Note 13 
Financial Derivatives.

Variable Interest Entities

A variable interest entity (VIE) is a corporation, partnership, 
limited liability company, or any other legal structure used to 
conduct activities or hold assets generally that either:

•  Does not have equity investors with voting rights that 

can directly or indirectly make decisions about the 
entity’s activities through those voting rights or 
similar rights, or

•  Has equity investors that do not provide sufficient 
equity for the entity to finance its activities without 
additional subordinated financial support.

A VIE often holds financial assets, including loans or 
receivables, real estate or other property.

VIEs are assessed for consolidation under ASC 810 –
Consolidation when we hold a variable interest in these 
entities. We consolidate a VIE if we are its primary 
beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is determined to 
be the party that meets both of the following criteria: (i) has 
the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the 
economic performance of the VIE; and (ii) has the obligation 
to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either 
case could potentially be significant to the VIE. Upon 
consolidation of a VIE, we recognize all of the VIE’s assets, 
liabilities and noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated 
Balance Sheet. On a quarterly basis, we determine whether 
any changes occurred requiring a reassessment of whether we 
are the primary beneficiary of an entity.

See Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable 
Interest Entities for information about VIEs that we 
consolidate as well as those that we do not consolidate but in 
which we hold a significant variable interest.

Revenue Recognition
We earn interest and noninterest income from various sources, 
including:

•  Lending,
• 
Securities portfolio,
•  Asset management,
•  Customer deposits,
•  Loan sales, loan securitizations, and servicing,
•  Brokerage services,
• 
•  Certain private equity activities, and
• 

Sale of loans and securities,

Securities, derivatives and foreign exchange activities.

We earn fees and commissions from:

• 

• 
• 
• 

Issuing loan commitments, standby letters of credit 
and financial guarantees,
Selling various insurance products,
Providing treasury management services,
Providing merger and acquisition advisory and related 
services

•  Debit and credit card transactions, and
• 

Participating in certain capital markets transactions.

Our Asset management noninterest income includes asset 
management fees, which are generally based on a percentage 
of the fair value of the assets under management. Additionally, 
it includes our share of the earnings of BlackRock recognized 
under the equity method of accounting.

Service charges on deposit accounts are recognized when 
earned. Brokerage fees and gains and losses on the sale of 
securities and certain derivatives are recognized on a trade-
date basis.

We record private equity income or loss based on changes in 
the valuation of the underlying investments or when we 
dispose of our interest.

We recognize gain/(loss) on changes in the fair value of 
certain financial instruments where we have elected the fair 
value option. These financial instruments include certain 
commercial and residential mortgage loans originated for sale, 
certain residential mortgage portfolio loans, resale agreements 
and our investment in BlackRock Series C preferred stock. We 
also recognize gain/(loss) on changes in the fair value of 
residential and commercial mortgage servicing rights (MSRs).

We recognize revenue from servicing residential mortgages, 
commercial mortgages and other consumer loans as earned 
based on the specific contractual terms. These revenues are 
reported on the Consolidated Income Statement in the line 
items Residential mortgage, Corporate services and Consumer 
services. We recognize revenue from securities, derivatives 
and foreign exchange customer-related trading, as well as 
securities underwriting activities, as these transactions occur 
or as services are provided. We generally recognize gains from 
the sale of loans upon receipt of cash. Mortgage revenue 
recognized is reported net of mortgage repurchase reserves.

86    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and due from banks are considered “cash and cash 
equivalents” for financial reporting purposes.

Investments
We hold interests in various types of investments. The 
accounting for these investments is dependent on a number of 
factors including, but not limited to, items such as:

•  Ownership interest,
•  Our plans for the investment, and
•  The nature of the investment.

Debt Securities
Debt securities are recorded on a trade-date basis. We classify 
debt securities as held to maturity and carry them at amortized 
cost if we have the positive intent and ability to hold the 
securities to maturity. Debt securities that we purchase for 
certain risk management activities or customer-related trading 
activities are carried at fair value and classified as trading 
securities and are reported in the Other assets line item on our 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Realized and unrealized gains 
and losses on trading securities are included in Other 
noninterest income.

Debt securities not classified as held to maturity or trading are 
designated as securities available for sale and carried at fair 
value with unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes, 
reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
 
On at least a quarterly basis, we review all debt securities that 
are in an unrealized loss position for other than temporary 
impairment (OTTI). An investment security is deemed 
impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its 
amortized cost. Amortized cost includes adjustments (if any) 
made to the cost basis of an investment for accretion, 
amortization, previous other-than-temporary impairments and 
hedging gains and losses. After an investment security is 
determined to be impaired, we evaluate whether the decline in 
value is other-than-temporary. Declines in the fair value of 
available for sale and held to maturity debt securities that are 
deemed other-than-temporary and are attributable to credit 
deterioration are recognized in Other noninterest income on 
our Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which the 
determination is made. Declines in fair value which are 
deemed other-than-temporary and attributable to factors other 
than credit deterioration are recognized in Accumulated other 
comprehensive income (loss) on our Consolidated Balance 
Sheet.

We include all interest on debt securities, including 
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on 
investment securities, in net interest income using the constant 
effective yield method generally calculated over the 
contractual lives of the securities. Effective yields reflect 
either the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the 
date of acquisition or the effective interest rate determined 
based on improved cash flows subsequent to impairment. We 
compute gains and losses realized on the sale of available for 
sale debt securities on a specific security basis. These 

securities gains/(losses) are included in Other noninterest 
income on the Consolidated Income Statement.

Equity Securities and Partnership Interests
We account for equity securities and equity investments other 
than BlackRock and private equity investments under one of 
the following methods:

•  Marketable equity securities are recorded on a trade-

• 

date basis and are accounted for based on the 
securities’ quoted market prices from a national 
securities exchange. Those purchased with the 
intention of selling in the near term are classified as 
trading and included in Other assets on our 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Both realized and 
unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are 
included in Noninterest income. Marketable equity 
securities not classified as trading are designated as 
securities available for sale with unrealized gains and 
losses, net of income taxes, reflected in Accumulated 
other comprehensive income (loss). Any unrealized 
losses that we have determined to be other-than-
temporary on securities classified as available for sale 
are recognized in current period earnings.
For investments in limited partnerships, limited 
liability companies and other investments that are not 
required to be consolidated, we use either the equity 
method or the cost method of accounting. We use the 
equity method for general and limited partner 
ownership interests and limited liability companies in 
which we are considered to have significant influence 
over the operations of the investee. Under the equity 
method, we record our equity ownership share of net 
income or loss of the investee in Noninterest income 
and any dividends received on equity method 
investments are recorded as a reduction to the 
investment balance. When an equity investment 
experiences an other-than-temporary decline in value, 
we may be required to record a loss on the 
investment. We use the cost method for all other 
investments. Under the cost method, there is no 
change to the cost basis unless there is an other-than-
temporary decline in value or dividends received are 
considered a return on investment. If the decline is 
determined to be other-than-temporary, we write 
down the cost basis of the investment to a new cost 
basis that represents realizable value. The amount of 
the write-down is accounted for as a loss included in 
Noninterest income. Distributions received from the 
income of an investee on cost method investments are 
included in Noninterest income. Investments 
described above are included in Equity investments 
on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Private Equity Investments
We report private equity investments, which include direct 
investments in companies, affiliated partnership interests and 
indirect investments in private equity funds, at estimated fair 
value. These estimates are based on available information and 
may not necessarily represent amounts that we will ultimately 
realize through distribution, sale or liquidation of the 
investments. Fair values of publicly-traded direct investments 
are determined using quoted market prices and are subject to 
various discount factors arising from security level 
restrictions, when appropriate. The valuation procedures 
applied to direct investments and indirect investments are 
detailed in Note 6 Fair Value. We include all private equity 
investments within Equity investments on our Consolidated 
Balance Sheet. Changes in fair value of private equity 
investments are recognized in Noninterest income.

We consolidate affiliated partnerships when we have 
determined that we have control of the partnership or are the 
primary beneficiary if the entity is a VIE. The portion we do 
not own is reflected in Noncontrolling interests on our 
Consolidated Balance Sheet.
 
Loans
Loans are classified as held for investment when management 
has both the intent and ability to hold the loan for the 
foreseeable future, or until maturity or payoff. Management’s 
intent and view of the foreseeable future may change based on 
changes in business strategies, the economic environment, 
market conditions and the availability of government 
programs.

Measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual 
terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in 
terms of payment are considered delinquent.

Except as described below, loans held for investment are 
stated at the principal amounts outstanding, net of unearned 
income, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated 
loans, and premiums or discounts on purchased loans. Interest 
on performing loans (excluding interest on purchased impaired 
loans, which is further discussed below) is accrued based on 
the principal amount outstanding and recorded in Interest 
income as earned using the constant effective yield method. 
Loan origination fees, direct loan origination costs, and loan 
premiums and discounts are deferred and accreted or 
amortized into Net interest income using the constant effective 
yield method, over the contractual life of the loan.

In addition to originating loans, we also acquire loans through 
portfolio purchases or acquisitions of other financial services 
companies. For certain acquired loans that have experienced a 
deterioration of credit quality, we follow the guidance 
contained in ASC 310-30 – Loans and Debt Securities 
Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality. Under this 
guidance, acquired purchased impaired loans are to be 
recorded at fair value without the carryover of any existing 
valuation allowances. When evidence of credit quality 
deterioration and evidence that it is probable that we will be 
unable to collect all contractual amounts due exist, we

noninterest expense.

Loan Sales, Loan Securitizations and Retained Interests
We recognize the sale of loans or other financial assets when 
the transferred assets are legally isolated from our creditors 
and the appropriate accounting criteria are met. We have sold 
mortgage and other loans through securitization transactions. 
In a securitization, financial assets are transferred into trusts or 
to special purpose entities (SPEs) in transactions to effectively 
legally isolate the assets from us.

In a securitization, the trust or SPE issues beneficial interests 
in the form of senior and subordinated securities backed or 
collateralized by the assets sold to the trust. The senior classes 
of the asset-backed securities typically receive investment 
grade credit ratings at the time of issuance. These ratings are 
generally achieved through the creation of lower-rated 
subordinated classes of asset-backed securities, as well as 
subordinated or residual interests. In certain cases, we may 
retain a portion or all of the securities issued, interest-only 
strips, one or more subordinated tranches, servicing rights and, 
in some cases, cash reserve accounts. Securitized loans are 
removed from the balance sheet and a net gain or loss is 
recognized in Noninterest income at the time of initial sale. 
Gains or losses recognized on the sale of the loans depend on
the fair value of the loans sold and the retained interests at the 
date of sale. We generally estimate the fair value of the 
retained interests based on the present value of future expected 
cash flows using assumptions as to discount rates, interest 
rates, prepayment speeds, credit losses and servicing costs, if 
applicable.

With the exception of loan sales to certain U.S. government-
chartered entities, our loan sales and securitizations are 
generally structured without recourse to us except for 
representations and warranties and with no restrictions on the 
retained interests. We originate, sell and service commercial 
mortgage loans under the Federal National Mortgage 
Association (FNMA) Delegated Underwriting and Servicing 
(DUS) program. Under the provisions of the DUS program, 
we participate in a loss-sharing arrangement with FNMA. 
When we are obligated for loss-sharing or recourse, our policy 
is to record such liabilities initially at fair value and 
subsequently reserve for estimated losses in accordance with 
guidance contained in applicable GAAP.
 

consider the loans to be purchased credit impaired and we 
estimate the amount and timing of undiscounted expected cash 
flows at acquisition for each loan either individually or on a 
pool basis. The excess of undiscounted cash flows expected to 
be collected on a purchased impaired loan (or pool of loans) 
over its carrying value represents the accretable yield which is 
recognized into interest income over the remaining life of the 
loan (or pool of loans) using the constant effective yield 
method. Subsequent decreases in expected cash flows that are 
attributable, at least in part, to credit quality are recognized as 
impairments through a charge to the provision for credit losses 
resulting in an increase in the Allowance for Loan and Lease 
Losses (ALLL). Subsequent increases in expected cash flows 
are recognized as a provision recapture of previously recorded 
ALLL or prospectively through an adjustment of the loan’s or 
pool’s yield over its remaining life.

Loans Held for Sale
We designate loans as held for sale when we have the intent to 
sell them. We transfer loans to the Loans held for sale
category at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less cost 
to sell. At the time of transfer, write-downs on the loans are 
recorded as charge-offs. We establish a new cost basis upon 
transfer. Any subsequent lower-of-cost-or-market adjustment 
is determined on an individual loan basis and is recognized as 
a valuation allowance with any charges included in Other 
noninterest income.

We have elected to account for certain commercial and 
residential mortgage loans held for sale at fair value. The 
changes in the fair value of the commercial mortgage loans are 
measured and recorded in Other noninterest income while the 
residential mortgage loans are measured and recorded in 
Residential mortgage noninterest income each period. See 
Note 6 Fair Value for additional information.

Interest income with respect to loans held for sale is accrued 
based on the principal amount outstanding and the loan’s 
contractual interest rate.

In certain circumstances, loans designated as held for sale may 
be transferred to held for investment based on a change in 
strategy. We transfer these loans at the lower of cost or 
estimated fair value; however, any loans originated or 
purchased for held for sale and designated at fair value remain 
at fair value for the life of the loan.

Leases
We provide financing for various types of equipment, 
including aircraft, energy and power systems, and vehicles 
through a variety of lease arrangements. Direct financing 
leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments plus 
estimated residual value of the leased equipment, less 
unearned income. Leveraged leases, a form of financing lease, 
are carried net of nonrecourse debt. We recognize income over 
the term of the lease using the constant effective yield method. 
Lease residual values are reviewed for impairment at least 
annually. Gains or losses on the sale of leased assets are 
included in Other noninterest income while valuation

See Note 3 Asset Quality in this Report for additional detail on 
nonperforming assets and asset quality indicators for 
commercial and consumer loans.

Commercial Loans
We generally charge off Commercial Lending (Commercial, 
Commercial Real Estate, and Equipment Lease Financing) 
nonperforming loans when we determine that a specific loan, 
or portion thereof, is uncollectible. This determination is based 
on the specific facts and circumstances of the individual loans. 
In making this determination, we consider the viability of the 
business or project as a going concern, the past due status 
when the asset is not well-secured, the expected cash flows to 
repay the loan, the value of the collateral, and the ability and 
willingness of any guarantors to perform.

Additionally, in general, for smaller commercial loans of $1 
million or less, a partial or full charge-off occurs at 120 days 
past due for term loans and 180 days past due for revolvers. 
Certain small business credit card balances that are placed on 
nonaccrual status when they become 90 days or more past due 
are charged-off at 180 days past due.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  89

Consumer Loans
Home equity installment loans, home equity lines of credit, 
and residential real estate loans that are not well-secured and 
in the process of collection are charged-off at no later than 180 
days past due. At that time, the basis in the loan is reduced to 
the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. In addition to 
this policy, the bank recognizes a charge-off on a secured 
consumer loan when:

•  The bank holds a subordinate lien position in the loan 
and a foreclosure notice has been received on the first 
lien loan;

•  The bank holds a subordinate lien position in the loan 

which is 30 days or more past due with a combined 
loan to value ratio of greater than or equal to 110% 
and the first lien loan is seriously stressed (i.e., 90 
days or more past due);

•  The loan is modified or otherwise restructured in a 
manner that results in the loan becoming collateral 
dependent;

•  Notification of bankruptcy has been received within 

the last 60 days;

•  The borrower has been discharged from personal 
liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and has not 
formally reaffirmed his or her loan obligation to us; or
•  The collateral securing the loan has been repossessed 
and the value of the collateral is less than the recorded 
investment of the loan outstanding.

For loans that continue to meet any of the above policies, 
collateral values are updated annually and subsequent declines 
in collateral values are charged-off resulting in incremental 
provision for credit loss.

Most consumer loans and lines of credit, not secured by 
residential real estate, are charged off after 120-180 days past 
due.

Accounting for Nonperforming Assets and Leases and 
Other Nonaccrual Loans
For accrual loans, interest income is accrued on a monthly 
basis and certain fees and costs are deferred upon origination 
and recognized in income over the term of the loan utilizing an 
effective yield method. For nonaccrual loans, interest income 
accrual and deferred fee/cost recognition is discontinued. 
Additionally, the current year accrued and uncollected interest 
is reversed through Net interest income and prior year accrued 
and uncollected interest is charged-off. Nonaccrual loans may 
also be charged-off to reduce the basis to the fair value of 
collateral less costs to sell.

If payment is received on a nonaccrual loan, generally the 
payment is first applied to the recorded investment; payments 
are then applied to recover any charged-off amounts related to 
the loan. Finally, if both recorded investment and any charge-
offs have been recovered, then the payment will be recorded 
as fee and interest income. For certain consumer loans, the 
receipt of interest payments is recognized as interest income 
on a cash basis. Cash basis income recognition is applied if a 
loan’s recorded investment is deemed fully collectible and the 
loan has performed for at least six months.

90    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

For TDRs, payments are applied based upon their contractual 
terms unless the related loan is deemed non-performing. TDRs 
are generally included in nonperforming and nonaccrual loans. 
However, after a reasonable period of time in which the loan 
performs under restructured terms and meets other 
performance indicators, it is returned to performing/accruing 
status. This return to performing/accruing status demonstrates 
that the bank expects to collect all of the loan’s remaining 
contractual principal and interest. TDRs resulting from 1) 
borrowers that have been discharged from personal liability 
through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally 
reaffirmed their loan obligations to us and 2) borrowers that 
are not currently obligated to make both principal and interest 
payments under the restructured terms are not returned to 
accrual status.

Other nonaccrual loans are generally not returned to accrual 
status until the borrower has performed in accordance with the 
contractual terms and other performance indicators for at least 
six months, the period of time which was determined to 
demonstrate the expected collection of the loan’s remaining 
contractual principal and interest. When a nonperforming loan 
is returned to accrual status, it is then considered a performing 
loan.

See Note 3 Asset Quality and Note 4 Allowance for Loan and 
Lease Losses in this Report for additional TDR information.

Foreclosed assets consist of any asset seized or property 
acquired through a foreclosure proceeding or acceptance of a 
deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. Other real estate owned comprises 
principally commercial and residential real estate properties 
obtained in partial or total satisfaction of loan obligations. 
After obtaining a foreclosure judgment, or in some 
jurisdictions the initiation of proceedings under a power of 
sale in the loan instruments, the property will be sold. When 
we are awarded title or completion of deed-in-lieu of 
foreclosure, we transfer the loan to foreclosed assets included 
in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Property 
obtained in satisfaction of a loan is initially recorded at 
estimated fair value less cost to sell. Based upon the estimated 
fair value less cost to sell, the recorded investment of the loan 
is adjusted and, typically, a charge-off/recovery is recognized 
to the ALLL. We estimate fair values primarily based on 
appraisals, or sales agreements with third parties. 
Subsequently, foreclosed assets are valued at the lower of the 
amount recorded at acquisition date or estimated fair value 
less cost to sell. Valuation adjustments on these assets and 
gains or losses realized from disposition of such property are 
reflected in Other noninterest expense.

For certain mortgage loans that have a government guarantee, 
we establish a separate other receivable upon foreclosure. The 
receivable is measured based on the loan balance (inclusive of 
principal and interest) that is expected to be recovered from 
the guarantor.

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses
We maintain the ALLL at a level that we believe to be 
appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred 
in the loan and lease portfolios as of the balance sheet date. 
Our determination of the allowance is based on periodic 
evaluations of these loan and lease portfolios and other 
relevant factors. This critical estimate includes significant use 
of our own historical data and complex methods to interpret 
this data. These evaluations are inherently subjective, as they 
require material estimates and may be susceptible to 
significant change, and include, among others:

• 
Probability of default (PD),
•  Loss given default (LGD),
•  Outstanding balance of the loan,
•  Movement through delinquency stages,
•  Amounts and timing of expected future cash flows,
•  Value of collateral, which may be obtained from third 

parties, and

•  Qualitative factors, such as changes in current 

economic conditions, that may not be reflected in 
modeled results.

For all loans, except purchased impaired loans, the ALLL is 
the sum of three components: (i) asset specific/individual 
impaired reserves, (ii) quantitative (formulaic or pooled) 
reserves and (iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves.

The reserve calculation and determination process is 
dependent on the use of key assumptions. Key reserve 
assumptions and estimation processes react to and are 
influenced by observed changes in loan portfolio performance 
experience, the financial strength of the borrower, and 
economic conditions. Key reserve assumptions are 
periodically updated.

See Note 4 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses for 
additional detail on our ALLL.

Asset Specific/Individual Component
Nonperforming loans that are considered impaired under ASC 
310 – Receivables, which include all commercial and 
consumer TDRs, are evaluated for a specific reserve. Specific 
reserve allocations are determined as follows:

• 

• 

For commercial nonperforming loans and commercial 
TDRs greater than or equal to a defined dollar 
threshold, specific reserves are based on an analysis 
of the present value of the loan’s expected future cash 
flows, the loan’s observable market price or the fair 
value of the collateral.
For commercial nonperforming loans and commercial 
TDRs below the defined dollar threshold, the 
individual loan’s loss given default (LGD) percentage 
is multiplied by the loan balance and the results are 
aggregated for purposes of measuring specific reserve 
impairment.

•  Consumer nonperforming loans are collectively 

reserved for unless classified as consumer TDRs. For 
consumer TDRs, specific reserves are determined 
through an analysis of the present value of the loan’s 
expected future cash flows, except for those instances 

where loans have been deemed collateral dependent, 
including loans where borrowers have been 
discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 
bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their 
loan obligations to us. Once that determination has 
been made, those TDRs are charged down to the fair 
value of the collateral less costs to sell at each period 
end.

Commercial Lending Quantitative Component
The estimates of the quantitative component of ALLL for 
incurred losses within the commercial lending portfolio 
segment are determined through statistical loss modeling 
utilizing PD, LGD and outstanding balance of the loan. Based 
upon loan risk ratings, we assign PDs and LGDs. Each of 
these statistical parameters is determined based on internal 
historical data and market data. PD is influenced by such 
factors as liquidity, industry, obligor financial structure, access 
to capital and cash flow. LGD is influenced by
collateral type, original and/or updated loan-to-value ratio 
(LTV), facility structure and other factors.

Consumer Lending Quantitative Component
Quantitative estimates within the consumer lending portfolio 
segment are calculated primarily using transition matrices, 
including using a roll-rate model. The roll-rate model uses 
statistical relationships, calculated from historical data that 
estimate the movement of loan outstandings through the 
various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge-off over 
our loss emergence period.

Qualitative Component
While our reserve methodologies strive to reflect all relevant 
risk factors, there continues to be uncertainty associated with, 
but not limited to, potential imprecision in the estimation 
process due to the inherent time lag of obtaining information 
and normal variations between estimates and actual outcomes. 
We provide additional reserves that are designed to provide 
coverage for losses attributable to such risks. The ALLL also 
includes factors that may not be directly measured in the 
determination of specific or pooled reserves. Such qualitative 
factors may include:

Industry concentrations and conditions,

• 
•  Recent credit quality trends,
•  Recent loss experience in particular portfolios,
•  Recent macro-economic factors,
•  Model imprecision,
•  Changes in lending policies and procedures,
•  Timing of available information, including the 

performance of first lien positions, and
•  Limitations of available historical data.

Allowance for Purchased Non-Impaired Loans
ALLL for purchased non-impaired loans is determined based 
upon a comparison between the methodologies described 
above and the remaining acquisition date fair value discount 
that has yet to be accreted into interest income. After making 
the comparison, an ALLL is recorded for the amount greater 
than the discount, or no ALLL is recorded if the discount is 
greater.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  91

Allowance for Purchased Impaired Loans
ALLL for purchased impaired loans is determined in 
accordance with ASC 310-30 by comparing the net present 
value of management’s best estimate of cash flows expected to 
be collected over the life of the loan (or pool of loans) to the 
recorded investment for a given loan (or pool of loans). In 
cases where the net present value of expected cash flows is 
lower than the recorded investment, ALLL is established.

Allowance for Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters 
of Credit
We maintain the allowance for unfunded loan commitments 
and letters of credit at a level we believe is appropriate to 
absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred on these 
unfunded credit facilities as of the balance sheet date. We 
determine the allowance based on periodic evaluations of the 
unfunded credit facilities, including an assessment of the 
probability of commitment usage, credit risk factors, and, 
solely for commercial lending, the terms and expiration dates 
of the unfunded credit facilities. Other than the estimation of 
the probability of funding, the reserve for unfunded loan 
commitments is estimated in a manner similar to the 
methodology used for determining reserves for funded 
exposures. The allowance for unfunded loan commitments and 
letters of credit is recorded as a liability on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet. Net adjustments to the allowance for unfunded 
loan commitments and letters of credit are included in the 
provision for credit losses.

Mortgage Servicing Rights
We provide servicing under various loan servicing contracts 
for commercial and residential loans. These contracts are 
either purchased in the open market or retained as part of a 
loan securitization or loan sale. All acquired or originated 
servicing rights are measured at fair value. Fair value is based 
on the present value of the expected future net cash flows, 
including assumptions as to:

•  Deposit balances and interest rates for escrow and 

commercial reserve earnings,

•  Discount rates,
•  Estimated prepayment speeds, and
•  Estimated servicing costs.

We measure commercial and residential MSRs at fair value in 
order to reduce any potential measurement mismatch between 
our economic hedges and the MSRs. We manage the risk by 
hedging the fair value of the MSR with derivatives and 
securities which are expected to increase in value when the 
value of the servicing right declines. Changes in the fair value 
of MSRs are recognized as gains/(losses). The fair value of 
these servicing rights is estimated by using a discounted cash 
flow valuation model which calculates the present value of 
estimated future net servicing cash flows, taking into 
consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment 
rates, discount rates, servicing costs, and other factors which 
are determined based on current market conditions.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of financial instruments and the methods and 
assumptions used in estimating fair value amounts and 
financial assets and liabilities for which fair value was elected 
are detailed in Note 6 Fair Value.

Goodwill
We assess goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the 
fourth quarter, or when events or changes in circumstances 
indicate the assets might be impaired.

Depreciation and Amortization
For financial reporting purposes, we depreciate premises and 
equipment, net of salvage value, principally using the straight-
line method over their estimated useful lives.

We use estimated useful lives for furniture and equipment 
ranging from one to 10 years, and depreciate buildings over an 
estimated useful life of up to 40 years. We amortize leasehold 
improvements over their estimated useful lives of up to 15 
years or the respective lease terms, whichever is shorter.

We purchase, as well as internally develop and customize, 
certain software to enhance or perform internal business 
functions. Software development costs incurred in the 
planning and post-development project stages are charged to 
Noninterest expense. Costs associated with designing software 
configuration and interfaces, installation, coding programs and 
testing systems are capitalized and amortized using the 
straight-line method over periods ranging from one to 10 
years.

Other Comprehensive Income
Other comprehensive income, on an after-tax basis, primarily 
consists of unrealized gains or losses, excluding OTTI 
attributable to credit deterioration, on investment securities 
classified as available for sale, unrealized gains or losses on 
derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, and changes in 
pension and other postretirement benefit plan liability 
adjustments. Details of each component are included in Note 
16 Other Comprehensive Income.

Treasury Stock
We record common stock purchased for treasury at cost. At the 
date of subsequent reissue, the treasury stock account is 
reduced by the cost of such stock on the first-in, first-out basis.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
We use a variety of financial derivatives as part of our overall 
asset and liability risk management process to help manage 
exposure to interest rate, market and credit risk inherent in our 
business activities. Interest rate and total return swaps, 
swaptions, interest rate caps and floors, options, forwards, and 
futures contracts are the primary instruments we use for 
interest rate risk management.

Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, interest rate, 
market and credit risk. We manage these risks as part of our 
asset and liability management process and through credit 
policies and procedures.

We recognize all derivative instruments at fair value as either 
Other assets or Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet and the related cash flows in the Operating Activities 
section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 
Adjustments for counterparty credit risk are included in the 
determination of fair value. The accounting for changes in the 
fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has 
been designated and qualifies as part of a cash flow or net 
investment hedging relationship. For all other derivatives, 
changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.

We utilize a net presentation for derivative instruments on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet taking into consideration the 
effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements. Cash 
collateral exchanged with counterparties is also netted against 
the applicable derivative exposures by offsetting obligations to 
return, or general rights to reclaim, cash collateral against the 
fair values of the net derivatives being collateralized.

For those derivative instruments that are designated and 
qualify as accounting hedges, we designate the hedging 
instrument, based on the exposure being hedged, as a fair 
value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a hedge of the net 
investment in a foreign operation.

We formally document the relationship between the hedging 
instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management 
objective and strategy, before undertaking an accounting 
hedge. To qualify for hedge accounting, the derivatives and 
related hedged items must be designated as a hedge at 
inception of the hedge relationship. For accounting hedge 
relationships, we formally assess, both at the inception of the 
hedge and on an ongoing basis, if the derivatives are highly 
effective in offsetting designated changes in the fair value or 
cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that the 
derivative instrument is not highly effective, hedge accounting 
is discontinued.

For derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges (i.e., 
hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or 
a liability attributable to a particular risk, such as changes in 
LIBOR), changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument 
are recognized in earnings and offset by also recognizing in 
earnings the changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
attributable to the hedged risk. To the extent the change in fair 
value of the derivative does not offset the change in fair value 
of the hedged item, the difference or ineffectiveness is 
reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement in the same 
financial statement category as the hedged item.

For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging 
the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows), the 
effective portions of the gain or loss on derivatives are 
reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive 
income (loss) and subsequently reclassified to income in the 
same period or periods during which the hedged transaction 

affects earnings. The change in fair value attributable to the 
ineffective portion of the hedging instrument is recognized 
immediately in Interest income.

For derivatives designated as a hedge of net investment in a 
foreign operation, the effective portions of the gain or loss on 
the derivatives are reported as a component of Accumulated 
other comprehensive income (loss). The change in fair value 
attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedging 
instrument is recognized immediately in Noninterest income.

We discontinue hedge accounting when it is determined that 
the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective hedge; the 
derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised; or the 
derivative is de-designated as a fair value or cash flow hedge 
or, for a cash flow hedge, it is no longer probable that the 
forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally 
specified time period. We did not terminate any cash flow 
hedges in 2017, 2016 or 2015 due to a determination that a 
forecasted transaction was no longer probable of occurring.

We purchase or originate financial instruments that contain an 
embedded derivative. At the inception of the transaction, we 
assess if the economic characteristics of the embedded 
derivative are clearly and closely related to the economic 
characteristics of the host contract, whether the hybrid 
financial instrument is measured at fair value with changes in 
fair value reported in earnings, and whether a separate 
instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative 
would be a derivative. If the embedded derivative does not 
meet all of these conditions, the embedded derivative is 
recorded separately from the host contract with changes in fair 
value recorded in earnings, unless we elect to account for the 
hybrid instrument at fair value.

We have elected, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, fair 
value measurement for certain financial instruments with 
embedded derivatives.
 
We enter into commitments to originate residential and 
commercial mortgage loans for sale. We also enter into 
commitments to purchase or sell commercial and residential 
real estate loans. These commitments are accounted for as 
free-standing derivatives which are recorded at fair value in 
Other assets or Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet. Any gain or loss from the change in fair value after the 
inception of the commitment is recognized in Noninterest 
income.

Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under the asset and liability 
method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined 
based on differences between the financial reporting and tax 
bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the 
enacted tax rates and laws that we expect will apply at the 
time when we believe the differences will reverse. Changes in 
tax rates and tax law are accounted for in the period of 
enactment. Thus, at the enactment date, deferred taxes are 
remeasured and the change is recognized in Income Tax 
expense. The recognition of deferred tax assets requires an 
assessment to determine the realization of such assets. 

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  93

Realization refers to the incremental benefit achieved through 
the reduction in future taxes payable or refunds receivable 
from the deferred tax assets, assuming that the underlying 
deductible differences and carryforwards are the last items to 
enter into the determination of future taxable income. We 
establish a valuation allowance for tax assets when it is more 
likely than not that they will not be realized, based upon all 
available positive and negative evidence.

We use the deferral method of accounting on investments that 
generate investment tax credits. Under this method, the 
investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction to the 
related asset.

Earnings Per Common Share
Basic earnings per common share is calculated using the two-
class method to determine income attributable to common 
shareholders. Unvested share-based payment awards that 
contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend 
equivalents are considered participating securities under the 
two-class method. Distributed dividends and dividend 
equivalents related to participating securities and an allocation 
of undistributed net income to participating securities reduce 
the amount of income attributable to common shareholders. 
Income attributable to common shareholders is then divided 
by the weighted-average common shares outstanding for the 
period.

Diluted earnings per common share is calculated under the 
more dilutive of either the treasury method or the two-class 
method. For the diluted calculation, we increase the weighted-
average number of shares of common stock outstanding by the 
assumed conversion of outstanding convertible preferred stock 
from the beginning of the year or date of issuance, if later, and 
the number of shares of common stock that would be issued 
assuming the exercise of stock options and warrants and the 
issuance of incentive shares using the treasury stock method.
These adjustments to the weighted-average number of shares 
of common stock outstanding are made only when such 
adjustments will dilute earnings per common share. See Note 
14 Earnings Per Share for additional information.

PNC Foundation - Related Party Transactions
During 2017 and 2016, we contributed $200 million and $75 
million, respectively, of BlackRock common stock to the PNC 
Foundation.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

We did not adopt any new accounting standards that had a 
significant impact during 2017.
 

NOTE 2 LOAN SALE AND SERVICING ACTIVITIES AND 
VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES
Loan Sale and Servicing Activities
We have transferred residential and commercial mortgage 
loans in securitization or sales transactions in which we have 
continuing involvement. These transfers have occurred 
through Agency securitization, Non-agency securitization, and 
loan sale transactions. Agency securitizations consist of 
securitization transactions with FNMA, Federal Home Loan 
Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and Government National 
Mortgage Association (GNMA) (collectively the Agencies). 
FNMA and FHLMC generally securitize our transferred loans 
into mortgage-backed securities for sale into the secondary 
market through SPEs that they sponsor. We, as an authorized 
GNMA issuer/servicer, pool Federal Housing Administration 
(FHA) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) insured loans 
into mortgage-backed securities for sale into the secondary 
market. In Non-agency securitizations, we have transferred 
loans into securitization SPEs. In other instances, third-party 
investors have also purchased our loans in loan sale 
transactions and in certain instances have subsequently sold 
these loans into securitization SPEs. Securitization SPEs 
utilized in the Agency and Non-agency securitization 
transactions are variable interest entities (VIEs).

Our continuing involvement in the FNMA, FHLMC, and 
GNMA securitizations, Non-agency securitizations, and loan 
sale transactions generally consists of servicing, repurchasing 
previously transferred loans under certain conditions and loss 
share arrangements, and, in limited circumstances, holding of 
mortgage-backed securities issued by the securitization SPEs.

Depending on the transaction, we may act as the master, 
primary, and/or special servicer to the securitization SPEs or 
third-party investors. Servicing responsibilities typically 
consist of collecting and remitting monthly borrower principal 
and interest payments, maintaining escrow deposits, 
performing loss mitigation and foreclosure activities, and, in 
certain instances, funding of servicing advances. Servicing 
advances, which are generally reimbursable, are made for 
principal and interest and collateral protection and are carried 
in Other assets at cost.

We earn servicing and other ancillary fees for our role as 
servicer and, depending on the contractual terms of the 
servicing arrangement, we can be terminated as servicer with 
or without cause. At the consummation date of each type of 
loan transfer where we retain the servicing, we recognize a 
servicing right at fair value. See Note 6 Fair Value and Note 7 
Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights for further 
discussion of our servicing rights.

94    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

Certain loans transferred to the Agencies contain removal of 
account provisions (ROAPs). Under these ROAPs, we hold an 
option to repurchase at par individual delinquent loans that 
meet certain criteria. In other limited cases, GNMA has 
granted us the right to repurchase current loans when we 
intend to modify the borrower’s interest rate under established 
guidelines. When we have the unilateral ability to repurchase a 
loan, effective control over the loan has been regained and we 
recognize an asset (in either Loans or Loans held for sale) and 
a corresponding liability (in Other borrowed funds) on the 
balance sheet regardless of our intent to repurchase the loan.

The Agency and Non-agency mortgage-backed securities 
issued by the securitization SPEs that are purchased and held 
on our balance sheet are typically purchased in the secondary 
market. We do not retain any credit risk on our Agency 
mortgage-backed security positions as FNMA, FHLMC, and 
the U.S. Government (for GNMA) guarantee losses of 
principal and interest.

We also have involvement with certain Agency and Non-
agency commercial securitization SPEs where we have not 
transferred commercial mortgage loans. These SPEs were 
sponsored by independent third-parties and the loans held by 
these entities were purchased exclusively from other third-
parties. Generally, our involvement with these SPEs is as 
servicer with servicing activities consistent with those 
described above.

We recognize a liability for our loss exposure associated with 
contractual obligations to repurchase previously transferred 
loans due to possible breaches of representations and 
warranties and also for loss sharing arrangements (recourse 
obligations) with the Agencies. Other than providing 
temporary liquidity under servicing advances and our loss 
exposure associated with our repurchase and recourse 
obligations, we have not provided nor are we required to 
provide any type of credit support, guarantees, or 
commitments to the securitization SPEs or third-party 
investors in these transactions.

loan sale and servicing activities:

Table 37 presents information about the principal balances of 
transferred loans that we service and are not recorded on our 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. We would only experience a loss 
on these transferred loans if we were required to repurchase a 
loan due to a breach in representations and warranties or a loss 
sharing arrangement associated with our continuing 
involvement with these loans. The estimate of losses related to 
breaches in representations and warranties was insignificant at 
December 31, 2017.

losses for Agency securitizations are not reflected as we do not manage the 
underlying real estate upon foreclosure and, as such, do not have access to loss 
information.

Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)
We are involved with various entities in the normal course of 
business that are deemed to be VIEs. We assess VIEs for 
consolidation based upon the accounting policies described in 
Note 1 Accounting Policies. Our consolidated VIEs were 
insignificant at both December 31, 2017 and December 31, 
2016. We have not provided additional financial support to 
these entities which we are not contractually required to 
provide.

The following table provides a summary of non-consolidated 
VIEs with which we have significant continuing involvement 
but are not the primary beneficiary. We do not consider our 
continuing involvement to be significant when it relates to a 
VIE where we only invest in securities issued by the VIE and 
were not involved in the design of the VIE or where no 
transfers have occurred between us and the VIE. We have 
excluded certain transactions with non-consolidated VIEs 
from the balances presented in Table 38 where we have 
determined that our continuing involvement is not significant. 
In addition, where we only have lending arrangements in the 
normal course of business with entities that could be VIEs, we 
have excluded these transactions with non-consolidated 
entities from the balances presented in Table 38. These loans 
are included as part of the asset quality disclosures that we 
make in Note 3 Asset Quality.

Mortgage-Backed Securitizations
In connection with each Agency and Non-agency residential 
and commercial mortgage-backed securitization discussed 
above, we evaluate each SPE utilized in these transactions for 
consolidation. In performing these assessments, we evaluate 
our level of continuing involvement in these transactions as 
the nature of our involvement ultimately determines whether 
or not we hold a variable interest and/or are the primary 
beneficiary of the SPE. Factors we consider in our 
consolidation assessment include the significance of (i) our 
role as servicer, (ii) our holdings of mortgage-backed 
securities issued by the securitization SPE, and (iii) the rights 
of third-party variable interest holders.

96    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

The first step in our assessment is to determine whether we 
hold a variable interest in the securitization SPE. We hold 
variable interests in Agency and Non-agency securitization 
SPEs through our holding of residential and commercial 
mortgage-backed securities issued by the SPEs and/or our 
recourse obligations. Each SPE in which we hold a variable 
interest is evaluated to determine whether we are the primary 
beneficiary of the entity. For Agency securitization 
transactions, our contractual role as servicer does not give us 
the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect 
the economic performance of the SPEs. Thus, we are not the 
primary beneficiary of these entities. For Non-agency 
securitization transactions, we would be the primary 

NOTE 3 ASSET QUALITY
We closely monitor economic conditions and loan 
performance trends to manage and evaluate our exposure to 
credit risk. Trends in delinquency rates may be a key indicator, 
among other considerations, of credit risk within the loan 
portfolios. The measurement of delinquency status is based on 
the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or 
more past due in terms of payment are considered delinquent. 
Loan delinquencies exclude loans held for sale, purchased 
impaired loans, nonperforming loans and loans accounted for 
under the fair value option which are on nonaccrual status, but 
include government insured or guaranteed loans and accruing 
loans accounted for under the fair value option.

Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases, 
OREO, foreclosed and other assets. Nonperforming loans are 
those loans accounted for at amortized cost whose credit 
quality has deteriorated to the extent that full collection of 
contractual principal and interest is not probable. Interest 
income is not recognized on these loans. Loans accounted for 
under the fair value option are reported as performing loans as 
these loans are accounted for at fair value. However, when 
nonaccrual criteria is met, interest income is not recognized on 
these loans. Additionally, certain government insured or 
guaranteed loans for which we expect to collect substantially 
all principal and interest are not reported as nonperforming 
loans and continue to accrue interest. Purchased impaired 
loans are excluded from nonperforming loans as we are 
currently accreting interest income over the expected life of 
the loans.

See Note 1 Accounting Policies for additional information on 
our loan related policies.

beneficiary to the extent our servicing activities give us the 
power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the 
economic performance of the SPE and we hold a more than 
insignificant variable interest in the entity.

Details about the Agency and Non-agency securitization SPEs 
where we hold a variable interest and are not the primary 
beneficiary are included in Table 38. Our maximum exposure 
to loss as a result of our involvement with these SPEs is the 
carrying value of the mortgage-backed securities, servicing 
assets, servicing advances, and our liabilities associated with 
our recourse obligations. Creditors of the securitization SPEs 
have no recourse to our assets or general credit.

Tax Credit Investments and Other
For tax credit investments in which we do not have the right to 
make decisions that will most significantly impact the 
economic performance of the entity, we are not the primary 
beneficiary and thus do not consolidate the entity. These 
investments are disclosed in Table 38. The table also reflects 
our maximum exposure to loss exclusive of any potential tax 
credit recapture. Our maximum exposure to loss is equal to 
our legally binding equity commitments adjusted for recorded 
impairment, partnership results, or amortization for qualifying 
low income housing tax credit investments when applicable. 
For all legally binding unfunded equity commitments, we 
increase our recognized investment and recognize a liability. 
As of December 31, 2017, we had a liability for unfunded 
commitments of $.5 billion related to investments in qualified 
affordable housing projects which is reflected in Other 
liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Table 38 also includes our involvement in lease financing 
transactions with limited liability companies (LLCs) engaged 
in solar power generation that to a large extent provided 
returns in the form of tax credits. The outstanding financings 
and operating lease assets are reflected as Loans and Other 
assets, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, 
whereas related liabilities are reported in Deposits and Other 
liabilities.

We make certain equity investments in various tax credit 
limited partnerships or LLCs. The purpose of these 
investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital and to 
assist us in achieving goals associated with the Community 
Reinvestment Act. During 2017 and 2016, we recognized $.2 
billion of amortization, $.2 billion of tax credits, and $.1 
billion of other tax benefits associated with qualified 
investments in low income housing tax credits within Income 
taxes.

(a)  Amounts in table represent recorded investment and exclude loans held for sale. Recorded investment in a loan includes the unpaid principal balance plus net accounting 

adjustments, less any charge-offs. Recorded investment does not include any associated valuation allowance.

(b)  Past due loan amounts exclude purchased impaired loans, even if contractually past due (or if we do not expect to receive payment in full based on the original contractual 
terms), as we are currently accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans. Past due loan amounts include government insured or guaranteed Residential real 
estate mortgages totaling $.6 billion at both December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and Education and other consumer loans totaling $.3 billion and $.4 billion at

(c)  Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option for which we do not expect to collect substantially all principal and interest are subject to nonaccrual accounting 

and classification upon meeting any of our nonaccrual policies. Given that these loans are not accounted for at amortized cost, these loans have been excluded from the

In the normal course of business, we originate or purchase 
loan products with contractual characteristics that, when 
concentrated, may increase our exposure as a holder of those 
loan products. Possible product features that may create a 
concentration of credit risk would include a high original or 
updated LTV ratio, terms that may expose the borrower to 
future increases in repayments above increases in market 
interest rates, and interest-only loans, among others.

We originate interest-only loans to commercial borrowers. 
Such credit arrangements are usually designed to match 
borrower cash flow expectations (e.g., working capital lines, 
revolvers). These products are standard in the financial 
services industry and product features are considered during 
the underwriting process to mitigate the increased risk that the 
interest-only feature may result in borrowers not being able to 
make interest and principal payments when due. We do not 
believe that these product features create a concentration of 
credit risk.

At December 31, 2017, we pledged $18.7 billion of 
commercial loans to the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) and 
$62.8 billion of residential real estate and other loans to the 
Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) as collateral for the ability 
to borrow, if necessary. The comparable amounts at 
December 31, 2016 were $22.0 billion and $60.8 billion, 
respectively.

(a)  Excludes most consumer loans and lines of credit not secured by residential 
real estate, which are charged off after 120 to 180 days past due and are not 
placed on nonperforming status.
(b)  Amounts are for the year ended.

Nonperforming loans also include certain loans whose terms 
have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to 
a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. In accordance 
with applicable accounting guidance, these loans are 
considered TDRs. See Note 1 Accounting Policies and the 
TDR section of this Note 3.

Total nonperforming loans in Table 40 include TDRs of $1.0 
billion at December 31, 2017 and $1.1 billion at December 31, 
2016. TDRs that are performing, including consumer credit 
card TDR loans, totaled $1.1 billion at both December 31, 
2017 and December 31, 2016, and are excluded from 
nonperforming loans. Nonperforming TDRs are returned to 
accrual status and classified as performing after demonstrating 
a period of at least six months of consecutive performance 
under the restructured terms. Loans where borrowers have 
been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 
bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan 
obligations to us and loans to borrowers not currently 
obligated to make both principal and interest payments under 
the restructured terms are not returned to accrual status. See 
the TDRs section of this Note 3 for more information on 
TDRs.

Additional Asset Quality Indicators
We have two overall portfolio segments – Commercial 
Lending and Consumer Lending. Each of these two segments 
comprises multiple loan classes. Classes are characterized by 
similarities in initial measurement, risk attributes and the 
manner in which we monitor and assess credit risk. The 
Commercial Lending segment is composed of the commercial, 
commercial real estate and equipment lease financing loan 
classes. The Consumer Lending segment is composed of the 
home equity, residential real estate, credit card and other 
consumer loan classes.

Commercial Lending Asset Classes
Commercial Loan Class
For commercial loans, we monitor the performance of the 
borrower in a disciplined and regular manner based upon the 
level of credit risk inherent in the loan. To evaluate the level of 
credit risk, we assign an internal risk rating reflecting the 
borrower’s PD and LGD. This two-dimensional credit risk 
rating methodology provides granularity in the risk monitoring 
process on an ongoing basis. These ratings are reviewed and 
updated, generally at least once per year. Additionally, no less 
frequently than on an annual basis, we review PD rates related 
to each rating grade based upon internal historical data. These 
rates are updated as needed and augmented by market data as 
deemed necessary. For small balance homogeneous pools of 
commercial loans, mortgages and leases, we apply statistical 
modeling to assist in determining the probability of default 
within these pools. Further, on a periodic basis, we update our 
LGD estimates associated with each rating grade based upon 
historical data. The combination of the PD and LGD ratings 
assigned to commercial loans, capturing both the combination 
of expectations of default and loss severity in event of default, 
reflects the relative estimated likelihood of loss at the 
reporting date. In general, loans with better PD and LGD tend 
to have a lower likelihood of loss compared to loans with 
worse PD and LGD. The loss amount also considers an 
estimate of exposure at date of default, which we also 
periodically update based upon historical data.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  99

Based upon the amount of the lending arrangement and our 
risk rating assessment, we follow a formal schedule of written 
periodic review. Quarterly, we conduct formal reviews of a 
market’s or business unit’s entire loan portfolio, focusing on 
those loans which we perceive to be of higher risk, based upon 
PDs and LGDs, or loans for which credit quality is weakening. 
If circumstances warrant, it is our practice to review any 
customer obligation and its level of credit risk more 
frequently. We attempt to proactively manage our loans by 
using various procedures that are customized to the risk of a 
given loan, including ongoing outreach, contact, and 
assessment of obligor financial conditions, collateral 
inspection and appraisal.

Commercial Real Estate Loan Class
We manage credit risk associated with our commercial real 
estate projects and commercial mortgages similar to 
commercial loans by analyzing PD and LGD. Additionally, 
risks associated with commercial real estate projects and 
commercial mortgage activities tend to be correlated to the 
loan structure and collateral location, project progress and 
business environment. As a result, these attributes are also 
monitored and utilized in assessing credit risk.

Table 41: Commercial Lending Asset Quality Indicators (a)

As with the commercial class, a formal schedule of periodic 
review is also performed to assess market/geographic risk and 
business unit/industry risk. Often as a result of these 
overviews, more in-depth reviews and increased scrutiny are 
placed on areas of higher risk, including adverse changes in 
risk ratings, deteriorating operating trends, and/or areas that 
concern management. These reviews are designed to assess 
risk and take actions to mitigate our exposure to such risks.

Equipment Lease Financing Loan Class
We manage credit risk associated with our equipment lease 
financing loan class similar to commercial loans by analyzing 
PD and LGD.

Based upon the dollar amount of the lease and the level of 
credit risk, we follow a formal schedule of periodic review. 
Generally, this occurs quarterly, although we have established 
practices to review such credit risk more frequently if 
circumstances warrant. Our review process entails analysis of 
the following factors: equipment value/residual value, 
exposure levels, jurisdiction risk, industry risk, guarantor 
requirements, and regulatory compliance as applicable.

(a)  Loans are classified as “Pass”, “Special Mention”, “Substandard” and “Doubtful” based on the Regulatory Classification definitions. We use PDs and LGDs to rate 

commercial loans.

(b)  Special Mention rated loans have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration 

of repayment prospects at some future date. These loans do not expose us to sufficient risk to warrant a more adverse classification at the reporting date.

(c)  Substandard rated loans have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the collection or liquidation of debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility 

(d)  Doubtful rated loans possess all the inherent weaknesses of a Substandard loan with the additional characteristics that the weakness makes collection or liquidation in full

Consumer Lending Asset Classes
Home Equity and Residential Real Estate Loan Classes
We use several credit quality indicators, including delinquency 
information, nonperforming loan information, updated credit 
scores, originated and updated loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, and 
geography, to monitor and manage credit risk within the home 
equity and residential real estate loan classes. We evaluate 
mortgage loan performance by source originators and loan 
servicers. A summary of asset quality indicators follows:

Delinquency/Delinquency Rates: We monitor trending of 
delinquency/delinquency rates for home equity and residential 
real estate loans. See Table 39 for additional information.

Nonperforming Loans: We monitor trending of nonperforming 
loans for home equity and residential real estate loans. See 
Table 39 for additional information.

Credit Scores: We use a national third-party provider to update 
FICO credit scores for home equity loans and lines of credit 
and residential real estate loans at least quarterly. The updated 
scores are incorporated into a series of credit management 
reports, which are utilized to monitor the risk in the loan 
classes.

LTV (inclusive of combined loan-to-value (CLTV) for first 
and subordinate lien positions): At least annually, we update 
the property values of real estate collateral and calculate an 
updated LTV ratio. For open-end credit lines secured by real 
estate in regions experiencing significant declines in property 
values, more frequent valuations may occur. We examine LTV 
migration and stratify LTV into categories to monitor the risk 
in the loan classes.

Historically, we used, and we continue to use, a combination 
of original LTV and updated LTV for internal risk 
management and reporting purposes (e.g., line management, 
loss mitigation strategies). In addition to the fact that 
estimated property values by their nature are estimates, given 
certain data limitations it is important to note that updated 
LTVs may be based upon management’s assumptions (e.g., if 
an updated LTV is not provided by the third-party service 
provider, home price index (HPI) changes will be incorporated 
in arriving at management’s estimate of updated LTV).

Updated LTV is estimated using modeled property values. The 
related estimates and inputs are based upon an approach that 
uses a combination of third-party automated valuation models 
(AVMs), broker price opinions (BPOs), HPI indices, property 
location, internal and external balance information, origination 
data and management assumptions. We generally utilize 
origination lien balances provided by a third-party, where 
applicable, which do not include an amortization assumption 
when calculating updated LTV. Accordingly, the results of the 
calculations do not represent actual appraised loan level 
collateral or updated LTV based upon lien balances held by 
others, and as such, are necessarily imprecise and subject to 
change as we refine our methodology.

Geography: Geographic concentrations are monitored to 
evaluate and manage exposures. Loan purchase programs are 
sensitive to, and focused within, certain regions to manage 
geographic exposures and associated risks.

A combination of updated FICO scores, originated and 
updated LTV ratios and geographic location assigned to home 
equity loans and lines of credit and residential real estate loans 
is used to monitor the risk in the loan classes. Loans with 
higher FICO scores and lower LTVs tend to have a lower level 
of risk. Conversely, loans with lower FICO scores, higher 
LTVs, and in certain geographic locations tend to have a 
higher level of risk.

Credit Card and Other Consumer Loan Classes
We monitor a variety of asset quality information in the management of the credit card and other consumer loan classes. Other 
consumer loan classes include education, automobile, and other secured and unsecured lines and loans. Along with the trending of 
delinquencies and losses for each class, FICO credit score updates are generally obtained monthly, as well as a variety of credit bureau 
attributes. Loans with high FICO scores tend to have a lower likelihood of loss. Conversely, loans with low FICO scores tend to have 
a higher likelihood of loss.

accounts with no FICO score available or required.

Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs)
A TDR is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a 
manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing 
financial difficulty. TDRs result from our loss mitigation 
activities, and include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, 
postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization, and 
extensions, which are intended to minimize economic loss and 
to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Additionally, 
TDRs also result from borrowers that have been discharged 
from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have 
not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us. In those 
situations where principal is forgiven, the amount of such 
principal forgiveness is immediately charged off.

Some TDRs may not ultimately result in the full collection of 
principal and interest, as restructured, and result in potential 
incremental losses. These potential incremental losses have 
been factored into our overall ALLL estimate. The level of any 
subsequent defaults will likely be affected by future economic 
conditions. Once a loan becomes a TDR, it will continue to be 
reported as a TDR until it is ultimately repaid in full, the 
collateral is foreclosed upon, or it is fully charged off. We held 
specific reserves in the ALLL of $.2 billion and $.3 billion at 
December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, for 
the total TDR portfolio.

Table 44: Financial Impact and TDRs by Concession Type (a)

Table 44 quantifies the number of loans that were classified as 
TDRs as well as the change in the loans’ recorded investment 
as a result of becoming a TDR during the years 2017, 2016 
and 2015. Additionally, the table provides information about 
the types of TDR concessions. The Principal Forgiveness TDR 
category includes principal forgiveness and accrued interest 
forgiveness. The Rate Reduction TDR category includes 
reduced interest rate and interest deferral. The Other TDR 
category primarily includes consumer borrowers that have 
been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 
bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan 
obligations to us, as well as postponement/reduction of 
scheduled amortization and contractual extensions for both 
consumer and commercial borrowers.

In some cases, there have been multiple concessions granted 
on one loan. This is most common within the commercial loan 
portfolio. When there have been multiple concessions granted 
in the commercial loan portfolio, the principal forgiveness 
concession was prioritized for purposes of determining the 
inclusion in Table 44. Second in priority would be rate 
reduction. In the event that multiple concessions are granted 
on a consumer loan, concessions resulting from discharge 
from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy without 
formal affirmation of the loan obligations to us would be 
prioritized and included in the Other type of concession in 
Table 44. After that, consumer loan concessions would follow 
the previously discussed priority of concessions for the 
commercial loan portfolio.

Impaired Loans
Impaired loans include commercial and consumer nonperforming loans and TDRs, regardless of nonperforming status. TDRs that 
were previously recorded at amortized cost and are now classified and accounted for as held for sale are also included. Excluded from 
impaired loans are nonperforming leases, loans accounted for as held for sale other than the TDRs described in the preceding sentence, 
loans accounted for under the fair value option, smaller balance homogeneous type loans and purchased impaired loans. We did not 
recognize any interest income on impaired loans that have not returned to performing status, while they were impaired during the year 
ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The following table provides further detail on impaired loans individually 
evaluated for impairment and the associated ALLL. Certain commercial and consumer impaired loans do not have a related ALLL as 
the valuation of these impaired loans exceeded the recorded investment.

NOTE 4 ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES
We maintain the ALLL at levels that we believe to be appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the portfolios 
as of the balance sheet date. We use the two main portfolio segments – Commercial Lending and Consumer Lending, and develop and 
document the ALLL under separate methodologies for each of these portfolio segments. See Note 1 Accounting Policies for a 
description of the accounting policies for ALLL. A rollforward of the ALLL and associated loan data follows.

(a)  Loans accounted for under the fair value option are not evaluated for impairment as these loans are accounted for at fair value. Accordingly there is no allowance recorded on 

(b) 

these loans.
Includes $468 million in write-offs of purchased impaired loans due to the change in derecognition policy effective December 31, 2015 for certain consumer purchased 
impaired loans. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information.

Net interest income less the provision for credit losses was $8.7 billion, $8.0 billion and $8.0 billion for 2017, 2016 and 2015,

The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest 
rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. 
Net unrealized gains and losses in the securities available for 
sale portfolio are included in Shareholders’ equity as 
Accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax, 
unless credit-related. Securities held to maturity are carried at 
amortized cost. At December 31, 2017, Accumulated other 
comprehensive income included pretax gains of $54 million 
from derivatives that hedged the purchase of investment 
securities classified as held to maturity. The gains will be 
accreted into interest income as an adjustment of yield on the 
securities.

Table 48: Gross Unrealized Loss and Fair Value of Debt Securities

Table 48 presents gross unrealized losses and fair value of debt 
securities at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The 
securities are segregated between investments that have been 
in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve 
months and twelve months or more based on the point in time 
that the fair value declined below the amortized cost basis. 
The table includes debt securities where the noncredit portion 
of OTTI has been recognized in Accumulated other 
comprehensive income (loss).

Evaluating Investment Securities for Other-than-
Temporary Impairments
For the securities in Table 48, as of December 31, 2017 we do 
not intend to sell and believe we will not be required to sell the 
securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis.

On at least a quarterly basis, we review all debt securities that 
are in an unrealized loss position for OTTI, as discussed in 
Note 1 Accounting Policies. For those securities on our 
balance sheet at December 31, 2017, where during our 
quarterly security-level impairment assessments we 
determined losses represented OTTI, we have recorded 
cumulative credit losses of $1.1 billion in earnings and 
accordingly have reduced the amortized cost of our securities. 

The majority of these cumulative impairment charges related 
to non-agency residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed 
securities rated BB or lower. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, the 
OTTI credit losses recognized in noninterest income and the 
OTTI noncredit losses recognized in accumulated other 

Table 50: Contractual Maturity of Debt Securities

comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, on securities were 
not significant.

Information relating to gross realized securities gains and 
losses from the sales of securities is set forth in the following 
table.

Weighted-average yields are based on historical cost with 
effective yields weighted for the contractual maturity of each 
security. At December 31, 2017, there were no securities of a 
single issuer, other than FNMA, that exceeded 10% of Total 
shareholders’ equity. The FNMA investments had a total 
amortized cost of $31.0 billion and fair value of $30.8 billion.

The following table presents the fair value of securities that 
have been either pledged to or accepted from others to 
collateralize outstanding borrowings.

The securities pledged to others include positions held in our 
portfolio of investment securities, trading securities, and 
securities accepted as collateral from others that we are 
permitted by contract or custom to sell or repledge, and were 
used to secure public and trust deposits, repurchase 
agreements, and for other purposes.

NOTE 6 FAIR VALUE
Fair Value Measurement
We measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. 
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell 
an asset or the price that would be paid to transfer a liability 
on the measurement date, determined using an exit price in the 
principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability 
in an orderly transaction between market participants. The fair 
value hierarchy established by GAAP requires us to maximize 
the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value. The 
three levels of the fair value hierarchy are:
   

•  Level 1: Fair value is determined using a quoted price 

in an active market for identical assets or liabilities. 
Level 1 assets and liabilities may include debt 
securities, equity securities and listed derivative 
contracts that are traded in an active exchange market 
and certain U.S. Treasury securities that are actively 
traded in over-the-counter markets.

•  Level 2: Fair value is estimated using inputs other 
than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are 
observable for assets or liabilities, either directly or 
indirectly. The majority of Level 2 assets and 
liabilities include debt securities, equity securities and 
listed derivative contracts with quoted prices that are 
traded in markets that are not active, and certain debt 
and equity securities and over-the-counter derivative 
contracts whose fair value is determined using a 
pricing model without significant unobservable 
inputs.

•  Level 3: Fair value is estimated using unobservable 

inputs that are significant to the fair value of the 
assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities 
include financial instruments whose value is 
determined using pricing models and discounted cash 
flow methodologies, or similar techniques for which 
the significant valuation inputs are not observable and 
the determination of fair value requires significant 
management judgment or estimation.

We characterize active markets as those where transaction 
volumes are sufficient to provide objective pricing 
information, with reasonably narrow bid/ask spreads and 
where dealer quotes received do not vary widely and are based 
on current information. Inactive markets are typically 
characterized by low transaction volumes, price quotations 
that vary substantially among market participants or are not 
based on current information, wide bid/ask spreads, a 
significant increase in implied liquidity risk premiums, yields, 
or performance indicators for observed transactions or quoted 
prices compared to historical periods, a significant decline or 
absence of a market for new issuance, or any combination of 
the above factors. We also consider nonperformance risks 
including credit risk as part of our valuation methodology for 
all assets and liabilities measured at fair value.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value, by their nature, 
result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. 
Assets and liabilities classified within Level 3 inherently 
require the use of various assumptions, estimates and 
judgments when measuring their fair value. As observable 
market activity is commonly not available to use when 
estimating the fair value of Level 3 assets and liabilities, we 
must estimate fair value using various modeling techniques. 
These techniques include the use of a variety of inputs/
assumptions including credit quality, liquidity, interest rates or 
other relevant inputs across the entire population of our 
Level 3 assets and liabilities. Changes in the significant 
underlying factors or assumptions (either an increase or a 
decrease) in any of these areas underlying our estimates may 
result in a significant increase/decrease in the Level 3 fair 
value measurement of a particular asset and/or liability from 
period to period.

Any models used to determine fair values or to validate dealer 
quotes are subject to review and independent testing as part of 
our model validation and internal control testing processes. 
Our Model Risk Management Group reviews significant 
models on at least an annual basis. In addition, the Valuation 
Committee approves valuation methodologies and reviews the 
results of independent valuation reviews and processes for 
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring 
basis.
 
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a 
Recurring Basis

Securities Available for Sale and Trading Securities
Securities accounted for at fair value include both the 
available for sale and trading portfolios. We primarily use 
prices obtained from pricing services, dealer quotes, or recent 
trades to determine the fair value of securities. The majority of 
securities were priced by third-party vendors. The third-party 
vendors use a variety of methods when pricing securities that 
incorporate relevant market data to arrive at an estimate of 
what a buyer in the marketplace would pay for a security 
under current market conditions. We monitor and validate the 
reliability of vendor pricing on an ongoing basis through 
pricing methodology reviews, including detailed reviews of 
the assumptions and inputs used by the vendor to price 
individual securities, and through price validation testing. 
Securities not priced by one of our pricing vendors may be 
valued using a dealer quote, which are also subject to price 
validation testing. Price validation testing is performed 
independent of the risk-taking function and involves 
corroborating the prices received from third-party vendors and 
dealers with prices from another third party or through other 
sources, such as internal valuations or sales of similar 
securities. Security prices are also validated through actual 
cash settlement upon sale of a security.

Securities are classified within the fair value hierarchy after 
giving consideration to the activity level in the market for the 
security type and the observability of the inputs used to 
determine the fair value. When a quoted price in an active 
market exists for the identical security, this price is used to 
determine fair value and the security is classified within 
Level 1 of the hierarchy. Level 1 securities include U.S. 
Treasury securities and money-market mutual funds. When a 
quoted price in an active market for the identical security is 
not available, fair value is estimated using either an alternative 
market approach, such as a recent trade or matrix pricing, or 
an income approach, such as a discounted cash flow pricing 
model. If the inputs to the valuation are based primarily on 
market observable information, then the security is classified 
within Level 2 of the hierarchy. Level 2 securities include 
agency debt securities, agency residential mortgage-backed 
securities, agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-
backed securities, certain non-agency residential mortgage-
backed securities, asset-backed securities collateralized by 
non-mortgage-related consumer loans, municipal securities, 
and other debt securities. Level 2 securities are predominantly 
priced by third parties, either a pricing vendor or dealer.

In certain cases where there is limited activity or less 
transparency around the inputs to the valuation, securities are 
classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy. Securities classified 
as Level 3 consist primarily of non-agency residential 
mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities collateralized by 
first- and second-lien residential mortgage loans. Fair value 
for these securities is primarily estimated using pricing 
obtained from third-party vendors. In some cases, fair value is 
estimated using a dealer quote, by reference to prices of 
securities of a similar vintage and collateral type or by 
reference to recent sales of similar securities. Market activity 
for these security types is limited with little price transparency. 
As a result, these securities are generally valued by the third-
party vendor using a discounted cash flow approach that 
incorporates significant unobservable inputs and observable 
market activity where available. Significant inputs to the 
valuation include prepayment projections and credit loss 
assumptions (default rate and loss severity) and discount rates 
that are deemed representative of current market conditions. 
Significant increases (decreases) in any of those assumptions 
in isolation would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair 
value measurement.

Certain infrequently traded debt securities within Other debt 
securities available-for-sale and Trading securities are also 
classified in Level 3 and are included in the Insignificant 
Level 3 assets, net of liabilities line item in Table 54. The 
significant unobservable inputs used to estimate the fair value 
of these securities include an estimate of expected credit losses 
and a discount for liquidity risk. These inputs are incorporated 
into the fair value measurement by either increasing the spread 
over the benchmark curve or by applying a credit and liquidity 
discount to the par value of the security. Significant increases 
(decreases) in credit and/or liquidity risk could result in a 
significantly lower (higher) fair value estimate.

Residential Mortgage Loans Held for Sale
We account for certain residential mortgage loans originated 
for sale at fair value on a recurring basis. The election of the 
fair value option aligns the accounting for the residential 
mortgages with the related hedges. Residential mortgage loans 
are valued based on quoted market prices, where available, 
prices for other traded mortgage loans with similar 
characteristics, and purchase commitments and bid 
information received from market participants. The prices are 
adjusted as necessary to include the embedded servicing value 
in the loans and to take into consideration the specific 
characteristics of certain loans that are priced based on the 
pricing of similar loans. These adjustments represent 
unobservable inputs to the valuation but are not considered 
significant given the relative insensitivity of the value to 
changes in these inputs to the fair value of the loans. 
Accordingly, the majority of residential mortgage loans held 
for sale are classified as Level 2.

Commercial Mortgage Loans Held for Sale
We account for certain commercial mortgage loans classified 
as held for sale in whole loan transactions at fair value. We 
determine the fair value of commercial mortgage loans held 
for sale based upon discounted cash flows. Fair value is 
determined using sale valuation assumptions that management 
believes a market participant would use in pricing the loans.
 
Valuation assumptions may include observable inputs based 
on the benchmark interest rate swap curve, whole loan sales 
and agency sales transactions. The significant unobservable 
input for commercial mortgage loans held for sale, excluding 
those to be sold to agencies, is management’s assumption of 
the spread applied to the benchmark rate. The spread over the 
benchmark curve includes management’s assumptions of the 
impact of credit and liquidity risk. Significant increases 
(decreases) in the spread applied to the benchmark would 
result in a significantly lower (higher) asset value. The wide 
range of the spread over the benchmark curve is due to the 
varying risk and underlying property characteristics within our 
portfolio.  Based on the significance of the unobservable input 
we classified this portfolio as Level 3.

For loans to be sold to agencies with servicing retained, the 
fair value is adjusted for the estimated servicing cash flows, 
which is an unobservable input.  This adjustment is not 
considered significant given the relative insensitivity of the 
value to changes in the input to the fair value of the loans.  
Accordingly, commercial mortgage loans held for sale to 
agencies are classified as Level 2 as of December 31, 2017.

Loans
Loans accounted for at fair value consist primarily of 
residential mortgage loans. These loans are generally valued 
similarly to residential mortgage loans held for sale and are 
classified as Level 2. However, similar to residential mortgage 
loans held for sale, if these loans are repurchased and 
unsalable, they are classified as Level 3. In addition, 
repurchased VA loans, where only a portion of the principal 
will be reimbursed, are classified as Level 3. The fair value is 
determined using a discounted cash flow calculation based on 

our historical loss rate. We have elected to account for certain 
home equity lines of credit at fair value. These loans are 
classified as Level 3. Significant inputs to the valuation of 
these loans include credit and liquidity discount, cumulative 
default rate, loss severity and gross discount rate and are 
deemed representative of current market conditions. 
Significant increases (decreases) in any of these assumptions 
would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value 
measurement.

Equity Investments
The valuation of direct and indirect private equity investments 
requires significant management judgment due to the absence 
of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the 
long-term nature of such investments. Various valuation 
techniques are used for direct investments, including multiples 
of adjusted earnings of the entity, independent appraisals, 
anticipated financing and sale transactions with third parties, 
or the pricing used to value the entity in a recent financing 
transaction. A multiple of adjusted earnings calculation is the 
valuation technique utilized most frequently and is the most 
significant unobservable input used in such calculation. 
Significant decreases (increases) in the multiple of earnings 
could result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value 
measurement. Direct equity investments are classified as 
Level 3.

Indirect investments are not redeemable; however, we receive 
distributions over the life of the partnerships from liquidation 
of the underlying investments by the investee, which we 
expect to occur over the next twelve years. We value indirect 
investments in private equity funds using consensus pricing 
and the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient as provided 
in the financial statements that we receive from fund 
managers. Due to the time lag in our receipt of the financial 
information and based on a review of investments and 
valuation techniques applied, adjustments to the manager-
provided value are made when available recent portfolio 
company information or market information indicates a 
significant change in value from that provided by the manager 
of the fund. Indirect investments valued using NAV are not 
classified in the fair value hierarchy.

Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)
MSRs are carried at fair value on a recurring basis. 
Assumptions incorporated into the MSRs valuation model 
reflect management’s best estimate of factors that a market 
participant would use in valuing the MSRs. Although sales of  
MSRs do occur and can offer some market insight, MSRs do 
not trade in an active, open market with readily observable 
prices so the precise terms and conditions of sales are not 
available.

Residential MSRs
As a benchmark for the reasonableness of our residential 
MSRs fair value, we obtained opinions of value from 
independent brokers. These brokers provided a range 
(+/-10 bps) based upon their own discounted cash flow 
calculations of our portfolio that reflect conditions in the 
secondary market and any recently executed servicing 
transactions. We compare our internally-developed residential 

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  113

MSRs value to the ranges of values received from the brokers. 
If our residential MSRs fair value falls outside of the brokers’ 
ranges, management will assess whether a valuation 
adjustment is warranted. For the periods presented, our 
residential MSRs value did not fall outside of the brokers’ 
ranges. We consider our residential MSRs value to represent a 
reasonable estimate of fair value.

Due to the nature of the unobservable valuation inputs, 
residential MSRs are classified as Level 3. The significant 
unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of 
residential MSRs are constant prepayment rates and spread 
over the benchmark curve. Significant increases (decreases) in 
prepayment rates and spread over the benchmark curve would 
result in lower (higher) fair market value of residential MSRs.

Commercial MSRs
The fair value of commercial MSRs is estimated by using a 
discounted cash flow model incorporating unobservable inputs 
for assumptions such as constant prepayment rates, discount 
rates and other factors. Due to the nature of the unobservable 
valuation inputs and the limited availability of market pricing, 
commercial MSRs are classified as Level 3. Significant 
increases  (decreases) in constant prepayment rates and 
discount rates would result in significantly lower  (higher) 
commercial MSR value determined based on current market 
conditions and expectations.

Financial Derivatives
Exchange-traded derivatives are valued using quoted market 
prices and are classified as Level 1. The majority of 
derivatives that we enter into are executed over-the-counter 
and are valued using internal models. These derivatives are 
primarily classified as Level 2 as the readily observable 
market inputs to these models are validated to external sources 
such as industry pricing services, or are corroborated through 
recent trades, dealer quotes, yield curves, implied volatility or 
other market-related data. Level 2 financial derivatives are 
primarily estimated using a combination of Eurodollar future 
prices and observable benchmark interest rate swaps to 
construct projected discounted cash flows.

Financial derivatives that are priced using significant 
management judgment or assumptions are classified as 
Level 3. Unobservable inputs related to interest rate contracts 
include probability of funding of residential mortgage loan 
commitments and estimated servicing cash flows of 
commercial and residential mortgage loan commitments. 
Probability of default and loss severity are the significant 
unobservable inputs used in the valuation of risk participation 
agreements. The fair values of Level 3 assets and liabilities 
related to these financial derivatives as of December 31, 2017 
and 2016 are included in the Insignificant Level 3 assets, net 
of liabilities line item in Table 54 of this Note 6.

In connection with the sales of portions of our Visa Class B 
common shares, we entered into swap agreements with the 
purchasers of the shares to retain any future risk of decreases 
in the conversion rate of Class B common shares to Class A 
common shares resulting from increases in the escrow funded 
by Visa to pay for the costs of resolution of specified litigation 

114    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

(see Note 19 Legal Proceedings). These swaps also require 
PNC to make periodic payments based on the market price of 
the Class A common shares and a fixed rate of interest until 
the Visa litigation is resolved. An increase in the estimated 
length of litigation resolution date, a decrease in the estimated 
conversion rate, or an increase in the estimated growth rate of 
the Class A share price will each have a negative impact on the 
fair value of the swaps and vice versa.

The fair values of our derivatives include a credit valuation 
adjustment to reflect our own and our counterparties’ 
nonperformance risk. Our credit valuation adjustment is 
computed using new loan pricing and considers externally 
available bond spreads, in conjunction with internal historical 
recovery observations.

Other Assets and Liabilities
Other assets held at fair value on a recurring basis primarily 
include assets related to PNC’s deferred compensation and 
supplemental incentive savings plans and BlackRock Series C 
Preferred Stock.

The assets related to PNC’s deferred compensation and 
supplemental incentive savings plans primarily consist of a 
prepaid forward contract referencing an amount of shares of 
PNC stock, equity mutual funds and fixed income funds, and 
are valued based on the underlying investments. These assets 
are valued either by reference to the market price of PNC’s 
stock or by using the quoted market prices for investments 
other than PNC’s stock and are primarily classified in Levels 1 
and 2.

We have elected to account for the shares of BlackRock Series 
C Preferred Stock received in a stock exchange with 
BlackRock at fair value as these shares economically hedge 
the BlackRock LTIP liability that is accounted for and reported 
as a derivative. The fair value of the Series C Preferred Stock 
is determined using a third-party modeling approach, which 
includes both observable and unobservable inputs. Due to the 
significance of unobservable inputs, this security is classified 
as Level 3. Significant increases (decreases) in the liquidity 
discount would result in a lower (higher) asset value for the 
BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock.

All Level 3 other assets and liabilities are included in the 
Insignificant Level 3 assets, net of liabilities line item in Table 
54 in this Note 6.

Other Borrowed Funds
Other borrowed funds primarily consist of U.S. Treasury 
securities sold short classified as Level 1. Other borrowed 
funds also includes the related liability for certain repurchased 
loans for which we have elected the fair value option and are 
classified as either Level 2 or Level 3, consistent with the 
level classification of the corresponding loans. All Level 3 
amounts are included in the Insignificant Level 3 assets, net of 
liabilities line item in Table 54 in this Note 6.

The following table summarizes our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including instruments for which 
we have elected the fair value option.

(b)  The amount of the total gains or losses for the period included in earnings that is attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses related to those assets and liabilities held at the 

 

(c)  Transfers out of Level 3 primarily reflect the reclassification of residential mortgage loans held for sale to held for investment and the transfer of residential mortgage loans to OREO.
(d)  Reflects a transfer from Level 3 to Level 2 due to an unobservable valuation input that was deemed to be not significant.
(e)  Reflects transfers into and out of Level 3 associated with changes in valuation methodology for certain equity investments subject to the Volcker Rule provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.
(f)  Net gains (losses) realized and unrealized included in earnings related to Level 3 assets and liabilities included amortization and accretion. The amortization and accretion amounts were 
included in Interest income on the Consolidated Income Statement and the remaining net gains (losses) realized and unrealized were included in Noninterest income on the Consolidated 
Income Statement.

(g)  Net unrealized gains (losses) related to assets and liabilities held at the end of the reporting period were included in Noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement.

An instrument’s categorization within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement. Changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs to a fair value measurement may result in a 
reclassification (transfer) of assets or liabilities between hierarchy levels. Our policy is to recognize transfers in and transfers out as of 
the end of the reporting period.

Financial Assets Accounted for at Fair Value on a 
Nonrecurring Basis
We may be required to measure certain financial assets at fair 
value on a nonrecurring basis. These adjustments to fair value 
usually result from the application of lower of amortized cost 
or fair value accounting or write-downs of individual assets 
due to impairment and are included in Table 55 and Table 56.

Nonaccrual Loans
Nonaccrual loans represent the fair value of those loans which 
have been adjusted due to impairment. The impairment is 
primarily based on the appraised value of the collateral.

Appraisals are obtained by licensed or certified appraisers at 
least annually and more recently in certain instances. All third-
party appraisals are reviewed and any adjustments to the initial 
appraisal are incorporated into the final issued appraisal 
report. In instances where an appraisal is not obtained, 
collateral value is determined consistent with external third-
party appraisal standards by an internal person independent of 
the asset manager.
 
OREO, Foreclosed and Other Assets
The carrying value of OREO and foreclosed assets includes 
valuation adjustments recorded subsequent to the transfer to 
OREO and foreclosed assets. These valuation adjustments are 
based on the fair value less cost to sell of the property. Fair 
value is based on appraised value or sales price and the 
appraisal process for OREO and foreclosed properties is the 
same as described above for nonaccrual loans. The carrying 
value of other assets includes valuation adjustments that are 
generally based on the appraised value of the underlying 
assets.

Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets consists of buildings for which valuation 
adjustments were recorded during the period. A facility 
classified as held and used is impaired to the extent its 
carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. 
Valuation adjustments on buildings held for sale are based on 
the fair value of the property less an estimated cost to sell and 
are recorded subsequent to the transfer of the asset to held for 
sale status. Fair value is determined either by a third-party 
appraisal, recent sales offer, changes in market or property 
conditions, or where we have agreed to sell the building to a 
third party, the contractual sales price. Impairment on these 
long-lived assets is recorded in Other noninterest expense on 
our Consolidated Income Statement.

Financial Instruments Accounted for under Fair Value Option
We elect the fair value option to account for certain financial instruments. For more information on these financial instruments for 
which the fair value option election has been made, please refer to the Fair Value Measurement section of this Note 6. These financial 
instruments are initially measured at fair value. Gains and losses from initial measurement and any changes in fair value are 
subsequently recognized in earnings.

Interest income related to changes in the fair values of these financial instruments is recorded on the Consolidated Income Statement 
in Other interest income, except for certain Residential mortgage loans, for which income is also recorded in Loan interest income. 
Changes in value on the prepaid forward contract included in Other Assets is reported in Noninterest expense and interest expense on 
the Other borrowed funds is reported in Borrowed funds interest expense.

Fair values and aggregate unpaid principal balances of items for which we elected the fair value option follow.

Other Assets
Other assets includes accrued interest receivable, cash 
collateral, federal funds sold and resale agreements, equity 
investments carried at cost, certain loans held for sale, and 
FHLB and FRB stock. The aggregate carrying value of our 
FHLB and FRB stock was $1.8 billion at December 31, 2017 
and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2016, which approximated 
fair value at each date.

Deposits
For deposits with no defined maturity, such as noninterest-
bearing and interest-bearing demand and interest-bearing 
money market and savings deposits, carrying values 
approximate fair values. For time deposits, fair values are 
estimated by discounting contractual cash flows using current 
market rates for instruments with similar maturities.

Borrowed Funds
For short-term borrowings, including Federal funds purchased, 
commercial paper, repurchase agreements, and certain other 
short-term borrowings and payables, carrying values 
approximated fair values. For long-term borrowed funds, 
quoted market prices are used, when available, to estimate fair 
value. When quoted market prices are not available, fair value 
is estimated based on current market interest rates and credit 
spreads for debt with similar terms and maturities.

Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit
The fair value of unfunded loan commitments and letters of 
credit is determined from a market participant’s view 
including the impact of changes in interest rates and credit. We 
establish a liability on these facilities related to the 
creditworthiness of our counterparty.

Other Liabilities
Other liabilities includes interest-bearing cash collateral held 
related to derivatives and other accrued liabilities. Due to its 
short term nature, the carrying value of Other liabilities 
reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet approximates fair 
value.

The changes in fair value for items for which we elected the 
fair value option are as follows.

Additional Fair Value Information Related to Financial 
Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value
This section presents fair value information for all other 
financial instruments that are not recorded on the consolidated 
balance sheet at fair value. We used the following methods and 
assumptions to estimate the fair value amounts for these 
financial instruments.

Cash and Due from Banks and Interest-earning Deposits 
with Banks
Due to their short-term nature, the carrying amounts for Cash 
and Due from Banks and Interest-earning Deposits with Banks 
reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate fair 
value.

Securities Held to Maturity
We primarily use prices obtained from pricing services, dealer 
quotes or recent trades to determine the fair value of securities. 
Refer to the Fair Value Measurement section of this Note 6 for 
additional information relating to our pricing processes and 
procedures.

Net Loans
Fair values are estimated based on the discounted value of 
expected net cash flows incorporating assumptions about 
prepayment rates, net credit losses and servicing fees. 
Nonaccrual loans are valued at their estimated recovery value. 
Loans are presented net of the ALLL.

Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights
Residential MSRs are subject to changes in value from actual 
or expected prepayment of the underlying loans and defaults 
as well as market driven changes in interest rates. We manage 
this risk by economically hedging the fair value of residential 
MSRs with securities and derivative instruments which are 
expected to increase (or decrease) in value when the value of 
residential MSRs declines (or increases).

The fair value of residential MSRs is estimated by using a 
discounted cash flow valuation model which calculates the 
present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows, 
taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan 
prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs, and other 
factors which are determined based on current market 
conditions.

We conduct a goodwill impairment test on our reporting units 
at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if 
events occur or circumstances have changed significantly from 
the annual test date. The fair value of our reporting units with 
goodwill is determined by using discounted cash flow and 
market comparability methodologies. Based on the results of 
our analysis, there were no impairment charges related to 
goodwill in 2017, 2016 or 2015.

Mortgage Servicing Rights
We recognize the right to service mortgage loans for others 
when we recognize it as an intangible asset and the servicing 
income we receive is more than adequate compensation. 
MSRs are purchased or originated when loans are sold with 
servicing retained. MSRs totaled $1.8 billion at both 
December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and 
consisted of loan servicing contracts for commercial and 
residential mortgages measured at fair value. 

Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights
We recognize gains/(losses) on changes in the fair value of 
commercial MSRs. Commercial MSRs are subject to changes 
in value from actual or expected prepayment of the underlying 
loans and defaults as well as market driven changes in interest 
rates. We manage this risk by economically hedging the fair 
value of commercial MSRs with securities and derivative 
instruments which are expected to increase (or decrease) in 
value when the value of commercial MSRs declines (or 
increases).

impact from both regularly scheduled loan principal payments and loans that 
were paid down or paid off during the period.

(b)  Represents MSR value changes resulting from market-driven changes in 

interest rates and changes in model assumptions.

Sensitivity Analysis
The fair value of commercial and residential MSRs and 
significant inputs to the valuation models as of  December 31, 
2017 are shown in Tables 63 and 64. The expected and actual 
rates of mortgage loan prepayments are significant factors 
driving the fair value. Management uses both internal 
proprietary models and a third-party model to estimate future 
commercial mortgage loan prepayments and a third-party 
model to estimate future residential mortgage loan 
prepayments. These models have been refined based on 
current market conditions and management judgment. Future 
interest rates are another important factor in the valuation of 
MSRs. Management utilizes market implied forward interest 
rates to estimate the future direction of mortgage and discount 
rates. The forward rates utilized are derived from the current 
yield curve for U.S. dollar interest rate swaps and are 
consistent with pricing of capital markets instruments. 
Changes in the shape and slope of the forward curve in future 
periods may result in volatility in the fair value estimate.

A sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical effect on the fair 
value of MSRs to adverse changes in key assumptions is 
presented in Tables 63 and 64. These sensitivities do not 
include the impact of the related hedging activities. Changes 
in fair value generally cannot be extrapolated because the 
relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in 
fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a 
particular assumption on the fair value of the MSRs is 
calculated independently without changing any other 
assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in 
changes in another (for example, changes in mortgage interest 
rates, which drive changes in prepayment rate estimates, could 
result in changes in the interest rate spread), which could 
either magnify or counteract the sensitivities.

The following tables set forth the fair value of commercial and 
residential MSRs and the sensitivity analysis of the 
hypothetical effect on the fair value of MSRs to immediate 
adverse changes of 10% and 20% in those assumptions:

Junior Subordinated Debentures

PNC Capital Trust C, a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of 
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., owns junior 
subordinated debentures issued by PNC with a carrying value 
of $205 million. In June 1998, PNC Capital Trust C issued 
$200 million of trust preferred securities which bear interest at 
an annual rate of 3 month LIBOR plus 57 basis points. The 
trust preferred securities are currently redeemable by PNC 
Capital Trust C at par. In accordance with GAAP, the financial 
statements of the Trust are not included in our consolidated 
financial statements.

The obligations of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., as 
the parent of the Trust, when taken collectively, are the 
equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee of the 
obligations of the Trust under the terms of the trust preferred 
securities. Such guarantee is subordinate in right of payment 
in the same manner as other junior subordinated debt. There 
are certain restrictions on our overall ability to obtain funds 
from our subsidiaries. For additional disclosure on these 
funding restrictions, see Note 18 Regulatory Matters.

We are subject to certain restrictions, including restrictions on 
dividend payments, in connection with the outstanding junior 
subordinated debentures. Generally, if there is (i) an event of 
default under the debenture, (ii) we elect to defer interest on 
the debenture, (iii) we exercise our right to defer payments on 
the related trust preferred securities, or (iv) there is a default 
under our guarantee of such payment obligations, subject to 
certain limited exceptions, we would be unable during the 
period of such default or deferral to make payments on our 
debt securities that rank equal or junior to the debentures as 
well as to make payments on our equity securities, including 
dividend payments.

NOTE 11 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 
Pension and Postretirement Plans
We have a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan covering eligible employees. Benefits are determined using a cash 
balance formula where earnings credits are a percentage of eligible compensation. Earnings credit percentages for those employees 
who were plan participants on December 31, 2009 are frozen at the level earned to that point. Earnings credits for all employees who 
became participants on or after January 1, 2010 are a flat 3% of eligible compensation. All plan participants earn interest on their cash 
balances based on 30-year Treasury securities rates with those who were participants at December 31, 2009 earning a minimum rate. 
New participants on or after January 1, 2010 are not subject to the minimum rate. Any pension contributions to the plan are based on 
an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund total benefits payable to plan participants. We made a voluntary contribution of 
$200 million in September 2017 to the qualified pension plan. Assets of the qualified pension plan are held in a separate Trust (Trust). 

We also maintain nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees and provide certain health care and life insurance 
benefits for qualifying retired employees (postretirement benefits) through various plans. PNC reserves the right to terminate or make 
changes to these plans at any time. The nonqualified pension plan is unfunded. Contributions from PNC and, in the case of the 
postretirement benefit plans, participant contributions cover all benefits paid under the nonqualified pension plan and postretirement 
benefit plans. The postretirement plan provides benefits to certain retirees that are at least actuarially equivalent to those provided by 
Medicare Part D and accordingly, we receive a federal subsidy as shown in Table 72. In November of 2015, we established a voluntary 
employee beneficiary association (VEBA) to partially fund postretirement medical and life insurance benefit obligations.

We use a measurement date of December 31 for plan assets and benefit obligations. A reconciliation of the changes in the projected 
benefit obligation for qualified pension, nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans as well as the change in plan assets for 
the qualified pension plan follows.

At December 31, 2017, the fair value of the qualified pension 
plan assets was more than both the accumulated benefit 
obligation and the projected benefit obligation.

PNC Pension Plan Assets
The long-term investment strategy for pension plan assets in 
our qualified pension plan (the Plan) is to:

•  Meet present and future benefit obligations to all 

participants and beneficiaries,

•  Cover reasonable expenses incurred to provide such 

• 

• 

benefits, including expenses incurred in the 
administration of the Trust and the Plan,
Provide sufficient liquidity to meet benefit and 
expense payment requirements on a timely basis, and
Provide a total return that, over the long term, 
maximizes the ratio of trust assets to liabilities by 
maximizing investment return, at an appropriate level 
of risk.

The Plan’s named investment fiduciary has the ability to make 
short to intermediate term asset allocation shifts under the 
dynamic asset allocation strategy based on factors such as the 
Plan’s funded status, the named investment fiduciary’s view of 
return on equities relative to long term expectations, the 
named investment fiduciary’s view on the direction of interest 
rates and credit spreads, and other relevant financial or 
economic factors which would be expected to impact the 
ability of the Trust to meet its obligation to participants and 
beneficiaries. Accordingly, the allowable asset allocation 
ranges have been updated to incorporate the flexibility 
required by the dynamic allocation policy.

The asset strategy allocations for the Trust at the end of 2017 
and 2016, and the target allocation range at the end of 2017, 
by asset category, are as follows.

The asset category represents the allocation of Plan assets in 
accordance with the investment objective of each of the Plan’s 
investment managers. Certain domestic equity investment 
managers utilize derivatives and fixed income securities as 
described in their Investment Management Agreements to 
achieve their investment objective under the Investment Policy 

Statement. Other investment managers may invest in eligible 
securities outside of their assigned asset category to meet their 
investment objectives. The actual percentage of the fair value 
of total Plan assets held as of December 31, 2017 for equity 
securities, fixed income securities, real estate and all other 
assets are 70%, 17%, 5% and 8%, respectively.

We believe that, over the long term, asset allocation is the 
single greatest determinant of risk. Asset allocation will 
deviate from the target percentages due to market movement, 
cash flows, investment manager performance and 
implementation of shifts under the dynamic asset allocation 
policy. Material deviations from the asset allocation targets 
can alter the expected return and risk of the Trust. On the other 
hand, frequent rebalancing of the asset allocation targets may 
result in significant transaction costs, which can impair the 
Trust’s ability to meet its investment objective. Accordingly, 
the Trust portfolio is periodically rebalanced to maintain asset 
allocation within the target ranges described above.

In addition to being diversified across asset classes, the Trust 
is diversified within each asset class. Secondary 
diversification provides a reasonable basis for the expectation 
that no single security or class of securities will have a 
disproportionate impact on the total risk and return of the 
Trust.

Where investment strategies permit the use of derivatives and/
or currency management, language is incorporated in the 
managers’ guidelines to define allowable and prohibited 
transactions and/or strategies. Derivatives are typically 
employed by investment managers to modify risk/return 
characteristics of their portfolio(s), implement asset allocation 
changes in a cost effective manner, or reduce transaction costs. 
Under the managers’ investment guidelines, derivatives may 
not be used solely for speculation or leverage. Derivatives are 
to be used only in circumstances where they offer the most 
efficient economic means of improving the risk/reward profile 
of the portfolio.

Fair Value Measurements
As further described in Note 6 Fair Value, GAAP establishes 
the framework for measuring fair value, including a hierarchy 
used to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value.

A description of the valuation methodologies used for assets 
measured at fair value at both December 31, 2017 and 
December 31, 2016 follows:

•  Money market funds are valued at the net asset value 

of the shares held by the pension plan at year end.
•  U.S. government and agency securities, corporate 

debt and common stock are valued at the closing price 
reported on the active market on which the individual 
securities are traded. If quoted market prices are not 
available for the specific security, then fair values are 
estimated by using pricing models or quoted prices of 
securities with similar characteristics. Such securities 
are generally classified within Level 2 of the 
valuation hierarchy but may be a Level 3 depending 

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  129

on the level of liquidity and activity in the market for 
the security.

•  Other investments held by the pension plan include 

derivative financial instruments, which are recorded at 
estimated fair value as determined by third-party 
appraisals and pricing models, and group annuity 
contracts, which are measured at fair value by 
discounting the related cash flows based on current 
yields of similar instruments with comparable 
durations considering the credit-worthiness of the 
issuer. Also included in other investments is preferred 
stock valued at the closing price reported on an active 
market on which the securities are traded.
Investments measured at net asset value include 
collective trust fund investments and limited 
partnerships. Collective trust fund investments are 
valued based upon the units of such collective trust 
fund held by the Plan at year end multiplied by the 
respective unit value. The unit value of the collective 
trust fund is based upon significant observable inputs, 
although it is not based upon quoted marked prices in 
an active market. The underlying investments of the 
collective trust funds consist primarily of equity 

• 

securities, debt obligations, short-term investments, 
and other marketable securities. Due to the nature of 
these securities, there are no unfunded commitments 
or redemption restrictions. Limited partnerships are 
valued by investment managers based on recent 
financial information used to estimate fair value. The 
unit value of limited partnerships is based upon 
significant observable inputs, although it is not based 
upon quoted marked prices in an active market. In 
accordance with ASC 820-10, collective trust fund 
investments and limited partnerships are not classified 
in the fair value hierarchy.

These methods may result in fair value calculations that may 
not be indicative of net realizable values or future fair values. 
Furthermore, while the pension plan believes its valuation 
methods are appropriate and consistent with other market 
participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions 
to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments 
could result in a different fair value measurement at the 
reporting date.

The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Plan’s assets at fair value as of December 31, 2017 and 
2016.

The qualified pension plan contributions are deposited into the Trust, and the qualified pension plan benefit payments are paid from 
the Trust. We do not expect to be required to make a contribution to the qualified plan for 2018 based on the funding calculations 
under the Pension Protection Act of 2006. For the other plans, total contributions and the benefit payments are the same and represent 
expected benefit amounts, which are paid from general assets. Postretirement benefits are net of participant contributions. Estimated 
cash flows reflect the partial funding of postretirement medical and life insurance obligations in the VEBA. 

The components of net periodic benefit cost/(income) and other amounts recognized in Other comprehensive income (OCI) were as 
follows.

The discount rates are determined independently for each plan 
by comparing the expected future benefits that will be paid 
under each plan with yields available on high quality corporate 
bonds of similar duration. For this analysis, 10% of bonds 
with the highest yields and 40% with the lowest yields were 
removed from the bond universe.
 
The expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption 
established by considering historical and anticipated returns of 
the asset classes invested in by the pension plan and the 
allocation strategy currently in place among those classes. For 
purposes of setting and reviewing this assumption, “long- 
term” refers to the period over which the plan’s projected 
benefit obligations will be disbursed. We review this 
assumption at each measurement date and adjust it if 
warranted. Our selection process references certain historical 
data and the current environment, but primarily utilizes 
qualitative judgment regarding future return expectations. We 
also examine the assumption used by other companies with 
similar pension investment strategies. Taking into account all 
of these factors, the expected long-term return on plan assets 
for determining net periodic pension cost for 2017 was 
6.375%. We are reducing our expected long-term return on 
assets to 6.000% for determining pension cost for 2018. This 
decision was made after considering the views of both internal 
and external capital market advisors, particularly with regard 

132    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

to the effects of the recent economic environment on long-
term prospective equity and fixed income returns.

PNC’s net periodic benefit cost recognized for the plans is 
sensitive to the discount rate and expected long-term return on 
plan assets. With all other assumptions held constant, a .5% 
decline in the discount rate would have resulted in an 
immaterial increase in net periodic benefit cost for the 
qualified pension plan in 2017, and to be recognized in 2018. 
For the nonqualified pension plan and postretirement benefits, 
a .5% decline in the discount rate would also have resulted in 
an immaterial increase in net periodic benefit cost.

The health care cost trend rate assumptions shown in Tables 
77 and 78 relate only to the postretirement benefit plans. The 
effect of a one-percentage-point increase or decrease in 
assumed health care cost trend rates would be insignificant.

Defined Contribution Plans
The PNC Incentive Savings Plan (ISP) is a qualified defined 
contribution plan that covers all of our eligible employees. 
Effective January 1, 2015, newly-hired full time employees 
and part-time employees who became eligible to participate in 
the ISP after that date are automatically enrolled in the ISP 
with a deferral rate equal to 4% of eligible compensation in 
the absence of an affirmative election otherwise. Employee 
benefits expense related to the ISP was $125 million in 2017, 
$122 million in 2016 and $126 million in 2015, representing 
cash contributed to the ISP by PNC.

The ISP is a 401(k) Plan and includes an employee stock 
ownership (ESOP) feature. Employee contributions are 
invested in a number of investment options, including pre 
mixed portfolios and individual core funds, available under the 
ISP at the direction of the employee.

NOTE 12 STOCK BASED COMPENSATION PLANS
We have long-term incentive award plans (Incentive Plans) 
that provide for the granting of incentive stock options, 
nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, incentive 
shares/performance units, restricted shares, restricted share 
units, other share-based awards and dollar-denominated 
awards to executives and, other than incentive stock options, 
to non-employee directors. Certain Incentive Plan awards may 
be paid in stock, cash or a combination of stock and cash. We 
typically grant a substantial portion of our stock-based 
compensation awards during the first quarter of each year.

Total compensation expense recognized related to all share-
based payment arrangements was approximately $.2 billion 
during each of 2017, 2016 and 2015. The total tax benefit 
recognized related to compensation expense on all share-based 
payment arrangements was approximately $.1 billion during 
each of 2017, 2016 and 2015. At December 31, 2017, there 
was $.2 billion of unamortized share-based compensation 
expense related to nonvested equity compensation 
arrangements granted under the Incentive Plans. This 
unamortized cost is expected to be recognized as expense over 
a period of no longer than 5 years.

Nonqualified Stock Options
We did not grant any stock options in 2017, 2016 or 2015. 
Generally, options become exercisable in installments after the 
grant date. No option can be exercised after 10 years from its 
grant date. Payment of the option exercise price may be in 
cash or by surrendering shares of common stock at market 
value on the exercise date. The exercise price may also be paid 
by using previously owned shares.

The following table represents the stock option activity for 
2017.

To determine stock-based compensation expense, the grant 
date fair value is applied to the options granted with a 
reduction for estimated forfeitures. We recognize 
compensation expense for stock options on a straight-line 
basis over the specified vesting period.
 
At December 31, 2016 and 2015, options for 3 million and 5 
million shares of common stock were exercisable at a 
weighted-average price of $55.16 and $55.42, respectively. 
The total intrinsic value of options exercised was 
approximately $.1 billion during 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Cash received from option exercises under all Incentive Plans 
was approximately $.1 billion for 2017, 2016 and 2015. The 
tax benefit realized from option exercises under all Incentive 
Plans was insignificant for 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Shares of common stock available during the next year for the 
granting of options and other awards under the Incentive Plans 
were approximately 36 million shares at December 31, 2017. 
Total shares of PNC common stock authorized for future 
issuance under all equity compensation plans totaled 
approximately 37 million shares at December 31, 2017.

During 2017, we issued approximately 2 million common 
shares from treasury stock in connection with stock option 
exercise activity. As with past exercise activity, we currently 
intend to utilize primarily treasury stock for any future stock 
option exercises.

Incentive/Performance Unit Awards and Restricted Share/
Restricted Share Unit Awards
The fair value of nonvested incentive/performance unit awards 
and restricted share/restricted share unit awards is initially 
determined based on prices not less than the market value of 
our common stock on the date of grant with a reduction for 

estimated forfeitures. The value of certain incentive/
performance unit awards is subsequently remeasured based on 
the achievement of one or more financial and other 
performance goals. Additionally, certain incentive/
performance unit awards require subsequent adjustment to 
their current market value due to certain discretionary risk 
review triggers.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of incentive/
performance unit awards and restricted share/restricted share 
unit awards granted in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $122.10, 
$78.37 and $91.57 per share, respectively. The total intrinsic 
value of incentive/performance unit and restricted share/
restricted share unit awards vested during 2017, 2016 and 
2015 was approximately $.2 billion,  $.1 billion and $.2 
billion, respectively. We recognize compensation expense for 
such awards ratably over the corresponding vesting and/or 
performance periods for each type of program.

BlackRock Long-term Incentive Plans (LTIP)
BlackRock adopted the 2002 LTIP program to help attract and 
retain qualified professionals. At that time, we agreed to 
transfer up to four million shares of BlackRock common stock 
to fund a portion of the 2002 LTIP program and future LTIP 
programs approved by BlackRock’s Board of Directors.

In 2009, our obligation to deliver any remaining BlackRock 
common shares was replaced with an obligation to deliver 
shares of BlackRock’s Series C Preferred Stock held by us.

In 2017, we transferred .52 million shares of BlackRock Series 
C Preferred Stock to BlackRock in connection with our 
obligation. At December 31, 2017, we held approximately .25 
million shares of BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock which 
were available to fund our obligations. See Note 23 
Subsequent Events for information on our January 31, 2018 
transfer of 0.1 million shares of the Series C Preferred Stock 
to BlackRock to satisfy a portion of our LTIP obligation.

NOTE 13 FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES

We use derivative financial instruments primarily to help manage exposure to interest rate, market and credit risk and reduce the 
effects that changes in interest rates may have on net income, the fair value of assets and liabilities, and cash flows. We also enter into 
derivatives with customers to facilitate their risk management activities. Derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually 
require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a 
notional amount and an underlying as specified in the contract.

Derivative transactions are often measured in terms of notional amount, but this amount is generally not exchanged and it is not 
recorded on the balance sheet. The notional amount is the basis to which the underlying is applied to determine required payments 
under the derivative contract. The underlying is a referenced interest rate (commonly LIBOR), security price, credit spread or other 
index. Residential and commercial real estate loan commitments associated with loans to be sold also qualify as derivative 
instruments.

The following table presents the notional amounts and gross fair values of all derivative assets and liabilities held by us.

In the first quarter of 2017, PNC changed its accounting treatment for variation margin related to certain derivative instruments cleared through a central clearing house. Previously, 
variation margin was treated as collateral subject to offsetting. As a result of changes made by the clearing house to its rules governing such instruments with its counterparties, effective 
for the first quarter of 2017, variation margin is treated as a settlement payment on the derivative instrument. The impact at December 31, 2017 was a reduction of gross derivative assets 
and gross derivative liabilities by $.8 billion and $.7 billion, respectively. The accounting change had no impact on the net fair value of the derivative assets and liabilities that otherwise 
would have been reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Table 85 for more information.
Includes both residential and commercial mortgage banking activities.
Futures contracts settle in cash daily and, therefore, no derivative asset or derivative liability is recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Includes our obligation to fund a portion of certain BlackRock LTIP programs and the swaps entered into in connection with sales of a portion of Visa Class B common shares.

All derivatives are carried on our Consolidated Balance Sheet 
at fair value. Derivative balances are presented on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet on a net basis taking into 
consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting 
agreements and, when appropriate, any related cash collateral 
exchanged with counterparties. Further discussion regarding 
the offsetting rights associated with these legally enforceable 
master netting agreements is included in the Offsetting, 
Counterparty Credit Risk, and Contingent Features section 
below. Any nonperformance risk, including credit risk, is 
included in the determination of the estimated net fair value of 
the derivatives.

Further discussion on how derivatives are accounted for is 
included in Note 1 Accounting Policies.

Derivatives Designated As Hedging Instruments under 
GAAP
Certain derivatives used to manage interest rate and foreign 
exchange risk as part of our asset and liability risk 
management activities are designated as accounting hedges 
under GAAP. Derivatives hedging the risks associated with 

changes in the fair value of assets or liabilities are considered 
fair value hedges, derivatives hedging the variability of 
expected future cash flows are considered cash flow hedges, 
and derivatives hedging a net investment in a foreign 
subsidiary are considered net investment hedges. Designating 
derivatives as accounting hedges allows for gains and losses 
on those derivatives, to the extent effective, to be recognized 
in the income statement in the same period the hedged items 
affect earnings.

Fair Value Hedges
We enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps to 
hedge changes in the fair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt 
caused by fluctuations in market interest rates. We also enter 
into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swaps and zero-
coupon swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of fixed rate 
and zero-coupon investment securities caused by fluctuations 
in market interest rates. For these hedge relationships, we use 
statistical regression analysis to assess hedge effectiveness at 
both the inception of the hedge relationship and on an ongoing 
basis. There were no components of derivative gains or losses 
excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness for all 
periods presented.

Further detail regarding gains (losses) on fair value hedge derivatives and related hedged items is presented in the following table:

Cash Flow Hedges
We enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps to 
modify the interest rate characteristics of designated 
commercial loans from variable to fixed in order to reduce the 
impact of changes in future cash flows due to market interest 
rate changes. For these cash flow hedges, any changes in the 
fair value of the derivatives that are effective in offsetting 
changes in the forecasted interest cash flows are recorded in 
Accumulated other comprehensive income and are reclassified 
to interest income in conjunction with the recognition of 
interest received on the loans. We use statistical regression 
analysis to assess the effectiveness of these hedge 
relationships at both the inception of the hedge relationship 
and on an ongoing basis.
 

We also periodically enter into forward purchase and sale 
contracts to hedge the variability of the consideration that will 
be paid or received related to the purchase or sale of 
investment securities. The forecasted purchase or sale is 
consummated upon gross settlement of the forward contract 
itself. As a result, hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is typically 
minimal. Gains and losses on these forward contracts are 
recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income and are 
recognized in earnings when the hedged cash flows affect 
earnings.

Derivatives Not Designated As Hedging Instruments under 
GAAP

Residential mortgage loans that will be sold in the secondary 
market, and the related loan commitments, which are 
considered derivatives, are accounted for at fair value. 
Changes in the fair value of the loans and commitments due to 
interest rate risk are hedged with forward contracts to sell 
mortgage-backed securities, as well as U.S. Treasury and 
Eurodollar futures and options. Gains and losses on the loans 
and commitments held for sale and the derivatives used to 
economically hedge them are included in Residential 
mortgage noninterest income on the Consolidated Income 
Statement.

Residential mortgage servicing rights are accounted for at fair 
value with changes in fair value influenced primarily by 
changes in interest rates. Derivatives used to hedge the fair 
value of residential mortgage servicing rights include interest 
rate futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts to purchase 
mortgage-backed securities. Gains and losses on residential 
mortgage servicing rights and the related derivatives used for 
hedging are included in Residential mortgage noninterest 
income.

Commercial mortgage loans held for sale and the related loan 
commitments, which are considered derivatives, are accounted 
for at fair value. Derivatives used to economically hedge these 
loans and commitments from changes in fair value due to 
interest rate risk and credit risk include forward loan sale 
contracts, interest rate swaps, and credit default swaps. Gains 
and losses on the commitments, loans and derivatives are 
included in Other noninterest income. Derivatives used to 
economically hedge the change in value of commercial 
mortgage servicing rights include interest rate futures, swaps 
and options. Gains or losses on these derivatives are included 
in Corporate services noninterest income.

The residential and commercial mortgage loan commitments 
associated with loans to be sold which are accounted for as 
derivatives are valued based on the estimated fair value of the 
underlying loan and the probability that the loan will fund 
within the terms of the commitment. The fair value also takes 
into account the fair value of the embedded servicing right.

We offer derivatives to our customers in connection with their 
risk management needs. These derivatives primarily consist of 
interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, swaptions and 
foreign exchange contracts. We primarily manage our market 
risk exposure from customer transactions by entering into a 
variety of hedging transactions with third-party dealers. Gains 
and losses on customer-related derivatives are included in 
Other noninterest income.

In the 12 months that follow December 31, 2017, we expect to 
reclassify net derivative gains of $102 million pretax, or $81 
million after-tax, from Accumulated other comprehensive 
income to interest income for both cash flow hedge strategies. 
This reclassified amount could differ from amounts actually 
recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-
designations, and the addition of other hedges subsequent to 
December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the maximum 
length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged 
is seven years. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, there were no 
gains or losses from cash flow hedge derivatives reclassified 
to earnings because it became probable that the original 
forecasted transaction would not occur.

There were no components of derivative gains or losses 
excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness related to 
either cash flow hedge strategy for all periods presented.

Further detail regarding gains (losses) on derivatives and 
related cash flows is presented in the following table:

Net Investment Hedges
We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge 
non-U.S. Dollar net investments in foreign subsidiaries against 
adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. We assess whether 
the hedging relationship is highly effective in achieving 
offsetting changes in the value of the hedge and hedged item 
by qualitatively verifying that the critical terms of the hedge 
and hedged item match at the inception of the hedging 
relationship and on an ongoing basis. Net investment hedge 
derivatives are classified as foreign exchange contracts. There 
were no components of derivative gains or losses excluded 
from the assessment of the hedge effectiveness for all periods 
presented. For 2017, 2016 and 2015, there was no net 
investment hedge ineffectiveness. Net gains (losses) on net 
investment hedge derivatives recognized in OCI were $(81) 
million in 2017, $186 million in 2016 and $60 million in 2015.

Included in the customer, mortgage banking risk management, 
and other risk management portfolios are written interest-rate 
caps and floors entered into with customers and for risk 
management purposes. We receive an upfront premium from 
the counterparty and are obligated to make payments to the 
counterparty if the underlying market interest rate rises above 
or falls below a certain level designated in the contract. Our 
ultimate obligation under written options is based on future 
market conditions.

We have entered into risk participation agreements to share 
some of the credit exposure with other counterparties related 
to interest rate derivative contracts or to take on credit 
exposure to generate revenue. The notional amount of risk 
participation agreements sold was $3.6 billion at December 
31, 2017 and $4.3 billion at December 31, 2016. Assuming all 
underlying third party customers referenced in the swap 
contracts defaulted, the exposure from these agreements 
would be $.1 billion at both December 31, 2017 and 
December 31, 2016 based on the fair value of the underlying 
swaps.

Offsetting, Counterparty Credit Risk, and Contingent 
Features
We generally utilize a net presentation on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet for those derivative financial instruments 
entered into with counterparties under legally enforceable 
master netting agreements. The master netting agreements 
reduce credit risk by permitting the closeout netting of all 
outstanding derivative instruments under the master netting 
agreement with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of 
an event of default. The master netting agreement also may 
require the exchange of cash or marketable securities to 
collateralize either party’s net position. In certain cases, 
minimum thresholds must be exceeded before any collateral is 
exchanged. Collateral is typically exchanged daily on 
unsettled positions based on the net fair value of the positions 
with the counterparty as of the preceding day. Collateral 
representing initial margin, which is based on potential future 
exposure, is also required to be pledged by us in relation to 
derivative instruments with central clearing house 
counterparties. Any cash collateral exchanged with 
counterparties under these master netting agreements is also 
netted, when appropriate, against the applicable derivative fair 
values on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. However, the fair 
value of any securities held or pledged is not included in the 
net presentation on the balance sheet. In order for derivative 
instruments under a master netting agreement to be eligible for 

closeout netting under GAAP, we must conduct sufficient 
legal review to conclude with a well-founded basis that the 
offsetting rights included in the master netting agreement 
would be legally enforceable upon an event of default, 
including upon an event of bankruptcy, insolvency, or a 
similar proceeding of the counterparty. Enforceability is 
evidenced by a legal opinion that supports, with sufficient 
confidence, the enforceability of the master netting agreement 
in such circumstances.

Table 85 shows the impact legally enforceable master netting 
agreements had on our derivative assets and derivative 
liabilities as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. 
The table includes cash collateral held or pledged under 
legally enforceable master netting agreements. The table also 
includes the fair value of any securities collateral held or 
pledged under legally enforceable master netting agreements. 
Cash and securities collateral amounts are included in the table 
only to the extent of the related net derivative fair values.

Table 85 includes over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, OTC 
cleared derivatives, and exchange-traded derivatives. OTC 
derivatives represent contracts executed bilaterally with 
counterparties that are not settled through an organized 
exchange or cleared through a central clearing house. The 
majority of OTC derivatives are governed by the International 
Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) documentation or 
other legally enforceable industry standard master netting 
agreements. OTC cleared derivatives represent contracts 
executed bilaterally with counterparties in the OTC market 
that are novated to a central clearing house who then becomes 
our counterparty. Exchange-traded derivatives represent 
standardized futures and options contracts executed directly on 
an organized exchange.

138    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

In addition to using master netting agreements and other 
collateral agreements to reduce credit risk associated with 
derivative instruments, we also seek to manage credit risk by 
evaluating credit ratings of counterparties and by using 
internal credit analysis, limits, and monitoring procedures.

At December 31, 2017, we held cash, U.S. government 
securities and mortgage-backed securities totaling $.9 billion 
under master netting agreements and other collateral 
agreements to collateralize net derivative assets due from 
counterparties, and we pledged cash totaling $1.5 billion under 
these agreements to collateralize net derivative liabilities owed 
to counterparties and to meet initial margin requirements. 
These totals may differ from the amounts presented in the 
preceding offsetting table because these totals may include 
collateral exchanged under an agreement that does not qualify 
as a master netting agreement or because the total amount of 

collateral held or pledged exceeds the net derivative fair 
values with the counterparty as of the balance sheet date due 
to timing or other factors, such as initial margin. To the extent 
not netted against the derivative fair values under a master 
netting agreement, the receivable for cash pledged is included 
in Other assets and the obligation for cash held is included in 
Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Securities 
held from counterparties are not recognized on our balance 
sheet. Likewise securities we have pledged to counterparties 
remain on our balance sheet.

Certain derivative agreements contain various credit-risk 
related contingent provisions, such as those that require our 
debt to maintain a specified credit rating from one or more of 
the major credit rating agencies. If our debt ratings were to fall 
below such specified ratings, the counterparties to the 
derivative instruments could request immediate payment or 
demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization on 
derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate 
fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related 
contingent features that were in a net liability position on 
December 31, 2017 was $1.6 billion for which we had posted 
collateral of  $.8 billion in the normal course of business. The 
maximum additional amount of collateral we would have been 
required to post if the credit-risk-related contingent features 
underlying these agreements had been triggered on 
December 31, 2017 would be $.8 billion.

Each outstanding series of preferred stock other than the 
Series B contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends 
and make other shareholder payments.  Subject to limited 
exceptions, if dividends are not paid on any such series of 
preferred stock, we cannot declare dividends on or repurchase 
shares of our common stock.  In addition, if we would like to 
repurchase shares of preferred stock, such repurchases must be 
on a pro rata basis with respect to all such series of preferred 
stock.

Our Series K preferred stock was issued on May 21, 2008. On 
May 4, 2015, we redeemed all 500,000 depositary shares 
representing interests in our Series K preferred stock and all 
50,000 shares of Series K preferred stock underlying such 
depositary shares, resulting in a net outflow of $500 million.

In February 2018, we redeemed the Series A preferred stock of 
PNC REIT Corp. which had been exchangeable into shares of 
PNC Series H preferred stock under certain conditions relating 
to the capitalization or the financial condition of PNC Bank. 
As described below in the Perpetual Trust Securities portion of 
the Noncontrolling Interests section of this Note, we redeemed 
all $500 million of the PNC Preferred Funding Trust II 
securities that had been exchangeable under certain conditions 
into PNC Series I preferred stock.

Warrants
We had 3.5 million and 11.3 million warrants outstanding as 
of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The reduction 
was due to 7.8 million warrants that were exercised during 
2017. At December 31, 2017, each warrant entitles the holder 
to purchase one share of PNC common stock at an exercise 
price of $67.24 per share. In accordance with the terms of the 
warrants, the warrants are exercised on a non-cash net basis 
with the warrant holder receiving PNC common shares 
determined based on the excess of the market price of PNC 
common stock on the exercise date over the exercise price of 
the warrant. In 2017, we issued 3.5 million common shares 
resulting from the exercise of the warrants. The issuance of 
these shares resulted in a reclassification within Capital 
surplus with no impact on our Shareholders’ equity. These 
warrants were sold by the U.S. Treasury in a secondary public 
offering that closed on May 5, 2010 after the U.S. Treasury 
exchanged its TARP Warrant (issued on December 31, 2008 
under the TARP Capital Purchase Program) for 16.9 million 
warrants. These warrants expire December 31, 2018.

On January 4, 2018, PNC declared a quarterly common stock 
dividend on $.75 per share to shareholders of record as of 
January 17, 2018. In accordance with the terms of the 
warrants, the declaration of a dividend in excess of $.66 per 
share may result in an adjustment to the warrant exercise price 
and to the warrant share number. As a result of this dividend, 
the warrant exercise price was reduced from $67.24 to $67.20 
per share on January 17, 2018 and the warrant share number 
remained 1.00.

Other Shareholders’ Equity Matters
We have a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan. 
Holders of PNC common stock may participate in the plan, 
which provides that additional shares of common stock may 
be purchased at market value with reinvested dividends and 
voluntary cash payments. Common shares issued pursuant to 
this plan were .2 million shares for 2017, .3 million for 2016 
and .3 million for 2015.

At December 31, 2017, we had reserved approximately 92 
million common shares to be issued in connection with certain 
stock plans.

We repurchased 4.4 million shares in 2015 under the stock 
repurchase program that the Board of Directors approved 
effective October 4, 2007. Effective March 31, 2015, the 
Board of Directors terminated this share repurchase program 
and effective April 1, 2015 the Board of Directors replaced it 
with a new stock repurchase program authorization in the 
amount of up to 100 million shares of PNC common stock 
which may be purchased on the open market or in privately 
negotiated transactions. Under this program authorization, we 
repurchased 18.6 million shares in 2017 and 22.8 million 
shares in 2016. A maximum amount of 40.7 million shares 
remained available for repurchase under this program 
authorization at December 31, 2017. This program 
authorization will remain in effect until fully utilized or until 
modified, superseded or terminated.

Noncontrolling Interests

Perpetual Trust Securities
Our noncontrolling interests balance at December 31, 2017 
reflected our March 15, 2017 redemption of $1.0 billion 
Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Exchangeable 
Perpetual Trust Securities issued by PNC Preferred Funding 
Trusts I and II with current distribution rates of 2.61% and 
2.19%, respectively. The Perpetual Trust Securities were 
subject to replacement capital covenants dated December 6, 
2006 and March 29, 2007 benefiting PNC Capital Trust C as 
the sole holder of $200 million of junior subordinated 
debentures issued by PNC in June 1998. Upon redemption of 
the Perpetual Trust Securities, the replacement capital 
covenants terminated and such debentures ceased being 
covered debt with respect to the replacement capital 
covenants.

(a)  Reflected the impact of new federal tax legislation that was enacted on 

December 22, 2017. Certain tax legislation amounts are considered reasonable 
estimates as of December 31, 2017. 

As the result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on 
December 22, 2017, PNC recognized a benefit of $1.2 billion 
primarily attributable to the revaluation of net deferred tax 
liabilities. To the extent our accounting of certain income tax 
effects is complete, these tax effects have been included in the 
financial statements. However, to the extent our accounting for 
certain income tax effects is incomplete, but can be reasonably 
estimated, the estimated effects are included as provisional 
amounts in the financial statements. 

Based on current estimates, any adjustments to provisional 
amounts are not expected to be material during the 
measurement period. However, additional data and analysis is 
being collected in the preparation of our 2017 income tax 
returns which upon completion will validate or cause 
provisional amounts to be adjusted. Furthermore the newly 
enacted law is unclear in certain aspects, and may require 
additional clarification through legislative amendments or 
governmental agency regulations or interpretations.
 
During the one year measurement period, which will end in 
December 2018, the provisional amounts may be adjusted 
upon obtaining, preparing and analyzing additional 
information about facts and circumstances that existed at the 
enactment date.

It is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax 
benefits could increase or decrease in the next twelve months 
due to completion of tax authorities’ exams or the expiration 
of statutes of limitations; however, the estimated amount is 
insignificant.

We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income 
tax in most states and some foreign jurisdictions. Table 96 
summarizes the status of significant IRS examinations of us.

In addition, we are under continuous examinations by various 
state taxing authorities. With few exceptions, we are no longer 
subject to state and local and foreign income tax examinations 
by taxing authorities for periods before 2012. For all open 
audits, any potential adjustments have been considered in 
establishing our unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 
2017.

Our policy is to classify interest and penalties associated with 
income taxes as income tax expense. For 2017 and 2016, the 
amount of gross interest and penalties was insignificant. At 
December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the related 
amounts of accrued interest and penalties was also 
insignificant.

Certain tax legislation amounts are considered reasonable estimates as of 
December 31, 2017.

The majority of the tax credit carryforwards expire in 2032 
and were insignificant at December 31, 2017 and 
December 31, 2016. All federal and most state net operating 
loss and credit carryforwards are from acquired entities and 
utilization is subject to various statutory limitations. We 
anticipate that we will be able to fully utilize our 
carryforwards for federal tax purposes, but we have recorded 
an insignificant valuation allowance against certain state tax 
carryforwards as of December 31, 2017. If select uncertain tax 
positions were successfully challenged by a state, the state net 
operating losses listed in Table 94 could be reduced by an 
insignificant amount.

As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, an insignificant 
amount of taxes have been accrued on unremitted foreign 
earnings. There are no remaining foreign earnings for which 
U.S. deferred taxes have not been provided.

Retained earnings included $.1 billion at both December 31, 
2017 and December 31, 2016 in allocations for bad debt 
deductions of former thrift subsidiaries for which no income 
tax has been provided. Under current law, if certain 
subsidiaries use these bad debt reserves for purposes other 
than to absorb bad debt losses, they will be subject to Federal 
income tax at the current corporate tax rate.

NOTE 18 REGULATORY MATTERS
We are subject to the regulations of certain federal, state, and 
foreign agencies and undergo periodic examinations by such 
regulatory authorities.

The ability to undertake new business initiatives (including 
acquisitions), the access to and cost of funding for new 
business initiatives, the ability to pay dividends, the ability to 
repurchase shares or other capital instruments, the level of 
deposit insurance costs, and the level and nature of regulatory 
oversight depend, in large part, on a financial institution’s 
capital strength.

At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, PNC and 
PNC Bank, our domestic banking subsidiary, were both 
considered “well capitalized,” based on applicable U.S. 
regulatory capital ratio requirements.

The following table sets forth the Transitional Basel III 
regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2017 and

applicable to us during both 2017 and 2016.

The principal source of parent company cash flow is the 
dividends it receives from PNC Bank, which may be impacted 
by the following:

•  Capital needs,
•  Laws and regulations,
•  Corporate policies,
•  Contractual restrictions, and
•  Other factors.

Also, there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the 
ability of national banks to pay dividends or make other 
capital distributions. The amount available for dividend 
payments to the parent company by PNC Bank without prior 
regulatory approval was approximately $1.6 billion at 
December 31, 2017.

Under federal law, a bank subsidiary generally may not extend 
credit to, or engage in other types of covered transactions 
(including the purchase of assets) with, the parent company or 
its non-bank subsidiaries on terms and under circumstances 
that are not substantially the same as comparable transactions 
with nonaffiliates. A bank subsidiary may not extend credit to, 
or engage in a covered transaction with, the parent company or 
a non-bank subsidiary if the aggregate amount of the bank’s 
extensions of credit and other covered transactions with the 
parent company or non-bank subsidiary exceeds 10% of the 
capital stock and surplus of such bank subsidiary or the 
aggregate amount of the bank’s extensions of credit and other 
covered transactions with the parent company and all non-
bank subsidiaries exceeds 20% of the capital stock and surplus 
of such bank subsidiary. Such extensions of credit, with 
limited exceptions, must be at least fully collateralized in 
accordance with specified collateralization thresholds, with the 
thresholds varying based on the type of assets serving as 
collateral. In certain circumstances, federal regulatory 
authorities may impose more restrictive limitations.

Federal Reserve Board regulations require depository 
institutions to maintain cash reserves with a Federal Reserve 
Bank (FRB). At December 31, 2017, the balance outstanding 
at the FRB was $28.3 billion.

NOTE 19 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We establish accruals for legal proceedings, including 
litigation and regulatory and governmental investigations and 
inquiries, when information related to the loss contingencies 
represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is 
probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably 
estimated. Any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as 
appropriate to reflect changed circumstances. When we are 
able to do so, we also determine estimates of possible losses or 
ranges of possible losses, whether in excess of any related 
accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, for 
disclosed legal proceedings (“Disclosed Matters,” which are 
those matters disclosed in this Note 19). For Disclosed Matters 
where we are able to estimate such possible losses or ranges of 
possible losses, as of December 31, 2017, we estimate that it is 
reasonably possible that we could incur losses in excess of 
related accrued liabilities, if any, in an aggregate amount of up 
to approximately $100 million. The estimates included in this 
amount are based on our analysis of currently available 
information and are subject to significant judgment and a 
variety of assumptions and uncertainties. As new information 
is obtained we may change our estimates. Due to the inherent 
subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of 
outcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts accrued or 
included in this aggregate amount may not represent the 
ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings in question. 
Thus, our exposure and ultimate losses may be higher, and 
possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued or this 
aggregate amount.

In our experience, legal proceedings are inherently 
unpredictable. One or more of the following factors frequently 
contribute to this inherent unpredictability: the proceeding is 
in its early stages; the damages sought are unspecified, 
unsupported or uncertain; it is unclear whether a case brought 
as a class action will be allowed to proceed on that basis or, if 
permitted to proceed as a class action, how the class will be 
defined; the other party is seeking relief other than or in 
addition to compensatory damages (including, in the case of 
regulatory and governmental investigations and inquiries, the 
possibility of fines and penalties); the matter presents 
meaningful legal uncertainties, including novel issues of law; 
we have not engaged in meaningful settlement discussions; 
discovery has not started or is not complete; there are 
significant facts in dispute; the possible outcomes may not be 
amenable to the use of statistical or quantitative analytical 
tools; predicting possible outcomes depends on making 
assumptions about future decisions of courts or regulatory 
bodies or the behavior of other parties; and there are a large 
number of parties named as defendants (including where it is 
uncertain how damages or liability, if any, will be shared 
among multiple defendants). Generally, the less progress that 
has been made in the proceedings or the broader the range of 
potential results, the harder it is for us to estimate losses or 
ranges of losses that it is reasonably possible we could incur.

As a result of these types of factors, we are unable, at this 
time, to estimate the losses that are reasonably possible to be 
incurred or ranges of such losses with respect to some of the 

146    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

matters disclosed, and the aggregate estimated amount 
provided above does not include an estimate for every 
Disclosed Matter. Therefore, as the estimated aggregate 
amount disclosed above does not include all of the Disclosed 
Matters, the amount disclosed above does not represent our 
maximum reasonably possible loss exposure for all of the 
Disclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate amount also does 
not reflect any of our exposure to matters not so disclosed, as 
discussed below under “Other.”

We include in some of the descriptions of individual Disclosed 
Matters certain quantitative information related to the 
plaintiff’s claim against us as alleged in the plaintiff’s 
pleadings or other public filings or otherwise publicly 
available information. While information of this type may 
provide insight into the potential magnitude of a matter, it 
does not necessarily represent our estimate of reasonably 
possible loss or our judgment as to any currently appropriate 
accrual.

Some of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may be offset by 
applicable insurance coverage. We do not consider the 
possible availability of insurance coverage in determining the 
amounts of any accruals (although we record the amount of 
related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable up to 
the amount of the accrual) or in determining any estimates of 
possible losses or ranges of possible losses.

Interchange Litigation
Beginning in June 2005, a series of antitrust lawsuits were 
filed against Visa®, MasterCard®, and several major financial 
institutions, including cases naming National City (since 
merged into The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.) and its 
subsidiary, National City Bank of Kentucky (since merged 
into National City Bank which in turn was merged into PNC 
Bank). The plaintiffs in these cases are merchants operating 
commercial businesses throughout the U.S., as well as trade 
associations. Some of these cases (including those naming 
National City entities) were brought as class actions on behalf 
of all persons or business entities that have accepted Visa® or 
MasterCard®. The cases have been consolidated for pre-trial 
proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District 
of New York under the caption In re Payment Card 
Interchange Fee and Merchant-Discount Antitrust 
Litigation (Master File No. 1:05-md-1720-MKB-JO).

In July 2012, the parties entered into a memorandum of 
understanding with the class plaintiffs and an agreement in 
principle with certain individual plaintiffs with respect to a 
settlement of these cases, under which the defendants agreed 
to pay approximately $6.6 billion collectively to the class and 
individual settling plaintiffs and agreed to changes in the terms 
applicable to their respective card networks (including an 
eight-month reduction in default credit interchange rates). The 
parties entered into a definitive agreement with respect to this 
settlement in October 2012. The court granted final approval 
of the settlement in December 2013. Several objectors 
appealed the order of approval to the U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the Second Circuit, which issued an order in June 2016, 
reversing approval of the settlement and remanding for further 

proceedings. In November 2016, the plaintiffs filed a petition 
for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court to 
challenge the court of appeal’s decision. The Supreme Court 
denied the petition in March 2017.

As a result of the reversal of the approval of the settlement, the 
class actions have resumed in the district court. In November 
2016, the district court appointed separate interim class 
counsel for a proposed class seeking damages and a proposed 
class seeking equitable (injunctive) relief. In February 2017, 
each of these counsel filed a proposed amended and 
supplemental complaint on behalf of its respective proposed 
class. These complaints make similar allegations, including 
that the defendants conspired to monopolize and to fix the 
prices for general purpose card network services, that the 
restructuring of Visa and MasterCard, each of which included 
an initial public offering, violated the antitrust laws, and that 
the defendants otherwise imposed unreasonable restraints on 
trade, resulting in the payment of inflated interchange fees and 
other fees, which also violated the antitrust laws. In their 
complaints, collectively the plaintiffs seek, among other 
things, injunctive relief, unspecified damages (trebled under 
the antitrust laws) and attorneys’ fees. PNC is named as a 
defendant in the complaint seeking damages but is not named 
as a defendant in the complaint that seeks equitable relief.

In September 2017, the magistrate judge at the district court 
granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs’ motions to file 
their proposed amended complaints. The dispute over 
amendment arose in part from the decision in United States v. 
American Express, Co., 838 F.3d 179 (2d Cir. 2016), in which 
the court held that the relevant market in a similar complaint 
against American Express is “two-sided,” i.e., requires 
consideration of effects on consumers as well as merchants. In 
October 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a writ of 
certiorari (under the caption Ohio v. American Express Co.) to 
review the court’s decision in American Express. Oral 
argument took place in February 2018. Previously, the 
plaintiffs in this litigation had alleged a one-sided market, and, 
as a result of the court’s decision in American Express, they 
sought leave to add claims based on a two-sided market. The 
order allowed the complaint to be amended to include 
allegations pertaining to a two-sided market only to the extent 
those claims are not time-barred, but held that the two-sided 
market allegations do not relate back to the time of the original 
complaint and are not subject to tolling. In October 2017, the 
plaintiffs appealed this order to the presiding district judge.

National City and National City Bank entered into judgment 
and loss sharing agreements with Visa and certain other banks 
with respect to all of the above referenced litigation. We were 
not originally named as defendants in any of the Visa or 
MasterCard related antitrust litigation nor were we initially 
parties to the judgment or loss sharing agreements. However, 
we became responsible for National City’s and National City 
Bank’s position in the litigation and responsibilities under the 
agreements through our acquisition of National City. In 
addition, following Visa’s reorganization in 2007 in 
contemplation of its initial public offering, U.S. Visa members 
received shares of Class B Visa common stock, convertible 

upon resolution of specified litigation, including the remaining 
litigation described above, into shares of Class A Visa 
common stock, with the conversion rate adjusted to reflect 
amounts paid or escrowed to resolve the specified litigation, 
and also remained responsible for indemnifying Visa against 
the specified litigation. Our Class B Visa common stock is all 
subject to this conversion adjustment provision, and we are 
now responsible for the indemnification obligations of our 
predecessors as well as ourselves. We have also entered into a 
MasterCard Settlement and Judgment Sharing Agreement with 
MasterCard and other financial institution defendants and an 
Omnibus Agreement Regarding Interchange Litigation 
Sharing and Settlement Sharing with Visa, MasterCard and 
other financial institution defendants. The Omnibus 
Agreement, in substance, apportions resolution of the claims 
in this litigation into a Visa portion and a MasterCard portion, 
with the Visa portion being two-thirds and the MasterCard 
portion being one-third. This apportionment only applies in 
the case of either a global settlement involving all defendants 
or an adverse judgment against the defendants, to the extent 
that damages either are related to the merchants’ inter-network 
conspiracy claims or are otherwise not attributed to specific 
MasterCard or Visa conduct or damages. The MasterCard 
portion (or any MasterCard-related liability not subject to the 
Omnibus Agreement) will then be apportioned under the 
MasterCard Settlement and Judgment Sharing Agreement 
among MasterCard and PNC and the other financial institution 
defendants that are parties to this agreement. The 
responsibility for the Visa portion (or any Visa-related liability 
not subject to the Omnibus Agreement) will be apportioned 
under the pre-existing indemnification responsibilities and 
judgment and loss sharing agreements.

Fulton Financial
In 2009, Fulton Financial Advisors, N.A. filed lawsuits against 
PNC Capital Markets, LLC and NatCity Investments, Inc. in 
the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County, 
Pennsylvania arising out of Fulton’s purchase of auction rate 
certificates (ARCs) through PNC and NatCity. In each original 
complaint, Fulton alleged violations of the Pennsylvania 
Securities Act, negligent misrepresentation, negligence, breach 
of fiduciary duty, common law fraud, and aiding and abetting 
common law fraud in connection with the purchase of the 
ARCs by Fulton. Specifically, Fulton alleged that, as a result 
of the decline of financial markets in 2007 and 2008, the 
market for ARCs became illiquid; that PNC and NatCity knew 
or should have known of the increasing threat of the ARC 
market becoming illiquid; and that PNC and NatCity did not 
inform Fulton of this increasing threat, but allowed Fulton to 
continue to purchase ARCs, to Fulton’s detriment. In its 
complaints, Fulton alleged that it then held ARCs purchased 
through PNC for a price of more than $123 million and 
purchased through NatCity for a price of more than $175 
million. In each complaint, Fulton seeks, among other things, 
unspecified actual and punitive damages, rescission, attorneys’ 
fees and interest.

NatCity removed the case against it to the U.S. District Court 
for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Fulton Financial 
Advisors, N.A. v. NatCity Investments, Inc. (No. 5:09-

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  147

cv-04855)), and in November 2009 filed a motion to dismiss 
the complaint. In October 2013, the court granted the motion 
to dismiss with respect to claims under the Pennsylvania 
Securities Act and for negligent misrepresentation, common 
law fraud, and aiding and abetting common law fraud and 
denied the motion with respect to claims for negligence and 
breach of fiduciary duty. Fulton filed an amended complaint in 
December 2013, reasserting its negligence and breach of 
fiduciary duty claims and adding a new claim under the 
Pennsylvania Securities Act. Fulton and NatCity filed motions 
for summary judgment in February 2015. In January 2017, the 
court granted NatCity’s motion for summary judgment with 
respect to the claim under the Pennsylvania Securities Act and 
otherwise denied both Fulton’s and NatCity’s motions.

In November 2017, PNC and Fulton entered into a final 
agreement to settle both of these cases, as a result of which 
these cases are fully resolved. The terms of the settlement 
were not announced. The financial impact of the settlement 
was not material to PNC.

Captive Mortgage Reinsurance Litigation
In December 2011, a lawsuit (White, et al. v. The PNC 
Financial Services Group, Inc., et al. (Civil Action 
No. 11-7928)) was filed against PNC (as successor in interest 
to National City Corporation and several of its subsidiaries) 
and several mortgage insurance companies in the U.S. District 
Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. This lawsuit, 
which was brought as a class action, alleges that National City 
structured its program of reinsurance of private mortgage 
insurance in such a way as to avoid a true transfer of risk from 
the mortgage insurers to National City’s captive reinsurer. The 
plaintiffs allege that the payments from the mortgage insurers 
to the captive reinsurer constitute kickbacks, referral 
payments, or unearned fee splits prohibited under the Real 
Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), as well as 
common law unjust enrichment. The plaintiffs claim, among 
other things, that from the beginning of 2004 until the end of 
2010 National City’s captive reinsurer collected from the 
mortgage insurance company defendants at least $219 million 
as its share of borrowers’ private mortgage insurance 
premiums and that its share of paid claims during this period 
was approximately $12 million. The plaintiffs seek to certify a 
nationwide class of all persons who obtained residential 
mortgage loans originated, funded or originated through 
correspondent lending by National City or any of its 
subsidiaries or affiliates between January 1, 2004 and the 
present and, in connection with these mortgage loans, 
purchased private mortgage insurance and whose residential 
mortgage loans were included within National City’s captive 
mortgage reinsurance arrangements. Plaintiffs seek, among 
other things, statutory damages under RESPA (which include 
treble damages), restitution of reinsurance premiums 
collected, disgorgement of profits, and attorneys’ fees. In 
August 2012, the district court directed the plaintiffs to file an 
amended complaint, which the plaintiffs filed in September 
2012. In November 2012, we filed a motion to dismiss the 
amended complaint. The court dismissed, without prejudice, 
the amended complaint in June 2013 on statute of limitations 
grounds. A second amended complaint, in response to the 

148    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

court’s dismissal order, was filed in July 2013. We filed a 
motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, also in July 
2013. In August 2014, the court denied the motion to dismiss. 
We then filed an uncontested motion to stay all proceedings 
pending the outcome of another matter then on appeal before 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that involves 
overlapping issues. In September 2014, the district court 
granted the stay. In October 2014, the court of appeals decided 
that other matter, holding that the RESPA claims in that case 
were barred by the statute of limitations. We then filed a 
motion for reconsideration of the denial of our motion to 
dismiss in light of the court of appeals’ decision. In January 
2015, the district court denied our motion. In March 2015, the 
parties stipulated to, and the court ordered, a stay of all 
proceedings pending the outcome of a new other matter 
currently on appeal before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Third Circuit that also involves overlapping issues. In 
February 2016, the court of appeals in the other matter issued 
a decision favorable to our position.

In September 2016, the plaintiffs moved to lift the stay and for 
permission to file a Third Amended Class Action Complaint to 
add claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt 
Organizations Act (RICO) and to assert that the RESPA claim 
is not barred by the statute of limitations under the “continuing 
violations doctrine” because every acceptance of a reinsurance 
premium is a new occurrence for these purposes. In January 
2017, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion to amend to add a 
RICO claim, but granted their motion permitting them to rely 
on the continuing violations doctrine to assert claims under 
RESPA. We moved to certify this issue for interlocutory 
appeal to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and 
sought a stay in the district court pending an appeal.  Although 
the district court certified the issue for immediate interlocutory 
appeal in March 2017 and stayed the action, the court of 
appeals shortly thereafter declined to accept the appeal. As a 
result proceedings have resumed in the district court. 

Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Indemnification 
Demands
We have received indemnification demands from several 
entities sponsoring residential mortgage-backed securities and 
their affiliates where purchasers of the securities have brought 
litigation against the sponsors and other parties involved in the 
securitization transactions. National City Mortgage had sold 
whole loans to the sponsors or their affiliates that were 
allegedly included in certain of these securitization 
transactions. According to the indemnification demands, the 
plaintiffs’ claims in these lawsuits are based on alleged 
misstatements and omissions in the offering documents for 
these transactions. The indemnification demands assert that 
agreements governing the sale of these loans or the 
securitization transactions to which National City Mortgage 
was a party require us to indemnify the sponsors and their 
affiliates for losses suffered in connection with these lawsuits. 
The parties have settled several of these cases. There has not 
been any determination that the parties seeking 
indemnification have any liability to the plaintiffs in the other 
lawsuits and the amount, if any, for which we are responsible 
in the settled cases has not been determined.

Patent Infringement Litigation
In June 2013, a lawsuit (Intellectual Ventures I LLC and 
Intellectual Ventures II LLC vs. PNC Financial 
Services Group, Inc., and PNC Bank, NA, (Case No. 2:13-
cv-00740-AJS)(IV 1)) was filed in the U.S. District Court for 
the Western District of Pennsylvania against PNC and PNC 
Bank for patent infringement. The plaintiffs allege that 
multiple systems by which PNC and PNC Bank provide online 
banking services and other services via electronic means 
infringe five patents owned by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs 
seek, among other things, a declaration that PNC and PNC 
Bank are infringing each of the patents, damages for past and 
future infringement, and attorneys’ fees. In July 2013, we filed 
an answer with counterclaims, denying liability and seeking 
declarations that the asserted patents are invalid and that PNC 
has not infringed them. In November 2013, PNC filed 
Covered Business Method/Post Grant Review petitions in the 
U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (PTO) seeking to invalidate 
all five of the patents. In December 2013, the court dismissed 
the plaintiffs’ claims as to two of the patents and entered a stay 
of the lawsuit pending the PTO’s consideration of PNC’s 
review petitions, including any appeals from decisions of the 
PTO. The PTO instituted review proceedings in May 2014 on 
four of the five patents at issue, finding that the subject matter 
of those patents was “more likely than not” unpatentable. The 
court had previously dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims with 
respect to the one patent not selected for review by the PTO. 
In separate decisions issued in April and May 2015, the PTO 
invalidated all claims with respect to the patents that were still 
at issue in IV 1. In July 2015, in an appeal arising out of 
proceedings against a different defendant relating to some of 
the same patents, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal 
Circuit affirmed the invalidity of the two patents at issue in 
both IV 1 and the Federal Circuit appeal. As a result, all of the 
patents at issue in IV 1 not subject to the prior dismissal have 
been invalidated. In October 2015, the plaintiffs moved to 
dismiss with prejudice their claims arising from the patents 
that had not been subject to prior dismissal in IV 1, which the 
court granted.

In June 2014, Intellectual Ventures filed a second lawsuit 
(Intellectual Ventures I LLC and Intellectual Ventures II LLC v. 
PNC Bank Financial Services Group, Inc., PNC Bank NA, and 
PNC Merchant Services Company, LP (Case No. 2:14-
cv-00832-AKS)(IV 2)) in the same court as IV 1. This lawsuit 
alleges that PNC defendants infringed five patents, including 
the patent dismissed in IV 1 that is not subject to PTO review, 
and relates generally to the same technology and subject 
matter as the first lawsuit. The court has stayed this case, 
which was consolidated with IV 1 in August 2014, pending the 
PTO’s consideration of various review petitions of the patents 
at issue in this case, as well as the review of the patents at 
issue in IV 1 and the appeals from any PTO decisions. In April 
2015, the PTO, in a proceeding brought by another defendant, 
upheld the patentability of one of the patents at issue in IV 2. 
That decision was appealed to the Federal Circuit, which 
affirmed it in February 2016. After decisions adverse to the 
patent holder in the PTO and several U.S. District Courts on 
three of the remaining patents, in October 2015, the plaintiffs 
voluntarily dismissed without prejudice their claims with 

respect to those three patents, leaving two patents at issue in 
this lawsuit. The plaintiffs moved to deconsolidate IV 1 and IV 
2 and to lift the stay. The court denied this motion in October 
2015, continuing the stay until certain court proceedings 
against other defendants related to the same patents are 
resolved.

Mortgage Repurchase Litigation
In December 2013, Residential Funding Company, LLC 
(RFC) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District 
of Minnesota against PNC Bank, as alleged successor in 
interest to National City Mortgage Co., NCMC Newco, Inc., 
and North Central Financial Corporation (Residential Funding 
Company, LLC v. PNC Bank, N.A., et al. (Civil No. 13-3498- 
JRT-JSM)). In its complaint, RFC alleged that PNC Bank 
(through predecessors) sold $6.5 billion worth of residential 
mortgage loans to RFC during the timeframe at issue 
(approximately May 2006 through September 2008), a portion 
of which were allegedly materially defective, resulting in 
damages and losses to RFC. RFC alleged that PNC Bank 
breached representations and warranties made under seller 
contracts in connection with these sales. The complaint 
asserted claims for breach of contract and indemnification. 
RFC sought, among other things, monetary damages, costs, 
and attorney’s fees. In March 2014, we filed a motion to 
dismiss the complaint. RFC then filed an amended complaint. 
In April 2014, we moved to dismiss the amended complaint. 
In October 2014, the court granted our motion to dismiss with 
prejudice the breach of contract claims in the complaint with 
respect to loans sold before May 14, 2006 and otherwise 
denied our motion to dismiss. In January 2015, the lawsuit 
was consolidated for pre-trial purposes with other lawsuits 
pending in the District of Minnesota filed by RFC against 
other originators of mortgage loans that it had purchased. The 
consolidated action is captioned In Re: RFC and RESCAP 
Liquidating Trust Litigation (Civil File No. 13-cv-3451 (SRN/
JJK/HB)). In September 2015, RFC filed a motion for leave to 
file a second amended complaint to add claims based on an 
asserted principle that loan sellers had a continuing contractual 
obligation to provide notice of loan defects, which RFC claims 
should allow it to assert contract claims as to pre-May 14, 
2006 loans notwithstanding the prior dismissal of those claims 
with prejudice. In November 2015, the court granted RFC’s 
motion, and RFC filed its second amended complaint 
thereafter.

In January 2017, the ResCap Liquidating Trust (RLT) filed a 
lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota 
against PNC Bank, as successor in interest to Community 
Bank of Northern Virginia (CBNV) (ResCap Liquidating Trust 
v. PNC Bank, N.A. (No. 17-cv-196-JRT-FLN)). In its 
complaint, the RLT alleged that PNC Bank (as successor to 
CBNV) sold over 21,300 mortgage loans to RFC, with an 
original principal balance in excess of $789 million, which 
were included in RFC-sponsored RMBS trusts for which 
liabilities were settled in RFC’s bankruptcy. The RLT alleged 
that PNC Bank (as successor to CBNV) materially breached 
its representation and warranties made to RFC in connection 
with the sale of the loans, resulting in damages and losses to 
RFC. The complaint asserted claims for breach of contract and 

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K  149

indemnification and seeks, among other things, monetary 
damages, costs, and attorney’s fees. The action was 
consolidated for pre-trial purposes into In Re: RFC and 
RESCAP Liquidating Trust Litigation.

In March 2017, we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. In 
July 2017, the court denied our motion to dismiss. 

In November 2017, we entered into a final agreement with 
RFC and the RLT to settle both of these cases, as a result of 
which the cases are fully resolved. The terms of the settlement 
were not announced. The financial impact of the settlement 
was not material to PNC. 

Pre-need Funeral Arrangements
National City Bank and PNC Bank are defendants in a lawsuit 
filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of 
Missouri under the caption Jo Ann Howard and Associates, 
P.C., et al. v. Cassity, et al. (No. 4:09-CV-1252-ERW) arising 
out of trustee services provided by Allegiant Bank, a National 
City Bank and PNC Bank predecessor, with respect to 
Missouri trusts that held pre-need funeral contract assets. 
Under a pre-need funeral contract, a customer pays an amount 
up front in exchange for payment of funeral expenses 
following the customer’s death. In a number of states, 
including Missouri, pre-need funeral contract sellers are 
required to deposit a portion of the proceeds of the sale of pre-
need funeral contracts in a trust account.

The lawsuit was filed in August 2009 by the Special Deputy 
Receiver for three insolvent affiliated companies, National 
Prearranged Services, Inc. a seller of pre-need funeral 
contracts (NPS), Lincoln Memorial Life Insurance Company 
(Lincoln), and Memorial Service Life Insurance Company 
(Memorial). Seven individual state life and health insurance 
guaranty associations, who claim they are liable under state 
law for payment of certain benefits under life insurance 
policies sold by Lincoln and Memorial, and the National 
Organization of Life & Health Guaranty Associations have 
also joined the action as plaintiffs. In addition to National City 
Bank and PNC Bank (added following filing of the lawsuit as 
successor-in-interest to National City Bank) (the PNC 
defendants), other defendants included members of the Cassity 
family, who controlled NPS, Lincoln, and Memorial; officers 
and directors of NPS, Lincoln, and Memorial; auditors and 
attorneys for NPS, Lincoln, and Memorial; the trustees of each 
of the trusts that held pre-need funeral contract assets; and the 
investment advisor to the Pre-need Trusts. NPS retained 
several banks to act as trustees for the trusts holding NPS pre-
need funeral contract assets (the NPS Trusts), with Allegiant 
Bank acting as one of these trustees with respect to seven 
Missouri NPS Trusts. All of the other defendants have settled 
with the plaintiffs, are otherwise no longer a party to the 
lawsuit, or are insolvent.

In their Third Amended Complaint, filed in 2012 following the 
granting by the court in part of motions to dismiss made by the 
PNC defendants and the other NPS Trust trustees, the 
plaintiffs allege that Allegiant Bank breached its fiduciary 
duties and acted negligently as the trustee for the Missouri 

150    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-K

NPS Trusts. In part as a result of these breaches, the plaintiffs 
allege, members of the Cassity family, acting in concert with 
other defendants, were able to improperly remove millions of 
dollars from the NPS Trusts, which in turn caused NPS, 
Lincoln, and Memorial to become insolvent. The complaint 
alleges $600 million in present and future losses to the 
plaintiffs due to the insolvency of NPS, Lincoln, and 
Memorial. The lawsuit seeks, among other things, unspecified 
actual and punitive damages, various equitable remedies 
including restitution, attorneys’ fees, costs of suit and interest.

In July 2013, five of the six defendants in a parallel federal 
criminal action, including two members of the Cassity family, 
entered into plea agreements with the U.S. to resolve criminal 
charges arising out of their conduct at NPS, Lincoln and 
Memorial. In August 2013, after a jury trial, the sixth 
defendant, the investment advisor to the NPS Trusts, was 
convicted on all criminal counts against him. The criminal 
charges against the defendants alleged, among other thing, a 
scheme to defraud Allegiant Bank and the other trustees of the 
NPS Trusts.

In May 2014, the court granted the plaintiffs’ motion to 
disallow the PNC defendants’ affirmative defense relating to 
the plaintiffs’ alleged failure to mitigate damages. In July 
2014, the PNC defendants’ motion for reconsideration was 
denied. In September 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion 
seeking leave to amend their complaint to reassert aiding and 
abetting claims, previously dismissed by the court in 2012. 
The court denied this motion in December 2014. Also in 
December 2014, the court granted in part and denied in part 
the PNC defendants’ motion for summary judgment.

In March 2015, following a jury trial, the court entered a 
judgment against the PNC defendants in the amount of $356 
million in compensatory damages and $36 million in punitive 
damages. In April 2015, the plaintiffs filed motions with the 
court seeking $179 million in pre-judgment interest. Also, in 
April 2015, the PNC defendants filed motions with the court 
to reduce the compensatory damages by the amounts paid in 
settlement by other defendants, to strike the punitive damages 
award, for judgment as a matter of law, and for a new trial. In 
November 2015, the court granted the motion to reduce the 
compensatory damages by amounts paid in settlement by other 
defendants and denied the other motions by the PNC 
defendants, with the judgment being reduced as a result to a 
total of $289 million, and also denied the plaintiffs’ motion for 
pre-judgment interest. 

In December 2015, the PNC defendants appealed the 
judgment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 
Also in December 2015, the plaintiffs cross-appealed from the 
court's orders reducing the judgment by amounts paid in 
settlement by other defendants, denying plaintiffs’ motion for 
pre-judgment interest, and dismissing the plaintiffs’ aiding and 
abetting claims. In August 2017, the court of appeals reversed 
the judgment to the extent that it was based on tort rather than 
trust law. The court accordingly held that any damages 
awarded to the plaintiff will be limited to losses to the trusts in 
Missouri caused by Allegiant’s breaches during the time it 

acted as trustee; plaintiffs cannot recover for damages to the 
Missouri trusts after Allegiant’s trusteeship or outside of the 
Missouri trusts, which had been included in the judgment 
under appeal. The court of appeals otherwise affirmed the 
judgment, including the dismissal of the aiding and abetting 
claims, and remanded the case to the district court for further 
proceedings in light of its decision. In September 2017, 
plaintiffs filed a motion for rehearing by the panel solely 
seeking to remove the prohibition on damages being sought 
for the period following Allegiant’s trusteeship. In December 
2017, the court denied the petition for rehearing. Proceedings 
have resumed in the district court.

DD Growth Premium Master Fund
In June 2014, the liquidators of the DD Growth Premium 
Master Fund (DD Growth) issued a Plenary Summons in the 
High Court, Dublin, Ireland, in connection with the provision 
of administration services to DD Growth by a European 
subsidiary (GIS Europe) of PNC Global Investment Servicing 
(PNC GIS), a former subsidiary of PNC. The Plenary 
Summons was served on GIS Europe in June 2015.

In July 2010, we completed the sale of PNC GIS to The Bank 
of New York Mellon Corporation (BNY Mellon). Beginning in 
February 2014, BNY Mellon has provided notice to us of three 
indemnification claims pursuant to the stock purchase 
agreement related to DD Growth. Our responsibility for this 
litigation is subject to the terms and limitations included in the 
indemnification provisions of the stock purchase agreement.

In its Statement of Claim, which the liquidator served in July 
2015, the liquidator alleges, among other things, that GIS 
Europe breached its contractual duties to DD Growth as well 
as an alleged duty of care to DD Growth, and to investors in 
DD Growth, and makes claims of breach of the administration 
and accounting services agreement, breach of the middle 
office agreement, negligence, gross negligence, and breach of 
duty. The statement of claim further alleges claims for loss in 
the net asset value of the fund and loss of certain subscriptions 
paid into the fund in the amounts of $283 million and $134 
million respectively. The statement of claim seeks, among 
other things, damages, costs, and interest. 

Other Regulatory and Governmental Inquiries
We are the subject of investigations, audits, examinations and 
other forms of regulatory and governmental inquiry covering a 
broad range of issues in our consumer, mortgage, brokerage, 
securities and other financial services businesses, as well as 
other aspects of our operations. In some cases, these inquiries 
are part of reviews of specified activities at multiple industry 
participants; in others, they are directed at PNC individually. 
From time to time, these inquiries involve or lead to regulatory 
enforcement actions and other administrative proceedings, and 
may lead to civil or criminal judicial proceedings. Some of 
these inquiries result in remedies including fines, penalties, 
restitution, or alterations in our business practices, and in 
additional expenses and collateral costs and other 
consequences. Such remedies and other consequences are not 
typically material to us from a financial standpoint, but may be 

and, even if not, may result in significant reputational harm or 
other adverse collateral consequences.

• 

In April 2011, as a result of a publicly-disclosed 
interagency horizontal review of residential mortgage 
servicing operations at fourteen federally regulated 
mortgage servicers, The PNC Financial Services 
Group, Inc. entered into a consent order with the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
and PNC Bank entered into a consent order with the 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. 
Collectively, these consent orders describe certain 
foreclosure-related practices and controls that the 
regulators found to be deficient and require The PNC 
Financial Services Group, Inc. and PNC Bank to, 
among other things, develop and implement plans and 
programs to enhance our residential mortgage 
servicing and foreclosure processes, retain an 
independent consultant to review certain residential 
mortgage foreclosure actions, take certain remedial 
actions, and oversee compliance with the orders and 
the new plans and programs. In early 2013, The PNC 
Financial Services Group, Inc. and PNC Bank, along 
with twelve other residential mortgage servicers, 
reached agreements with the OCC and the Federal 
Reserve to amend these consent orders.

In June 2015, the OCC issued an order finding that 
PNC Bank had satisfied all of its obligations under 
the OCC’s 2013 amended consent order and 
terminating PNC Bank’s 2011 consent order and 2013 
amended consent order. 

In January 2018, the Federal Reserve issued an order 
terminating The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.'s 
2011 consent order and 2013 amended consent order. 
In connection with this termination, the Federal 
Reserve assessed a $3.5 million civil money penalty 
against The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

•  We received subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney’s 
Office for the Southern District of New York. The 
first two subpoenas, served in 2011, concern National 
City Bank’s lending practices in connection with 
loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration 
(FHA) as well as certain non-FHA-insured loan 
origination, sale and securitization practices. A third, 
served in 2013, seeks information regarding claims 
for costs that are incurred by foreclosure counsel in 
connection with the foreclosure of loans insured or 
guaranteed by FHA, FNMA or FHLMC. We are 
cooperating with the investigations.

Our practice is to cooperate fully with regulatory and 
governmental investigations, audits and other inquiries, 
including those described in this Note 19.

Other
In addition to the proceedings or other matters described 
above, PNC and persons to whom we may have 
indemnification obligations, in the normal course of business, 
are subject to various other pending and threatened legal 
proceedings in which claims for monetary damages and other 
relief are asserted. We do not anticipate, at the present time, 
that the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of such 
other legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on 
our financial position. However, we cannot now determine 
whether or not any claims asserted against us or others to 
whom we may have indemnification obligations, whether in 
the proceedings or other matters described above or otherwise, 
will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in any future reporting period, which will depend on, among 
other things, the amount of the loss resulting from the claim 
and the amount of income otherwise reported for the reporting 
period.

Commitments to Extend Credit
Commitments to extend credit, or net unfunded loan 
commitments, represent arrangements to lend funds or provide 
liquidity subject to specified contractual conditions. These 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates, may 
require payment of a fee, and contain termination clauses in 
the event the customer’s credit quality deteriorates.

Net Outstanding Standby Letters of Credit
We issue standby letters of credit and share in the risk of 
standby letters of credit issued by other financial institutions, 
in each case to support obligations of our customers to third 
parties, such as insurance requirements and the facilitation of 
transactions involving capital markets product execution. 
Approximately 91% and 94% of our net outstanding standby 
letters of credit were rated as Pass as of December 31, 2017 
and December 31, 2016, respectively, with the remainder rated 
as Below Pass. An internal credit rating of Pass indicates the 
expected risk of loss is currently low, while a rating of Below 
Pass indicates a higher degree of risk.

If the customer fails to meet its financial or performance 
obligation to the third party under the terms of the contract or 
there is a need to support a remarketing program, then upon a 
draw by a beneficiary, subject to the terms of the letter of 
credit, we would be obligated to make payment to them. The 
standby letters of credit outstanding on December 31, 2017 
had terms ranging from less than one year to seven years.

As of December 31, 2017, assets of $1.3 billion secured 
certain specifically identified standby letters of credit. In 
addition, a portion of the remaining standby letters of credit 
issued on behalf of specific customers is also secured by 
collateral or guarantees that secure the customers’ other 
obligations to us. The carrying amount of the liability for our 
obligations related to standby letters of credit and 
participations in standby letters of credit was $.2 billion at 
December 31, 2017 and is included in Other liabilities on our 
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

NOTE 22 SEGMENT REPORTING
Effective for the first quarter of 2017, as a result of changes to 
how we manage our businesses, we realigned our segments 
and, accordingly, have changed the basis of presentation of our 
segments, resulting in four reportable business segments:

•  Retail Banking
•  Corporate & Institutional Banking
•  Asset Management Group
•  BlackRock

Results of individual businesses are presented based on our 
internal management reporting practices. There is no 
comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for 
management accounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the 
financial results of our individual businesses are not 
necessarily comparable with similar information for any other 
company. We periodically refine our internal methodologies as 
management reporting practices are enhanced. To the extent 
significant and practicable, retrospective application of new 
methodologies is made to prior period reportable business 
segment results and disclosures to create comparability with 
the current period. 

Net interest income in business segment results reflects our 
internal funds transfer pricing methodology. Assets receive a 
funding charge and liabilities and capital receive a funding 
credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that 
incorporates product repricing characteristics, tenor and other 
factors. Effective for the first quarter of 2017, we made certain 
adjustments to our internal funds transfer pricing methodology 
primarily relating to weighted average lives of certain non-
maturity deposits based on our recent historical experience. 
These changes in methodology affected business segment 
results, primarily adversely impacting net interest income for 
Corporate & Institutional Banking and Retail Banking, offset 
by increased net interest income in the “Other” category.

All prior periods presented were revised to conform to the new 
segment alignment and to our change in internal funds transfer 
pricing methodology. 

Our business segment results reflect the allocation of the 
impact of the new tax legislation to our business segments, 
primarily the revaluation of the net deferred tax positions 
allocated to the segments. Certain tax legislation amounts are 
considered reasonable estimates as of December 31, 2017. See 
Note 17 Income Taxes for additional details. 

Total business segment financial results differ from total 
consolidated net income. The impact of these differences is 
reflected in the “Other” category in the business segment 
tables. “Other” includes residual activities that do not meet the 
criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such 
as asset and liability management activities including net 
securities gains or losses, other-than-temporary impairment of 
investment securities, certain trading activities, certain non-
strategic runoff consumer loan portfolios, private equity 
investments, intercompany eliminations, most corporate 
overhead, tax adjustments that are not allocated to business 

segments, gains or losses related to BlackRock transactions, 
integration costs, exited businesses, and differences between 
business segment performance reporting and financial 
statement reporting (GAAP), including the presentation of net 
income attributable to noncontrolling interests as the 
segments’ results exclude their portion of net income 
attributable to noncontrolling interests. Assets, revenue and 
earnings attributable to foreign activities were not material in 
the periods presented for comparative purposes. 

Financial results are presented, to the extent practicable, as if 
each business operated on a stand-alone basis. Additionally, 
we have aggregated the results for corporate support functions 
within “Other” for financial reporting purposes. 

Our allocation of the costs incurred by shared support areas 
not directly aligned with the businesses is primarily based on 
the use of services. 

A portion of capital is intended to cover unexpected losses and 
is assigned to our business segments using our risk-based 
economic capital model, including consideration of the 
goodwill at those business segments as well as the 
diversification of risk among the business segments, 
ultimately reflecting our portfolio risk adjusted capital 
allocation. 

We have allocated the allowances for loan and lease losses and 
for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit based on 
the loan exposures within each business segment’s portfolio. 
Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and 
are influenced by observed changes in loan portfolio 
performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower 
and economic conditions. Key reserve assumptions are 
periodically updated.

overall revenue diversification. BlackRock is a publicly-traded 
company, and additional information regarding its business is 
available in its filings with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC). At December 31, 2017, our economic 
interest in BlackRock was 22%. We received cash dividends 
from BlackRock of $354 million, $331 million, and $320 
million during 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.

(a)  Nonaccrual loans are included in loans, net of unearned income. The impact of financial derivatives used in interest rate risk management is included in the interest income/

expense and average yields/rates of the related assets and liabilities. Basis adjustments related to hedged items are included in noninterest-earning assets and noninterest-
bearing liabilities. Average balances of securities are based on amortized historical cost (excluding adjustments to fair value, which are included in other assets). Average 
balances for certain loans and borrowed funds accounted for at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in Noninterest income, are included in noninterest-earning 
assets and noninterest-bearing liabilities.

(b)  Loan fees for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $126 million, $137 million and $106 million, respectively.
(c) 

Interest income calculated as taxable-equivalent interest income. To provide more meaningful comparisons of interest income and yields for all interest-earning assets, as 
well as net interest margins, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margin by increasing the interest income 
earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP. See Reconciliation 
of Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income in this Statistical Information section for more information.

returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest income, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis by increasing the 
interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP. As a 
result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted into law during the fourth quarter of 2017, the statutory tax rate for corporations was lowered to 21% from 35%, 
effective January 1, 2018. As such, beginning in 2018, our taxable-equivalent adjustments will be calculated using this lower statutory tax rate.

TRANSITIONAL BASEL III AND PRO FORMA FULLY PHASED-IN BASEL III COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIOS 
(NON-GAAP) – 2013-2016 PERIODS
Our regulatory risk-based ratios for 2014 through 2016 were calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-
weighted assets, and the definitions of, and deductions from, regulatory capital under the Basel III rules (as such definitions and 
deductions were phased-in for 2014 through 2016). We refer to the capital ratios calculated using the phased-in Basel III provisions 
in effect for those periods and, for the risk-based ratios, standardized approach risk-weighted assets as the Transitional Basel III 
ratios.

(b)  Basel III capital ratios and estimates may be impacted by additional regulatory guidance or analysis, and, in the case of those ratios calculated using the advanced 
approaches, may be subject to variability based on the ongoing evolution, validation and regulatory approval of our models that are integral to the calculation of

(e)  Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets are based on the Basel III advanced approaches rules, and include credit, market and operational risk-weighted 

assets. During the parallel run qualification phase we have refined the data, models and internal processes used as part of the advanced approaches for determining risk-
weighted assets. Refinements implemented in the fourth quarter of 2015 reduced estimated Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets. We anticipate additional 
refinements to this estimate through the parallel run qualification phase.

ITEM 9A – CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER 
FINANCIAL REPORTING
The management of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. 
and subsidiaries (PNC) is responsible for establishing and 
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, 
as such term is defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).

Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial 
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods 
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

We performed an evaluation under the supervision and with 
the participation of our management, including the Chairman, 
President and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice 
President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of 
PNC’s internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2017. This assessment was based on criteria for 
effective internal control over financial reporting described in 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission. Based on this assessment, management 
concluded that PNC maintained effective internal control over 
financial reporting as of December 31, 2017.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered 
public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial 
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 
included in this Report, has also audited the effectiveness of 
PNC’s internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2017. The report of PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP is included under Item 8 of this Report.
DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND 
CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL 
REPORTING
As of December 31, 2017, we performed an evaluation under 
the supervision and with the participation of our management, 
including the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer 
and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, 
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our 
disclosure controls and procedures and of changes in our 
internal control over financial reporting.

Based on that evaluation, our Chairman, President and Chief 
Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief 
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and 
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities 
and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective as of 
December 31, 2017, and that there has been no change in 
PNC’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred 
during the fourth quarter of 2017 that has materially affected, 
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control 
over financial reporting.

because they have no exercise price.

(2) – Of this total, the following amounts relate to the 2016 
Incentive Award Plan (2016 Incentive Plan), approved by 
shareholders on April 26, 2016:  1,326,972 are stock-payable

Under both the 2016 Incentive Plan and the 2006 Incentive 
Plan (for incentive performance unit awards under each) upon 
achievement of performance goals and other conditions above 
target level, payment is made in cash share equivalents, up to a
