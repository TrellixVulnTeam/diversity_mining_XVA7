A Hurricane Harvey 
orthopaedic success story

As Hurricane Harvey barreled toward Houston, 
Texas, St. Joseph Medical Center prepared for 
the worst. The staff’s stamina would be severely 
tested over the next five days, as historic amounts 
of rain pummeled the area, sending scores of 
desperate people to the hospital.

One such patient, Taylor Koob, 
arrived by ambulance with a 
shattered ankle and floodwater-
soaked gashes on his leg. The 
25-year-old had narrowly escaped  
from his submerged Jeep by 
kicking out the windshield.

With the water coming in so 
fast, “I knew my only option 
was, I kick out this window or 
I die,” Taylor says. “That’s when 
everything goes blank.” He’s 
still not sure how he got out 
of the Jeep.

Houston firefighters from a 
nearby station eventually found 
him bobbing in the floodwaters. 
But because of the intense 
downpour, it took eight hours 
to make the 11-mile trek to the 
hospital, beginning on a city 
dump truck used to transport 
people in high-water conditions 
and continuing by rescue boat 
and ambulance.

Five surgeries and  
an external fixator
Taylor’s leg was so seriously 
injured that he required five 
surgeries, a significant amount 
of antibiotics and a month of 
recuperation at the hospital.

Key to this treatment was 
Stryker’s Hoffmann 3 Modular 

External Fixation system, frame 
components used in conjunction 
with Apex Pins to stabilize the 
open and/or unstable fracture. 
Made of lightweight carbon-
based materials, the product 
is designed to address patient 
comfort while postoperative 
corrections and treatments 
for soft-tissue damage can 
be performed with the frame 
in place. 

In the tense situation at the  
hospital, Stryker’s representatives  
communicated regularly with 
Taylor’s team of physicians on 
adjusting the frame, given the 
serious nature of his injuries, 
according to Dr. Rosemary 
Buckle, an orthopaedic surgeon 
who played an instrumental role 
in Taylor’s treatment. “I rely on 
my team at Stryker to have what 
I need for my patients,” she says. 
“Without them, I can’t do what 
I need to do.”

Nearly a week after his arrival 
at the hospital, Taylor returned 
to the operating room, where 
Dr. Buckle cleaned his ankle 
wounds and cultured them for 
signs of bacteria, which she 
would need to eliminate before 
she inserted Stryker’s plates 
and screws to repair the bone. 
Dr. Buckle also was concerned 

about infection over the long 
term, because Taylor’s open 
wounds had been exposed 
to contaminated water for 
several hours.

After his hospital stay, Taylor 
was able to go home and continue  
with antibiotic treatment for 
several weeks before Dr. Buckle 
removed the frame. Taylor was 
then able to receive physical 
therapy to restore his strength 
and range of motion. While his  
doctors still monitor him for  
infection, they expect him  
to make a full recovery.

“I can’t say enough about  
the doctors who saved  
my life,” Taylor says. 
“Every time I see 
Dr. Buckle, I just 
smile.” Noting 
how lucky he is, 
he displays his 
Hoffmann External 
Fixator in his house,  
as a reminder of 
his ordeal.

Stryker 2017 Annual Review    1

Dear  
shareholders,

We delivered another strong year  
of financial results in 2017 and 
continue to strengthen our position  
as a leader in Orthopaedics,  
Medical and Surgical (MedSurg),  
and Neurotechnology and Spine.

We achieved significant milestones, 
surpassing $12 billion in sales for 
the first time, recording our 38th 
consecutive year of sales growth and 
again earning accolades as a great 
place to work. 

Culture and leadership
Our culture defines us and sets us 
apart. We are guided by our uni-
fying mission: Together with our 
customers, we are driven to make 
healthcare better; and by our values: 
Integrity, Accountability, People and 
Performance. We attract people who 
align with these qualities and who are 
humble and hard-working. In addition 
to being honored again by FORTUNE’s 
100 Best Companies to Work For (U.S.), 
we were recognized as a World’s Great 
Place to Work and a Great Place to 
Work for Women. Our customer focus 
is evident in our operating model of 
decentralized businesses, supported 
by strong corporate functions.

Our leadership team had one addition 
in 2017, Graham McLean, President of 
Asia Pacific, and our longest-standing 
director, Howard Cox, announced his 
retirement from our Board after 
44 years of service. Howard has made 
immense contributions to Stryker, 
dating back to before we were listed 
as a public company in 1979. In 
recognition of his contributions, we 
named him Director Emeritus. We also 
added Mary Brainerd, a director of 
Bremer Bank and former CEO of Health 
Partners, to our Board.

Financial performance 
Our organic sales growth of 7.1 percent 
(which excludes the impact of acquisi-
tions and foreign currency exchange) 
was once again at the high end of the 
medical technology industry. Our 
reported sales growth was 9.9 percent, 
including 2.7 percent growth from 
acquisitions as the impact of foreign 
currency exchange was nominal. While

our reported net earnings declined 
38.1 percent due to significant one- 
time charges related to U.S. tax 
reform legislation, we delivered 
strong adjusted net earnings growth 
of 12.3 percent.

We continued to generate healthy 
operational cash flow that contributed  
to a year-end cash and marketable 
securities position of $2.8 billion, 
enabling us to increase our dividend 
rate by 11 percent for the January 
2018 payment.

Successes and challenges
In 2017, our growth was well 
balanced across businesses and 
geographies. We generated double-
digit organic growth in Endoscopy, 
Neurotechnology, and Trauma & 
Extremities in the United States. 
We also had strong performances 
in Joint Replacement, Instruments 
and categories within Medical 
(EMS and Acute Care). Europe, 
Canada and Australia continued 
to perform well, and we had 
encouraging performances in 
emerging markets. 

We maintained our commitment  
to R&D, spending 6.3 percent of  
sales, and successfully introduced 
a number of products, including 
the full launch of the robotic-arm 
assisted Mako Total Knee application 
and System 8 power tools. We also 
continued to be acquisitive, including 
NOVADAQ, which provides advanced 
imaging for our Endoscopy business, 
and Entellus, a deal that closed in 
the first quarter of 2018 and will 
strengthen our Instruments business 
through expansion of our Ear, Nose 
and Throat (ENT) portfolio.

We also weathered some storms 
this past year, both literally and 
figuratively. The hurricane season 
in the United States and Caribbean 
islands had a meaningful impact 

on our manufacturing facility in 
Puerto Rico and affected business 
in Florida and Houston. We also 
managed through significant 
regulatory challenges with Sage 
Products, a part of our Medical 
business, that required a product 
recall and lengthy product holds  
on the majority of its portfolio.

I would like to acknowledge the 
way our employees rallied in the face 
of these challenges to support each 
other and minimize the impact on our 
customers. We recovered well from 
both issues by the end of the year 
and expect only modest headwinds 
to linger into 2018.

Cost transformation 
Our efforts to systematically reduce 
costs, which is a multi-year process, 
continue to progress. We are focused 
on product-line rationalization; 
indirect procurement optimization; 
global enterprise resource planning 
(ERP) system implementation; 
shared services transformation; and 
manufacturing-site consolidation. 

Looking ahead
Stryker continues to have a bright 
future. We remain confident in our 
ability to grow sales at the high end 
of the medical technology industry, 
while driving leveraged earnings. 
Our strategy, people and culture will 
enable us to maintain our strong 
performance in the years ahead, 
which is evident in our financial 
guidance for 2018.

I would like to thank our manage-
ment teams, our Board of Directors, 
and our 33,000 employees worldwide 
who make healthcare better each 
and every day.

Enhancing 
patient care

Our mission is clear: “Together with our customers, 
we are driven to make healthcare better” through 
collaboration, innovative technologies and 
our commitment to successful patient outcomes.

A miracle rescue

When paramedics in Gloucester, 
Massachusetts, arrived on the scene, they 
didn’t know they were about to lead one 
of the most dramatic lifesaving rescues of 
their careers. 

Responding to a 911 call about a man who 
had collapsed and stopped breathing while 
at work, veteran firefighter-paramedics 
Doug Sherman and Jack Brancaleone 
found a police officer performing CPR on 
a 56-year-old who was in cardiac arrest. 

In less than a minute, Sherman and 
Brancaleone placed a LUCAS 2 Chest 
Compression System on the patient 
to assist with CPR. The battery-powered 
device is designed to maintain a steady 
flow of oxygen to the heart and brain 
through uninterrupted chest compressions.

The LUCAS 3 Chest Compression System

6

The first responders kept the patient 
alive for more than three hours, from 
the time he first received treatment 
through his time at Addison Gilbert 
Hospital. At the hospital, Sherman 
and Brancaleone stayed on the scene 
to help with treatment and make sure 
the LUCAS device remained powered 
at all times. The treatment included 
delivering some 20 defibrillation 
shocks to restore the patient’s heart 
to a normal rhythm. This required the 
use of four new batteries, each lasting 
45 minutes. 

When the patient was finally stabi-
lized, he was flown to Lahey Hospital 
& Medical Center in Burlington for 
 continued treatment. The patient 
made a full recovery and was released 
approximately two weeks later.

As it turns out, the case set the record 
for the longest continual usage of the 
LUCAS device in Massachusetts and 
New England —  and the second longest 
documented save with continual use 
in the country.

The LUCAS Chest Compression System 
standardizes chest compressions in 
accordance with the latest scientific 
guidelines, providing the same quality 
for all patients, independent of 
transport conditions, rescuer fatigue 
or variability in the experience level of 
the caregiver. This frees up rescuers to 
focus on other lifesaving tasks. Studies 
show that the controlled mechanical 
LUCAS compressions can sustain a 
higher blood flow to the brain and heart 
compared to manual compressions.1

Setting a record  
in tight corners
“The patient’s survival would not 
have been possible without the 
LUCAS Chest Compression System,” 
says Sherman. “Even after five or 
10 minutes, paramedics doing manual 
CPR get tired, and it’s almost impossible 
to keep up, especially when we’re 
moving the patient.”

“And with the LUCAS, there’s no 
interference with the other tasks 
we’re performing, like supplying 
medications intravenously, which we 
often do in tight quarters or in a high-
speed ambulance where paramedics 
can get hurt.”

“This case and several others we’ve 
been involved with prove that LUCAS 
saves lives. Patients who might not 
have made it were able to go home to 
their families,” says Fire Department 
Captain Jamie Santos. “That’s why we 
have them in each of our ambulances 
and two more in the engine company.”

“It was a team effort from the very 
beginning,” Gloucester Fire Chief Eric 
Smith adds. “We are so grateful to 
have the LUCAS device at our disposal, 
as it provides nonstop compressions. 
Coupled with the high quality of care, 
this patient is alive today.”

“The patient’s  
survival would not 
have been possible 
without the LUCAS 
Chest Compression  
System.”

Mako System creating  
the future of hip and knee 
replacement surgeries

Mako Robotic-Arm Assisted Surgery 
features three phases —  enhanced 
planning, dynamic joint balancing 
and robotic-arm assisted bone prepa-
ration. The Mako System aims to 
aid surgeons in achieving functional 
implant positioning for patients, 
which occurs when the surgeon places 
the hip or knee implant, using Mako, 
according to the pre-operative plan. 

Applications are available for Mako 
Total Hip, Partial Knee and Total 
Knee Surgery. Through 2017, more 
than 125,000 Mako procedures had 
been performed, including nearly 
16,000 Mako Total Knee surgeries.1

Launched in 2017, Mako Total 
Knee has already achieved several 
milestones. In November, we added 

a cementless option —  Mako Total 
Knee with Triathlon Tritanium —  
combining three of our most innovative 
technologies: Mako, our Triathlon 
single-radius design, and  additive- 
manufactured Tritanium. 

Also in 2017, the first clinical 
outcomes data on Mako Total Knee 
were detailed in The Journal of Knee 
Surgery by lead author Robert C. 
Marchand, M.D. This single-center 
prospective study, performed at a 
high-volume hospital, showed Mako 
Total Knee had significantly lower 
mean pain (p=<0.05) and mean total 
patient satisfaction scores (p=<0.05), 
indicating greater patient satisfaction 
and clinical outcome for the Mako 
cohort compared to manual TKA.2 

“The feedback  
I’m getting as I  
take a patient 
through a dynamic 
arc of motion is 
something we’ve 
never had before.”

Allowing surgeons 
to see and do more

Statistics show that roughly one in eight 
women in the United States will develop 
breast cancer in her lifetime. In fact, about 
266,120 new cases of invasive breast cancer 
will be diagnosed in American women this 
year.1 These are just a few of the reasons 
why Stryker, a leader in advanced imaging 
and O.R. connectivity, acquired NOVADAQ. 
NOVADAQ’s SPY fluorescence imaging 
technology allows surgeons to visualize 
real-time tissue perfusion during a range 
of procedures, including mastectomy and 
breast reconstruction. 

NOVADAQ’s innovative SPY technology not 
only complements Stryker’s advanced imaging 
products, its use in breast reconstruction has 
been shown to reduce postoperative compli-
cations —  which can occur in up to 31 percent 
of cases.2,3 Studies have also indicated that 
the use of SPY may result in lower costs to 
hospitals.4

More than 250 clinical articles support the 
use of SPY technology in a variety of surgical 
procedures. Of the multiple clinical studies, 
more than 40 feature the economic and 
clinical benefits of using SPY during breast 
reconstruction.5

“Fluorescence imaging is like having a GPS 
system during surgery,” says Dr. Santiago 
Horgan, from the School of Medicine & Center 
for the Future of Surgery at the University 
of California, San Diego. “It will become the 
standard of care.”

New facilities help drive innovation

We have built or are in the process 
of building several new facilities to 
accelerate the development of product 
innovations. These strategic invest-
ments are being made responsibly 
and in alignment with our company 
strategy, which includes a long- 
standing commitment to innovation 
and an intense focus on the needs of 
our customers.

Investments include a new Salt Lake 
City facility that not only manufactures 
specialized products used to treat 
strokes but also houses a state-of-the-
art Neurovascular Learning Center 
to train physicians from around the 
world. Product assembly, R&D and 
engineering personnel are based there.

We also launched a global technology 
development center and centralized 
additive technology manufactur-
ing hub, the AMagine Institute, in 
Carrigtwohill, Cork, Ireland. Since 
2001, we have invested in additive 
manufacturing and collaborated with 
top Ph.D. programs at leading uni-
versities in the United Kingdom to 
industrialize 3D porous printing for 
the healthcare industry.

In addition, we built sales and customer 
experience offices, designed to deepen 
customer relationships, in San Jose, 
California; Cary, Illinois; Flower Mound, 
Texas; Hamilton, Ontario, Canada; Italy; 
Singapore; South Korea and Thailand.

Other facilities currently under 
construction include:

• A new 120,000-square-foot 

corporate office for our Canada 
business will serve as our 
local hub. The move will bring 
together employees who have 
been spread across three facilities 
and is expected to take place in 
September 2018.

• A 485,000-square-foot research 
and development center for our 
Instruments business in Portage, 
Michigan, expected to be completed 
in late 2019. The facility will 
feature a customer experience 
center, showroom, and R&D and 
bio-skills labs, with space for 
sales, marketing and support 
functions. The new facility will 
encourage collaboration and 
communication among product 
and marketing teams. 

• The Freiburg Innovation Center is 

expected to open in Germany in 
2018 and will host R&D teams from 
five divisions under one roof. We 
designed the building to maximize 
collaboration and bring innovative 
products and technology platforms 
to market faster.

Additive  
manufacturing

3D printing —  also known as additive 
manufacturing (AM) —  is one of our 
pillars of innovation in Orthopaedics. 
This technique takes a computer 
model of a medical device and grows 
the part layer by layer in a three-
dimensional environment, fusing 
one layer of fine metal powder to the 
previous layers.

Through AM, we design and bring 
to market novel implants for the knee, 
spine and hip. We are investing for 
the future with this technology —  
expanding R&D, opening new facilities, 
collaborating with other industry 
leaders like GE Additive and launching 
new products.

Since 2001, we have invested in addi-
tive manufacturing with academic 
research institutions, initially to 
find a scalable model for controlling 
solid and porous metal zones during 
production. In 2012, we validated the 
large-scale manufacturing capabilities 
of our proprietary process: AMagine.

AMagine encompasses everything 
from the creative implant design 
to our patented Tritanium porous 
metal geometry, SOMA data inputs, 
production set-up, and numerous 
in-process quality controls —  elements 
that differentiate our process from 
3D printing alone.

The result of years of foresight, hard 
work and innovation: unique Tritanium 
implants that can be made only with 
additive manufacturing by Stryker.

Commercial launches

Since 2014, we have led the industry 
with a steady commercial output of 
additive manufactured Tritanium 
implants across multiple indications.

The international medical charity Operation Smile has provided hundreds 
of thousands of free surgeries for children and young adults in developing 
countries who are born with cleft lip, cleft palate or other facial deformities.

In addition to our product donations, which help Operation Smile deliver 
safe and effective surgical care for these young patients, our financial 
contributions help it expand surgical services and conduct targeted education 
programs for surgeons in countries that critically lack trained healthcare 
professionals and surgical specialists.

Building surgical capacity

Operation Smile has been able to leverage our support to expand educational 
and training programs for surgeons and maximize its impact on local health 
systems in marginalized communities across the globe.

To learn how our support helped triple the number of cleft care providers in 
Rwanda, visit Smile.Stryker.com.

Providing crucial nonmedical support

We also sponsor groups of Stryker employees as nonmedical mission volun-
teers. In November 2017, eight employees traveled to Managua, Nicaragua, 
as part of a team of 97 volunteers from around the world who comforted and 
supported patients and their families before, during and after 116 surgeries 
performed over five days.

“As a volunteer, you are able to follow the entire cycle of emotions that  
these families experience firsthand,” says Kris Sanders, a Senior Business 
Program Manager. “The process is so personal, and there aren’t words  
for the joy and happiness that these parents display when they first see  
their child [after surgery].”

Raising funds

Meanwhile, our employees back home volunteer to raise funds each year 
for Operation Smile programs. In 2017, they raised nearly $55,000, with the 
company providing a dollar-for-dollar match.

“With success 
comes responsibility.”

After 44 years of distinguished service, Howard E. Cox, Jr. has 
decided to retire from our Board of Directors. Because of Howard’s 
immense contributions to Stryker — since before it was a publicly 
traded company to its current position as a leading global medical 
technology firm — he will be named Director Emeritus.  
 
Stryker’s Board and management team sincerely appreciate 
Howard’s unwavering dedication, his more than four decades 
of service and his championing of our growth ambitions and 
consistent success. On behalf of the Board and everyone at Stryker, 
we wish him all the best and salute him for his wisdom and 
guidance in helping Stryker deliver on its mission.
