In the face of accelerating change,
it’s easy to forget that what matters 
most to customers remains the 
same as ever.

Family. Opportunity. Simplicity. 
Peace of mind.

What matters most to customers hasn’t changed.
It’s how we help them achieve it that’s changing 
and driving the future. Theirs and ours.

Leading to new solutions that meet and engage 
them where they are – and where they’re going. 
That move and inspire them to take greater 
control of their financial futures. And that enable 
us to reach millions of new customers in growing 
middle-class markets around the world.

We invest in what matters most, so we can 
deliver what matters most to our customers 
and shareholders.

2017 was a very good year for Principal.

We delivered record results and double-digit 
growth, with $2.3 billion in net income available 
to common stockholders and $1.5 billion in 
non-GAAP operating earnings.

Strong asset appreciation combined with solid 
net cash flows enabled us to increase assets under 
management by $77 billion, or 13 percent, to a 
record $669 billion at year-end.

We remain pleased with our investment
performance, with more than 80 percent of
our options1 in the top two Morningstar
quartiles for the five-year period, including
more than 50 percent in the top quartile.

1 Principal actively managed mutual funds, exchange traded funds, insurance separate accounts, and collective  
  investment trusts. Based on performance as of Dec. 31, 2017.

We continued to make meaningful investments 
across our businesses to expand and enhance our 
customer solution set, broaden distribution, and 
improve the customer experience, positioning 
Principal for future growth and success.

During the year, we also committed $180 million to 
acquisitions2 and returned more than $730 million 
to shareholders through common stock dividends 
and buybacks, reflecting strong capital generation 
and balanced deployment.

is that we helped 
people through 
some of the most 
challenging times in 
their lives.

From the chairman, president, and chief executive officer

To our shareholders

2017 was our 138th year in business. It was a year of strong growth for Principal, but more 
importantly, a year of meaningful progress. Progress meeting customer needs and solving their 
problems. Progress delivering education and tools that remove barriers to customer action.  
Progress promoting the importance of investment diversification, savings discipline, and risk 
protection. Progress advocating for pension systems that enable people around the world to 
maintain their lifestyle in retirement. Progress on the things that matter most.  

While a company’s longevity can speak volumes, the four largest companies in the world by 
market cap – Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon – are just 125 years old combined.1
These relative newcomers have created exceptional shareholder value by creating exceptional 
customer value. They’ve demonstrated to the world the importance of vision and creativity; 
of going forward, unconstrained by past formulas for success, and dedicated to innovating in 
ways that truly benefit customers.

Today, more than ever, Principal is re-imagining its future, with technology investment at the 
forefront. Undoubtedly, we’re continuing to invest in areas that improve efficiency, making us 
more cost competitive. But more importantly, we’re accelerating our investment in technology 
that: enables us to create new solutions; makes us more accessible to customers; and improves 
the customer experience overall, while protecting customer data and privacy. Ultimately, by 
enabling us to put more people around the world on the path to financial security, these 
investments will also enable us to create long-term value for our shareholders. 

Becoming the company
Competitors – traditional and emerging – are working hard, every day, to create something 
better for customers. Industries are being disrupted, and clearly, longevity alone is not enough. 
Customer-driven innovation is the key to ongoing success. Which means every day, Principal 
must continue to evolve.

We must continue becoming the company that is at the forefront of building something better 
– better guidance, better solutions, better experiences. Better at helping people achieve their 
financial goals. Here are some of the things that we accomplished in 2017 to do just that, and to 
differentiate ourselves in this rapidly changing world. 

New solutions
Customer needs can vary dramatically based on countless factors, including life stage, risk 
tolerance, and financial literacy. Our evolution, from product manufacturer to solutions 
provider, reflects our recognition that we must meet a broader range of needs and anticipate 
where demand is going. We have to do more and be more for our customers. With the needs of 
individuals, retirement, and institutional investors all top of mind, we continued to expand and 
enhance our investment platforms in three key areas in 2017:

1 As of Dec. 31, 2017

6

•  Outcomes-based funds, with a particular focus on income solutions 
•  Alternative investments, to enhance diversification and help manage downside risk
•  Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and collective investment trusts (CITs), to provide 
  cost-effective alternatives to pure passive management 

We launched more than 50 new funds in total in Southeast Asia, China, and Latin America 
during the year to address growing local demand for multi-asset and income generating 
solutions. On our U.S. platform, we launched more than a dozen new investment options, 
including seven ETFs. This brings us to a dozen ETF strategies in the market as of year-end.  
Our ETF franchise surpassed both the $1 billion and $2 billion milestones in 2017, moving 
us into the top 30 as of year-end. 

Importantly, we continued to deliver strong investment performance. Throughout the year, 
we received dozens of best fund awards – in Chile, China, Hong Kong, India, Europe, Malaysia, 
Mexico, and the U.S. – from organizations including Bloomberg, Morningstar, and Thomson 
Reuters Lipper. Just after year-end, Principal Millennials ETF made Investment News’ list of 
best performing International ETFs, topping the World Large Stock category with a 41 percent 
gain for the year.

More. Easier. Better.
Too many people around the world are under-saved, under-insured, and unadvised. To be part 
of the solution, we have to provide education, guidance, and advice. We have to address how 
future generations will buy financial services. We have to make it easier for people to save and 
protect their assets. We must continue to help advisors serve their clients. But at the same time, 
we must also help individuals and business owners who are trying to figure it out on their own.  
During the year, we advanced these efforts in a number of important ways.

Accelerated underwriting (AU): We made an important enhancement to the AU program in 
our life insurance business. Beyond eliminating intrusive, time-consuming steps like lab testing 
and medical exams for eligible applicants, further automation of our rules allows for immediate 
review of applications. Some applications can now be approved within minutes, compared to 
traditional underwriting, which can take weeks, making this a true breakthrough for customers 
and advisors alike.

Digital sales and advice: We launched a fully digital pension product platform in Brazil (which 
after regulatory approval, will be owned through a joint venture with BB Seguridade). This is 
just a prelude to a much broader effort by Principal to introduce digital platforms that: 
•  support advisors as they seek asset allocation models to use in portfolio construction, and
•  support individuals through understandable, affordable, direct-to-consumer solutions for  
  protection, retirement, and other long-term savings needs.

Driving retirement readiness: In 2017, we launched a new account aggregation tool. 
This provides plan participants a more holistic view of their finances and a more accurate 
estimation of the income they will have in retirement. We also launched a first-of-its-kind 
retirement modeling planner. Using real-time data, plan sponsors and advisors can assess 
plan health, see how plan design features impact participant retirement readiness, and 
estimate costs associated with changes to plan design.

7

Going mobile: With a projected 6 billion smartphones in circulation by 2020,2 mobile features 
are clearly critical to delivering a better customer experience. In 2017, we rolled out a number 
of new features including text alerts so retirement plan participants can receive automatic 
updates on the status of a loan or distribution request. Mobile rollouts planned for 2018 
include investment transfers, contribution changes, withdrawals, and onboarding for newly 
eligible participants. 

Multi-channel, multi-product distribution: In 2017, we continued to make our investment 
offerings more accessible to investors through placements on third party platforms, model 
portfolios, and recommended lists. In total, we earned 72 placements, adding more than 40 
different options to more than two dozen different distribution platforms with success across 
asset classes. At year-end, our top 10 firms averaged more than 5.5 products per platform.  
And we added several key distribution relationships during the year, most notably, Alibaba.  

What matters most
For all our accomplishments, what matters most is that we helped people through some of 
the most challenging times in their lives. And we helped people achieve financial progress they 
might have had difficulty attaining on their own. In 2017, we provided monthly income to nearly 
50,000 disabled workers (more than $400 million in total), and to more than 200,000 retirees in 
the U.S., Latin America, and Asia (more than $1.2 billion in total). We paid more than $1 billion 
in death benefits on nearly 13,000 claims. We helped more than 15 million people around the 
world save/invest for retirement and other long-term needs, through employer sponsored 
retirement plans and retail mutual funds. Over the course of the year, those individuals saw 
their assets appreciate by some $60 billion.

Competitive and environmental challenges remain, but we go forward from a position of 
strength, with excellent fundamentals and the benefit of broad diversification. And we go 
forward increasingly well-positioned to: 
•  compete in asset management globally, in retirement and long-term savings in the U.S.,  
  Latin America, and Asia, and insurance in the U.S.,
•  capitalize on growing demand associated with a thriving U.S. small- to medium-sized 
  business market, emerging middle-class populations, aging populations, and longer life 
  expectancies, and
•  continue to build momentum in 2018, and for that momentum to translate into long-term  
  shareholder value.        

On behalf of Principal, my sincere thanks for your continued support. We’ll continue to strive to 
become an even stronger organization for you and each of our stakeholders.

Management 
continues to take 
appropriate actions 
to further 
strengthen its 
competitive 
positioning.

From the Board of Directors

To our shareholders

To create long-term shareholder value in a rapidly changing world, management must continuously 
address new challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities. As your board of directors, we take our 
responsibilities, which include oversight of management’s strategy and succession, very seriously, and we 
are committed to representing your interests. On behalf of the board, I’m pleased to provide an update on 
our key areas of focus and to share some thoughts on company performance.

Strategic oversight: The board not only evaluates strategy, but also shares perspectives, provides advice, 
and monitors and assesses management’s implementation of our chosen strategy. Each quarter, as well 
as at our annual strategy retreat with management, we discuss and debate topics critical to long-term 
success. At our 2017 retreat, we focused on global growth and capital planning. This involved looking at 
key challenges, opportunities, and risks created by changing customer expectations, demographic shifts, 
further expansion of a global middle class, technology (including Principal’s digital transformation), and 
industry regulation. Management continues to evolve and refine company strategy, invest in growth, and 
take appropriate actions to further strengthen its competitive positioning.

Risk oversight: We have a coordinated, comprehensive approach to overseeing the company’s enterprise 
risk management. The board regularly reviews strategic threats, opportunities, and key risks, including 
financial, product, cybersecurity, regulatory, and reputational risk, as well as new exposures that could 
potentially emerge in the future. Both your board and management are fully engaged in risk 
management and have made it a fundamental aspect of company strategy, operations, and culture. 

Talent and succession planning: Our role in talent and succession planning applies to both company 
leadership and the board. In February 2017, as part of a planned succession, Deanna Strable transitioned 
from president of U.S. Insurance Solutions to chief financial officer, replacing Terry Lillis. Amy Friedrich 
succeeded Deanna as president of U.S. Insurance Solutions in May 2017, after serving as senior vice 
president and head of Specialty Benefits Insurance.

In October 2017, Diane Nordin, former partner at Wellington Management Company, LLP,  joined the 
Principal board. She brings over 30 years’ experience in investment management, with expertise in product 
management, client relationship management, strategic planning, and operations. We are committed to 
regular board refreshment and continue to strive for balance between introducing new perspectives and 
maintaining continuity. Our board now includes 11 independent directors with broad expertise, skills, and 
viewpoints to help the company advance and execute its strategy. The board values diversity in all aspects 
including gender, race, age, and experience. Five of our 11 independent directors are women.

Company performance: The board remains focused on sustainable performance. We, too, were pleased 
with performance in 2017, but even more so with long-term growth. Since 2012, the company has 
increased assets under management by more than $265 billion or 66 percent. This has helped drive 
13 percent compounded annual growth in earnings per share over the past five years. Again, through 
strategic investment, the company continues to make important strides in meeting customers’ needs.

Thank you for your continued support and for the opportunity to serve as your lead director. 
Please contact me with your questions, thoughts, and opinions at principal.com/contactliz.

Sincerely, 

Elizabeth Tallett
Lead director, Principal Financial Group

Customer first

Bringing the
voice of the 
customer to 
everything 
we do.

Our customers are the reason we exist. So we work to listen and understand their 
needs, challenges, and motivations with more than academic interest. Real life 
input from employers, advisors, plan participants, and retail customers guides 
our work at every level of the organization.

We gather broad customer knowledge, trends, and insights through third-party 
research and studies commissioned by partner organizations. This data provides 
directional value. But it’s the work of our internal research teams that brings us 
ever closer to our customers.

Our opt-in Customer Community enables us to quickly gather key information on a 
variety of topics from nearly 1,300 individuals who use our products and services. 
We regularly segment and poll the group through online surveys, chats, and phone 
interviews. We use their input to vet everything from product design to education 
and marketing approaches. We listen, understand, and move forward, together. 

Our success with this customer group will soon lead to the creation of an Employer 
Community that will bring deeper knowledge and immediacy to our work with 
businesses and plan sponsors.

The habits and interests of younger customers, who are now early in their 
retirement journeys, are already impacting our industry. In 2017, we studied more 
than 1,500 millennial and Gen X plan participants who are saving at high levels. 
The goal was to discover motivations that can be used to help other young 
participants engage and succeed in saving for retirement. It turns out that parents 
still hold a great influence on savings habits. So does the prospect of having the 
income to live a good life in retirement. Young savers are willing to make sacrifices. 
They’re also willing to help others, with six out of 10 teaching family and friends 
how to become better savers.

The use of technology and rich data is reshaping our industry. But drilling through 
the numbers to uncover real customers’ needs and preferences is what drives our 
future. And theirs.

12

Reimagined solutions

Being there 
when they 
need us 
is only 
the beginning.

Anyone can make a connection. It’s how you engage that produces results and 
true relationships. That’s why we seek to understand and be inspired by our 
customers. To rethink how we design the experiences and solutions that they 
desire. To satisfy their needs. And to create relevant conversations that help 
them live their best lives.

Our customer insights and innovation team works across our global enterprise to 
reframe business challenges and engagement opportunities, putting customers at 
the center. The process evolves through a series of focused conversations guided 
by human-centered design experts. The result is new, often surprising, solutions 
that work for both the customers and our business, with immediate, near-term, 
and future action plans created.

This approach was used to create a new strategy for engaging Hispanic 
participants in our 401(k) plans. Hispanics comprise the largest, fastest-growing 
ethnic population in the United States. But a disproportionate number do not 
actively participate in any form of retirement saving. Human-centered design 
conversations revealed that the problem wasn’t a lack of financial discipline. 
Deeper cultural issues were in play,  centered on the concept of family helping 
family. Simply repackaging English materials into Spanish wasn’t the answer. 

Using human-centered design, we reimagined an enrollment and participation 
experience that would resonate specifically with Hispanic workers. We built 
culturally relevant practices and solutions around their needs, families, and future 
– including an interactive digital experience, in-language education and enrollment 
tools, and bicultural support specialists. And we’re already seeing significant 
growth in both plan engagement and saving.

The team is also working on projects to enhance and reinvent relationships with 
advisors, plan sponsors, retail customers, and alliance firms in the United States 
and around the world. Through developmental internships with Principal employees 
from our global business units, as well as university partnerships, we are seeding 
the human-centered design philosophy across the enterprise.

14

Intuitive technology

Engaging 
and 
inspiring,
creating magic
and momentum.

Here’s the sad truth about retirement readiness: Most people aren’t on track to 
achieve it. Many procrastinate. Others aren’t sure what to do. Some participate, 
but save too little, not understanding the value of their company’s match. More 
than a few simply don’t expect to retire at all.

But we’re proving that little pushes and simplified choices can produce significant 
momentum – especially when combined with plan design best practices, intuitive 
technology, and close working relationships with plan sponsors.

Our first-of-its-kind retirement modeling planner assesses plan design options 
in real time. It’s designed to help plan sponsors make decisions that can lead to 
better participant outcomes. For instance, we know that automatic enrollment is 
important. So is a starting deferral rate of 6 percent, rising to 10 percent over time. 
Surprisingly, most employees agree. And the journey begins. Interactive, engaging 
My Virtual Coach conversations provide help to participants along the way. On 
their smartphone or tablet. Whenever they want to engage. And our experts are 
never more than a phone call away to provide deep knowledge, understanding, 
and support.

So how do these tools and best practices work in real life? Movement Mortgage 
has grown from four to 4,000 employees in 10 short years. The company is fully 
engaged in guiding their people, mostly Gen Y and millennials, to long-term 
financial security. In 2017, they partnered with Principal to help take their plan to 
the next level. They created a contest to drive employees to complete a retirement 
checkup on principal.com and engage in My Virtual Coach conversations. Nearly a 
third of their participants increased deferral after having access to their Retirement 
Wellness Score and Planner. By the end of the year, plan participation grew from 
88 percent to 97 percent – with more than 60 percent of participants on track to 
replace at least 50 percent of their income in retirement.

Clearly, our commitment to best practices is producing satisfying results. People 
who enroll through My Virtual Coach are five times more likely to contribute 
10 percent or more of their salary than those who enroll through other methods.

Investment leadership

Driving 
opportunity 
for investors
around the 
world. 

Each investor has a purpose, a goal. Our mission is to help them achieve 
it – through investment solutions built around our global expertise in asset 
allocation, active management, and alternative strategies.

Our multi-boutique investment approach brings even the most sophisticated 
asset classes within reach of every investor. We offer a broad range of specialist 
investment capabilities, spanning equities, fixed income, real estate, and other 
alternative investments. And we are an industry leader in delivering customized 
multi-asset and multi-manager solutions to serve specific client needs.

New and experienced investors alike can benefit from our breadth of asset 
allocation solutions – including target date and target risk funds. Rather than 
simply creating products, we build portfolios that meet specific objectives, such 
as saving for retirement, generating income, or addressing inflation. Think of 
the process as a conversation. What are your risks? What are your goals for the 
future? What are your options for getting there? 

Institutional investors see the advantage of our strong presence in money 
centers around the world. We are close to the markets and close to our clients. 
They come to us in search of specific objectives. And through our nimble, 
specialized boutiques, we can move quickly to build outcome-based solutions 
that fit precisely within their overall portfolios.

In 2017, we introduced more than 50 new funds in Southeast Asia, China, and 
Latin America, as well as more than a dozen new investment options in the 
U.S. Globally, our strong investment performance earned a host of “best fund” 
awards from Bloomberg, Morningstar, Thomson Reuters Lipper, and others.

Consistent with client needs, we take a long-term view. And as active managers, 
we pay close attention to disruptive trends, such as 5G technology, rich data, 
driverless cars, and more. Not so much to predict the future. But to understand 
their potential impact on industries and markets – and how they may separate 
winners from losers over time.

Forward looking and cautionary statements 
Certain statements made by the company which are not historical facts may be considered forward-looking statements, including, 
without limitation, statements as to operating earnings, net income available to common stockholders, net cash flows, realized and 
unrealized gains and losses, capital and liquidity positions, sales and earnings trends, and management’s beliefs, expectations, goals and 
opinions. The company does not undertake to update these statements, which are based on a number of assumptions concerning future 
conditions that may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. Future events and their effects on the company may not be those anticipated, and 
actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. The risks, uncertainties and factors 
that could cause or contribute to such material differences are discussed in the company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended 
Dec. 31, 2017, filed by the company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as updated or supplemented from time to time in 
subsequent filings. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation: adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly 
affect the company’s ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital; conditions in the global capital markets and the 
economy generally; volatility or declines in the equity, bond or real estate markets; changes in interest rates or credit spreads or a sustained 
low interest rate environment; the company’s investment portfolio is subject to several risks that may diminish the value of its invested 
assets and the investment returns credited to customers; the company’s valuation of investments and the determination of the amount 
of allowances and impairments taken on such investments may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to 
differing interpretations; any impairments of or valuation allowances against the company’s deferred tax assets; the company’s actual 
experience could differ significantly from its pricing and reserving assumptions; the pattern of amortizing the company’s DAC and other 
actuarial balances on its universal life-type insurance contracts, participating life insurance policies and certain investment contracts may 
change; the company may not be able to protect its intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims; the company’s ability 
to pay stockholder dividends and meet its obligations may be constrained by the limitations on dividends or distributions Iowa insurance 
laws impose on Principal Life; changes in laws, regulations or accounting standards; results of litigation and regulatory investigations; from 
time to time the company may become subject to tax audits, tax litigation or similar proceedings, and as a result it may owe additional taxes, 
interest and penalties in amounts that may be material; applicable laws and the company’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws may 
discourage takeovers and business combinations that some stockholders might consider in their best interests; competition from companies 
that may have greater financial resources, broader arrays of products, higher ratings and stronger financial performance; a downgrade in the 
company’s financial strength or credit ratings; changes in investor preferences; inability to attract and retain qualified employees and sales 
representatives and develop new distribution sources; international business risks; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the 
company may need to fund deficiencies in its “Closed Block” assets that support participating ordinary life insurance policies that had a 
dividend scale in force at the time of Principal Life’s 1998 conversion into a stock life insurance company; the company’s reinsurers could 
default on their obligations or increase their rates; risks arising from acquisitions of businesses; and a computer system failure or security 
breach could disrupt the company’s business and damage its reputation.
