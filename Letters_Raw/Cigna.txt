A message from our president and CEO,
David Cordani

CIGNA DELIVERED A STRONG 2017
Cigna delivered exceptionally strong performance on behalf of 
our customers, employer clients, partners and shareholders in 
2017 – extending our long track record of differentiated results. 

Once again, these results were driven by the effective 
execution of our “Go” strategy, best-in-class medical cost trend 
performance on behalf of our employer clients, and strong 
contributions from each of our four priority growth platforms – 
Commercial Employer, United States Seniors, Global 
Supplemental Benefits, and Group Disability and Life. 

I’m proud of our contributions to all of our stakeholders,               
energized by the opportunities ahead, and thankful for the 
ongoing commitment of more than 45,000 Cigna colleagues 
around the world who remain passionate about our mission of 
helping to improve the health, well-being and sense of security 
of those we serve. We grew to more than 95 million customer 
relationships in 2017, and I’m privileged to witness examples 
every day of how our Cigna team helps our customers lead 
healthier, more productive lives.  

ADDRESSING OUR 
UNSUSTAINABLE HEALTH 
CARE SYSTEM

At the same time, there’s a 
clear consensus around the 
need for a more sustainable 
health care system, and the 
tremendous pressure this puts 
on far too many individuals 
and families. 

Unfortunately, debates around 
health care reform have been 
largely unproductive, and 
challenges we have long faced 
still remain. 

For example, United States 
health expenditures absorb 
an increasing proportion of 
the gross domestic product, 

yet access to affordable, 
high-quality health care 
remains elusive for many 
of our families, friends and 
neighbors. People are living 
longer on average, but too 
frequently are doing so 
without the vitality they 
desire. Health care costs 
are growing, as individual 
health status erodes due 
to behaviors and lifestyles, 
as well as an unsustainable 
rise in chronic disease. In 
the majority of individual 
situations, these challenges 
are preventable!

This environment is 
exacerbated by aging 
populations, historical

“

Collectively, our best opportunities to improve 
affordability and build a more sustainable health 
care system will come from helping to improve 
individual health, in a highly personalized way.

payment models that fail to incentivize health care 
system participants to maintain or improve health, a 
health care reform debate which too often focuses 
on symptoms – such as the financing of “sick care” 
interventions – rather than on underlying causes. In 
short, in most countries, the social narrative equates 
“health care” solely with “sick care,” rather than with 
the broader aspiration and need of keeping people 
healthy in the first place.

No segment of society can successfully address these 
challenges alone, or in a vacuum. Collectively, we need 
to commit to building more powerful connections and 
solutions among individuals, physicians, health care 
companies, governments and communities. 

Cigna actively works to enable these connections, 
and to catalyze and contribute to a constructive 

dialogue focused on improving health care outcomes 
in numerous ways, ranging from community 
engagement – such as our efforts to help reduce  
the use of opioids among our customers  – and  
our value-based collaborations with health care 
professionals, to market-changing consumer support 
programs and ongoing, principle-based engagement 
with elected officials.  

A FOCUS ON THE INDIVIDUAL

In the 1950s, the United States Air Force determined 
that planes with cockpits designed to accommodate 
the stature of an average-sized pilot were  
contributing to an increase in crashes. In fact, a study 
of 4,000 Air Force pilots showed none of them to be 
“average” based on the measurements used to create 
a cockpit for the “average man.”2

2. Rose, T. (2016, January 16). When U.S. air force discovered the flaw of averages. Retrieved March 02, 2018, from https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2016/01/16/when-us-air-force-discovered-the-flaw-of-averages.html

3

Equipped with this information, the Air Force shifted to adjustable 
– personalized – cockpits. 

Averages can help us better understand theoretical groups of 
people, but not unique human beings. It didn’t work for the Air 
Force. And it doesn’t work in health care.

We fervently believe the most powerful solutions transcend 
a monolithic, one-size-fits-all approach; rather, they’re 
oriented around the well-being and unique needs of the 
individual. Collectively, our best opportunities to improve 
affordability and build a more sustainable health care system 
will come from helping to improve individual health, in a 
highly personalized way.

Too often, our dialogue around well-being is overly 
generalized; we forget the vulnerable, uncertain and often 
frightened person at the end of the health care equation. In 
reality, the definition of well-being is unique to every individual, 
and further influenced by factors ranging from the person’s life 
goals, to health disparities influenced by their demographics, 
lifestyles and behaviors, and where they live. Put differently, at 
certain levels, “well-being” is likely to mean something quite 
different to someone in Beijing compared with someone in 
Boston; however, it may very well also be different for two 
people in Boston living on the same block.

This is why we find, time and again, that the best paths for health 
improvement are created one community, one neighborhood, 
and one person at a time. 

Even the nature of what constitutes health improvement itself 
is relative and also uniquely individual – any person can achieve 
greater vitality regardless of where they are on their health 
journey, and rightfully feel good about it. The already-healthy can 
be supported in staying healthy. The healthy, “at risk” populations 
can lower their risk; this is critical to avoid becoming chronically 
or acutely ill in the near future. Those with chronic disease can 
be supported to reverse or control their conditions, live life to 
the fullest, and avoid becoming acutely ill. Those with acute care 
needs can benefit from quality, high-value health care services. 

Grassroots engagement is critical, because in addition to all health 
being personal, it is local. In fact, health awareness programs 
can be instrumental in mobilizing individuals to take a more 
active role in managing their health. In the United States in the 
1980s, public awareness campaigns reoriented habits around 
seat belt use and similarly, campaigns in the 1990s focused on 
smoking reduction – each with tremendously positive results.

These give hope to the potential for community 
engagement and activation to positively affect lifestyle 
choices negatively influencing individual health today.                                                       

BRIGHT SPOTS: WHERE IT’S WORKING

In this equation, Cigna embraces our role as a 
“connective fiber” or enabler, helping to connect and 
mobilize employers, health care professionals and 
communities to create affordable, high-quality health 
outcomes for individuals. Working together, each of 
these stakeholders plays a crucial role in contributing to 
better and more affordable health care. 

Today in the United States, employers provide health 
care insurance coverage to more than 175 million 
Americans,3 and remain the best positioned to put 
into place the benefit designs, physician networks and 
onsite health coaching programs that work best for 
their employees. Increasingly, employers in countries 
around the world are introducing or adopting health 
and chronic disease programs to supplement the 
services supplied by their government programs. Along 
with another “bright spot” in the American health care 
system – Medicare Advantage – these two access 
points of coverage collectively provide coverage to 
almost two-thirds of the U.S. population,4 and are 
highly functioning despite the burden of directly and 
indirectly subsidizing the health care system at large. 

Health care providers are increasingly embracing 
incentive-based programs which prioritize the value 
of outcomes achieved, over the volume of services 
provided. Through our collaboration with health care 
providers, we have nearly 500 advanced collaborative 
arrangements across physician practices and hospitals 
spanning 33 states.5 Today, 88% of Cigna’s customers 
in the United States are within 15 miles of a health care 
provider in a collaborative care arrangement.6

Finally, the community piece is especially important 
here, and too often not considered. The health care 
system alone, regardless of its structure, cannot meet 
the needs of every individual. The vast majority of 
factors that influence a person’s health exist outside 
the doctor’s office, pharmacy or hospital. For these 

reasons, the community needs to play an essential 
role, which takes different shapes around the globe. 

In the United States, for example, Cigna was the first 
in our industry to step up to the opioid epidemic, 
collaborating with physicians and dentists to 
dramatically reduce prescribing volumes to protect 
health, and expanding access to Medication Assisted 
Treatments for those already addicted. Additionally, 
we established a multi-city Health Improvement Tour 
to bring free health screenings to communities, and 
created a Community Ambassador Fellowship Program, 
with Cigna colleagues around the world supporting 
key initiatives such as clean water, prosthetics, mental 
health, children’s health and addiction. These kinds 
of community-driven efforts take on even greater 
importance given findings that people who feel 
connected to their community demonstrate lower rates 
of anxiety, isolation and loneliness.7

At Cigna, we support customers on their life and health 
journey every day, often at their most vulnerable 
moments. To share just three very different examples:          
>  One of our case managers worked closely with 
Katherine Rodriguez to address her chronic hypertension 
following multiple preterm deliveries, one of which 
resulted in a miscarriage. Katherine remained susceptible 
to preterm delivery, but she and her husband desperately 
wanted more children. Our case manager helped ensure 
she took her medicine to delay preterm labor, which 
contributed to her subsequent deliveries of two healthy 
baby boys. Soon after her most recent delivery, Cigna 
also helped to coordinate Katherine’s family’s evacuation 
plan during Hurricane Harvey.                                                     
>  Shawn King was a Marine who prided himself on 
physical fitness. Then, he began gaining weight, and 
one morning woke up more than 20 pounds heavier 
than the day before. He was diagnosed with congestive 
heart failure, and then diabetes – a disease which 
contributed to the deaths of both Shawn’s father 
and brother. Through the Cigna Collaborative CareSM 
program, a Cigna pharmacist and an embedded care 
coordinator from an accountable care provider worked 
together to ensure Shawn had the right medicine,

>  After being diagnosed with colon cancer, and then 
suffering from a heart attack which put him in the 
intensive care unit soon after, Robert Harrison took 
time off from work to heal. During his recovery, a Cigna 
vocational coach worked closely with Robert to create 
a personalized “recovery plan” to rebuild his strength 
and stamina. His Cigna coach also connected him with 
a trainer from Achilles International – an organization, 
sponsored by Cigna – which helps people with disabilities 
and other ailments to participate in mainstream  
athletics. Robert has since completed Achilles running 
events and is leading an active and healthy life. 

Katherine, Shawn and Robert are three people with 
different challenges and definitions of well-being. We 
ultimately helped them to meet their needs, and to 
achieve greater health outcomes through personalized, 
individualized solutions which mobilized employer, 
health care provider and community relationships.

BUILDING ON SUCCESS AND CHARTING OUR FUTURE

We updated our successful “Go” strategy in 2017 to 
better address evolving market conditions and the 
needs of our customers and other stakeholders.

Go Deeper drives Cigna to expand and deepen our 
customer, client and partner relationships, while also 
intensifying our depth in targeted sub-segments and 
geographies. 

These efforts range from our collaborative physician 
relationships, to our continued growth for our One 
Guide® service, which helps our customers make more 
informed and more personalized health care choices. 
We anticipate doubling our number of One Guide 
customers to four million in 2018.

Go Local intensifies our efforts to ensure our solution 
suite and services meet customer, client and partner 
needs at a local market level – as recently exemplified 
by our 2017 acquisitions of Zurich Middle East 
and Brighter, one of health care’s most innovative 
technology companies, which further accelerated 

And Go Beyond means we’ll further innovate and 
differentiate our business, the experiences we deliver 
and – consistent with Cigna’s emphasis on community –  
the overall social impact we have. We’ll do this through 
efforts such as our Community Ambassador Fellowship 
Program; Cigna was proud to grant nine community 
ambassador fellowships in 2017.

LOOKING FORWARD TO 2018 AND BEYOND

As we look ahead to 2018 and beyond, we will continue 
creating strong value for our customers, clients, 
partners, and, as a result, our shareholders, through 
our consistent focus on delivering affordable and 
personalized products, services and solutions, as well  
as through collaborating with health care professionalss 
to help ensure our customers receive access to quality 
affordable health care. 

Additionally, each of our four growth platforms remain 
well-positioned for sustained growth, and we continue 
to have a tremendous capital position – giving us 
the confidence to recently enhance our long-term 
Earnings Per Share8 target to $18 per share by 2021, 
resulting in a compounded growth rate at the high 
end of our strategic target of 10%–13%, and building 
on the prior five years where we also achieved the 
high end of this range.

Thank you for your continued confidence and investment 
in Cigna. We’re excited about the future, and remain 
driven by our unwavering mission of helping to improve 
the health, well-being and sense of security of those we 
serve around the world – coupled with an unrelenting 
commitment to help unleash the unique potential of 
every human being we have the opportunity to serve.

8. We use the term adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on this same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. Adjusted income (loss) from operations, defined on page 35 of our Form 
10-K, is a measure of profitability used by Cigna’s management because it presents the underlying results of operations of Cigna’s businesses and permits analysis of trends in underlying revenue, expenses and shareholders’ net 
income. This consolidated measure is not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP 
measure, shareholders’ net income.  Management is not able to provide a reconciliation to shareholders’ net income (loss) on a forward-looking basis because we are unable to predict, without unreasonable effort, certain 
components thereof including (i) future net realized investment results and (ii) future special items. These items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond our control.

RECOGNIZING AND REWARDING   
COLLEAGUES WORLDWIDE   

As Cigna looks forward to the next 
chapter in its 225-year history, the 
company made a special one-time 
global stock award of five shares to 
employees worldwide. The stock award 
recognized the passion and commitment 
of Cigna employees during a dynamic 
and disruptive environment over the past 
several years. The stock award represents 
an investment in employees’ futures and 
promotes an ownership mentality that 
fuels our ability to support and change 
our customers’ lives for the better.

Additionally, to support employees in 
balancing work and life demands, Cigna 
launched a Caregiver Leave Program, 
a new benefit for U.S. employees that 
offers up to four weeks of paid leave for 
employees caring for others, including 
child bonding, care for a seriously ill 
family member or qualifying military

support. Cigna also ensured that in all 
countries where it operates outside the 
United States, employees have a minimum of 
12 weeks of full paid maternity leave, and four 
weeks of paid paternity and adoption leave.

Invested in our  
employees’ 

futures.“

Cigna also introduced the Community 
Ambassador Fellowship program, which 
offers eligible employees an opportunity 
to take a sabbatical-style paid leave 
from work to improve life in communities 
where they work and live by supporting 
projects that exemplify Cigna’s mission. 
Program participants are selected 
through a competitive application 
process for a one- to three-month 
fellowship, and receive full salary and 
benefits plus a stipend to support their 
community work.

Together, the global stock award and new 
benefits signal Cigna’s pride in its employees’ 
continued high level of performance in a 
challenging environment. We’re investing 
in a bright future for Cigna, our employees 
and the people we serve around the world.                                         

CIGNA RATED A TOP EMPLOYER FOR  
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION  

Cigna was recognized as a top employer 
for its diversity and inclusion practices and 
policies, including its hiring and support of 
military veterans. Cigna was designated as a 
Military Friendly® Employer by Victory Media, 
which provides its list of Military Friendly 
Employers to service members and their 
families, helping them discover post-military 
career opportunities. Companies that have 
earned this designation are deemed to have 
exceptionally strong hiring programs and 
meaningful jobs for transitioning service 
members, veterans and spouses. 

Companies and organizations earning the 
Military Friendly Employer designation are 

evaluated using publicly available data from 
federal agencies, personal opinion data from 
veteran employees and proprietary Military 
Friendly survey data from participating 
organizations. Cigna also has received multiple 
recognitions from Military Times magazine for 
being a “Best for Vets” employer.

Additionally, for the sixth year in a row, 
Cigna scored a perfect 100 on the Human 
Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality 
Index (CEI) and has been recognized by 
the HRC Foundation as one of the “Best 
Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality.” The 
CEI evaluates LGBTQ-related policies and 
practices including nondiscrimination 
workplace protections, domestic partner 
benefits, transgender-inclusive health care 
benefits, competency programs, and public 
engagement with the LGBTQ community.

Cigna’s commitment to a diverse workforce 
runs deep, and includes Colleague Resource 
Groups within the company to focus on 
the needs of employees as well as those of 
diverse customers.

TV DOCTORS HELP CIGNA SAVE 
LIVES THROUGH PREVENTIVE CARE  

Cigna’s TV Doctors of America campaign 
used an ensemble of familiar TV doctors 
to promote annual check-ups as a way 
to improve an individual’s health and 
encourage a dialogue with his or her health 
care provider. Actors Patrick Dempsey, 
Neil Patrick Harris, Kate Walsh and Donald 
Faison donned scrubs and white coats to 
take on this role with Cigna. The TV doctors 
appeared in a multimedia platform including 
television, digital and social channels, using 
their star power to help influence consumers 
to go get their annual check-ups, know their 
key health numbers for blood pressure, 
cholesterol, blood sugar and body mass 
index (BMI), and take control of their health.

Cigna’s goal is to help save 100,000 lives 
a year, the number of lives the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
estimates would be saved if everyone 
received his or her recommended 
preventive care.9 The campaign 
encourages all consumers to get their 
annual check-up – which most U.S. health 
plans cover at 100% as part of a suite of 
preventive services.10

HEALTH IMPROVEMENT TOUR DELIVERS 
10,000+ SCREENINGS NATIONWIDE IN 2017 

Cigna’s Go. Know. Take Control.® Health 
Improvement Tour (HIT) delivers free health 
screenings and health coaching, reaching 
individuals who may not have access to care 
through traditional means, and regardless 
of whether they are Cigna customers. The 
Cigna Foundation arm of the HIT brings free 
screenings to our nonprofit partners. This 
aspect of the HIT is supported by a generous 
grant from the Cordani Family Foundation.  

The HIT represents an opportunity to make 
a difference – connecting with communities 
on the importance of preventive health care. 
The program is helping to uncover health 
issues for people who may be unaware of 
their risks, meeting people where they are 
and engaging them in managing their health. 
This initiative delivers biometric screenings 
for blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar 
and body mass index in cities across the

LEADING THE WAY IN HEALTH EQUITY  

Cigna was awarded the Innovation in 
Advancing Health Equity Award by the 
National Business Group on Health for the 
second consecutive year.

New initiatives addressing health disparities 
included several personalized programs 
that made it easier for customers to better 
engage with their providers and the health 
care system, resulting in improvements 
in health assessments and screenings – 
including an 84.7% increase in colorectal 
screening rates for Hispanic customers 
enrolled in Cigna’s Individual and Family 
Plans in Texas and Colorado.11

Additionally, health disparity training 
and resources were expanded. More

topics as well as a section discussing our 
work to align efforts with the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals.

In our latest report, we highlight the key 
issues our Cigna Connects platform centered 
on; health and well-being, the environment 
and inclusive business. For each issue area, 
we identified the specific initiatives that 
demonstrate how we work to address these 
complex social challenges.

TACKLING THE NATIONAL                 
OPIOID EPIDEMIC

Cigna has been aggressively fighting the 
opioid epidemic by reducing the use of 
opioids among customers and collaborating 
with physicians and other parties to find 
workable solutions.  

Cigna has committed to reducing the use 
of prescribed opioids among customers by 

15. Number of signed pledges received by Cigna for Performance Measurement and Improvement.

25% by 2019, while still providing the right 
care at the right time. More than 65,270 
doctors,15 through their medical groups, 
signed Cigna’s pledge to reduce opioid 
prescriptions and treat opioid use disorders 
as chronic conditions. And Cigna reached 
out to 2,600 prescribers of high-dosage 
opioid medications to ensure the dosage of 
the opioid medications were appropriate, 
medically necessary and safe for the patient.

HELPING VETER ANS FIGHT               
HEALTH CHALLENGES   

Cigna is helping veterans overcome challenges 
– including opioid addiction. Many veterans 
struggle as they transition back to civilian 
life and face chronic pain, post-traumatic 
stress disorder, depression and other health 
conditions that contribute to the use, and 
misuse, of painkillers. The opioid epidemic 
has hit veterans harder than other population 
groups, with veterans 10 times more likely to 
misuse opioids than average Americans.16 

While many resources exist to help vets, in 
some cases waiting lists and social barriers, 
such as feeling embarrassed to seek 
assistance, prevent vets from getting the help 
they need. Cigna is taking a leadership role in 
addressing the unique needs of veterans and 
introduced a free national Veteran Support 
Line, available 24/7/365 days a year to all 
veterans, their families and caregivers, whether 
or not the veteran is a Cigna customer. The 
support line, available at 855.244.6211, gives 
veterans access to services and resources for 
pain management, substance use counseling 

and treatment, PTSD, and many other needs 
related to housing, employment, financial 
assistance, family issues and more. 

In addition, Cigna also is now offering a weekly 
Mindfulness for Vets session, exclusively for 
veterans, to help them manage pain and stress 
more effectively. 

“

They answered 
our country’s call. 
Now we’re here to 
answer theirs.

Cigna views veterans as an important part of 
its global team, and commits approximately 
10% of its annual recruitment budget in the 
United States to recruit veterans and their 
spouses. We will continue to look for ways to 
give back to those individuals who served and 
protected our country.

MAPPING THE FUTURE OF HEALTH CARE

Cigna is creating the future of health care 
through offering greater affordability 
and better quality in health care. To 
achieve this goal, we reward providers 
for the quality of care they deliver, and 
the health outcomes they achieve for 
patients, as we shift from traditional   
fee-for-service reimbursement models to 
value-based partnerships. 

For the last decade in Cigna’s 
Commercial business, and 20 years in the

A BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR              
DIGITAL CAPABILITIES 

Cigna acquired Brighter Inc.®, a digital 
health plan platform leader to enable Cigna

initiatives and provider partnerships. 
Brighter is a technology company that is 
working with leading health service and 
dental organizations to engage patients and 
providers in personalized and seamlessly 
integrated experiences to more efficiently 
deliver higher-value health care.

The acquisition accelerates Cigna’s

quality of care and maximize cost savings.

Brighter provides Cigna with the 
technology, consumer expertise and 
speed-to-market capabilities necessary 
for the ongoing and critical digital 
transformation of health plans. These 
capabilities enable consumers to more 
regularly and confidently engage with the 
plans, providers and wellness programs 
that are best able to improve health while 
reducing costs. 

In addition, providers gain more                                              
cost-efficient ways to provide quality 
services by leveraging reduced marketing, 
administrative and patient-engagement 
expenses, while employer plan sponsors 
benefit from population health management 
and data-driven recommendations for 
ongoing improvements.

performance or results, and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Cigna undertakes no
obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may
be required by law.

We execute on this strategy with a differentiated set of medical, pharmacy, behavioral, dental, disability, life and accident insurance and related
products and services offered by our subsidiaries.

In  an  increasingly  retail-oriented  marketplace,  we  focus  on  delivering  affordable  and  personalized  products  and  services  to  customers
through  employer-based,  government-sponsored  and  individual  coverage  arrangements.  We  increasingly  collaborate  with  health  care
providers to continue the transition from volume-based fee for service arrangements toward a more value-based system designed to increase
quality of care, lower costs and improve health outcomes. We operate a customer-centric organization enabled by keen insights regarding
customer needs, localized decision-making and talented professionals committed to bringing our ‘‘Together All the Way’’ brand promise to
life.

CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K 1

PART I
ITEM 1. Business

In particular, over the past several years, to achieve the goals of better health, affordability, localization and an improved experience for the
customer, we have continued expanding our participation in collaborative care and other delivery arrangements with health care professionals
across  the  care  delivery  spectrum,  including  large  and  small  physician  groups,  specialist  groups  and  hospitals.  More  recently,  we  have
developed innovative tools and flexible provider arrangements that provide a truly personalized customer experience. These arrangements
and tools are discussed in more detail in the ‘‘Global Health Care’’ section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (‘‘Form 10-K’’) beginning on
page 3.

We present the financial results of our businesses in the following three reportable segments:

Global Health Care aggregates the Commercial and Government operating segments.

•

The  Commercial  operating  segment  encompasses  both  the  U.S.  commercial  and  certain  international  health  care  businesses  serving
employers and their employees, other groups, and individuals. In this segment, we refer to employer or other groups as the ‘‘client’’ and the
individual as the ‘‘customer.’’ Products and services include medical, dental, behavioral health, vision, and prescription drug benefit plans,
health advocacy programs and other products and services to insured and self-insured customers.

•

The Government operating segment offers Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D plans to seniors as well as Medicaid plans.

Global Supplemental Benefits offers supplemental health, life and accident insurance products in selected international markets and in the
United States.

Group Disability and Life provides group long-term and short-term disability, group life, accident and specialty insurance products and related
services.

run-off reinsurance and settlement annuity businesses and deferred gains associated with the sales of the individual life insurance and annuity
and retirement benefits businesses.

Our revenues are derived principally from premiums on insured products, fees from self-insured products and services, mail-order pharmacy
sales and investment income.

The ACA and Health Care Reform
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively referred to throughout this
Form 10-K as the ‘‘ACA’’ or ‘‘PPACA’’) continues to have a significant impact on our business operations. The future of the ACA is uncertain due
to congressional efforts to repeal and replace the ACA, various executive actions of the Trump administration, and repeal of the individual
mandate as part of H.R.1, An Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal
Year 2018 (referred to throughout this Form 10-K as the ‘‘Tax Cuts and Jobs Act’’ or ‘‘U.S. tax reform legislation’’). The effects of the ACA, and
efforts to repeal and replace it, are discussed throughout this Form 10-K where appropriate, including in the Global Health Care business
description, Regulation, Risk Factors, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (‘‘MD&A’’), and
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We seek to differentiate ourselves in this business by providing innovative personalized and affordable health care benefit solutions to our
clients and customers. We sub-segment and target distinct buyer groups in a personalized and localized way. We focus on anticipating,
understanding,  and  meeting  their  needs  and  we  will  continue  to  drive  growth  by  deepening  our  approach  to  consultative  partnership,
accelerating the value of our integrated solutions, and enhancing the customer experience. As a leader in the drive to transition the health care
delivery system from volume-based reimbursements to a value orientation, our strategy is to accelerate our engagement with employers and
individuals in order to: 1) increase our customers’ involvement in their health care and 2) develop deep insights into customer needs. Our
differentiated approach to partnering with health care providers allows us to leverage information, incentives and care resources to help them
evolve towards value-based care delivery and improve the quality and affordability of care for our customers and clients.

Innovation is core to the way we do business and will be a critical factor to our success in the highly dynamic health care industry. We have
delivered innovative solutions that improve affordability and are more personalized, such as the Cigna One Guide姞 program that combines a
state-of-the-art digital experience with a human concierge service; and the Cigna SureFit姞 network that allows individual family members to
choose their personal care networks, consistent with their health needs and provider preferences.

ITEM 1. Business

Principal Products and Services
Commercial Medical Health Plans – U.S. and International
The Commercial operating segment, either directly or through its partners, offers some or all of its products in all 50 states, the District of
Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Africa and Australia. We offer a variety of medical plans including:

•

•

•

•

Managed Care Plans including HMO, Network, Network Open Access and Open Access Plus. Through our insurance companies, Health
Maintenance Organizations (‘‘HMOs’’) and third party administrator (‘‘TPA’’) companies, we offer insured and self-insured indemnity and
managed care benefit plans that use meaningful cost-sharing incentives to encourage the use of ‘‘in-network’’ versus ‘‘out-of-network’’ health
care providers and provide the option to select a primary care physician. The national provider network for Managed Care Plans is somewhat
smaller than the national network used with the preferred provider (‘‘PPO’’) plan product line. If a particular plan covers non-emergency
services  received  from  a  non-participating  health  care  provider,  the  customer’s  cost-sharing  obligation  is  usually  greater  for  the
out-of-network care.

PPO Plans. Our PPO product line features a network with broader provider access than the Managed Care Plans. The preferred provider
product line may be at a higher cost than our Managed Care Plans.

Consumer-Driven Products. Cigna’s suite of consumer-driven products – health savings accounts (‘‘HSAs’’), health reimbursement accounts
(‘‘HRAs’’)  and  flexible  spending  accounts  (‘‘FSAs’’)  –  are  typically  paired  with  a  high-deductible  medical  plan  and  offer  customers  a
tax-advantaged way to pay for eligible health care expenses. The nature of these products encourages customers to play an active role in
managing their health and their health care costs. When integrated with a Cigna medical plan, we can deliver a seamless experience for our
customers and clients. More than three million customers have chosen one of these integrated product solutions.

Cigna Connect is an individual plan offered in markets within eight states. The product is comprised of a network of health care providers in a
geographic area who have been selected with cost and quality in mind. Customers who participate in the Connect network will receive care at
Cigna’s lower negotiated rates to help keep out-of-pocket costs down. Out-of-network coverage is not available except for urgent and
emergent care.

Approximately  90%  of  our  commercial  medical  customers  are  enrolled  in  medical  plans  with  either  ASO  or  experience  rated  funding
arrangements that allow the corporate client to directly benefit from lower medical costs.

The funding arrangements available for our commercial medical and dental health plans are as follows:

Premium rates are established at the beginning of a policy period and are typically based on prior claim experience of the policyholder.
•
The policyholder receives detailed claim and utilization reporting to understand actual plan costs and help make informed decisions
about future benefit plan design.

•

The policyholder participates, or shares in, favorable claim experience. When claims and expenses are less than the premium charged
(an ‘‘experience surplus’’ or ‘‘margin’’), the policyholder may be credited for a portion of this experience surplus/margin. If claims and
expenses exceed the premium charged (an ‘‘experience deficit’’), we bear these costs. In certain cases, experience deficits incurred
while the policy is in effect are accumulated and may be recovered through future policy year experience surpluses/margins.

Insured – Guaranteed Cost (‘‘Fully Insured’’)
Premium rates are established at the beginning of a policy period and, depending on group size, may be based in whole or in part on
•
prior experience of the policyholder or on a pool of similar policyholders. We generally cannot subsequently adjust premiums to reflect
actual claim experience until the next annual renewal.

•

The policyholder does not participate, or share in, actual claim experience. We keep any experience surplus/margin if costs are less than
the premium charged (subject to minimum medical loss ratio rebate requirements discussed below) and bear the risk for actual costs in
excess of the premium charged.

4 CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K

PART I
ITEM 1. Business

In  most  states,  individual  and  group  insurance  premium  rates  must  be  approved  by  the  applicable  state  regulatory  agency  (typically
department of insurance) and state or federal laws may restrict or limit the use of rating methods. Premium rates for groups and individuals are
subject to state review for reasonableness. In addition, the ACA subjects individual and small group policy rate increases above an identified
threshold to review by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (‘‘HHS’’) and requires payment of premium refunds on
individual and group medical insurance products if minimum medical loss ratio (‘‘MLR’’) requirements are not met. The MLR represents the
percentage of premiums used to pay medical claims and expenses for activities that improve the quality of care. In our individual business,
premiums may also be adjusted as a result of the government risk adjustment program that takes into account the relative health status of our
customers. See the ‘‘Regulation’’ section of this Form 10-K for additional information on the commercial MLR requirements and the risk
mitigation programs of the ACA.

Government Health Plans
Medicare Advantage
We offer Medicare Advantage plans in 17 states and the District of Columbia through our Cigna-HealthSpring brand. Under such a plan,
Medicare-eligible beneficiaries may receive health care benefits, including prescription drugs, through a managed care health plan such as our
coordinated care plans. A significant portion of our Medicare Advantage customers receive medical care from our value based models that
focus on developing highly engaged physician networks, aligning payment incentives to improved health outcomes, and using timely and
transparent data sharing. We are focused on continuing to expand these models in the future.

We receive revenue from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (‘‘CMS’’) for each plan customer based on customer demographic
data and actual customer health risk factors compared to the broader Medicare population. We also may earn additional revenue from CMS
related to quality performance measures (known as ‘‘Star Ratings’’). See the ‘‘Executive Overview’’ section of our MD&A beginning on page 35
of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of our Star Ratings. Premiums may be received from customers when our plan premium exceeds the
revenue received from CMS. The ACA requires Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D plans to meet a minimum MLR of 85%. If the MLR for a
CMS contract is less than 85%, we are required to pay a rebate to CMS and could be required to make additional payments if the MLR continues
to be less than 85% for successive years.

Medicare Part D
Our Medicare Part D prescription drug program provides a number of plan options, as well as service and information support, to Medicare and
Medicaid eligible customers. Our plans are available in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and offer the savings of Medicare combined
with the flexibility to provide enhanced benefits and a drug list tailored to individuals’ specific needs. Eligible beneficiaries benefit from broad
network access and value-added services intended to help keep them well and save them money.

Medicaid
We offer Medicaid coverage to low income individuals in select markets in Texas. We also offered Medicaid coverage to low income individuals
in select markets in Illinois throughout 2017; however, as of December 31, 2017, all of our Medicaid contracts with the state of Illinois have been
terminated. Our Medicaid customers benefit from many of the coordinated care aspects of our Medicare Advantage programs.

We receive revenue from the states of Texas and Illinois for our Medicaid only customers. For customers eligible for both Medicare and
Medicaid (‘‘dual eligible’’) we receive revenue from both the state and CMS. All revenue is based on customer demographic data and actual
customer health risk factors. Similar to Medicare Advantage, there are minimum MLR requirements in Illinois (85% for the dual product and 88%
for the Medicaid only product). However, Texas utilizes an experience rebate in an effort to provide better value to consumers and increase
transparency. The Texas experience rebate takes into account operating expenses and requires a rebate of dollars to the state as different
profitability thresholds are met.

Specialty Products and Services
Our specialty products and services described below are designed to improve the quality of care, lower cost and help customers achieve better
health outcomes. Many of these products can be sold on a standalone basis, but we believe they are most effective when integrated with a
Cigna-administered health plan. Our specialty products are focused in the areas of medical, behavioral, pharmacy management, dental and
vision.

Medical Specialty
Stop Loss. We offer stop loss insurance coverage for ASO clients that provides reimbursement for claims in excess of a predetermined
•
amount for individuals (‘‘specific’’), the entire group (‘‘aggregate’’), or both.

•

•

Cost-Containment Service. We administer cost-containment programs on behalf of our clients and customers for health care services and
supplies that are covered under health benefit plans. These programs may involve vendors who perform activities designed to control health
costs by reducing out-of-network utilization and costs, educating customers regarding the availability of lower cost in-network services,
negotiating discounts, reviewing provider bills, and recovering overpayments from other payers or health care providers. We charge fees for
providing or arranging for these services.

Consumer  Health  Engagement. We  offer  an  array  of  medical  management,  disease  management,  and  wellness  services  to  customers
covered under plans administered by Cigna, or by third-party administrators. Our Medical Management programs include case, specialty and
utilization management including a 24-hour nurse information line. Our Health Advocacy programs and services include early intervention in
the  treatment  of  chronic  conditions  and  an  array  of  health  and  wellness  coaching.  Additionally,  we  administer  incentives  to  motivate
customers to engage in and improve their health.

CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K 5

PART I
ITEM 1. Business

Pharmacy Management
We offer prescription drug plans to our commercial and government customers both in conjunction with our medical products and on a
standalone basis. With a network of over 69,000 pharmacies, Cigna Pharmacy Management is a comprehensive pharmacy benefits manager
(‘‘PBM’’)  offering  clinical  programs  and  specialty  pharmacy  solutions.  We  also  offer  high  quality,  efficient,  and  cost-effective  mail  order,
telephone and on-line pharmaceutical fulfillment services through our home delivery operation.

Our medical and pharmacy coverage meets the needs of customers with complex medical conditions requiring specialty pharmaceuticals.
These types of medications are covered under the pharmacy or medical benefit depending on whether they are dispensed by a pharmacy to
the customer or administered to the customer by a health care professional or facility. Uses of these typically expensive medications often
require associated lab work and coordination between the pharmacy and the patient’s medical professionals may be critical in improving
clinical outcomes and affordability. Customers with Cigna-administered medical and pharmacy coverage may experience greater continuity of
care and affordability, and clients may benefit from integrated reporting and meaningful unit cost discounts on specialty drugs.

Behavioral Health
We arrange for behavioral health care services for customers through our network of approximately 122,000 participating behavioral health
care professionals and 14,000 facilities and clinics. We offer behavioral health care case management services, employee assistance programs
(‘‘EAP’’), and work/life programs to employers, government entities and other groups sponsoring health benefit plans. We focus on integrating
our programs and services with medical, pharmacy and disability programs to facilitate customized, holistic care.

Dental
We offer a variety of insured and self-insured dental benefit solutions including dental health maintenance organization plans (‘‘Dental HMO’’)
in 37 states, dental preferred provider organization (‘‘Dental PPO’’) plans in 49 states and the District of Columbia, exclusive dental provider
organization plans, traditional dental indemnity plans and a dental discount program. Employers and other groups can purchase our products
as  standalone  products  or  in  conjunction  with  medical  products.  Additionally,  individual  customers  can  purchase  Dental  PPO  plans  as
standalone products or in conjunction with individual medical policies.

Beginning in 2016 Cigna launched a suite of digital enhancements to our web portal and mobile application, for our dental customers to
schedule appointments online, compare out-of-pocket costs across multiple dentists, and access information that evaluates the dentist’s
professional history, affordability and patient experience. Cigna’s recent acquisition of Brighter, a leader in digital engagement with health care
consumers, will accelerate developing and delivering deep end-to-end experiences that further connect our dental consumers with high
quality providers.

As of December 31, 2017, our dental customers totaled 15.8 million worldwide and approximately 67% are enrolled in plans with funding
arrangements that allow clients to directly benefit from lower dental costs. Our U.S. customers access care from one of the largest Dental PPO
networks and Dental HMO networks, with approximately 140,600 Dental PPO and 19,900 Dental HMO health care professionals.

Vision
Cigna Vision offers flexible, cost-effective PPO coverage that includes a range of both in and out-of-network benefits for routine vision services
offered in conjunction with our medical and dental product offerings. Our national vision care network, consisting of approximately 89,800
health care providers in over 26,300 locations, includes private practice ophthalmologist and optometrist offices, as well as retail eye care
centers.

Service and Quality
Customer Service
For U.S.-based customers, we operate 22 service centers that together in 2017 processed approximately 168 million claims and handled
33 million calls providing our customers service 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

In our international health care business, we have a service model dedicated to the unique needs of our 1.5 million customers around the world.
We service them from 12 globally deployed service centers that allow us to provide service 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

Technology
Cigna Information Technology supports the Go Deeper, Go Local, Go Beyond strategy by focusing first and foremost on strong foundational
technology services and delivering against an aligned business and technology portfolio that creates market differentiation. We target specific
innovation in the customer experience, digital capabilities, advanced analytics and artificial intelligence that provide key areas of competitive
advantage. Our goal is to continue to focus on targeted technology investments to enable our strategic business objectives. This goal is
accomplished by delivering innovative technology that enables more efficient operations, improves process integrity and cyber-protections,
builds stronger relationships with our key stakeholders; optimizes our economies of scale; and maximizes flexible payment arrangements,
innovative  products  and  services  and  intelligent  analytics  to  support  evidence-based  medicine.  Through  continued  execution  of  these
capabilities, we are able to better and more rapidly deliver market-differentiating and innovative solutions.

Technology plays an essential role, both as a critical enabler and as a core asset, in Cigna’s drive to be the partner of choice and to deliver a
superior experience to numerous stakeholders. To support these goals, our global IT strategy continues to focus on technology, infrastructure
and platforms, as well as adopting Agile development methods. Execution across each of these dimensions results in improved delivery, quality
and speed, stronger integration, improved transparency and greater optionality. As part of the execution of our global IT strategy, we have
launched a growing portfolio of innovative solutions that leverage technologies such as virtual reality, mobile, advanced analytics and machine
learning. Utilizing virtual reality technology coupled with biometrics and brain wave analysis, we developed a solution that monitors and

manages the stress level of call center agents. We also have introduced a global mobile application that enables access to a virtual health team
as well as personalized health content, internet of things integration and consolidated medical record information. We are leveraging machine
learning and analytics to proactively engage customers with our new, integrated customer decision support and service program, One Guide姞.
We are also using analytics to address the opioid epidemic. In addition to collaborating with our network of doctors, we leverage our Opioid
Likely Overdose Risk Model, which uses machine learning with integrated claims data and analytics to detect opioid use patterns that suggest
possible misuse.

Innovation  is  core  to  the  way  we  do  business;  we  continuously  seek  opportunities  to  drive  efficiencies  and  create  a  superior  customer
experience through technology. Our business strategy is predicated on providing customers with differentiated, easy to use, seamless and
secure products and solutions that leverage analytics and information to meet their increasing expectations. That means we need to anticipate
those needs and meet customers where they are. From predicting and preventing chronic diseases, to mining data to reduce payment and
claims fraud, to using the data from wearable’s to optimize health, we foresee even more opportunities going forward to use sophisticated
artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. This will allow us to build even better models to answer the complex questions, and will
lead to better health care outcomes.

Data Analytics
Cigna has transformed substantial investments in analytics talent, data infrastructure, and machine learning capabilities over the past several
years into a closed loop, self-learning insights system that guides our decision making and executing on our strategy. Our Insights That Matter
analytics process helps our business leaders identify the questions that matter most to our customers and partners. We focus our data science
experts on answering those questions with innovative methodologies and transform our insights into targeted business actions.

Cigna is using advanced analytic capabilities throughout all facets of the business to:

•

•

•

Identify and quantify the financial and clinical cost of discrete health opportunities and insights into how to best engage individual customers
(e.g., digital, phone, or physician-based interactions). We convert these insights into a Health Matters Score that is used to connect each
customer to the right clinical services and drive better clinical, financial, and quality outcomes.

Enable customized service experiences. In our pharmacy business we are proactively offering our customers value added pharmacy and
medical services during inbound customer calls, realizing the value of an integrated medical and pharmacy offering. To maximize impact, we
apply our proprietary Customer Segmentation models to tailor customer communications to make interactions more meaningful.

Build a deep understanding of risk adjusted total cost and quality performance metrics at the individual physician level and aggregate market
level to develop relative benchmarks. This data is being used to fuel our drive to fee for value physician reimbursements and flexible provider
networks.

•

Leverage advanced analytic models and tools to better identify prospects that best align with Cigna’s mission and value proposition for our
client engagement team.

Going forward, we view insights as a strategic imperative and will continue to heavily invest in expanding and strengthening our capabilities to
meet and exceed our customer and partner expectations.

Quality Health Care
Our commitment to promoting quality health care to the people we serve is reflected in a variety of activities.

Health Improvement through Engaging Providers and Customers
Cigna improves health outcomes, reduces health care costs, and delivers a better customer and provider experience by enabling optimized
relationships that connect care between customers and providers. We refer to this as our Connected Care strategy. Key aspects of this strategy
include engaging customers in their health, collaborating with providers to help them improve their performance, and connecting customers
and providers through aligned health goals and incentives and actionable information to enable better decisions and outcomes. Cigna is
committed to developing innovative solutions that span the health care delivery system and can be applied to different types of providers.
Currently  we  have  numerous  collaborative  arrangements  with  our  participating  health  care  providers  and  are  actively  developing  new
arrangements to support our Connected Care strategy. The key principles that guide our innovative solutions include:

•

improving access to care at the local market level;

•

collaborating with and supporting providers to be successful with value-based care;

•

leveraging actionable, personalized patient information, enhancing the patient experience; and,

•

shifting reimbursement incentives to reward quality medical and cost outcomes.

We continue to increase our engagement with physicians and hospitals by rapidly developing the types of arrangements discussed below.
Over two million medical customers are currently serviced by more than 136,000 health care providers in these types of arrangements.

Cigna Collaborative Care.

•

Accountable Care Program – we have over 200 collaborative care arrangements with primary care groups built on the patient-
centered medical home and accountable care organization (‘‘ACO’’) models. Our arrangements span over 30 states and reach over
2.4 million customers. We are committed to increasing the number of groups over the next several years. Our goal is to reach 280
programs by the end of 2020.

Specialist Programs – we have approximately 150 arrangements with specialist groups in value-based reimbursement arrangements.
Our goal is to reach approximately 260 arrangements by the end of 2020. Programs include arrangements with several types of
specialist groups around the country, including orthopedics, obstetrics and gynecology, cardiology, gastroenterology, oncology,
nephrology, and neurology. Arrangements include care coordination, and episodes of care reimbursements, for meeting cost and
quality goals.

Independent  Practice  Associations  are  value  based  physician  engagement  models  in  our  Cigna-HealthSpring  business  that  allow  the
physician groups to share financial outcomes with us. The Cigna-HealthSpring clinical model also includes outreach to new and at-risk
patients to ensure they are accessing their primary care physician.

CareAllies姞. In  2016,  we  announced  the  formation  of  CareAllies姞;  this  U.S.-based  population  health  company  is  focused  on  helping
physicians manage the health of their patients and improve their health outcomes. CareAllies姞 partners with physicians, provider groups and
health systems to develop customized solutions that help them meet their goals across all patients and all payers.

Delivery System Alliances. Cigna  is  collaborating  with  select  health  care  delivery  systems  to  develop  compelling  and  unique  strategic
relationships focused on addressing the local market’s unique health care needs. This includes jointly developed products designed to
improve the experience of Cigna customers by offering integrated health care and providing access to quality, value-based care in local
communities.

Customer Engagement Products – Cigna One Guide姞. Cigna is also delivering a personalized experience to help our customers navigate the
complex  health  care  system  and  make  important  health  care  choices.  Cigna  One  Guide姞  provides  customers  with  access  to  guided
consultations via phone, mobile application and ‘‘Click-to-Chat’’ to help with choosing their benefits, building a personal health team of
doctors, clinicians and coaches, navigating their health benefits and reducing their health expenses through reward programs.

In the international health care business we use the Net Promoter Score (‘‘NPS’’) approach to continually gather insights from customers and
health care professionals around the world and to guide how we proactively enhance product and service offerings.

Participating Provider Network
We provide our customers with an extensive network of participating health care professionals, hospitals, and other facilities, pharmacies and
providers of health care services and supplies. In most instances, we contract with them directly; however, in some instances, we contract with
third parties for access to their provider networks and care management services. In addition, we have entered into strategic alliances with
several regional managed care organizations (e.g., Tufts Health Plan, HealthPartners, Inc., Health Alliance Plan, and MVP Health Plan) to gain
access to their provider networks and discounts.

We credential physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals in our participating provider networks using quality criteria that meet
or  exceed  the  standards  of  external  accreditation  or  state  regulatory  agencies,  or  both.  Typically,  most  health  care  professionals  are
re-credentialed every three years.

The Cigna Care Network姞 is a benefit-plan design option offered in 74 service areas. The network distinguishes physicians in 21 specialties (3
primary care and 18 other specialties) who participate in our network, based on specific quality and/or cost-efficiency criteria. The benefit
design  is  intended  to  encourage  Cigna  customers  to  consider  using  a  Cigna  Care  Network姞  physician,  affords  a  lower  co-payment  or
coinsurance for services provided by a physician in this network than if the individual were to select a participating, non-Cigna Care Network姞
physician.

LocalPlus姞 is a locally-tailored network of select health care providers and facilities designed to provide cost-effective and quality care. It links
multiple local networks across geographic markets to provide consistency for both employers and the customers. LocalPlus姞 was available in
23 markets as of the end of 2017, and will be available in 24 markets by the end of 2018.

The Cigna SureFit姞 network is built around a focused, local network of doctors and hospitals, who are rewarded for collaborating and providing
quality care. Customers choose a primary care provider (‘‘PCP’’) at enrollment, which helps ensure care is coordinated within the network –
creating a better, more affordable customer experience. This creates network efficiencies that result in significant client savings over our Open
Access Plus (‘‘OAP’’) product. Traditional and alternative funding options are paired with integrated medical, pharmacy and behavioral health
products to further maximize savings.

Medical Care and Onsite Services
Cigna Medical Group is a multi-specialty medical group practice that delivers primary care and certain specialty care services through 20
•
medical facilities and 120 clinicians in Phoenix, Arizona. These health care centers have received the highest accreditation (level 3) from the
National Committee for Quality Assurance (‘‘NCQA’’).

•

•

LivingWell Health Centers – HealthSpring姞. Medicare Advantage customers may receive care from one of our four free-standing clinics and
13 ‘‘embedded’’ clinics that incorporate the principles and resources of stand-alone clinics while allowing the customer access to their primary
care physician.

Cigna Onsite Health provides employer-based onsite or nearby health centers and health and wellness coaches with nearly 60 health centers
and 160 health coaches. Care delivery services include acute, episodic care through full primary care services. Additional services include a
range of health and wellness and preventive services, pre-packaged generic prescription dispensing, biometrics screenings and health and
wellness coaching for diet and nutrition as well as chronic condition management. Cigna Onsite Health also offers virtual health services to
extend access to care for both coaching and treatment services.

Cigna  Guided  Solutions姞  is  Cigna’s  benefit  administration  and  private  exchange  solution  that  targets  clients  who  value  fully  integrated
solutions and focus on engaging employees in their benefit offering. It leverages Cigna’s ability to provide a fully integrated solution with our
broad spectrum of products, benefit plans, services, and full suite of funding options focused on improving total cost, health, and productivity.
Through  Cigna  Guided  Solutions姞,  employers  enjoy  simplified  administration  and  the  convenience  of  single  source  purchasing  while
employees  receive  more  choice  via  an  easy-to-use  shopping  experience  and  year  round  engagement.  Together  with  integrated  robust
decision-support tools, employees are able to make personalized decisions to select the right benefit offering and get the most value from
their plans.

In addition, Cigna participates on many third party private exchanges. We actively evaluate private exchange participation opportunities as
they emerge in the market, and target our participation to those models that best align with our mission and value proposition.

We employ sales representatives to distribute our products and services through insurance brokers and insurance consultants or directly to
employers, unions and other groups or individuals. We also employ sales representatives to sell access to our national participating provider
network, utilization review services, behavioral health care and pharmacy management services, and employee assistance services directly to
insurance  companies,  HMOs  and  third  party  administrators.  As  of  December  31,  2017,  our  field  sales  force  consisted  of  over  1,200  sales
representatives in 124 field locations. In our Government business, Medicare Advantage enrollment is generally a decision made individually by
the customer, and accordingly, sales agents and representatives focus their efforts on in-person contacts with potential enrollees, as well as
telephonic and group selling venues.

Competition
Our business is subject to intense competition and continuing industry consolidation creates an even more competitive business environment.
In certain geographic locations, some health care companies may have significant market share positions, but no one competitor dominates
the health care market nationally. Given the current economic and political environment, we expect a continuing trend of consolidation across
the health care industry supply chain (including insurers, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and providers).

Competition in the health care market exists both for employers and other groups sponsoring plans and for employees in those instances
where the employer offers a choice of products from more than one health care company. Most group insurance policies are subject to annual
review  by  the  plan  sponsor,  who  may  seek  competitive  quotations  prior  to  renewal.  Since  the  inception  of  the  Individual  Exchange
marketplaces many carriers have incurred significant financial losses leading to many exiting the market. With the continued debate regarding
the ACA and the health care industry more broadly, it is likely that legislative and regulatory changes to the ACA will occur in the future.

CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K 9

PART I
ITEM 1. Business

The primary competitive factors affecting our business are quality and cost-effectiveness of service and provider networks; effectiveness of
medical  care  management;  products  that  meet  the  needs  of  employers  and  their  employees;  total  cost  management;  technology;  and
effectiveness of marketing and sales. Financial strength of the insurer, as indicated by ratings issued by nationally recognized rating agencies, is
also a competitive factor. We believe that our health advocacy capabilities, holistic approach to consumer engagement, breadth of product
offerings, clinical care and medical management capabilities and array of product funding options are competitive advantages in meeting the
diverse needs of our customer base. We also believe that our focus on helping to improve the health, well-being and sense of security of the
customers we serve will allow us to differentiate ourselves from our competitors.

Our primary competitors in our U.S.-based health care businesses include:

•

other national insurance and health services companies that provide group health insurance products, including Aetna, Anthem, Humana,
Kaiser Permanente and UnitedHealth Group;

•

not-for-profit managed care organizations, including Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans;

•

other  regional  stand-alone  managed  care  and  specialty  companies,  including  newer  health  plans  seeking  to  disrupt  in  part  through
technology (e.g. Bright Health and Oscar)

•

managed care organizations affiliated with major insurance companies and hospitals; and

•

national managed pharmacy, behavioral health and utilization review services companies.

Our primary competitors in the international health care business include U.S.-based insurers such as Aetna, UnitedHealth Group GeoBlue and
MetLife; global competitors such as BUPA and Allianz; and local and regional insurers in a range of countries.

In addition to our traditional competitors, new sources of competition continue to emerge. These newer competitors are focused on delivering
lower cost benefits and services through internet-enabled technology that allows consumers to take a more active role in the management of
their health. This can be accomplished through financial incentives, access to enhanced quality medical data and other information sharing.
The effective use of our health advocacy, customer insight and physician engagement capabilities, along with decision support tools (some of
which are web-based) and enabling technology are critical to success in the health care industry, and we believe our capabilities in these areas
will be competitive differentiators.

Industry Developments
The health insurance marketplace will continue to be shaped by the ACA over the near term. However, Congressional efforts to repeal and
replace the ACA, various executive actions of the Trump administration, and the repeal of the individual mandate as part of the recently signed
U.S. tax reform legislation make the future of the ACA uncertain. See the ‘‘Regulation’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors’’ sections of the Form 10-K for
additional discussion about these developments.

10 CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K

PART I
ITEM 1. Business

Principal Products and Services
Supplemental Health, Life and Accident Insurance
Supplemental health, life and accident insurance products generally provide simple, affordable coverage of risks for the health and financial
security of individuals. Supplemental health products provide specified payments for a variety of health risks and include personal accident,
accidental death, critical illness, hospitalization, travel, dental, cancer and other dread disease coverages. We also offer customers individual
private medical insurance, term and variable universal life insurance and certain savings products.

Medicare Supplement Plans
We offer individual Medicare Supplement plans that provide retirees with federally standardized Medigap-style plans. Retirees may select among
the various plans with specific plan options to meet their unique needs and may visit, without the need for a referral, any health care professional or
facility that accepts Medicare throughout the United States.

Pricing and Reinsurance
Premium rates for our global supplemental benefits products are based on assumptions about mortality, morbidity, customer acquisition and
retention, customer demographics, expenses and target profit margins, as well as interest rates. For variable universal life insurance products, fees
consist of mortality, administrative, asset management and surrender charges assessed against the contractholder’s fund balance. Mortality
charges on variable universal life may be adjusted prospectively to reflect expected mortality experience. Most contracts permit premium rate
changes at least annually.

A global approach to underwriting risk management allows each local business to underwrite and accept risk within specified limits. Retentions
are centrally managed through cost effective use of external reinsurance to limit our liability on per life, per risk and per event (catastrophe) bases.

Markets and Distribution
Our supplemental health, life and accident insurance products sold in foreign countries are generally marketed through distribution partners with
whom the individual insured has an affinity relationship. These products are sold primarily through direct marketing channels, such as outbound
telemarketing, and in-branch bancassurance (when we partner with a bank and use the bank’s sales channels to sell our insurance products).
Marketing campaigns are conducted through these channels under a variety of arrangements with affinity partners, including banks, credit card
companies and other financial and non-financial institutions. We also market directly to consumers via direct response television and the Internet.
In certain countries, we market our products through captive and third party brokers and agents. Our Medicare supplement product line is
distributed primarily through independent agents and telemarketing directly to the consumer.

South Korea represents our single largest geographic market for Global Supplemental Benefits. For information on this concentration of risk for
the Global Supplemental Benefits segment’s business in South Korea, see ‘‘Other Items Affecting Results of Global Supplemental Benefits’’ in the
Global Supplemental Benefits section of the MD&A beginning on page 49 of this Form 10-K.

For our supplemental health, life and accident insurance products sold in foreign markets we are increasingly exposed to geopolitical, currency
and other risks inherent in foreign operations. Also, given that we bill and collect a significant portion of premiums through credit cards, a
substantial contraction in consumer credit could impact our ability to retain existing policies and sell new policies. A decline in customer retention
would  result  in  both  a  reduction  of  revenue  and  an  acceleration  of  the  amortization  of  acquisition-related  costs.  Changes  in  regulation  for
permitted distribution channels also may impact our business or results.

Competition
We expect that the competitive environment for global supplemental benefits will continue to intensify as U.S., Europe and other regionally-based
insurance and financial services providers more aggressively pursue expansion opportunities across geographies, especially in Asia. We believe
competitive factors will include branding, product and distribution innovation and differentiation, efficient management of marketing processes
and costs, commission levels paid to distribution partners, the quality of claims, local network coverage, customer services and talent acquisition
and retention. Additionally, in most overseas markets, perception of financial strength also will likely continue to be an important competitive
factor.

Our competitors are primarily locally-based insurance companies, including insurance subsidiaries of banks primarily in Asia and Europe and
multi-national companies. Insurance company competitors in this segment primarily focus on traditional product distribution through captive
agents, with direct marketing being secondary channels. We estimate that we have less than 3% market share of the total insurance premiums in
any given market in which we operate.

In the Medicare supplement business, the principal competitive factors are underwriting and pricing, relative operating efficiency, broker relations
and the quality of claims and customer service. Our primary competitors in this business include U.S.-based health insurance companies.

Industry Developments
Pressure on social health care systems, a rapidly aging population and increased wealth and education in developing insurance markets are
leading to higher demand for products providing health insurance and financial security. In the supplemental health, life and accident business,
direct marketing channels continue to grow and attract new competitors with industry consolidation among financial institutions and other affinity
partners.

Data privacy regulation has tightened in all markets in the wake of data privacy news scandals, impacting affinity partner and customer attitudes
toward direct marketing of insurance and other financial services.

Most of the businesses in this segment operate through foreign subsidiaries. We continue to maintain a capital management strategy to retain
overseas a significant portion of the earnings from these foreign operations. These undistributed earnings are deployed outside of the United
States in support of the liquidity and capital requirements of our foreign operations. As a result of U.S. tax reform legislation enacted in
December 2017, we recorded additional U.S. taxes of $88 million related to the Company’s accumulated unremitted foreign earnings. Most of
these  taxes  were  incurred  in  the  Global  Supplemental  Benefits  segment.  See  the  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  section  of  this

Our Group Disability and Life business markets its products and services in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin
Islands and Canada.

Products and Services
Group Disability
Long-term and short-term group disability insurance products generally provide a fixed level of income to replace a portion of wages lost
because of disability. Group disability coverage is typically employer-paid or a combination of employer and employee-paid, but also may
include coverage paid for entirely by employees. As part of our group disability insurance products, we also provide assistance to employees in
returning to work and assistance to employers with resources to manage the cost of employee disability. We are an industry leader in helping
employees return to work quickly, resulting in higher productivity and lower cost for employers and a better quality of life for their employees.

We seek to integrate the administration of our disability insurance products with other disability benefit programs, behavioral programs,
medical programs, social security advocacy and administration of federal Family and Medical Leave Act (‘‘FMLA’’), State Leave Laws and other
leave of absence programs. We believe this integration provides our customers with increased efficiency and effectiveness in disability claims
management, enhances productivity and reduces overall costs to employers. This integration also provides early insight into employees at risk
for future disability claims. Coordinating the administration of these disability programs with medical programs offered by our health care
business provides enhanced opportunities to influence outcomes, reduce the cost of both medical and disability events and improve the return
to work rate. The benefits of this integrated approach also include:

•

•

using information from the health care and disability databases to help identify, treat and manage disabilities before they become longer in
duration or chronic and more costly; and

proactively reaching out to assist employees suffering from a mental health or chronic condition, either as a primary condition or as a result of
another condition.

Our disability products and services are offered on a fully insured, experience-rated and ASO basis, although most are fully insured. As
measured by 2017 premiums and fees, disability constituted 51% of this segment’s business. Approximately 15,400 disability insurance policies
covering approximately 8.8 million lives were in force as of December 31, 2017.

Group Life Insurance
Group life insurance products offered include term life and universal life. Group term life insurance may be employer-paid basic life insurance,
employee-paid  supplemental  life  insurance  or  a  combination  thereof.  Group  universal  life  insurance  is  an  employee-paid,  voluntary  life
insurance product in which the owner may accumulate a cash value. The cash value earns interest at rates declared from time to time, subject to
a minimum guaranteed contracted rate, and may be borrowed, withdrawn, or, within certain limits, used to fund future life insurance coverage.

12 CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K

PART I
ITEM 1. Business

As measured by 2017 premiums and fees, group life insurance constituted approximately 43% of this segment’s business. Approximately 9,200
group life insurance policies covering approximately 6.5 million lives were in force as of December 31, 2017.

Other Products and Services
We  also  offer  personal  accident  insurance  coverage,  consisting  primarily  of  accidental  death  and  dismemberment  and  travel  accident
insurance to employers. Group accident insurance may be employer-paid or employee-paid. In addition, we offer specialty insurance services
that  consist  primarily  of  disability  and  life,  accident  and  hospital  indemnity  products  to  professional  or  trade  associations  and  financial
institutions.

We also provide a number of voluntary products and services that are typically paid by the employee and offered at the employer’s worksite.
Our plans provide employers with administrative solutions designed to provide employers with a complete and simple way to manage their
benefits program. In recent years, we have brought to market three additional voluntary offerings: accidental injury insurance, critical illness
coverage and hospital indemnity. These products provide additional dollar payouts to employees for unexpected accidents, hospitalization or
more serious illnesses.

Pricing and Reinsurance
Premiums charged for disability and term life insurance products are usually established in advance of the policy period and are generally
guaranteed  for  one  to  three  years  and  selectively  guaranteed  for  up  to  five  years;  policies  are  generally  subject  to  termination  by  the
policyholder or by the insurance company annually. Premium rates reflect assumptions about future claims, expenses, credit risk, investment
returns and profit margins. These assumptions may be based in whole or in part on prior experience of the account or on a pool of accounts,
depending on the group size and the statistical credibility of the experience that varies by product.

Premiums for group universal life insurance products consist of mortality and administrative charges assessed against the policyholder’s fund
balance.  Interest  credited  and  mortality  charges  for  group  universal  life  may  be  adjusted  prospectively  to  reflect  expected  interest  and
mortality experience. Mortality charges are subject to maximum guaranteed rates and interest credited on cash values is subject to minimum
guaranteed rates as stated in the policy.

The premiums for these products are typically collected within the coverage year and then invested in assets that match the duration of the
expected  benefit  payments  that  occur  over  many  future  years  (primarily  for  disability  benefits).  With  significant  investments  in  longer-
duration securities, net investment income is a critical element of profitability for this segment.

The effectiveness of return-to-work programs and morbidity levels will impact the profitability of disability insurance products. Our previous
claim experience and industry data indicate a correlation between disability claim incidence levels and economic conditions, with submitted
claims rising under adverse economic conditions, although this impact is not clear. For life insurance products, the degree to which future
experience deviates from mortality and expense assumptions also affects profitability.

To reduce our exposure to large individual and catastrophic losses under group life, disability and accidental death policies, as well as our more
recent accidental injury and critical illness policies, we purchase reinsurance from a diverse group of unaffiliated reinsurers. Our comprehensive
reinsurance program consists of excess of loss treaties and catastrophe coverage designed to mitigate earnings volatility and provide surplus
protection.

Markets and Distribution
We market our group disability and life insurance products and services to employers, employees, professional and other associations and
groups in the National, Middle Market and Select segments (see definitions of these segments on page 9). In marketing these products, we
primarily sell through insurance brokers and consultants and employ a direct sales force consisting of approximately 250 sales professionals in
27 office locations as of December 31, 2017.

Competition
The principal competitive factors that affect the Group Disability and Life segment are underwriting and pricing, the quality and effectiveness
of claims management, relative operating efficiency, investment and risk management, distribution methodologies and producer relations, the
breadth and variety of products and services offered, the quality of customer service and, more importantly, the state of the tools and
technology  available  for  customers,  clients,  consultants  and  producers.  For  certain  products  with  longer-term  liabilities,  such  as  group
long-term disability insurance, the financial strength of the insurer, as indicated by ratings issued by nationally recognized rating agencies, is
also a competitive factor.

The principal competitors of our group disability, life and accident businesses are other large and regional insurance companies that market
and distribute these or similar types of products and include Unum, The Hartford, Prudential, Lincoln and MetLife.

As of December 31, 2017, we are one of the top providers of group disability, life and accident insurance in the United States, based on
premiums.

Industry Developments
Employers are expressing a growing interest in employee wellness, absence management and productivity and likewise are recognizing a
strong  link  between  employee  health,  productivity  and  their  profitability.  As  this  interest  grows,  we  believe  our  healthy  lifestyle  and
return-to-work programs and integrated family medical leave, disability and health care programs position us to deliver integrated solutions for
employers and employees. We also believe that our strong disability management portfolio and fully integrated programs provide tools for
employers and employees to improve health status. This focus on managing the employee’s total absence enables us to increase the number
and effectiveness of interventions and minimize disabling events.

CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K 13

PART I
ITEM 1. Business

The group insurance market remains highly competitive as the rising cost of providing medical coverage to employees has forced companies to
re-evaluate their overall employee benefit spending, resulting in lower volumes of group disability and life insurance business and more
competitive  pricing.  Demographic  shifts  have  further  driven  demand  for  products  and  services  that  are  sufficiently  flexible  to  meet  the
evolving needs of employers and employees who want innovative, cost-effective solutions to their insurance needs. Employers continue to
shift towards greater employee participatory coverage and voluntary purchases. With our broad suite of voluntary offerings and continued
focus on developing additional voluntary products and service capabilities, we believe we are well positioned to meet the needs of both
employers and employees as the market shifts to become more retail-focused.

Over the past few years, there has been heightened review by state regulators of the claims handling practices within the disability and life
insurance industry. This has resulted in an increase in coordinated, multi-state examinations that target specific market practices in addition to
regularly recurring examinations of an insurer’s overall operations conducted by an individual state’s regulators. We have been subject to such
an examination over the past several years. See Note 21(E) to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

The depressed level of interest rates in the United States over the last several years has constrained earnings growth in this segment due to
lower yields on our fixed-income investments and higher benefit expenses resulting from the discounting of future claim payments at lower
interest rates.

Other Operations
Other Operations includes the following four businesses:

Corporate-owned Life Insurance
The principal products of the COLI business are permanent insurance contracts sold to corporations to provide coverage on the lives of certain
employees for the purpose of financing employer-paid future benefit obligations. Permanent life insurance provides coverage that, when
adequately funded, does not expire after a term of years. The contracts are primarily non-participating universal life policies. Fees for universal
life insurance products consist primarily of mortality and administrative charges assessed against the policyholder’s fund balance. Interest
credited and mortality charges for universal life and mortality charges on variable universal life may be adjusted prospectively to reflect
expected interest and mortality experience. To reduce our exposure to large individual and catastrophe losses, we purchase reinsurance from
unaffiliated reinsurers.

Run-off Settlement Annuity Business
Our  settlement  annuity  business  is  a  closed,  run-off  block  of  single  premium  annuity  contracts.  These  contracts  are  primarily  liability
settlements with approximately 20% of the liabilities associated with payments that are guaranteed and not contingent on survivorship. For
contracts  that  involve  non-guaranteed  payments,  such  payments  are  contingent  on  the  survival  of  one  or  more  parties  involved  in  the
settlement.

Run-off Reinsurance
Our reinsurance operations are an inactive business in run-off mode.

In February 2013, we effectively exited the guaranteed minimum death benefit (‘‘GMDB’’) and guaranteed minimum income benefit (‘‘GMIB’’)
business by reinsuring 100% of our future exposures, net of retrocessional arrangements in place at that time, up to a specified limit. For
additional information regarding this reinsurance transaction and the arrangements that secure our reinsurance recoverables, see Note 9 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Individual Life Insurance and Annuity and Retirement Benefits Businesses
This business includes deferred gains recognized from the 1998 sale of the individual life insurance and annuity business and the 2004 sale of
the retirement benefits business. For more information regarding the arrangements that secure our reinsurance recoverables for the retirement
benefits business, see Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Investments and Investment Income
General Accounts
Our investment operations provide investment management and related services for our corporate invested assets and the insurance-related
invested assets in our General Account (‘‘General Account Invested Assets’’). We acquire or originate, directly or through intermediaries, a
broad range of investments including private placement and public securities, commercial mortgage loans, real estate, mezzanine, private
equity partnerships and short-term investments. Invested assets also include policy loans that are fully collateralized by insurance policy cash
values. Invested assets are managed primarily by our subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, external managers with whom our subsidiaries
contract. Net investment income is included as a component of adjusted income from operations for each of our reporting segments and
Corporate. Realized investment gains (losses) are reported by segment but excluded from adjusted income from operations. For additional
information  about  invested  assets,  see  the  ‘‘Investment  Assets’’  section  of  the  MD&A  beginning  on  page  52  and  Notes  10  to  12  of  our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

We manage our investment portfolios to reflect the underlying characteristics of related insurance and contractholder liabilities and capital
requirements,  as  well  as  regulatory  and  tax  considerations  pertaining  to  those  liabilities  and  state  investment  laws.  Insurance  and
contractholder liabilities range from short duration health care products to longer term obligations associated with disability and life insurance
products and the run-off settlement annuity business. Assets supporting these liabilities are managed in segregated investment portfolios to

14 CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K

PART I
ITEM 1. Business

facilitate matching of asset durations and cash flows to those of corresponding liabilities. Investment strategy and results are affected by the
amount and timing of cash available for investment, competition for investments, economic conditions, interest rates and asset allocation
decisions. We routinely monitor and evaluate the status of our investments, obtaining and analyzing relevant investment-specific information
and assessing current economic conditions, trends in capital markets and other factors such as industry sector, geographic and property-
specific information.

Separate Accounts
Our subsidiaries or external advisors manage Separate Account invested assets on behalf of contractholders; including the Cigna Pension Plan,
variable universal life products sold through our corporate-owned life insurance business, and other disability and life products. These assets
are legally segregated from our other businesses and are not included in General Account Invested Assets. Income, gains and losses generally
accrue directly to the contractholders.

Regulation
The laws and regulations governing our business continue to increase each year and are subject to frequent change. We are regulated by state,
federal and international regulatory agencies that generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. These
regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically.
Domestic and international governments continue to enact and consider various legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially
impact the health care system.

Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. These subsidiaries are subject to
numerous state, federal and international regulations related to their business operations, including, but not limited to:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

the form and content of customer contracts including benefit mandates (including special requirements for small groups);
premium rates and medical loss ratios;
the content of agreements with participating providers of covered services;
producer appointment and compensation;
claims processing, payment and appeals;
underwriting practices;
reinsurance arrangements;
solvency and financial reporting;
unfair trade and claim practices;
market conduct;
protecting the privacy and confidentiality of the information received from customers;
risk sharing arrangements with providers;
reimbursement or payment levels for Medicare services;
reimbursement or payment levels for out-of-network emergency care services;
claim appeal procedures;
provider directory and network adequacy requirements;
advertising; and
the operation of consumer-directed plans (including health savings accounts, health reimbursement accounts, flexible spending accounts
and debit cards).

The business of administering and insuring employee benefit programs in the United States, particularly health care programs, is heavily
regulated by state and federal laws and administrative agencies, such as state departments of insurance, and federal agencies including HHS,
CMS, the Internal Revenue Service (‘‘IRS’’) and the Departments of Labor (‘‘DOL’’), Treasury and Justice (‘‘DOJ’’), as well as the courts. Health
savings accounts, health reimbursement accounts and flexible spending accounts also are regulated by the Department of the Treasury and
the IRS.

Our operations, accounts and other books and records are subject to examination at regular intervals by regulatory agencies, including state
insurance and health and welfare departments, state boards of pharmacy, CMS, DOL, and comparable international regulators to assess
compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, our current and past business practices are subject to review by, and from time to
time  we  receive  subpoenas  and  other  requests  of  information  from  various  state  insurance  and  health  care  regulatory  authorities,  state
attorneys general, the Office of Inspector General (‘‘OIG’’), the DOJ, the DOL and other state, federal and international authorities, including
inquiries by, and testimony before committees and subcommittees of the U.S. Congress regarding certain of our business practices. These
examinations, reviews, subpoenas and requests may result in changes to or clarifications of our business practices, as well as fines, penalties or
other sanctions.

Our international subsidiaries are subject to regulations in international jurisdictions where foreign insurers may face more rigorous regulations
than their domestic competitors. In addition, the expansion of our operations into foreign countries increases our exposure to certain U.S. laws,
such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (‘‘FCPA’’). See page 19 for further discussion of international regulations.

Patient Protection and the Affordable Care Act (ACA)
The ACA mandated broad changes affecting insured and self-insured health benefit plans that impact our current business model, including
our relationship with current and future producers and health care providers, products, services, processes and technology. Several bills were

CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K 15

PART I
ITEM 1. Business

introduced in Congress in 2017 to repeal and replace the ACA, though none had passed the House and Senate. Discussions on the ACA
continue in Congress.

Throughout 2017, President Trump took several steps to limit the utility of the ACA. In January 2017, he signed an executive order instructing
agencies to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the ACA that would impose a
fiscal burden on any state or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, providers, insurers, recipients of health care services,
purchasers of health insurance or makers of medical devices, products or medications. In October 2017, President Trump issued another
executive  order  that  could  result  in  significant  changes  to  the  individual  and  group  health  insurance  markets.  Among  other  things,  the
executive order permits the expansion of association health plans where small businesses and individuals join together to form a plan. It may
also expand the use of short term health plans that generally have lower premiums and less coverage than policies sold on the exchanges. At
this time, we are unable to determine the effect, if any, of these actions on our business or results of operations.

Also in October 2017, the Trump administration stopped payment of cost-sharing reduction subsidies to insurers. Cost-sharing reduction
subsidies lower the amount that qualifying customers pay for deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. The federal government had provided
funding for the cost-sharing reduction subsidies to the qualifying customer’s insurer until the President’s executive order. The attorneys
general of 18 states and the District of Columbia have sued the Trump administration, seeking to require the administration to continue paying
these subsidies. While the litigation is at a preliminary stage, in October 2017, the court denied the attorney generals’ request for an injunction,
allowing the government to cease providing the cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers during the pendency of the matter. We will
continue to monitor developments as the case proceeds.

In December 2017, the U.S. tax reform legislation was signed into law that, among other things, repealed the penalty charged to individuals
without health insurance, known as the ‘‘individual mandate,’’ effective January 1, 2019.

As a result of these actions, the future of the ACA is uncertain.

Key Provisions of the ACA
Various fees, including the health insurance industry tax, were assessed beginning in 2014. The health insurance industry assessment, totaling
$14.3 billion in 2018, is not tax deductible. While federal appropriations legislation imposed a one-year moratorium on the industry tax for 2017
and 2019, the industry tax has been reinstated for 2018. For 2020 and beyond, the annual industry tax will equal the amount for the preceding
year increased by a rate of premium growth for the preceding year less the rate of growth in the consumer price index for the preceding
calendar year. Our share of this industry tax is determined based on our proportion of premiums for both our commercial and government risk
businesses to the industry total.

Each state has a state-based, a state and federal partnership, or a federally-facilitated health insurance exchange for individuals and small
employer groups to purchase insurance coverage. Because individuals seeking to purchase health insurance coverage either on or off the
exchanges are guaranteed to be issued a policy, the ACA provided programs designed to reduce the risk for participating health insurance
companies. The ACA includes a permanent program that adjusts premiums based on the relative health status of the customer base (‘‘risk
adjustment’’). Two other programs, a reinsurance program and a risk corridor program, were temporary in nature (2014-2016).

MLR requirements, as prescribed by HHS, require payment of premium rebates to group and individual policyholders if certain annual MLRs are
not met in our commercial business. Expatriate health coverage is excluded from certain provisions of the ACA, including the MLR requirement.

Other provisions of the ACA in effect include reduced Medicare Advantage premium rates, the requirement to cover preventive services with
no enrollee cost-sharing, banning the use of lifetime and annual limits on the dollar amount of essential health benefits, increasing restrictions
on rescinding coverage and extending coverage of dependents to the age of 26. The employer mandate requires employers with 50 or more
full-time employees to offer affordable health insurance that provides minimum value (each as defined under the ACA) to full-time employees
and dependent children up to age 26 or be subject to penalties based on employer size. The ACA also changed certain tax laws that effectively
limit tax deductions for certain employee compensation paid by health insurers.

Management continues to be actively engaged with the Trump administration, Congress, regulators and policymakers with respect to the ACA.
However, President Trump’s and Congress’ attempts to scale back the ACA, such as through the repeal of the individual mandate, regulatory
challenges to the ACA, and pending litigation challenging aspects of the law and related executive orders, will continue to create uncertainty
about the ultimate impact of the ACA.

See also the ‘‘Executive Overview’’ section of our MD&A beginning on page 35 of this Form 10-K. In addition, accounting policies around the
government’s risk mitigation programs are further disclosed in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Medicare and Medicaid Regulations
Several of our subsidiaries engage in businesses that are subject to federal Medicare regulations, such as:
•
•

those offering individual and group Medicare Advantage coverage; and
those offering Medicare Pharmacy (Part D) products.

In our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D business, we contract with CMS to provide services to Medicare beneficiaries. As a result, our
ability to obtain payment (and the determination of the amount of such payments), enroll and retain members and expand into new service
areas is subject to compliance with CMS’ numerous and complex regulations and requirements that are frequently modified and subject to
administrative discretion. Marketing and sales activities (including those of third-party brokers and agents) are also heavily regulated by CMS
and other governmental agencies, including applicable state departments of insurance. We will continue to allocate significant resources to our
compliance,  ethics  and  fraud,  waste  and  abuse  programs  to  comply  with  the  laws  and  regulations  governing  Medicare  Advantage  and
Medicare Part D programs.

Our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plan businesses also have been impacted by the ACA (and other programs) in
a variety of ways, including mandated minimum reductions to risk scores, transition of Medicare Advantage ‘‘benchmark’’ rates to Medicare

16 CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K

PART I
ITEM 1. Business

fee-for-service parity, reduced enrollment periods and limitations on disenrollment and mandated consumer discounts on brand name and
generic prescription drugs for Medicare Part D plan participants in the coverage gap.

The ACA ties a portion of each Medicare Advantage plan’s and Medicare Part D plan’s reimbursement to the plan’s ‘‘Star Rating’’ by CMS; those
plans receiving a rating of four or more stars are eligible for quality-based bonus payments. The Star Rating system considers various measures
adopted by CMS, including, for example, quality of care, preventative services, chronic illness management, coverage determinations and
appeals and customer satisfaction. The star rating system is subject to change annually by CMS, which may make it more difficult to achieve
four stars or greater.

The ACA requires Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D plans to meet a minimum MLR of 85%. If the MLR for a CMS contract is less than
85%, we are required to pay a penalty to CMS and could be required to make additional payments or be subject to other penalties if the MLR
continues to be less than 85% for successive years. Through the ACA and other federal legislation, funding for Medicare Advantage plans has
been and may continue to be altered.

Our Medicaid and dual eligible products are also regulated by CMS and state Medicaid agencies that audit our performance to determine
compliance with contracts and regulations. We continue to work in collaboration with applicable state agencies regarding our Medicaid plan in
Texas to ensure ongoing compliance and sustainability.

Section 111 of the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 requires us to report specific information regarding claimants and claim
settlements involving Medicare participants so CMS can recover Medicare funds expended to provide health care treatment to the claimant.

Strict sanctions, including fines and penalties, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties may be imposed for
non-compliance with these laws and regulations.

Federal and State Audits of Government-Sponsored Health Care Programs
Participation in government-sponsored health care programs subjects us to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations and risks
associated with audits conducted under these programs. These audits may occur in years subsequent to our providing the relevant services.
These risks may include potential fines and penalties, restrictions on our ability to participate or expand our presence in certain programs and
restrictions on marketing our plans. For example, with respect to our Medicare Advantage business, CMS and the OIG perform audits to
determine a health plan’s compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations, including program audits, compliance with proper
coding practices (sometimes referred to as ‘‘Risk Adjustment Data Validation Audits’’ or ‘‘RADV audits’’). For our Medicare Part D business,
compliance with fraud and abuse enforcement practices is monitored through Recovery Audit Contractor (‘‘RAC’’) audits in which third-party
contractors  conduct  post-payment  reviews  on  a  contingency  fee  basis  to  detect  and  correct  improper  payments.  In  addition,  negative
performance  points  may  be  accumulated  for  noncompliance,  including  failure  to  perform  satisfactorily  during  an  audit.  Negative  past
performance points could restrict our ability to expand our Medicare Advantage business geographically. The DOJ is currently conducting an
industry review of the risk adjustment data submission practices and business processes, including review of medical charts, of Medicare
Advantage organizations under Medicare Parts C and D.

The  federal  government  has  made  investigating  and  prosecuting  health  care  fraud,  waste  and  abuse  a  priority.  Fraud,  waste  and  abuse
prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities, including kickbacks for inducement to refer customers, billing for unnecessary medical
services, coding, network adequacy and improper marketing. The False Claims Act (which includes whistleblower provisions) enables the
federal government to bring a lawsuit against an entity that it believes has knowingly presented a false or fraudulent request for payment from
the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. The regulations and contractual
requirements in this area are complex, are frequently modified, and are subject to administrative discretion and judicial interpretation. A
number of states have also adopted false claims acts and whistleblower provisions. We expect to continue to allocate significant resources to
comply with these regulations and requirements and to maintain audit readiness.

Pharmacy-related Laws and Regulations
Certain of our subsidiaries are pharmacies that dispense prescription drugs to participants of benefit plans administered or insured by our
HMO and insurance company subsidiaries. These pharmacy-subsidiaries are subject to state licensing requirements and regulation as well as
U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency registration requirements, U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements and third party accreditation
requirements. Other laws and regulations affecting our pharmacy-subsidiaries include federal and state laws concerning labeling, packaging,
advertising, handling and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances.

Our pharmacy benefit management (PBM) services are subject to numerous laws and regulations, including, for example the False Claims Act
and federal and state anti-kickback laws. These laws and regulations govern, and proposed legislation and regulations may govern, critical PBM
practices, including disclosure, receipt and retention of rebates and other payments received from pharmaceutical manufacturers; receipt and
retention of transmission fees from contracted pharmacies; use of, administration of, and/or changes to drug formularies, maximum allowable
cost  list  pricing,  and/or  clinical  programs;  disclosure  of  data  to  third  parties;  drug  utilization  management  practices;  the  level  of  duty  a
pharmacy benefit manager owes its customers; configuration of pharmacy networks; the operations of our subsidiary pharmacies; disclosure
of negotiated provider reimbursement rates; calculation of customer cost share for prescription drug claims; disclosure of fees associated with
administrative service agreements and patient care programs that are attributable to customers’ drug utilization; and registration or licensing
of pharmacy benefit managers.

Other Federal and State Regulations
Employee Retirement Income Security Act and the Public Health Service Act
Our domestic subsidiaries sell most of their products and services to sponsors of employee benefit plans that are governed by the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (‘‘ERISA’’). ERISA is a complex set of federal laws and regulations enforced by the IRS and
the Department of Labor, as well as the courts. ERISA regulates certain aspects of the relationship between us, the employers that maintain
employee  welfare  benefit  plans  subject  to  ERISA  and  participants  in  such  plans.  Our  domestic  subsidiaries  are  subject  to  requirements

CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K 17

PART I
ITEM 1. Business

imposed by ERISA affecting claim payment and appeals procedures for individual health insurance and insured and self-insured group health
plans and for the insured dental, disability, life and accident plans we administer. Our domestic subsidiaries also may contractually agree to
comply with these requirements on behalf of the self-insured dental, disability, life and accident plans they administer.

Many provisions of the ACA impacting insured and self-insured group health plans were incorporated into ERISA. The health insurance reform
provisions under ERISA were also incorporated into the Public Health Service Act and are directly applicable to health insurance issuers
(i.e., health insurers and HMOs).

Plans subject to ERISA also can be subject to state laws and the legal question of whether and to what extent ERISA preempts a state law will
continue to be subject to court interpretation.

Privacy, Security and Data Standards Regulations
The  federal  Health  Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability  Act  of  1996  and  its  implementing  regulations  (‘‘HIPAA’’)  imposes  minimum
standards on health insurers, HMOs, health plans, health care providers and clearinghouses for the privacy and security of protected health
information. HIPAA also established rules that standardize the format and content of certain electronic transactions, including, but not limited
to, eligibility and claims.

The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (‘‘HITECH’’) imposes additional contracting requirements for covered
entities, the extension of privacy and security provisions to business associates, the requirement to provide notification to various parties in the
event of a data breach of protected health information, and enhanced financial penalties for HIPAA violations, including potential criminal
penalties for individuals. In the conduct of our business, depending on the circumstances, we may act as either a covered entity or a business
associate.

The federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act generally places restrictions on the disclosure of non-public information to non-affiliated third parties,
and requires financial institutions, including insurers, to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal information is
used, including an opportunity to ‘‘opt out’’ of certain disclosures. State departments of insurance and certain federal agencies adopted
implementing regulations as required by federal law.

A number of states have adopted data security laws and regulations regulating data security and requiring security breach notification that
may apply to us in certain circumstances and are increasingly focused on protecting individuals from identity theft. Neither HIPAA nor the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley  privacy  regulations  preempt  more  stringent  state  laws  and  regulations.  In  addition,  international  laws,  rules  and
regulations governing the use and disclosure of personal information are generally more stringent than in the United States, and they vary from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

The  Cybersecurity  Information  Sharing  Act  of  2015  (‘‘CISA’’)  encourages  organizations  to  share  cyber  threat  indicators  with  the  federal
government and, among other things, directs HHS to develop a set of voluntary cybersecurity best practices for organizations in the health
care industry. States have also begun to issue regulations specifically related to cybersecurity. In October 2017, the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners (‘‘NAIC’’) adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law that creates rules for insurers and other covered entities
addressing data security, investigation and notification of breaches. This includes maintaining an information security program based on
ongoing risk assessment, overseeing third-party service providers, investigating data breaches and notifying regulators of a cybersecurity
event. As the model law is intended to serve as model legislation only, states will need to enact legislation for the model law to become
mandatory and enforceable. We will continue to monitor states’ activity regarding cybersecurity regulation.

Consumer Protection Laws
We engage in direct-to-consumer activities and are increasingly offering mobile and web-based solutions to our customers. We are therefore
subject to federal and state regulations applicable to electronic communications and other consumer protection laws and regulations, such as
the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the CAN-SPAM Act. In particular, the Federal Trade Commission is increasingly exercising its
enforcement authority in the areas of consumer privacy and data security, with a focus on web-based, mobile data and ‘‘big data.’’ Federal
consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information.

Dodd-Frank Act and Investment-Related Regulations
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ‘‘Dodd-Frank Act’’) provides for a number of reforms and regulations in
the corporate governance, financial reporting and disclosure, investments, tax and enforcement areas. The Dodd-Frank Act established a
Federal Insurance Office (the ‘‘FIO’’) to develop federal policy on insurance matters. While the FIO does not have authority over health
insurance, it may have authority over other parts of our business, such as life insurance. Additional rulemaking by the SEC and other regulatory
authorities continues. In February 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct a review
of the Dodd-Frank Act. We continue to monitor how these regulations might impact us.

Depending upon their nature, our investment management activities are subject to U.S. federal securities laws, ERISA and other federal and
state  laws  governing  investment  related  activities.  In  many  cases,  the  investment  management  activities  and  investments  of  individual
insurance companies are subject to regulation by multiple jurisdictions.

Office of Foreign Assets Control Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering
We also are subject to regulation by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury that administers and enforces
economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes.

Certain of our products are subject to Department of the Treasury anti-money laundering regulations under the Bank Secrecy Act.

In addition, we may be subject to similar regulations in non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate.

18 CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K

ITEM 1. Business

Regulation of Insurance Companies
Financial Reporting, Internal Control and Corporate Governance
Regulators  closely  monitor  the  financial  condition  of  licensed  insurance  companies  and  HMOs.  States  regulate  the  form  and  content  of
statutory financial statements, the type and concentration of permitted investments, and corporate governance over financial reporting. Our
insurance and HMO subsidiaries are required to file periodic financial reports and schedules with regulators in most of the jurisdictions in which
they do business as well as annual financial statements audited by independent registered public accounting firms. Certain insurance and HMO
subsidiaries are required to file an annual report of internal control over financial reporting with most jurisdictions in which they do business.
Insurance and HMO subsidiaries’ operations and accounts are subject to examination by such agencies. Many states have expanded regulations
relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of insurance and HMO subsidiaries as a result of model regulations adopted by
the NAIC with elements similar to corporate governance and risk oversight disclosure requirements under federal securities laws.

Guaranty Associations, Indemnity Funds, Risk Pools and Administrative Funds
Most states and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions require insurance companies to support guaranty associations or indemnity funds that are
established to pay claims on behalf of insolvent insurance companies. Some states have similar laws relating to HMOs and other payers, such as
consumer operated and oriented plans (co-ops) established under the ACA. In the United States, these associations levy assessments on
member insurers licensed in a particular state to pay such claims. Certain states require HMOs to participate in guaranty funds, special risk
pools and administrative funds. For additional information about guaranty fund and other assessments, see Note 21 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Certain states continue to require health insurers and HMOs to participate in assigned risk plans, joint underwriting authorities, pools or other
residual market mechanisms to cover risks not acceptable under normal underwriting standards, although some states have eliminated these
requirements as a result of the ACA.

Solvency and Capital Requirements
Many states have adopted some form of the NAIC model solvency-related laws and risk-based capital rules (‘‘RBC rules’’) for life and health
insurance companies. The RBC rules recommend a minimum level of capital depending on the types and quality of investments held, the types
of business written and the types of liabilities incurred. If the ratio of the insurer’s adjusted surplus to its risk-based capital falls below statutory
required minimums, the insurer could be subject to regulatory actions ranging from increased scrutiny to conservatorship.

In  addition,  various  non-U.S.  jurisdictions  prescribe  minimum  surplus  requirements  that  are  based  upon  solvency,  liquidity  and  reserve
coverage  measures.  Our  HMOs  and  life  and  health  insurance  subsidiaries,  as  well  as  non-U.S.  insurance  subsidiaries,  are  compliant  with
applicable RBC and non-U.S. surplus rules.

The  Risk  Management  and  Own  Risk  and  Solvency  Assessment  Model  Act  (‘‘ORSA’’),  adopted  by  the  NAIC,  provides  requirements  and
principles for maintaining a group solvency assessment and a risk management framework and reflects a broader approach to U.S. insurance
regulation. ORSA includes a requirement to file an annual ORSA Summary Report in the lead state of domicile. To date, an overwhelming
majority of the states have adopted the same or similar versions of ORSA. We file our ORSA report annually as required.

Holding Company Laws
Our domestic insurance companies and certain of our HMOs are subject to state laws regulating subsidiaries of insurance holding companies.
Under such laws, certain dividends, distributions and other transactions between an insurance company or an HMO subsidiary and its affiliates
may require notification to, or approval by, one or more state insurance commissioners. In addition, the holding company acts of states in which
our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or HMO subsidiary without prior
regulatory approval.

Marketing, Advertising and Products
In most states, our insurance companies and HMO subsidiaries are required to certify compliance with applicable advertising regulations on an
annual basis. Our insurance companies and HMO subsidiaries are also required by most states to file and secure regulatory approval of
products prior to the marketing, advertising, and sale of such products.

Licensing Requirements
Certain subsidiaries contract to provide claim administration, utilization management and other related services for the administration of
self-insured  benefit  plans.  These  subsidiaries  may  be  subject  to  state  third-party  administration  and  other  licensing  requirements  and
regulation, as well as third party accreditation requirements.

Our international subsidiaries are often required to be licensed when entering new markets or starting new operations in certain jurisdictions.
The licensure requirements for these subsidiaries vary by country and are subject to change.

International Regulations
Our operations outside the United States expose us to laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies
and regulators, including those related to financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, data protection, data mining, data
transfer,  intellectual  property,  labor  and  employment,  consumer  protection,  direct-to-consumer  communications  activities,  tax,
anti-corruption and anti-money laundering. Foreign laws and rules may include requirements that are different from or more stringent than
similar requirements in the United States.

CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K 19

ITEM 1. Business

Our operations in countries outside the United States:
•
•
•

are subject to local regulations of the jurisdictions where we operate;
in some cases, are subject to regulations in the jurisdictions where customers reside; and
in all cases, are subject to the FCPA.

In particular, in South Korea where we are selling insurance products directly to individual customers, regulators are focused on protecting the
rights of individual customers by enforcing ‘‘Treating Customers Fairly’’ concepts. This regulatory focus results in rigorous data localization
requirements,  network  separation  obligations,  and  system  monitoring  restrictions,  as  well  as  obligations  to  closely  monitor  marketing
communications and sales scripts. Anti-money laundering requirements in South Korea also impose obligations on the Company to collect
certain information about each customer at time of sale and to risk rank each customer to determine possible future money laundering risk.

The FCPA prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official or employee
to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. Outside of the United States, we may interact with government officials
in several different capacities: as regulators of our insurance business; as clients or partners who are state-owned or partially state-owned; as
health care professionals who are employed by the government; and as hospitals that are state-owned. Violations of the FCPA and other
anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties, and the SEC and Department of Justice have
increased their enforcement activities with respect to FCPA. The UK Bribery Act of 2010 applies to all companies with a nexus to the United
Kingdom. Under this act, any voluntary disclosures of FCPA violations may be shared with United Kingdom authorities, thus potentially
exposing companies to liability and potential penalties in multiple jurisdictions.

If our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws governing our international operations, we may face investigations, prosecutions
and other legal proceedings and actions that could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies and criminal sanctions. See the Risk Factors
section beginning on page 21 for a discussion of risks related to our global operations.

Miscellaneous
Premiums and fees from CMS represented 17% of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 under a number of
contracts. We are not dependent on business from one or a few customers. Other than CMS, no one customer accounted for 10% or more of our
consolidated revenues in 2017. We are not dependent on business from one or a few brokers or agents. In addition, our insurance businesses are
generally not committed to accept a fixed portion of the business submitted by independent brokers and agents, and generally all such
business is subject to approval and acceptance.

We had approximately 46,000 employees as of December 31, 2017.

ITEM 1A.

 Risk Factors

As a large company operating in a complex industry, we encounter a variety of risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect
on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition or the trading price of our securities. You should carefully consider each of
the  risks  and  uncertainties  discussed  below,  together  with  other  information  contained  in  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  including
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we
face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect us. The
following risk factors have been organized by category for ease of use; however many of the risks may have impacts in more than one category.
These categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the
potential impact of the matters discussed. Risk factors are not necessarily listed in order of importance.

Strategic and Operational Risks
Future performance of our business will depend on our ability to execute our strategic and operational
initiatives effectively.
The  future  performance  of  our  business  will  depend  in  large  part  on  our  ability  to  effectively  implement  and  execute  our  strategic  and
operational initiatives including: (1) driving value creation in our targeted areas of business growth; (2) pursuing additional opportunities to
expand our capabilities through solutions, segments, distribution channels and geographies; and (3) creating additional value through capital
deployment. Successfully executing on these initiatives depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:

•

differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors;

•

•

develop and introduce new and innovative products or programs, particularly in response to government regulation and the increased focus
on consumer-directed products;

grow our commercial product portfolio, including managing the uncertainties associated with the mix and volume of business on public
health insurance exchanges;

•

identify and introduce the proper mix or integration of products that will be accepted by the marketplace;

•

attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees;

•

attract, develop and maintain collaborative relationships with a sufficient number of qualified partners, including physicians and other health
care providers in an environment of growing shortages of primary care professionals and consolidation within the provider industry;

•

attract new and maintain existing customer relationships;

•

transition health care providers from volume-based fee-for-service arrangements to a value-based system;

•

improve medical cost competitiveness in targeted markets;

•

manage our medical and administrative costs effectively;

•

identify and enter into strategic relationships;

•

manage our balance sheet exposures effectively, including our pension funding obligations; and

•

manage our Global Health Care operating expense ratio effectively.

If these initiatives fail or are not executed on effectively, our consolidated financial position and results of operations could be negatively
affected. For example, efforts to reduce operating expenses while maintaining the necessary resources and talent pool are important and, if
not managed effectively, could have long-term effects on our business by negatively impacting our ability to drive improvements in the quality
of our products and services. For our strategic initiatives to succeed, we must effectively integrate our operations, including our acquired
businesses, actively work to ensure consistency throughout the organization, and promote a global mind-set along with a focus on individual
customers. If we fail to do so, our business may be unable to grow as planned, or the result of expansion may be unsatisfactory. In addition, the
current competitive, economic and regulatory environment requires our organization to adapt rapidly and nimbly to new opportunities and
challenges. We will be unable to do so if we do not make important decisions quickly, define our appetite for risk specifically, implement new
governance, managerial and organizational processes smoothly and communicate roles and responsibilities clearly.

We face price competition and other pressures that could result in premiums that are insufficient to
cover the cost of the health care services delivered to our customers.
While health plans compete on the basis of many service and quality-related factors, we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis
of competition. Our client and customer contracts are subject to negotiation as clients and customers seek to contain their costs, including by
reducing benefits offered or elected. Increasingly, our clients seek to negotiate performance guarantees that require us to pay penalties if the
guaranteed performance standard is not met. As brokers and benefit consultants seek to enhance their revenue streams, they look to take on
services that we typically provide. Alternatively, our clients and customers may purchase different types of products that are less profitable, or
move to a competitor to obtain more favorable pricing. Each of these events would likely negatively impact our financial results.

Further, federal and state regulatory agencies may restrict our ability to implement changes in premium rates. For example, the ACA includes
an annual rate review requirement to prohibit unreasonable rate increases in the individual and small group health insurance markets and
established  minimum  medical  loss  ratios  for  certain  plans,  which  could  make  it  more  difficult  to  obtain  price  increases.  Fiscal  concerns
regarding the continued viability of programs such as Medicare may cause decreasing reimbursement rates, delays in premium payments or

CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K 21

PART I
ITEM 1A. Risk Factors

insufficient increases in reimbursement rates for government-sponsored programs in which we participate. Any limitation on our ability to
maintain or increase our premium or reimbursement levels, or a significant loss of customers resulting from our need to increase or maintain
premium or reimbursement levels, could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, factors such as business consolidations and strategic alliances will likely continue to create pressure to contain or otherwise restrict
price increases for products and services, despite increasing medical costs. Continuing consolidation among physicians, hospitals and other
health  care  providers,  the  emergence  of  accountable  care  organizations,  vertical  integration  of  health  care  providers  and  other  entities,
changes in the organizational structures chosen by physicians, hospitals and health care providers, new market entrants, including those not
traditionally in the health care industry, and the ability of larger employers to contract directly with providers may impact how we compete and
the way we price our products. Technological advancements, such as those that allow customers and providers to access medical information
remotely and telemedicine, may also affect how we compete and price our products. Our product margins and growth depend, in part, on our
ability to compete effectively in our markets, set prices appropriately in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share,
increase customers as planned, and avoid losing accounts with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing our customer
base in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience.

Premiums in the health care business are generally set for one-year periods and are priced well in advance of the date on which the contract
commences. Our revenue on Medicare policies is based on bids submitted mid-year in the year before the contract year. Although we base the
premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimate of future health care costs over the contract period, actual costs may exceed what
we estimate and charge in premiums due to factors such as medical cost inflation, higher than expected utilization of medical services, new or
costly drugs, treatments and technology and customer mix. Our health care costs also are affected by external events that we cannot forecast
or project and over which we have little or no control, such as influenza-related health care costs, epidemics, pandemics, terrorist attacks or
other man-made disasters, natural disasters or other events that materially increase utilization of medical and/or other covered services, as
well as changes in customers’ health care utilization patterns and provider billing practices. Relatively small differences between predicted and
actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenue can result in significant changes in our financial results. Our profitability
depends,  in  part,  on  our  ability  to  accurately  predict,  price  for  and  effectively  manage  future  health  care  costs  through  disciplined
underwriting, provider contracting, utilization management and product design.

The reserves we hold for expected medical claims are based on estimates that involve an extensive
degree of judgment and are inherently variable. If actual claims exceed our estimates, our operating
results could be materially adversely affected, and our ability to take timely corrective actions to contain
future costs may be limited.
We maintain and record medical claims reserves on our balance sheet for estimated future payments. Our estimates of health care costs
payable are based on a number of factors, including historical claim experience, but this estimation process requires extensive judgment.
Considerable variability is inherent in such estimates, and the accuracy of the estimates is highly sensitive to changes in medical claims
submission and processing patterns and/or procedures, changes in customer base and product mix, changes in the utilization of medical
and/or other covered services, changes in medical cost trends, changes in our medical management practices and the introduction of new
benefits and products. Furthermore, if we are not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends, our ability to take
timely corrective actions to limit future costs and reflect our current benefit cost experience in our pricing process may be limited. In addition,
while we continually review estimates of future payments relating to medical claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods
and make adjustments to our reserves, the actual health care costs may exceed the reserves we have recorded.

If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians, hospitals and other health
care providers, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.
We directly and indirectly contract with physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals and facilities to provide health care services
to our customers. Our results of operations are substantially dependent on our ability to contract for these services at competitive prices. In
any particular market, physicians, hospitals and health care providers may enter into exclusive arrangements with competitors or simply refuse
to contract with us, demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs or less desirable products for our
customers. In some markets, certain providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations and multi-specialty physician groups,
may have significant or controlling market positions that could result in a diminished bargaining position for us. If providers refuse to contract
with us, use their market position to negotiate more favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market
products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected. Establishing collaborative arrangements with physician
groups,  specialist  groups,  independent  practice  associations,  hospitals  and  health  care  delivery  systems  is  key  to  our  strategic  focus  to
transition from volume-based fee-for-service arrangements to a value-based health care system. If such collaborative arrangements do not
result in the lower medical costs that we project or if we fail to attract health care providers to such arrangements, or are less successful at
implementing such arrangements than our competitors, our attractiveness to customers may be reduced and our ability to profitably grow our
business may be adversely affected.

Our ability to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers also may be negatively impacted by other factors not
associated with us, such as changes in Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement levels, increasing pressure on revenue and other pressures on
health care providers and increasing consolidation activity among hospitals, physician groups and health care providers. For example, ongoing
reductions by CMS and state governments in amounts payable to providers, particularly hospitals, for services provided to Medicare and
Medicaid enrollees may exacerbate the cost shift to private payors, thereby adversely impacting our ability to maintain or develop new
cost-effective health care provider contracts or result in a loss of revenues or customers.

Continuing consolidation among physicians, hospitals and other health care providers, the emergence of accountable care organizations,
vertical integration of health care providers and other entities, changes in the organizational structures chosen by physicians, hospitals and
health care providers and new market entrants, including those not traditionally in the health care industry,  may affect the way providers
interact with us and may change the competitive landscape in which we operate. In some instances, these organizations may compete directly

22 CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K

PART I
ITEM 1A. Risk Factors

with us, potentially affecting the way that we price our products and services or cause us to incur increased costs if we change our operations
to be more competitive.

Out-of-network providers are not limited by any agreement with us in the amounts they bill. While benefit plans place limits on the amount of
charges that will be considered for reimbursement, out-of-network providers have become increasingly sophisticated and aggressive and such
limitations can be difficult to enforce. As a result, the outcome of disputes where we do not have a provider contract may cause us to pay higher
medical or other benefit costs than we projected.

As a global company, we face political, legal, operational, regulatory, economic and other risks that
present challenges and could negatively affect our multinational operations and/or our long-term growth.
As a global company, our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in foreign operations. These risks can vary substantially by market,
and include political, legal, operational, regulatory, economic and other risks, including government intervention that we do not face in our U.S.
operations. The global nature of our business and operations may present challenges including, but not limited to, those arising from:

•

varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands;

•

regulation that may discriminate against U.S. companies, favor nationalization or expropriate assets;

•

•

price  controls  or  other  pricing  issues  and  exchange  controls  or  other  restrictions  that  prevent  us  from  transferring  funds  from  these
operations out of the countries in which we operate or converting local currencies that our foreign operations hold into U.S. dollars or other
currencies;

foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations that may have an impact on the future costs or on future sales and cash flows from our
international operations, and any countermeasures that we may implement may not be effective in reducing the effect of volatile currencies
and other risks of our international operations;

•

tax positions and applicable regulations that may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater extent than in the United States;

•

our reliance on local sales forces for some operations in countries that may have labor problems and/or less flexible employee relationships
that can be difficult and expensive to terminate, where laws and regulations regarding employment status may be less clear, or where
changes in local regulation or law may disrupt business operations;

•

effectively managing our partner relationships in countries outside of the United States;

•

managing more geographically diverse operations and projects;

•

operating in new foreign markets that may require considerable management time before operations generate any significant revenues and
earnings;

•

providing data protection on a global basis and sufficient levels of technical support in different locations;

•

the global trend for companies to enact local data residency requirements;

•

political conditions, including the June 2016 referendum in the United Kingdom to leave the European Union and tensions in the Korean
Peninsula;

•

acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters or pandemics in locations where we operate; and

•

general economic and political conditions.

These factors may increase in significance as we continue to expand globally, and any one of these challenges could negatively affect our
operations or long-term growth. For example, due to the concentration of our international business in South Korea, the Global Supplemental
Benefits segment is exposed to potential losses resulting from economic and regulatory changes in that country and the geopolitical climate in
the Korean Peninsula, as well as foreign currency movements affecting the South Korean currency, that could have a significant impact on the
segment’s results and our consolidated financial results.

International operations also require us to devote significant resources to implement controls and systems in new markets to comply with, and
to ensure that our vendors and partners comply with, U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting bribery, corruption and money laundering, in addition to
other regulations regarding, among other things, our products, direct-to-consumer communications, customer privacy, data protection and
data  residency.  Violations  of  these  laws  and  regulations  could  result  in  fines,  criminal  sanctions  against  us,  our  officers  or  employees,
restrictions or outright prohibitions on the conduct of our business and significant reputational harm. We must regularly reassess the size,
capability and location of our global infrastructure and make appropriate changes, and must have effective change management processes
and internal controls in place to address changes in our business and operations. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these
risks and manage these challenges. Our failure to comply with laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the United States or to
establish constructive relations with non-U.S. regulators could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition, liquidity and long-term growth.

We are dependent on the success of our relationships with third parties for various services and
functions, including, but not limited to, certain pharmacy benefit management services.
To improve operating costs, productivity and efficiencies, we contract with third parties for the provision of specific services, such as certain
pharmacy benefit management services, information technology, medical management services, call center and claim services. Our operations
may be adversely affected if a third party fails to satisfy its obligations to us or if the arrangement is terminated in whole or in part or if there is a
contractual dispute between us and the third party. Even though contracts are intended to provide certain protections, we have limited control

CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K 23

PART I
ITEM 1A. Risk Factors

over the actions of third parties. For example, noncompliance with any privacy or security laws and regulations or any security breach involving
one of our third-party vendors or a dispute between us and a third party vendor related to our arrangement could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and reputation. In addition, with respect to services or functions
outsourced to third parties in foreign jurisdictions, we also are exposed to risks inherent in conducting business outside of the United States.

Outsourcing  also  may  require  us  to  change  our  existing  operations,  adopt  new  processes  for  managing  these  service  providers  and/or
redistribute responsibilities to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies. If there are delays or difficulties in changing
business processes or our third party vendors do not perform as expected, we may not realize, or not realize on a timely basis, the anticipated
economic and other benefits of these relationships. This could result in substantial costs or regulatory compliance issues, divert management’s
attention  from  other  strategic  activities,  negatively  affect  employee  morale  or  create  other  operational  or  financial  problems  for  us.
Terminating or transitioning in whole or in part arrangements with key vendors could result in additional costs or penalties, risks of operational
delays or potential errors and control issues during the termination or transition phase. We may not be able to find an alternative vendor in a
timely manner or on acceptable terms. If there is an interruption in business or loss of access to data resulting from a termination or transition in
services, we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and, in turn, our business and results of operations could be adversely
impacted.

Acquisitions, joint ventures and other transactions involve risks and we may not realize the expected
benefits because of integration difficulties, underperformance relative to our expectations and other
challenges.
As part of our growth strategy, we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures,
licensing arrangements and other relationships (collectively referred to as ‘‘transactions’’), with the expectation that these transactions will
result in various benefits. Our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of these transactions is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks,
including our ability to integrate operations, resources and systems, including data security systems, in an efficient and effective manner. We
could also face challenges in implementing business plans; changes in laws and regulations or conditions imposed by regulations applicable to
the business; retaining key employees; and general competitive factors in the marketplace. These events could result in increased costs,
decreases in expected revenues, earnings or cash flow, and goodwill or other intangible asset impairment charges. Further, we may finance
transactions by issuing common stock for some or all of the purchase price that could dilute the ownership interests of our shareholders, or by
incurring additional debt that could impact our ability to access capital in the future.

In addition, effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to mitigate the risk of fraud. The
integration of businesses is likely to cause increasing complexity in our systems and internal controls and make them more difficult to manage.
Any difficulties in assimilating businesses into our control system could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Ineffective
internal controls also could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information that could negatively impact the trading
price of our stock and our access to capital.

Our business depends on our ability to effectively invest in, implement improvements to and properly
maintain the uninterrupted operation and data integrity of our information technology and other business
systems.
Our business is highly dependent on maintaining effective information systems as well as the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to
serve our customers and health care professionals and to operate our business. If our data were found to be inaccurate or unreliable due to
fraud or other error, or if we, or any of the third-party service providers we engage, were to fail to maintain information systems and data
integrity effectively, we could experience operational disruptions that may impact our clients, customers and health care professionals and
hinder our ability to establish appropriate pricing for products and services, retain and attract clients and customers, establish reserves and
report financial results timely and accurately and maintain regulatory compliance, among other things.

Our information technology strategy and execution are critical to our continued success. Increasing regulatory and legislative changes will
place additional demands on our information technology infrastructure that could have a direct impact on resources available for other
projects tied to our strategic initiatives. In addition, recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and
enhanced technologies, including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices. We must continue to invest in long-term solutions that
will enable us to anticipate customer needs and expectations, enhance the customer experience, act as a differentiator in the market and
protect against cybersecurity risks and threats. Our success is dependent, in large part, on maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology
systems and continuing to deliver and enhance technology systems that support our business processes in a cost-efficient and resource-
efficient manner. Connectivity among technologies is becoming increasingly important. The failure of our health care technologies to operate
seamlessly with other products could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We must also develop new
systems to meet current market standards and keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and
regulatory standards and customer needs. Failure to do so may present compliance challenges and impede our ability to deliver services in a
competitive manner. Further, because system development projects are long-term in nature, they may be more costly than expected to
complete and may not deliver the expected benefits upon completion.

In  addition,  our  business  is  highly  dependent  upon  our  ability  to  perform,  in  an  efficient  and  uninterrupted  fashion,  necessary  business
functions, such as claims processing and payment, internet support and customer call centers, and processing new and renewal business.
Unavailability, cyber-attack or other failure of one or more of our information technology or other systems could cause slower response times,
resulting in claims not being processed as quickly as clients or customers desire, decreased levels of client or customer service and satisfaction,
and harm to our reputation. Because our information technology and other systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we
could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. If
sustained or repeated, such business interruptions, systems failures or service denials could have material adverse effects on our business,
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

24 CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K

PART I
ITEM 1A. Risk Factors

As a large health services company, we are subject to cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security
incidents. If we are unable to prevent or contain the effects of any such attacks, we may suffer exposure
to substantial liability, reputational harm, loss of revenue or other damages.
Our  business  depends  on  our  clients’  and  customers’  willingness  to  entrust  us  with  their  health-related  and  other  sensitive  personal
information. Computer systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses or malware, programming errors, attacks by third
parties or similar disruptive problems. We have been, and will likely continue to be, the target of computer viruses or other malicious codes,
unauthorized access, cyber-attacks or other computer-related penetrations. There have been large scale cyber-attacks within the health care
industry. As we increase the amount of personal information that we store and share digitally, our exposure to data security and related
cybersecurity risks increases, including the risk of undetected attacks, damage, loss or unauthorized access or misappropriation of proprietary
or personal information, and the cost of attempting to protect against these risks also increases. We have implemented security technologies,
processes and procedures to protect consumer identity and provide employee awareness training around phishing, malware and other cyber
risks;  however,  there  are  no  assurances  that  such  measures  will  be  effective  against  all  types  of  breaches.  The  techniques  used  change
frequently or are often not recognized until after they have been launched, because cyber-attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources
including third parties such as external service providers. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other
users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers. In addition, while we have
certain standards for all vendors that provide us services, our vendors, and in turn, their own service providers, may become subject to the
same type of security breaches. Finally, our offices may be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks, acts of vandalism or theft,
misplaced or lost data, human error or similar events that could negatively affect our systems and our customers’ and clients’ data.

The costs to eliminate or address security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. Our remediation
efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers.

In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary information
or confidential information about us, our customers or other third-parties could expose our customers’ private information and our customers
to the risk of financial or medical identity theft. Unauthorized dissemination of confidential and proprietary information about our business and
strategy also could negatively affect the achievement of our strategic initiatives. Such events would also negatively affect our ability to
compete, others’ trust in us, our reputation, customer base and revenues and expose us to mandatory disclosure (including to the media),
litigation and other enforcement proceedings, material fines, penalties and/or remediation costs, and compensatory, special, punitive and
statutory damages, consent orders and other adverse actions, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial
condition or liquidity.

Our pharmacy benefit management business and related operations are subject to a number of risks and
uncertainties that are in addition to those we face in our health care business.
Notwithstanding our arrangement with a third-party vendor for certain pharmacy benefit management services, we remain responsible to
regulators and our clients and customers for the delivery of those pharmacy benefit management services that we contract to provide. Our
pharmacy benefit management business is subject to federal and state regulation, including without limitation, federal and state anti-kickback
laws, consumer protection laws, ERISA, HIPAA and laws related to the operation of Internet and mail-service pharmacies, as well as the laws
and regulations of the foreign countries in which we conduct business. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are pharmacies subject to state
licensing and U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency registration requirements and state and federal laws concerning labeling, packaging, advertising,
handling and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances. Noncompliance with applicable regulations by us or
our third-party vendors could have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and reputation.

Our  pharmacy  benefit  management  business  also  would  be  adversely  affected  by  an  inability  to  contract  on  favorable  terms  with
pharmaceutical manufacturers and we could suffer exposure to liabilities and reputational harm in connection with purported errors by mail
order or retail pharmacy businesses.

In operating onsite clinics and other types of medical facilities, we may be subject to additional liability
that could result in significant time and expense.
In  addition  to  contracting  with  physicians  and  other  health  care  providers  for  services,  we  employ  physicians  and  other  health  care
professionals at onsite low acuity and primary care clinics that we operate for our customers, as well as certain clinics for our employees. In
addition, our Government business operates LivingWell health centers and we own and operate multispecialty health care centers, low acuity
clinics and other types of centers in the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area that employ physicians and other health care professionals. As a
direct employer of health care professionals and as an owner or operator of medical facilities, we are subject to liability for negligent acts,
omissions,  or  injuries  occurring  at  one  of  these  clinics  or  caused  by  one  of  our  employees.  Even  if  any  claims  brought  against  us  are
unsuccessful or without merit, we still have to defend against such claims. The defense of any actions may result in significant expenses that
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and reputation.

Legal and Compliance Risks
Our business is subject to substantial government regulation, as well as new laws or regulations or
changes in existing laws or regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
Our  business  is  regulated  at  the  federal,  state,  local  and  international  levels.  The  laws  and  rules  governing  our  business  and  related
interpretations, including, among others, those associated with the ACA, are increasing in number and complexity, are subject to frequent
change and can be inconsistent or in conflict with each other. As a public company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of multiple

CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K 25

PART I
ITEM 1A. Risk Factors

jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, such as those related to financial and other disclosures, corporate
governance, privacy, data protection, labor and employment, consumer protection, tax and anti-corruption.

We must identify, assess and respond to new trends in the legislative and regulatory environment, as well as comply with the various existing
regulations applicable to our business. Existing or future laws, rules, regulatory interpretations or judgments could force us to change how we
conduct our business, affect the products we offer, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our costs, including operating, health care
technology and administrative costs, and require enhancements to our compliance infrastructure and internal controls environment. Existing
or future laws and rules also could require us to take other actions such as changing our business practices, thereby increasing our liability in
federal and state courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions.

Several bills were introduced in Congress in 2017 to repeal and replace the ACA, though none have passed the House and Senate. Discussions
on the ACA continue in Congress. Throughout 2017, President Trump took several steps to limit the utility of the ACA and continues to
advocate for its repeal and replacement. The individual mandate was repealed effective January 1, 2019 as part of the U.S. tax reform legislation
that was signed into law in December 2017. We are unable to predict how these events will ultimately be resolved and what the potential impact
may be on the ACA, and in turn, on our business including, but not limited to, our products, services, processes and technology and on our
relationships with current and future customers, producers, vendors and health care providers. Legal challenges regarding aspects of the ACA,
such as litigation regarding the payment of risk corridor receivables and cost sharing reduction subsidies, have contributed to this uncertainty.
In addition, state legislatures have and will continue to focus on health care issues, particularly in light of the various ACA amendments
proposed by Congress and the Trump administration executive orders.

Further, failure to effectively implement or adjust our strategic and operational initiatives, such as by reducing operating costs, adjusting
premium pricing or benefit design or transforming our business model in response to regulatory changes may have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, including, but not limited to, our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill
and other intangible assets.

Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to the regulations of the jurisdictions in which they conduct business.
For example, HMOs and insurance companies are regulated under specific state laws and regulations and indirectly affected by other health
care-related laws and regulations. State regulations mandate minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. In addition, state
guaranty fund laws and related regulations subject us to assessments for certain obligations to policyholders and claimants of impaired or
insolvent insurance companies. Some states have similar laws relating to HMOs and other payors, such as consumer operated and oriented
plans (co-ops) established under the ACA. Any such assessment could expose us to the risk of paying a portion of an impaired or insolvent
insurance  company’s  claims  through  state  guaranty  association  assessments.  We  also  participate  in  the  private  exchange  marketplace.
Whether and the extent to which states may issue regulations that apply to private exchanges remains uncertain.

In addition to the regulations discussed above, we are required to obtain and maintain insurance and other regulatory approvals to market
many of our products, increase prices for certain regulated products and consummate some of our acquisitions and dispositions. Delays in
obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs.

The health care industry is also regularly subject to negative media attention, including as a result of the political environment and the ongoing
debate concerning the ACA. Such publicity may adversely affect our stock price and reputation in certain markets.

For more information on regulation, see ‘‘Business – Regulation’’ in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.

There are various risks associated with participating in government-sponsored programs, such as
Medicare, including dependence upon government funding, compliance with government contracts and
increased regulatory oversight.
Through our Government business, we contract with CMS and various state governmental agencies to provide managed health care services
including Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare-approved prescription drug plans. Revenues from Medicare programs are dependent, in
whole or in part, upon annual funding from the federal government through CMS and/or applicable state or local governments. Funding for
these programs is dependent on many factors outside our control including general economic conditions, continuing government efforts to
contain health care costs and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state or local level and general political issues and priorities.
These entities generally have the right to not renew or cancel their contracts with us on short notice without cause or if funds are not available.
Unanticipated changes in funding, such as the application of sequestration by the federal or state governments, could substantially reduce our
revenues and profitability.

The Medicare program has been the subject of regulatory reform initiatives, including the ACA. The premium rates paid to Medicare Advantage
plans and Medicare Part D plans are established by contract, although the rates differ depending on a combination of factors, many of which
are outside our control. The ACA ties a portion of each Medicare Advantage plan’s and Medicare Part D plan’s reimbursement to the plan’s ‘‘Star
Rating’’ by CMS, with those plans receiving a rating of four or more stars eligible for quality-based bonus payments. The Star Rating system
considers  various  measures  adopted  by  CMS,  including,  for  example,  quality  of  care,  preventative  services,  chronic  illness  management,
coverage determination appeals and customer satisfaction. The Star Rating system is subject to change annually by CMS, which may make it
more difficult to achieve four stars or greater. Our Medicare Advantage plans’ and Medicare Part D plans’ operating results, premium revenue
and benefit offerings are likely to continue to be significantly determined by their Star Ratings. If we fail to meet our expectations regarding
Star Ratings, are unsuccessful in maintaining or improving our Star Ratings, fail to meet or exceed our competitors’ ratings, or if quality-bonus
payments are eliminated, our financial performance may be adversely affected. See Part II, Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Information – Health Care Industry Developments and Other Matters Affecting our Global Health Care
Segment for additional information on our Star Ratings.

Contracts with CMS and the various state governmental agencies contain certain provisions regarding data submission, provider network
maintenance, provider directories, quality measures, claims payment, continuity of care, call center performance and other requirements. If we
fail to comply with these requirements, we may be subject to administrative actions, fines or other penalties that could impact our profitability.

PART I
ITEM 1A. Risk Factors

The ACA established health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers. Insurers participating on the health insurance exchanges
are required to offer a minimum level of benefits and comply with requirements with respect to premium rates and coverage limitations. Our
participation in these exchanges involves uncertainties associated with mix and volume of business and could adversely affect our results of
operations, financial position and cash flows. The executive order signed by President Trump in October 2017 that halted payment of the cost
sharing reduction subsidies has created additional uncertainty regarding the future of public health insurance exchanges.

In addition, any failure to comply with various state and federal health care laws and regulations, including those directed at preventing fraud
and abuse in government funded programs, could result in investigations or litigation, such as actions under the federal False Claims Act and
similar whistleblower statutes under state laws. This could subject us to fines, penalties or other enforcement actions, restrictions on our ability
to market or enroll new customers, limits on expansion, restrictions or exclusions from programs or other agreements with federal or state
governmental agencies that could adversely impact our business, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.

In addition, our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D businesses face a number of other risks including potential uncollectible receivables
resulting  from  processing  and/or  verifying  enrollment,  inadequate  underwriting  assumptions,  inability  to  receive  and  process  correct
information or increased medical or pharmaceutical costs. Actual results may be materially different than our assumptions and estimates
regarding these complex and wide-ranging programs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

We face risks related to litigation, regulatory audits and investigations.
We are routinely involved in numerous claims, lawsuits, regulatory audits, investigations and other legal matters arising, for the most part, in the
ordinary course of business, including that of administering and insuring employee benefit programs. These legal matters could include benefit
claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims, claims arising from consumer protection laws, claims disputes under federal or state laws and
disputes regarding reinsurance arrangements, employment and employment discrimination-related suits, antitrust claims, employee benefit
claims, wage and hour claims, tax, privacy, intellectual property and whistle blower claims, shareholder suits and other securities law claims and
real estate disputes. In addition, we have incurred and likely will continue to incur liability for practices and claims related to our health care
business, such as marketing misconduct, failure to timely or appropriately pay for or provide health care, provider network structure, poor
outcomes for care delivered or arranged, provider disputes including disputes over compensation or contractual provisions, and claims related
to our administration of self-funded business. There are currently, and may be in the future, attempts to bring class action lawsuits against the
company  and  the  industry;  individual  plaintiffs  also  may  bring  multiple  claims  regarding  the  same  subject  matter  against  us  and  other
companies in our industry.

With respect to our global operations, contractual rights, tax positions, laws and regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to
a greater degree than in the United States, and therefore subject us to disputes by customers, governmental authorities or others. Foreign laws
and rules and regulatory audit and investigative practices may differ from or be more stringent than, similar requirements in the United States.

Court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. In some cases, substantial non-economic or
punitive damages may be sought. We seek to procure insurance coverage to cover some of these potential liabilities. However, certain potential
liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may be insufficient to cover the entire
damages awarded. In addition, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance, and insurance coverage
for all or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future. It is possible that the resolution of current or
future legal matters and claims could result in changes to our industry and business practices, losses material to our results of operations,
financial condition and liquidity or damage to our reputation.

We are frequently the subject of regulatory market conduct and other reviews, audits and investigations by state insurance and health and
welfare departments, attorneys general, CMS and the OIG and comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions. With respect to our Medicare
Advantage and Medicare Part D businesses, CMS and OIG perform audits to determine a health plan’s compliance with federal regulations and
contractual  obligations,  including  compliance  with  proper  coding  practices  and  fraud  and  abuse  enforcement  practices  through  audits
designed to detect and correct improper payments. The Department of Justice is conducting an industry review of the risk adjustment data
submission practices and business processes, including review of medical charts, of Medicare Advantage organizations under Medicare Parts C
and D. There also continues to be heightened review by federal and state regulators of business and reporting practices within the health care,
disability and life insurance industry, including with respect to claims payment and related escheat practices, and increased scrutiny by other
state and federal governmental agencies (such as state attorneys general) empowered to bring criminal actions in circumstances that could
have previously given rise only to civil or administrative proceedings. These regulatory audits or reviews or actions by other governmental
agencies could result in changes to our business practices, retroactive adjustments to certain premiums, significant fines, penalties, civil
liabilities, criminal liabilities or other sanctions, including restrictions on our ability to market certain products or engage in business-related
activities, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, disclosure
of an adverse investigation or audit or the imposition of fines or other sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in certain markets and
make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services.

A description of material pending legal actions and other legal and regulatory matters is included in Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements included in this Form 10-K. The outcome of litigation and other legal or regulatory matters is always uncertain.

If we fail to comply with applicable privacy, security and data laws, regulations and standards, our
business and reputation could be materially and adversely affected.
The collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the
federal, state, international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with clients. In some cases, such laws, rules,
regulations and contractual requirements also apply to our vendors and require us to obtain written assurances of their compliance with such
requirements or may hold us liable for any violations by our vendors. International laws, rules and regulations governing the use and disclosure
of such information are generally more stringent than in the United States, and they vary across jurisdictions. We also are subject to various
other consumer protection laws that regulate our communications with customers.

CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K 27

PART I
ITEM 1A. Risk Factors

These laws, rules, and contractual requirements are subject to change. Compliance with new privacy, security and data laws, regulations and
requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations. For example,
the HITECH amendments to HIPAA may further restrict our ability to collect, disclose and use sensitive personal information and may impose
additional compliance requirements on our business.

HIPAA requires covered entities to comply with the HIPAA privacy, security and breach rules. In addition, business associates must comply with
the HIPAA security and breach requirements. While we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our third-party service
providers and in certain cases assess their security controls, we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices. Several of our
businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and, as a result, collect, use, disclose and maintain sensitive personal
information in order to provide services to these customers. HHS has continued its audit program to assess HIPAA compliance efforts by
covered entities and has expanded it to include business associates. In addition, HHS has increased its enforcement efforts. These efforts result
in enforcement actions that are the result of investigations brought on by the notification to HHS of a breach. An audit resulting in findings or
allegations of noncompliance or the implementation of an enforcement action could have an adverse effect on our results of operations,
financial position, cash flows and reputation.

Effective prevention, detection and control systems are critical to maintain regulatory compliance and
prevent fraud and failure of these systems could adversely affect us.
Federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting health care and other insurance fraud and abuse a priority. Fraud and
abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks for referral of customers, billing for unnecessary medical services,
improper marketing and violations of patient privacy rights. The regulations and contractual requirements applicable to us are complex and
subject to change. In addition, ongoing vigorous law enforcement, a highly technical regulatory scheme and the Dodd-Frank Act legislation
and related regulations enhance regulators’ enforcement powers and whistleblower incentives and protections. Our compliance efforts in this
area will continue to require significant resources. Failure of our prevention, detection or control systems related to regulatory compliance or
the failure of employees to comply with our internal policies including data systems security or unethical conduct by managers and employees,
could adversely affect our reputation and also expose us to litigation and other proceedings, fines and penalties.

In addition, provider or customer fraud that is not prevented or detected could impact our medical costs or those of our self-insured clients.
Further, during an economic downturn, we may experience increased fraudulent claims volume that may lead to additional costs due to an
increase in disputed claims and litigation.

Economic Risks
Significant stock market or interest rate declines could result in additional unfunded pension obligations
resulting in the need for additional plan funding by us and increased pension expenses.
We currently have unfunded obligations in our frozen pension plans. A significant decline in the value of the plans’ equity and fixed income
investments or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations could materially increase our expenses and change the timing and
amount of required plan funding. This could reduce the cash available to us, including our subsidiaries. We also are exposed to interest rate and
equity risk associated with our pension and other post-retirement obligations. Sustained declines in interest rates could have an adverse
impact on the funded status of our pension plans and our reinvestment yield on new investments. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements for more information on our obligations under the pension plan.

Significant changes in market interest rates affect the value of our financial instruments that promise a
fixed return or benefit and the value of particular assets and liabilities.
As an insurer, we have substantial investment assets that support insurance and contractholder deposit liabilities. Generally low levels of
interest rates on investments, such as those experienced in U.S. and foreign financial markets during recent years, have negatively impacted
our level of investment income earned in recent periods.

A substantial portion of our investment assets are in fixed interest-yielding debt securities of varying maturities, fixed redeemable preferred
securities and commercial mortgage loans. The value of these investment assets can fluctuate significantly with changes in market conditions.
A rise in interest rates would likely reduce the value of our investment portfolio and increase interest expense if we were to access our available
lines of credit.

A downgrade in the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect new
sales and retention of current business, and a downgrade in our debt ratings would increase the cost of
borrowed funds and could negatively affect our ability to access capital.
Financial strength, claims paying ability and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are each important factors in establishing the
competitive position of insurance and health benefits companies. Ratings information by nationally recognized ratings agencies is broadly
disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. We believe that the claims paying ability and financial strength ratings of our
principal insurance subsidiaries are important factors in marketing our products to certain customers. Our debt ratings impact both the cost
and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital. Each of the rating agencies reviews ratings periodically and there can
be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future. A downgrade of these ratings in the future could make it more difficult to
either market our products successfully or raise capital to support business growth within our insurance subsidiaries.

28 CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K

PART I
ITEM 1A. Risk Factors

Global market, economic and geopolitical conditions may cause fluctuations in equity market prices,
interest rates and credit spreads that could impact our ability to raise or deploy capital and affect our
overall liquidity.
If the equity and credit markets experience extreme volatility and disruption, there could be downward pressure on stock prices and access to
capital  for  certain  issuers  without  regard  to  those  issuers’  underlying  financial  strength.  Extreme  disruption  in  the  credit  markets  could
adversely impact our availability and cost of capital in the future.

As of December 31, 2017, our outstanding long-term debt totaled $5.2 billion. In the event of adverse economic and industry conditions, we
may be required to dedicate a greater percentage of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt,
thereby  reducing  the  funds  we  have  available  for  other  purposes,  such  as  investments  and  other  expenditures  in  ongoing  businesses,
acquisitions, dividends and stock repurchases. In these circumstances, our ability to execute our strategy may be limited, our flexibility in
planning for or reacting to changes in business and market conditions may be reduced, or our access to capital markets may be limited such
that additional capital may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms.

Unfavorable developments in economic conditions may adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition.
Many  factors,  including  geopolitical  issues,  future  economic  downturns,  availability  and  cost  of  credit  and  other  capital  and  consumer
spending can negatively impact the U.S. and global economies. Our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by the
impact of unfavorable economic conditions on our customers (both employers and individuals), health care providers and third-party vendors.
For example:

•

•

•

Employers may take action to reduce their operating costs by modifying, delaying or canceling plans to purchase our products or making
changes in the mix of products purchased that are unfavorable to us.

Higher unemployment rates and workforce reductions could result in lower enrollment in our employer-based plans (including an increase in
the number of employees who opt out of employer-based plans) or our individual plans.

Because of unfavorable economic conditions or the ACA, employers may stop offering health care coverage to employees or elect to offer
this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs.

•

Our historical disability claim experience and industry data indicate that submitted disability claims rise under adverse economic conditions.

•

•

•

If customers are not successful in generating sufficient funds or are precluded from securing financing, they may not be able to pay, or may
delay payment of, accounts receivable that are owed to us.

Our customers or potential customers may force us to compete more vigorously on factors such as price and service to retain or obtain their
business.

A prolonged unfavorable economic environment could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other health care providers,
potentially increasing our medical costs as these providers attempt to maintain revenue levels in their efforts to adjust to their own economic
challenges.

•

Our third-party vendors could significantly and quickly increase their prices or reduce their output to reduce their operating costs. Our
business depends on our ability to perform necessary business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion.

These factors could lead to a decrease in our customer base, revenues or margins and/or an increase in our operating costs.

In addition, during a prolonged unfavorable economic environment, state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected,
resulting in reduced or delayed reimbursements or payments in state and federal government programs such as Medicare and Social Security.
These state and federal budgetary pressures also could cause the government to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments on us,
such as premium taxes on insurance companies and HMOs and surcharges or fees on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims.
Although we could attempt to mitigate or cover our exposure from such increased costs through, among other things, increases in premiums,
there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate or cover all of such costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

We are subject to the credit risk of our reinsurers.
We enter into reinsurance arrangements with other insurance companies, primarily to limit losses from large exposures or to permit recovery of
a portion of direct losses. We also may enter into reinsurance arrangements in connection with acquisition or divestiture transactions when the
underwriting company is not being acquired or sold.

Under all reinsurance arrangements, reinsurers assume insured losses, subject to certain limitations or exceptions that may include a loss limit.
These arrangements also subject us to various obligations, representations and warranties with the reinsurers. Reinsurance does not relieve us
of  liability  as  the  originating  insurer.  We  remain  liable  to  the  underlying  policyholders  if  a  reinsurer  defaults  on  obligations  under  the
reinsurance arrangement. Although we regularly evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers to minimize exposure to significant losses from
reinsurer insolvencies, reinsurers may become financially unsound. If a reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance contract or if
the liabilities exceed any applicable loss limit, we will be forced to cover the claims on the reinsured policies.

The collectability of amounts due from reinsurers is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors, including whether the insured
losses  meet  the  qualifying  conditions  of  the  reinsurance  contract,  whether  reinsurers  or  their  affiliates  have  the  financial  capacity  and
willingness  to  make  payments  under  the  terms  of  the  reinsurance  contract,  and  the  magnitude  and  type  of  collateral  supporting  our
reinsurance recoverable, such as holding sufficient qualifying assets in trusts or letters of credit issued. Although a portion of our reinsurance
exposures are secured, the inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (‘‘MD&A’’) is intended to provide information to assist
you  in  better  understanding  and  evaluating  our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  We  encourage  you  to  read  this  MD&A  in
conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (‘‘Form 10-K’’) and the
‘‘Risk Factors’’ contained in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

Unless otherwise indicated, financial information in the MD&A is presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (‘‘GAAP’’). See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company’s
significant accounting policies. In some of our financial tables in this MD&A, we present either percentage changes or ‘‘N/M’’ when those
changes are so large as to become not meaningful. Changes in percentages are expressed in basis points (‘‘bps’’).

In this MD&A, our consolidated measures ‘‘operating revenues’’ and ‘‘adjusted income from operations’’ are not determined in accordance with
GAAP and should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable GAAP measures ‘‘total revenues’’ and ‘‘shareholders’ net
income.’’

We  define  operating  revenues  as  total  revenues  excluding  realized  investment  results.  We  exclude  realized  investment  results  from  this
measure because our portfolio managers may sell investments based on factors largely unrelated to the underlying business purposes of each
segment. As a result, gains or losses created in this process may not be indicative of past or future underlying performance of our businesses.

We use adjusted income from operations as our principal financial measure of operating performance because management believes it best
reflects the underlying results of our business operations and permits analysis of trends in underlying revenue, expenses and profitability. We
define adjusted income from operations as shareholders’ net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses, net amortization
of other acquired intangible assets and special items. Income or expense amounts are excluded from adjusted income from operations for the
following reasons:

•

•

Realized investment results are excluded because, as noted above, our portfolio managers may sell investments based on factors largely
unrelated to the underlying business purposes of each segment.

Net amortization of other intangible assets is excluded because it relates to costs incurred for acquisitions and, as a result, it does not relate to
the core performance of the Company’s business operations. In 2015, the amortization amount was net of a bargain purchase gain on an
acquisition.

•

Special items are excluded because management believes they are not representative of the underlying results of operations. See Note 22 to
our Consolidated Financial Statements for descriptions of special items.

Executive Overview

2017  versus  2016  –  Increase  due  to  higher  adjusted  income  from

2017, partially offset these increases.
2016  versus  2015  –  Decrease  due  to  lower  adjusted  income  from
operations, primarily in the Group Disability and Life segment. Increased
special item charges in 2016 (primarily higher transaction costs and the

2017  versus  2016  –  Increase  driven  by  higher  earnings  in  each  of  our
ongoing reportable segments. These increases were primarily a result of
customer growth in Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits
and  increased  specialty  contributions  in  Global  Health  Care.  Improved
claim  experience  in  Group  Disability  and  Life  also  contributed  to  the
increase.
2016 versus 2015 – Decrease was a result of significantly lower earnings in
Group Disability and Life reflecting unfavorable claim experience. Costs
related to the Government segment’s response to the Centers for Medicare
and  Medicaid  Services  (‘‘CMS’’)  audit  also  contributed  to  the  decline.
Increased earnings contributions in Global Supplemental Benefits and the
Commercial segment partially offset those unfavorable impacts.

MD&A beginning on page 47.

Key Developments
U.S. Tax Reform Legislation
Major U.S. tax reform legislation was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The legislation is highlighted by a reduction in the corporate
income tax rate from the current 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As further described on page 39 of this Form 10-K, we expect a
significant decline in our effective tax rate beginning in 2018 as a result of the rate reduction. The remaining provisions of the law, most of which
take effect on January 1, 2018, are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations beginning in 2018.
We recorded additional tax expense of $232 million in 2017 resulting from this legislation, comprised of $144 million due to the revaluation of
deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate and $88 million due to the assessment of U.S. taxes related to
the Company’s accumulated unremitted foreign earnings. The legislation provides an election to pay these taxes over eight years and we
expect to adopt this election. Both the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the taxes on accumulated unremitted foreign
earnings are considered provisional as certain adjustments used to calculate the tax at year-end were based on estimates.

CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K 37

PART II
ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Also as a result of tax reform, the Company recorded a reduction in operating expenses of $56 million ($36 million after-tax) reflecting a
decrease in a liability to reimburse a reinsurer for taxes related to a block of business sold through reinsurance. An offsetting tax effect is
included in the $144 million charge discussed above, resulting in no after-tax effect for this item.
See Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Termination of Proposed Merger with Anthem, Inc.
On May 12, 2017, we announced that the merger agreement between Cigna and Anthem, Inc. had been terminated.

Consolidated Results of Operations: 2017 versus 2016 and 2016 versus 2015
Revenues. The components of revenue changes are discussed further below:
•

•

•

•

•

•

Premiums. The increase in 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily due to customer growth in the Commercial segment and in Global
Supplemental Benefits. Expected decreases in Government segment premiums due to Medicare disenrollment partially offset these
increases. In 2016, premiums increased compared with 2015, reflecting customer growth in Global Health Care, Global Supplemental
Benefits as well as Group Disability and Life. Rate actions in our commercial health care businesses consistent with medical cost trend
also contributed to these increases.
Fees and other revenues. The increases in both 2017 and 2016 compared with each prior year primarily reflected growth from
specialty products offered through our Global Health Care segment and an increased customer base for our administrative services
only business.
Net investment income increased in 2017 compared with 2016 driven by growth in average invested assets partially offset by lower
yields. In 2016, net investment income decreased slightly compared with 2015, as lower investment yields in the protracted low
interest  rate  environment  were  partially  offset  by  higher  average  invested  assets.  Unfavorable  foreign  currency  effects  also
contributed to the declines in 2016.
Mail  order  pharmacy  revenues  were  flat  in  2017  compared  with  2016,  reflecting  increased  Commercial  customers,  specialty
medication prices and utilization (e.g., certain injectables) offset by lower oral medication volumes and Medicare customers. In 2016,
mail order pharmacy revenues increased compared with 2015, driven by greater volume, primarily for specialty medications due to
our higher customer base and increased utilization. In each period, changes in mail order pharmacy costs were driven by the same
factors as mail order pharmacy revenues.
Realized investment results increased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to higher gains on sales of alternative and real
estate investments as well as lower impairment losses. Realized investment results increased in 2016 compared with 2015 due to
significantly lower impairment losses.

•

•

•

•

•

Global Health Care medical costs. The increases in 2017 and 2016 compared with each prior year resulted primarily from customer growth in
our commercial health care businesses and medical cost trend. In 2017, the impact of Medicare disenrollment partially offset these effects.
Other benefit expenses declined slightly in 2017 compared with 2016 as improvements in our disability and life claims experience were
largely offset by customer growth in Global Supplemental Benefits. The increase in 2016 compared with 2015 was driven by unfavorable
disability and life claim experience due primarily to changes in the disability claims management process in 2016 and elevated life claims
during  the  second  quarter  of  2016.  Business  growth  in  our  Group  Disability  and  Life  and  Global  Supplemental  Benefits  segments  also
contributed to the 2016 increase.
Other operating expenses. In 2017, the increase in other operating expenses compared with 2016 reflected debt extinguishment costs, a
long-term care guaranty fund assessment and higher volume-based expenses reflecting business growth. These increases were offset by the
moratorium on the health insurance industry tax in 2017 and a reduction in costs related to our CMS audit response. The increase in 2016
compared with 2015 was due to costs associated with our CMS audit response, business growth, strategic investment across our segments
and special item charges including transaction-related costs and a risk corridor allowance described in Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Amortization of other acquired intangible assets, net. The decrease in 2017 compared with 2016 was driven by the expected continuing
decline in amortization from our 2012 acquisition of HealthSpring, Inc. The increase in 2016 compared with 2015 was driven by the absence of
the  $23  million  bargain  purchase  gain  recorded  in  2015  for  an  acquisition.  This  factor  was  partially  offset  by  the  decline  in  our
HealthSpring, Inc. amortization.
The consolidated effective tax rate was flat in 2017 compared with 2016. The unfavorable impact of additional tax expense associated with
the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation was offset by the favorable effects of a moratorium on the health insurance industry tax in
2017 and an incremental tax benefit associated with previously non-deductible transaction-related costs. See Note 20 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information. The increase in our effective tax rate in 2016 compared with 2015 was largely driven by an
increase  in  non-tax  deductible  transaction-related  costs  reported  in  2016,  partially  offset  by  the  tax  benefits  on  stock  compensation
recognized in net income as a result of our early adoption of Accounting Standard Update (‘‘ASU’’) 2016-09.

We expect our effective tax rate in 2018 to decrease significantly from 2017 as a result of enactment of the U.S. tax reform legislation. This
favorable effect will be partially offset by the resumption of the health insurance industry tax.

Health Care Industry Developments and Other Matters Affecting Our Global Health
Care Segment
The ‘‘Regulation’’ section of this Form 10-K provides a detailed description of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ‘‘ACA’’)
provisions and other legislative initiatives that impact our health care business, including regulations issued by CMS and the Departments of
the Treasury and Health and Human Services (‘‘HHS’’). In October 2017, President Trump issued an executive order that could result in a variety
of changes to the individual and group health insurance markets when implemented. At this time, we are unable to determine the effect, if any,
of these changes on our business or results of operations. In addition, the President ordered the immediate cessation of cost sharing reduction
subsidy payments to insurers. Discussions on the ACA continue in the U.S. Congress. The table presented below provides an update of the
impact of these items and other matters affecting our Global Health Care segment as of December 31, 2017.

Description

CMS sanctions: On June 16, 2017, the Company received notification from CMS that the marketing and
enrollment sanctions imposed by CMS on January 21, 2016 had been lifted. Cigna has resumed marketing of its
Medicare Advantage-Prescription Drug and Medicare Part D Plans and began enrolling beneficiaries with
effective dates beginning July 1, 2017.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, Medicare enrollment and consolidated revenues were materially
impacted due to our inability to participate in 2017 annual enrollment. However, 2017 shareholders’ net income
was not materially affected because the margin impact of the revenue loss was offset by lower operating
expenses due to reduced remediation costs and other operational efficiencies that improved 2017 results. The
impact of disenrollment was not material to 2016 consolidated revenues or earnings.
Medicare Star Quality Ratings (‘‘Star Ratings’’): Medicare Advantage plans must have a Star Rating of four
Stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments. We expect that approximately 60% of our Medicare Advantage
customers will be in a four Star or greater plan for bonus payments to be received in 2018. In October 2017,
CMS announced Star Ratings for plans for the 2019 payment year. We expect that approximately 40% of our
Medicare Advantage customers will be in a four Star or greater plan for bonus payments to be received in 2019.
Management continues to evaluate various actions to improve the Company’s Star Ratings.
2018 and 2019 MA Rates: Final MA reimbursement rates for 2018 were published by CMS in April 2017.
Preliminary MA reimbursement rates for 2019 were published by CMS in February 2018. We expect these
changes in rates to have an immaterial impact on our consolidated results of operations in 2018 and 2019.
Health Insurance Industry Tax: Federal legislation imposed a moratorium on the health insurance industry tax
for 2017 and 2019. The industry tax is being assessed in 2018 and, under current law, will return again in 2020
and beyond. For 2017, our premium rates reflected the moratorium and we would expect our target pricing
actions to reflect the moratorium in 2019. The amount of the tax was approximately $310 million in both 2016
and 2015 ($170 million for Commercial and $140 million for Government in each year).
The industry tax for Cigna in 2018 is expected to approximate $390 million ($260 million for Commercial and
$130 million for Government). For our Commercial business, the fee is reflected in our 2018 premium rates, and
is expected to result in an immaterial effect on shareholders’ net income. For our Medicare business, we
anticipate that the earnings impact of the tax will be more significant than in our Commercial business.
However, we expect to offset its earnings impact in 2018 with benefit and pricing changes as well as growth.
Because this tax is not deductible for federal income tax purposes, it will negatively impact our effective tax
rate in 2018.
Reinsurance Fee: This fee was applicable only from 2014 through 2016. For our insured business, the amount of
the fee was approximately $45 million in 2016 and $70 million in 2015.
Market Participation: For 2017, we offered individual coverage on seven public health insurance exchanges in
the following states: Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Missouri, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. For 2018, we
are offering individual coverage on the same exchanges with the exception of Maryland.
Cost Sharing Reduction Subsidies: The ACA provides for cost sharing reductions that lower the amount that
qualifying customers pay for deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. The federal government has provided
funding for the cost sharing reduction subsidies to the qualifying customer’s insurer. In October 2017, the Trump
administration stopped payment of these subsidies to insurers. The attorneys general of 18 states and the
District of Columbia have sued the Trump administration, seeking to require the administration to continue
paying these subsidies. While the litigation is at a preliminary stage, on October 25, 2017, the court denied the
request of the attorneys general for an injunction, allowing the government to cease providing the cost sharing
reduction payments to insurers during the pendency of the matter. We will continue to monitor developments
as the case proceeds. The impact of suspending cost sharing reduction subsidies was not material to 2017
consolidated earnings. Our pricing actions for the 2018 plan year have anticipated that the government would
no longer pay for these subsidies, and we expect the impact on our future results of operations to be
immaterial.
Individual Mandate Repeal: The U.S. tax reform legislation also repealed the penalty charged to individuals
without health insurance (known as the ‘‘individual mandate’’) effective January 1, 2019. While the impact on
future premium rates and enrollment in the individual market is uncertain, we expect this repeal to have an
immaterial impact on our future results of operations.

current status of court decisions. However, we continue to believe that the government has a binding obligation to satisfy the risk corridor
receivable.

Liquidity
We maintain liquidity at two levels: the subsidiary level and the parent company level.

Liquidity requirements at the subsidiary level generally consist of:

• medical costs and benefit payments to policyholders;
• expense requirements, primarily for employee compensation and benefits, information technology and facilities costs; and
• income taxes.

Our subsidiaries normally meet their operating requirements by:

• maintaining appropriate levels of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments;
• using cash flows from operating activities;
• matching investment durations to those estimated for the related insurance and contractholder liabilities;
• selling investments; and
• borrowing from affiliates, subject to applicable regulatory limits.

Liquidity requirements at the parent company level generally consist of:

• debt service and dividend payments to shareholders;
• pension plan funding; and
• repurchases of common stock.

The parent company normally meets its liquidity requirements by:

• maintaining appropriate levels of cash and various types of marketable investments;
• collecting dividends from its subsidiaries;
• using proceeds from issuance of debt and equity securities; and
• borrowing from its subsidiaries, subject to applicable regulatory limits.

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, were as follows:

employee tax obligations associated with stock compensation. The comparable amounts reported in financing activities were $61 million in 2017 and $72 million in 2016.

(2) As required in adopting ASU 2016-15 in 2016, the Company retrospectively reclassified cash distributions from partnership earnings of $137 million from investing to operating activities in

2015. The comparable amounts reported in operating activities were $161 million in 2017 and $144 million in 2016.

CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K 41

PART II
ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Operating activities
Cash flows from operating activities consist of cash receipts and disbursements for premiums and fees, mail order pharmacy, other revenues,
investment income, taxes, benefits and expenses. Because certain income and expense transactions do not generate cash, and because cash
transactions related to revenues and expenses may occur in periods different from when those revenues and expenses are recognized in
shareholders’ net income, cash flows from operating activities can be significantly different from shareholders’ net income.

Cash flows from operating activities increased slightly in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily driven by higher net income, partially offset by
lower receipts from Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage programs and a voluntary pension contribution of $150 million in 2017.

Cash  flows  from  operating  activities  increased  in  2016  compared  with  2015  due  to  higher  receipts  from  Medicare  Part  D  and  Medicare
Advantage programs.

Investing activities
Cash flows from investing activities generally consist of net investment purchases or sales and net purchases of property and equipment
including capitalized software, as well as cash used to acquire businesses.

Cash used in investing activities decreased in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to lower net investment purchases. In 2017, more cash
was deployed to share repurchase than investment purchases in accordance with our capital management strategy discussed in the below
‘‘Capital Resources’’ section of this MD&A.

Cash used in investing activities increased in 2016 compared with 2015, due to higher purchases of fixed maturity investments.

Financing activities
Cash flows from financing activities are generally comprised of issuances and re-payment of debt at the parent company level, proceeds on the
issuance of common stock resulting from stock option exercises, and stock repurchases. In addition, the subsidiaries report deposits to and
withdrawals from investment contract liabilities (including universal life insurance liabilities) because such liabilities are considered financing
activities with policyholders.

Cash used in financing activities increased in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to higher share repurchases. The 2017 proceeds from the
Company’s $1.6 billion debt issuance were largely offset by $1.3 billion paid to extinguish $1.0 billion of debt, as well as repaying maturing debt
in the first quarter of 2017.

Cash used in financing activities decreased in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to lower share repurchases offset by lower proceeds
from employees’ exercise of stock options.

Share repurchase
We maintain a share repurchase program, authorized by our Board of Directors. Under this program, we may repurchase shares from time to
time, depending on market conditions and alternate uses of capital. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a
variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternate uses of capital. The share repurchase program may be
effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

In 2017, we repurchased 15.7 million shares for $2.8 billion. From January 1, 2018 through January 31, 2018 we repurchased 1.2 million shares for
approximately $260 million. We repurchased 0.8 million shares for $110 million in 2016 and 5.5 million shares for $683 million in 2015.

Interest Expense
Interest expense on long-term debt, short-term debt and capital leases was as follows:

Interest expense

2017

Interest expense reported above excluded losses on the early extinguishment of debt.

The weighted average interest rate for outstanding short-term debt (primarily commercial paper) was 1.63% as of December 31, 2017. There
was no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2016.

Capital Resources
Our capital resources (primarily retained earnings and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities) provide protection for
policyholders, furnish the financial strength to underwrite insurance risks and facilitate continued business growth.

Management, guided by regulatory requirements and rating agency capital guidelines, determines the amount of capital resources that we
maintain. Management allocates resources to new long-term business commitments when returns, considering the risks, look promising and
when the resources available to support existing business are adequate.

42 CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K

PART II
ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

We prioritize our use of capital resources to:

•

provide the capital necessary to support growth and maintain or improve the financial strength ratings of subsidiaries and to fund pension
obligations;

•

consider acquisitions that are strategically and economically advantageous; and

•

return capital to investors through share repurchase.

The availability of capital resources will be impacted by equity and credit market conditions. Extreme volatility in credit or equity market
conditions may reduce our ability to issue debt or equity securities.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Outlook
At December 31, 2017, there was approximately $1.2 billion in cash and marketable investments available at the parent company level. In 2018,
the parent company’s combined cash obligations are expected to approximate $480 million for repayment of debt, interest and dividends. We
expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet the obligations discussed above, based on the parent company’s current cash position and current
projections for subsidiary dividends. In addition, we actively monitor our debt obligations and engage in issuance or redemption activities as
needed in accordance with our capital management strategy.

Our  cash  projections  may  not  be  realized  and  the  demand  for  funds  could  exceed  available  cash  if  our  ongoing  businesses  experience
unexpected shortfalls in earnings, or we experience material adverse effects from one or more risks or uncertainties described more fully in the
Risk Factors section of this Form 10-K. In those cases, we expect to have the flexibility to satisfy liquidity needs through a variety of measures,
including intercompany borrowings. The parent company may borrow up to $1.1 billion from its insurance subsidiaries without additional state
approval. We have additional liquidity available through short-term commercial paper borrowings and a committed $1.5 billion revolving credit
facility. The revolving credit and letter of credit agreement is subject to the maximum debt leverage covenant. As of December 31, 2017, we
have $9.3 billion of maximum borrowing capacity in the debt leverage covenant, in addition to the $5.4 billion of debt outstanding. See Note 5
to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the credit facility.

Though we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity, significant disruption or volatility in the capital and credit markets could affect our
ability to access those markets for additional borrowings or increase costs associated with borrowing funds.

The state of Illinois continues to experience financial difficulties; however, some of their immediate cash flow constraints were alleviated by a
bond offering issued during the fourth quarter of 2017. As a result, we have collected most of the receivables due as of December 31, 2017. The
remaining amount due to us from the state of Illinois under our commercial and Medicaid contracts as of December 31, 2017 was immaterial. As
of December 31, 2017, all of our contracts with the state of Illinois had been terminated.

We continue to maintain a capital management strategy to retain overseas a significant portion of the earnings from our foreign operations.
These undistributed earnings are deployed outside of the United States predominantly in support of the liquidity and regulatory capital
requirements of our foreign operations as well as to support growth initiatives overseas. As a result of the U.S. tax reform legislation enacted in
December 2017, we recorded additional U.S. taxes of $88 million related to these undistributed earnings. The legislation provides an election to
pay these taxes over eight years. We expect to adopt that election.

Unfunded  Pension  Plan  Liability. As  of  December  31,  2017,  our  unfunded  pension  liability  was  $688  million,  reflecting  a  decrease  of
$223 million from December 31, 2016. The decrease in the unfunded liability reflected strong investment asset returns and a contribution of
$150 million in 2017, partially offset by the impact of a decrease in discount rates of approximately 45 basis points. No contributions are
required in 2018 under the Pension Protection Act of 2006. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
regarding our pension plans.

Guarantees and Contractual Obligations
We are contingently liable for various contractual obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business. See the ‘‘Liquidity and Capital
Resources’’ section of this MD&A beginning on page 41 for additional background on how we manage our liquidity requirements related to
these obligations. The maturities of our primary contractual cash obligations, as of December 31, 2017, are estimated to be as follows:

On balance sheet:
Insurance liabilities. Excluded from the table above are $5 billion of insurance liabilities associated with the sold retirement benefits and
•
individual life insurance and annuity businesses, as well as the reinsured workers’ compensation, personal accident and supplemental benefits
businesses ($3 billion in contractholder deposit funds; $2 billion in future policy benefits) as their related net cash flows are not expected to
impact our cash flows. Excluding these amounts, the sum of the obligations presented above exceeds the corresponding insurance and
contractholder liabilities of $21 billion recorded on the balance sheet because some of the recorded insurance liabilities reflect discounting for
interest and the recorded contractholder liabilities exclude future interest crediting, charges and fees. The timing and amount of actual future
cash flows may differ from those presented above as actual results differ from those assumed.

• Contractholder deposit funds: see Note 2(F) to our Consolidated Financial Statements for our accounting policy for this liability.
Expected future cash flows presented above also include estimated future interest crediting on current fund balances based on
current investment yields less the estimated cost of insurance charges and mortality and administrative fees for universal life policies.
• Future policy benefits, Global Health Care medical costs payable and unpaid claims and claim expenses: see Notes 2(G), 7 and 8 to
our Consolidated Financial Statements for our accounting policies for these liabilities. Expected future cash flows for these liabilities
presented in the table above are undiscounted. The expected future cash flows for guaranteed minimum death benefit (‘‘GMDB,’’
reported in future policy benefits) do not consider any of the related reinsurance arrangements.

•

Short-term debt represents current maturities of long-term debt and related interest payments, and current obligations under capital leases.
Long-term debt includes scheduled interest payments. Capital leases are included in long-term debt and primarily represent obligations for
information technology network storage, servers and equipment.
Other long-term liabilities include estimated payments for guaranteed minimum income benefit (‘‘GMIB’’) contracts (without considering
any  related  reinsurance  arrangements),  pension  and  other  postretirement  and  postemployment  benefit  obligations,  supplemental  and
deferred compensation plans, interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts, and reinsurance liabilities. These items are presented in
accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Estimated payments of $68 million for deferred
compensation, non-qualified and international pension plans and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans are expected to
be paid in less than one year and are included in the table above. We do not expect to make any additional contributions to the qualified
domestic pension plans during 2018. We expect to make payments subsequent to 2018 for these obligations; however, subsequent payments
have been excluded from the table as their timing is based on plan assumptions that may materially differ from actual activities. See Note 15 to
our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.

We  are  contingently  liable  for  various  financial  and  other  guarantees  provided  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business.  See  Note  21  to  our
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on guarantees.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management considers an accounting estimate
to be critical if:
•
•

it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and
changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on our consolidated results of
operations or financial condition.

Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of
Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below.
In addition to the estimates presented in the following table, there are other accounting estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated
Financial Statements, including estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits, as well as estimates with respect to postemployment and
postretirement benefits other than pensions, certain compensation accruals, and income taxes.

44 CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K

PART II
ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements are appropriate.
However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements, the
resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and, in certain situations, could have a material
adverse  effect  on  our  liquidity  and  financial  condition.  The  table  below  presents  the  adverse  impacts  of  certain  possible  changes  in
assumptions. The effect of assumption changes in the opposite direction would be a positive impact to our consolidated results of operations,
liquidity or financial condition, except for the assessments of impairment for goodwill and fixed maturities carried at a fair value below cost. The
tax rate used to calculate the after-tax impact of assumption changes is based on the new corporate income tax rate discussed in the ‘‘Key
Developments’’ section of this MD&A.

See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on significant accounting policies.

Balance Sheet Caption / Nature of Critical Accounting Estimate
Goodwill

At the acquisition date, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses
acquired over the fair value of their net assets.

We completed our annual evaluations of goodwill for impairment during the
third quarter of 2017. These evaluations were performed at the reporting unit
level, based on discounted cash flow analyses or market data. The evaluations
indicated that no impairment was required.

Fair values of reporting units are estimated using models and assumptions that
we believe a hypothetical market participant would use to determine a current
transaction  price.  The  significant  assumptions  and  estimates  used  in
determining fair value include the discount rate and future cash flows. A range
of  discount  rates  is  used,  corresponding  with  the  reporting  unit’s  weighted
average  cost  of  capital,  consistent  with  that  used  for  investment  decisions
considering the specific and detailed operating plans and strategies within the
reporting unit. Projections of future cash flows are consistent with our annual
planning process for revenues, claims, operating expenses, taxes, capital levels
and  long-term  growth  rates.  In  addition  to  these  assumptions,  we  consider
market data to evaluate the fair value of each reporting unit.

In our Government operating segment we contract with CMS and various state
governmental  agencies  to  provide  managed  health  care  services,  including
Medicare  Advantage  plans  and  Medicare-approved  prescription  drug  plans.
Estimated future cash flows for this reporting unit’s business incorporate the
potential  effects  of  Medicare  Advantage  reimbursement  rates  for  2018  and
beyond  as  discussed  in  the  ‘‘Executive  Overview’’  section  of  this  MD&A.
Revenues from the Medicare programs are dependent, in whole or in part, upon
annual funding from the federal government through CMS. Funding for these
programs  is  dependent  on  many  factors  including  general  economic
conditions,  continuing  government  efforts  to  contain  health  care  costs  and
budgetary  constraints  at  the  federal  level  and  general  political  issues  and
priorities.

Goodwill as of December 31 was as follows (in millions):
•
•

2017 – $6,164
2016 – $5,980

See Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion
of our goodwill.
Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities – pension liabilities

These  liabilities  are  estimates  of  the  present  value  of  the  qualified  and
nonqualified pension benefits to be paid (attributed to employee service to
date) net of the fair value of plan assets. The accrued pension benefit liability as
of December 31 was as follows (in millions):

•

2017 – $688

•

2016 – $911

See  Note  15  to  our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  assumptions  and
methods used to estimate pension liabilities.

Effect if Different Assumptions Used

If  we  do  not  achieve  our  earnings  objectives  or  the  cost  of  capital  rises
significantly,  the  assumptions  and  estimates  underlying  these  impairment
evaluations  could  be  adversely  affected  and  result  in  future  impairment
charges that would negatively impact our operating results.

Based on our most recent evaluations, the fair value estimates of our reporting
units exceed their carrying values by adequate margins.

Future  changes  in  the  funding  for  our  Medicare  programs  by  the  federal
government  could  materially  reduce  revenues  and  profitability  in  our
Government reporting unit and have a significant impact on its fair value.

The discount rate is typically the most significant assumption in measuring the
pension liability. We develop the discount rate by applying actual annualized
yields at various durations from a discount rate curve constructed from high
quality corporate bonds. Based on our historical experience, we believe that a
50 basis point change in the discount rate and a 10% decline in plan assets are
reasonably possible outcomes.

If discount rates for the qualified and nonqualified pension plans decreased by
50  basis  points,  the  accrued  pension  benefit  liability  would  increase  by
approximately $190 million as of December 31, 2017, resulting in an after-tax
decrease to shareholders’ equity of approximately $150 million.

If the December 31, 2017 fair values of domestic qualified plan assets decreased
by 10%, the accrued pension benefit liability would increase by approximately
$425  million  as  of  December  31,  2017,  resulting  in  an  after-tax  decrease  to
shareholders’ equity of approximately $335 million.

The  liabilities  for  medical  costs  payable  as  of  December  31  were  as  follows
(in millions):

•

2017 – gross $2,719; net $2,454

•

2016 – gross $2,532; net $2,257

These liabilities are presented above both gross and net of reinsurance and
other recoverables.

See Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
regarding assumptions and methods used to estimate this liability.

Unpaid claims and claim expenses – long-term disability reserves

The liability for long-term disability reserves is the present value of estimated
future  benefits  payments  over  the  expected  disability  period  and  includes
estimates for both reported claims and for claims incurred but not yet reported.

Long-term disability reserves as of December 31 were as follows (in millions):

•

2017 – gross $3,884; net $3,790

•

2016 – gross $3,708; net $3,622

These  liabilities  are  presented  above  both  gross  and  net  of  reinsurance
recoverables.

See Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
regarding assumptions and methods used to estimate this liability.

Effect if Different Assumptions Used

As described in Note 7, Global Health Care medical costs payable is primarily
impacted by assumptions related to completion factors and medical cost trend.
Changes  in  either  assumption  from  actual  results  could  impact  the  Global
Health Care medical costs payable balance as noted below. A large number of
factors  may  cause  the  medical  cost  trend  to  vary  from  the  Company’s
estimates, including: changes in medical management practices, changes in the
level and mix of benefits offered and services utilized, and changes in medical
practices. Completion factors may be affected if actual claims submission rates
from providers differ from estimates (that can be influenced by a number of
factors, including provider mix, and electronic versus manual submissions), or if
changes to the Company’s internal claims processing patterns occur. Based on
studies of our claim experience, it is reasonably possible that a 100 basis point
change in the medical cost trend and a 50 basis point change in completion
factors could occur in the near term.

A 100 basis point increase in the medical cost trend rate would increase this
liability by approximately $35 million, resulting in a decrease in net income of
approximately  $30  million  after-tax,  and  a  50  basis  point  decrease  in
completion factors would increase this liability by approximately $75 million,
resulting in a decrease in net income of approximately $60 million after-tax.

As  described  in  Note  8,  key  assumptions  in  the  calculation  of  long-term
disability reserves include the discount rate and claim resolution rates, both of
which  are  reviewed  annually  and  updated  when  experience  or  future
expectations  would  indicate  a  necessary  change.  Based  on  recent  and
historical resolution rate patterns and changes in investment portfolio yields, it
is reasonably possible that a 5 percent change in claim resolution rates and a
25 basis point change in the discount rate could occur.

The  discount  rate  is  the  interest  rate  used  to  discount  the  projected  future
benefit payments to their present value. The discount rate assumption is based
on  the  projected  investment  yield  of  the  assets  supporting  the  reserves.  A
25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase long-term disability
reserves  by  approximately  $45  million  and  decrease  net  income  by
approximately $35 million after-tax.

Claim  resolution  rate  assumptions  involve  many  factors  including  claimant
demographics,  the  type  of  contractual  benefit  provided  and  the  time  since
initially becoming disabled. The Company uses its own historical experience to
develop its claim resolution rates. A 5 percent decrease in the claim resolution
rate would increase long-term disability reserves by approximately $90 million
and decrease net income by approximately $70 million after-tax.

Valuation of fixed maturity investments

Most fixed maturities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair
Typically,  the  most  significant  input  in  the  measurement  of  fair  value  is  the
value with changes in fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive market interest rate used to discount the estimated future cash flows of the
instrument.  Such  market  rates  are  derived  by  calculating  the  appropriate
income (loss) within shareholders’ equity.
spreads over comparable U.S. Treasury securities, based on the credit quality,
industry and structure of the asset.

Fair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the balance sheet date.

If the interest rates used to calculate fair value increased by 100 basis points,
the fair value of the total fixed maturity portfolio of $23 billion would decrease
by approximately $1.5 billion, resulting in an after-tax decrease to shareholders’
equity of approximately $0.9 billion.

Determining  fair  value  for  a  financial  instrument  requires  management
judgment. The degree of judgment involved generally correlates to the level of
pricing readily observable in the markets. Financial instruments with quoted
prices  in  active  markets  or  with  market  observable  inputs  to  determine  fair
value, such as public securities, generally require less judgment. Conversely,
private  placements  including  more  complex  securities  that  are  traded
infrequently  are  typically  measured  using  pricing  models  that  require  more
judgment as to the inputs and assumptions used to estimate fair value. There
may be a number of alternative inputs to select based on an understanding of
the  issuer,  the  structure  of  the  security  and  overall  market  conditions.  In
addition,  these  factors  are  inherently  variable  in  nature  as  they  change
frequently in response to market conditions. Approximately two-thirds of our
fixed  maturities  are  public  securities,  and  one-third  are  private  placement
securities.

See  Notes 10  and  11(A)  to  our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  a
discussion  of  our  fair  value  measurements,  the  procedures  performed  by
management to determine that the amounts represent appropriate estimates
and  our  accounting  policy  regarding  unrealized  appreciation  on  fixed
maturities.

Effect if Different Assumptions Used

If we subsequently determine that the excess of amortized cost over fair value
is other-than-temporary for any or all of these fixed maturities, the amount
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income would be reclassified to
shareholders’ net income as an impairment loss.

Balance Sheet Caption / Nature of Critical Accounting Estimate
Assessment of ‘‘other-than-temporary’’ impairments on fixed maturities

Certain fixed maturities with a fair value below amortized cost are carried at fair
value with changes in fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income.  For  these  investments,  we  have  determined  that  the  decline  in  fair
value below its amortized cost is temporary. To make this determination, we
evaluated the expected recovery in value and our intent to sell or the likelihood
of a required sale of the fixed maturity prior to an expected recovery. In making
this  evaluation,  we  considered  a  number  of  general  and  specific  factors
including the regulatory, economic and market environments, length of time
and  severity  of  the  decline,  and  the  financial  health  and  specific  near  term
prospects of the issuer.

The  after-tax  amounts  as  of  December  31 
in  Accumulated  Other
Comprehensive Income for fixed maturities in an unrealized loss position were
as follows (in millions):

•

2017 – ($80)

•

2016 – ($115)

See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion
of  our  review  of  declines  in  fair  value,  including  information  regarding  our
accounting policies for fixed maturities.

Segment Reporting
The  following  section  of  this  MD&A  discusses  the  results  of  each  of  our  reporting  segments.  In  these  segment  discussions,  we  present
‘‘operating revenues,’’ defined as total revenues excluding realized investment results and ‘‘adjusted income from operations,’’ defined as
shareholders’ net income excluding after-tax realized investment results, net amortization of other acquired intangible assets and special
items.  Ratios  presented  in  this  segment  discussion  exclude  the  same  items  as  adjusted  income  from  operations.  See  Note  22  to  our
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of these metrics.

In these segment discussions, we also present ‘‘adjusted margin,’’ defined as adjusted income from operations divided by operating revenues.

See the MD&A Executive Overview beginning on page 35 for summarized financial results of each of our reporting segments.

Global Health Care Segment
As described in the Segment Reporting introduction above, the performance of the Global Health Care segment is measured using adjusted
income from operations. The key factors affecting adjusted income from operations for this segment are:

•

customer growth;

•

sales of specialty products;

•

medical costs as a percentage of premiums (medical care ratio or ‘‘MCR’’) for our commercial and government businesses; and

•

operating expense as a percentage of operating revenues (operating expense ratio).

2017 versus 2016
Operating revenues. The increase was primarily due to customer growth in our Commercial risk business, partially offset by lower customer
enrollment in our Government segment.

Adjusted income from operations increased, reflecting higher earnings in both our Commercial and Government operating segments. The
increase in the Commercial segment reflects customer growth including increased contributions from our specialty products and favorable
claim experience in our U.S. Individual business. The Government segment’s earnings growth reflects lower operating expenses related to the
moratorium on the health insurance industry tax in 2017 and our 2016 CMS audit response, partially offset by lower customer enrollment.
Adjusted income from operations included favorable after-tax prior year reserve development of $112 million for 2017; prior year reserve
development in 2016 was not material.

Medical care ratios. The Commercial medical care ratio increased, reflecting the 2017 moratorium on the health insurance industry tax, offset
by improved performance in our U.S. Individual business and favorable prior year reserve development.

The Government medical care ratio decreased slightly, reflecting increased premium rates and favorable prior year reserve development,
partially offset by higher medical costs.

Operating expense ratio. The decrease was primarily due to the moratorium on the health insurance industry tax in 2017 and lower costs
related to our 2016 CMS audit response.

2016 versus 2015
Operating revenues. The increase in operating revenues was due to growth in our Commercial segment primarily from increased specialty
revenues and growth in Medicare Advantage customer volumes. Higher premium rates for most products (primarily to recover underlying
medical cost trend) also contributed to the increase. These increases were partially offset by lower customer volumes in our Medicare Part D
and U.S. Individual businesses.

Adjusted income from operations was flat, reflecting earnings growth in our Commercial segment, primarily due to increased contributions
from specialty products partially offset by lower margins in our U.S. Individual business. This increase was offset by lower earnings in our
Government segment primarily driven by costs related to our CMS audit response.

Medical care ratios. The Commercial medical care ratio increased, reflecting a less favorable medical care ratio in our stop loss business,
lower premium due to the anticipated reduction of the ACA mandated fees in 2017 and less favorable prior year reserve development.

The Government medical care ratio increased slightly, reflecting higher medical costs in our Medicaid business and less favorable prior year
development, mostly offset by improvements in the Medicare Part D business.

Operating expense ratio. The operating expense ratio increased slightly, reflecting costs related to our CMS audit response. Excluding those
costs,  the  operating  expense  ratio  decreased,  reflecting  higher  revenue  and  operating  efficiencies,  partially  offset  by  business  initiative
investments.

Other Items Affecting Health Care Results
Global Health Care Medical Costs Payable
Medical costs payable was higher as of December 31, 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to customer growth in our commercial risk
businesses and medical cost trend across all businesses. Medical costs payable was higher as of December 31, 2016 compared with 2015,
primarily  due  to  medical  cost  trend  across  all  businesses  and  customer  growth  in  our  Commercial  group  business.  See  Note  7  to  our
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Medical Customers
A medical customer is defined as a person meeting any one of the following criteria:

•

is covered under a medical insurance policy, managed care arrangement or service agreement issued by us;

•

has access to our provider network for covered services under their medical plan; or

•

has medical claims that are administered by us.

Our  medical  customer  base  increased  as  of  December  31,  2017  compared  with  2016,  reflecting  growth  across  our  Commercial  market
segments, partially offset by declines in our Medicare Advantage business. Our medical customer base increased as of December 31, 2016
compared with 2015, primarily driven by growth in our middle market, select and international market segments.

Global Supplemental Benefits Segment
As described in the Segment Reporting introduction on page 47, the performance of the Global Supplemental Benefits segment is measured
using adjusted income from operations. The key factors affecting adjusted income from operations for this segment are:

•

premium growth, including new business and customer retention;

•

benefit expenses as a percentage of premiums (loss ratio);

•

operating expense and acquisition expense as a percentage of operating revenues (expense ratio and acquisition cost ratio); and

•

the impact of foreign currency movements.

Throughout this discussion and the table presented below, prior period currency adjusted income from operations and operating revenues are
calculated by applying the current period’s exchange rates to reported results in the prior period. A strengthening U.S. dollar against foreign
currencies decreases these measures, while a weakening U.S. dollar produces the opposite effect.

2017 versus 2016
Operating revenues increased primarily due to business growth, particularly in the United States and South Korea, and the favorable impact of
foreign currency movements, primarily in the South Korean Won.

Adjusted income from operations increased, reflecting business growth, primarily in South Korea and China, and lower acquisition cost ratios.

The segment’s loss ratio decreased, primarily due to favorable claims experience, largely offset by a shift in business mix to products with
higher loss ratios.

The  acquisition  cost  ratio  decreased  due  to  lower  spending  in  certain  markets  and  a  shift  toward  higher  premium  markets  with  lower
acquisition costs, primarily in South Korea and the United States.

The decrease in the expense ratio (excluding acquisition costs) was primarily driven by strong expense management.

2016 versus 2015
Operating revenues were higher primarily due to new sales, particularly in South Korea and the United States, reflecting both customer growth
and sales of higher premium products. These higher premiums were partially offset by lower persistency in the U.K. and the unfavorable impact
of foreign currency movements, primarily in South Korea and the U.K.

ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Adjusted income from operations increased primarily due to business growth, largely in South Korea, and lower acquisition and operating cost
ratios. These factors were partially offset by higher income taxes and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency movements, primarily in
South Korea.

The segment’s loss ratio was flat, reflecting favorable claims in South Korea, largely offset by a shift in business mix to products with higher loss
ratios.

The acquisition cost ratio decreased due to a shift toward higher premium products with lower acquisition costs primarily in South Korea and
the United States.

The decrease in the expense ratio (excluding acquisition costs) was primarily driven by operating efficiencies.

Other Items Affecting Global Supplemental Benefits Results
South  Korea  is  the  single  largest  geographic  market  for  our  Global  Supplemental  Benefits  segment.  South  Korea  generated  51%  of  the
segment’s operating revenues and 89% of the segment’s adjusted income from operations in 2017. In 2017, our Global Supplemental Benefits
segment operations in South Korea represented 5% of our consolidated operating revenues and 12% of consolidated adjusted income from
operations.

As a global company, our business is exposed to risks inherent in foreign operations. We continue to monitor and evaluate the impacts of
tensions in the Korean Peninsula.

Significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates could materially affect the reported results of the Global Supplemental Benefits
segment.

Group Disability and Life Segment
As described in the Segment Reporting introduction on page 47, the performance of the Group Disability and Life segment is measured using
adjusted income from operations. The key factors affecting adjusted income from operations for this segment are:

•

premium growth, including new business and customer retention;

•

net investment income;

•

benefit expenses as a percentage of premiums (loss ratio); and

•

operating expense as a percentage of operating revenues excluding net investment income (expense ratio).

During  the  first  half  of  2016,  the  Group  Disability  and  Life  segment  experienced  significant  unfavorable  claims  in  its  disability  and  life
businesses. While claims experience moderated during the second half of 2016 and normalized in 2017, the first half results dampened full year
2016 earnings.

Disability: We implemented modifications to our disability claims management process in the first quarter of 2016 to drive improved quality
and consistency. These modifications extended the claims processing cycle and lowered the disability claim resolution rate. As our modified
disability claims management process continued to mature during the latter half of 2016, our claim resolution rate significantly improved and
operational margins normalized over the course of 2017.

Life: We experienced a period of elevated life claims in the second quarter of 2016, driven by substantially higher new claim incidence and
sizes, both of which have normalized in subsequent periods.

2017 versus 2016
Operating revenues were relatively flat in 2017 compared with 2016 with higher investment income driven by higher asset levels offset by
cancelations in non-core products.

50 CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K

PART II
ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Adjusted income from operations increased in 2017 compared with 2016 reflecting lower disability new claim incidence and a higher resolution
rate as modifications to the disability claims management process discussed above continued to mature. In addition, life claims have returned
to normal levels after a period of significantly elevated claims and a $17 million after-tax unfavorable reserve review, both in the second quarter
of 2016.

The loss ratio decreased in 2017 compared with 2016 due to improvement in the disability claim resolution rate as noted above, lower disability
new claim incidence and significantly improved life claims experience.

Operating expense ratio. The 2017 operating expense ratio increased compared with 2016 due to higher overhead costs.

2016 versus 2015
Operating revenues. Premiums and fees increased in 2016 compared with 2015 due to new business growth from disability and life sales. Net
investment income also increased primarily due to higher average assets partially offset by lower yields.

Adjusted income from operations. Results decreased in 2016 compared with 2015 due primarily to unfavorable disability and life claims
experience as well as the absence of favorable reserve reviews and a higher operating expense ratio. Results in 2016 included the unfavorable
impact of reserve reviews of $18 million after-tax compared with a favorable impact of $55 million after-tax in 2015.

The loss ratio increased in 2016 compared with 2015 due to lower claim resolutions in disability, higher life claim incidence and sizes in the
second quarter of 2016, and the unfavorable impact of reserve reviews as discussed above.

Operating expense ratio. The operating expense ratio increased in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily reflecting higher disability claim
management costs.

Other Operations
As described in the Segment Reporting introduction on page 47, the performance of the Other Operations segment is measured using
adjusted income from operations. Cigna’s corporate-owned life insurance (‘‘COLI’’) business contributes the majority of earnings in Other
Operations. Cigna’s Other Operations segment also includes the results from the run-off reinsurance and settlement annuity businesses, as well
as the remaining deferred gains recognized from the sale of the individual life insurance and annuity and retirement benefits businesses.

Operating revenues decreased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to lower investment income yields across all businesses, partially
offset by lower ceded premiums in the COLI business. The decrease in operating revenues in 2016 compared with 2015 was largely due to lower
net investment income driven by lower investment yields.

Adjusted income from operations in 2017 decreased compared with 2016, reflecting less favorable mortality experience partially offset by
higher interest margins in COLI. Adjusted income from operations decreased in 2016 compared with 2015, reflecting less favorable mortality
experience and lower interest margins in COLI.

ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Corporate’s adjusted loss from operations was lower in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to higher excess tax benefits on stock
compensation driven by increased option exercise activity in 2017. Higher net investment income also contributed to the lower loss, partially
offset by higher operating expenses. Corporate’s adjusted loss from operations decreased in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to
recognizing excess tax benefits on stock compensation in net income beginning in 2016 as a result of our early adoption of ASU 2016-09.

sheet. Additional information regarding valuation methodologies, key inputs and controls is included in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements. More detailed information about fixed maturities by type of issuer and maturity dates is included in Note 11 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements.

The fixed maturity portfolio increased $2.2 billion during the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, primarily reflecting an increase in investable
funds. As of December 31, 2017, $20.5 billion, or 89%, of the fixed maturities in our investment portfolio were investment grade (Baa and above,
or equivalent), and the remaining $2.6 billion were below investment grade. The majority of the bonds that are below investment grade are
rated at the higher end of the non-investment grade spectrum. These quality characteristics have not materially changed from the prior year
and are consistent with our investment strategy.

State and local government. Our investment in state and local government securities, with an average quality rating of Aa2, was diversified
by issuer and geography with no single exposure greater than $35 million as of December 31, 2017. We assess each issuer’s credit quality based
on a fundamental analysis of underlying financial information and do not rely solely on statistical rating organizations or monoline insurer
guarantees.

Foreign government. We invested in high quality foreign government obligations with an average quality rating of Aa3 as of December 31,
2017. These investments were concentrated in Asia, primarily South Korea, consistent with the geographic locations of our international
business operations. Foreign government obligations also included $243 million of investments in European sovereign debt, none of which are
in countries with significant political or economic concerns such as Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, Spain and Turkey.

Corporate. As of December 31, 2017, corporate fixed maturities included the following:

•

•

•

•

Private placement investments were $6 billion. These investments are generally less marketable than publicly-traded bonds; however yields
on these investments tend to be higher than yields on publicly-traded bonds with comparable credit risk. We perform a credit analysis of each
issuer, diversify investments by industry and issuer and require financial and other covenants that allow us to monitor issuers for deteriorating
financial strength and pursue remedial actions, if warranted.

Investments in companies that are domiciled or have significant business interests in Italy, Ireland, Spain and Turkey were $400 million. These
investments  have  an  average  quality  rating  of  Baa2  and  are  diversified  by  industry  sector,  including  less  than  2%  invested  in  financial
institutions.

Investments in the energy and natural gas sector were $1.8 billion with gross unrealized losses of $9 million. These investments have an
average quality rating of Baa2 and are diversified by issuer with no single exposure greater than $65 million.

Retail sector fixed maturity investments were approximately $460 million with gross unrealized losses of $3 million. These investments had
an average quality rating of Baa2 and were diversified across approximately 40 issuers with no exposure exceeding $50 million.

ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

In addition to amounts classified in fixed maturities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we operate an insurance joint venture in China in
which we have a 50% ownership interest. We account for this joint venture on the equity basis of accounting and report it in other assets,
including other intangibles. This entity had an investment portfolio of approximately $4.9 billion supporting this business that is primarily
invested  in  local  Chinese  corporate  and  government  fixed  maturities.  There  were  no  investments  with  a  material  unrealized  loss  as  of
December 31, 2017.

Equity Securities
As of December 31, 2017, approximately $400 million in equity securities were invested in an exchange traded fund (‘‘ETF’’) as part of a
program  to  invest  available  cash  in  high  quality  and  liquid  assets.  The  underlying  assets  of  the  ETF  are  primarily  U.S.  investment  grade
corporate bonds and there was a gross unrealized gain of $10 million as of December 31, 2017 due to a decrease in market yields since purchase.

Commercial Mortgage Loans
Our commercial mortgage loans are fixed rate loans, diversified by property type, location and borrower. Loans are secured by high quality
commercial properties and are generally made at less than 70% of the property’s value at origination of the loan. Property value, debt service
coverage, quality, building tenancy and stability of cash flows are all important financial underwriting considerations. We hold no direct
residential mortgage loans and do not originate or service securitized mortgage loans.

We completed the annual in-depth review of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio during the second quarter of 2017. The results of the 2017
review were in line with the prior year and confirmed the strength of the overall portfolio. For further discussion of the results of this review and
changes in key loan metrics, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Commercial  real  estate  capital  markets  remain  very  active  for  well-leased,  quality  commercial  real  estate  located  in  strong  institutional
investment markets. The vast majority of properties securing the mortgages in our mortgage loan portfolio possess these characteristics. As of
December 31, 2017, we had $135 million of commercial mortgage loans in the retail sector for various shopping centers in the United States. The
loan-to-value ratio for these loans was 49%, and the debt service coverage ratio was 2.15. All of these loans are current.

As of December 31, 2017, the $1.8 billion commercial mortgage loan portfolio consisted of approximately 60 loans that are all in good standing.
Given the quality and diversity of the underlying real estate, positive debt service coverage and significant borrower cash investment generally
ranging between 30 and 40%, we remain confident that borrowers will continue to perform as expected under their contract terms.

Other Long-term Investments
Other long-term investments of $1.5 billion included investments in securities limited partnerships and real estate limited partnerships as well
as direct investments in real estate joint ventures. The funds typically invest in mezzanine debt or equity of privately held companies (securities
partnerships) and equity real estate. Given our subordinate position in the capital structure of these underlying entities, we assume a higher
level of risk for higher expected returns. To mitigate risk, these investments are diversified across approximately 125 separate partnerships, and
approximately 60 general partners who manage one or more of these partnerships. Also, the funds’ underlying investments are diversified by
industry sector or property type, and geographic region. No single partnership investment exceeded 4% of our securities and real estate
partnership portfolio.

Problem and Potential Problem Investments
‘‘Problem’’ bonds and commercial mortgage loans are either delinquent by 60 days or more or have been restructured as to terms, including
concessions by us for modification of interest rate, principal payment or maturity date. ‘‘Potential problem’’ bonds and commercial mortgage
loans are considered current (no payment is more than 59 days past due), but management believes they have certain characteristics that
increase  the  likelihood  that  they  may  become  problems.  The  characteristics  management  considers  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the
following:

•

request from the borrower for restructuring;

•

principal or interest payments past due by more than 30 but fewer than 60 days;

•

downgrade in credit rating;

•

collateral losses on asset-backed securities; and

•

for commercial mortgages, deterioration of debt service coverage below 1.0 or value declines resulting in estimated loan-to-value ratios
increasing to 100% or more.

We recognize interest income on problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans only when payment is actually received because of the risk
profile of the underlying investment. The amount that would have been reflected in net income if interest on non-accrual investments had been
recognized in accordance with their original terms was not significant for 2017 or 2016.

Problem and potential problem investments decreased by $42 million since December 31, 2016 primarily due to payoffs and paydowns of
problem bonds and mortgage loans.

Investment Outlook
Although financial markets in the United States remained stable during 2017, we continue to closely monitor global macroeconomic trends and
their potential impact to our investment portfolio. Certain sectors, such as retail, energy and natural gas have experienced stress and volatility
and we expect that to continue. See the fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loan sections of this MD&A for further information on our
investments in these sectors. Future realized and unrealized investment results will be driven largely by market conditions that exist when a
transaction occurs or at the reporting date. These future conditions are not reasonably predictable; however, we believe that the vast majority
of our investments will continue to perform under their contractual terms. Based on our strategy to match the duration of invested assets to the
duration of insurance and contractholder liabilities, we expect to hold a significant portion of these assets for the long term. Although future
impairment losses resulting from interest rate movements and credit deterioration due to both investment-specific and the global economic
uncertainties discussed above remain possible, we do not expect these losses to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or
liquidity.

Market Risk
Financial Instruments
Our assets and liabilities include financial instruments subject to the risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices.
Consistent  with  disclosure  requirements,  the  following  items  have  been  excluded  from  this  consideration  of  market  risk  for  financial
instruments:

•

changes in the fair values of insurance-related assets and liabilities because their primary risks are insurance rather than market risk;

•

•

changes in the fair values of investments recorded using the equity method of accounting and liabilities for pension and other postretirement
and postemployment benefit plans (and related assets); and

changes in the fair values of other significant assets and liabilities such as goodwill, deferred policy acquisition costs, taxes, and various
accrued liabilities. Because they are not financial instruments, their primary risks are other than market risk.

Excluding these items, our primary market risk exposures from financial instruments are:

•

•

Interest-rate risk on fixed-rate, medium-term instruments. Changes in market interest rates affect the value of instruments that promise a
fixed return.

Foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the South Korean won, Euro, Taiwan dollar, Chinese yuan renminbi, and
British pound. An unfavorable change in exchange rates reduces the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies.

Our Management of Market Risks
We predominantly rely on three techniques to manage our exposure to market risk:

•

Investment/liability matching. We generally select investment assets with characteristics (such as duration, yield, currency and liquidity)
that correspond to the underlying characteristics of our related insurance and contractholder liabilities so that we can match the investments
to our obligations. Shorter-term investments generally support shorter-term life and health liabilities. Medium-term, fixed-rate investments
support interest-sensitive and health liabilities. Longer-term investments generally support products with longer pay out periods such as
annuities and long-term disability liabilities.

•

Use of local currencies for foreign operations. We generally conduct our international business through foreign operating entities that
maintain assets and liabilities in local currencies. While this technique does not reduce foreign currency exposure on our net assets, it
substantially limits exchange rate risk to those net assets.

•

Use of derivatives. We use derivative financial instruments to minimize certain market risks.

See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about derivative financial instruments.

ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Effect of Market Fluctuations
The examples that follow illustrate the adverse effect of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair value of certain financial
instruments including:

•

•

a hypothetical increase in market interest rates, primarily for fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loans, partially offset by liabilities for
long-term, largely fixed-rate debt; and

a  hypothetical  strengthening  of  the  U.S.  dollar  to  foreign  currencies,  primarily  for  financial  instruments  held  by  foreign  subsidiaries
denominated in a foreign currency.

The effects of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair values of certain of our financial instruments, subject to the exclusions
noted above (particularly insurance liabilities), would have been as follows as of December 31:

Market scenario for certain non-insurance financial instruments (in billions)

100 basis point increase in interest rates
10% strengthening in U.S. dollar to foreign currencies

Loss in fair value
2017

2016

$
1.2
$ 0.5

$
$

1.0
0.4

The effect of a hypothetical increase in interest rates was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using various models,
primarily duration modeling. The impact of a hypothetical increase to interest rates at December 31, 2017 was greater than that at December 31,
2016 reflecting increased purchases of fixed maturities partially offset by additional issuances of long-term debt.

The effect of a hypothetical strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies of certain financial instruments held by us was
estimated to be 10% of the U.S. dollar equivalent fair value. Our foreign operations hold investment assets, such as fixed maturities, cash, and
cash equivalents, that are generally invested in the currency of the related liabilities. The effect of a hypothetical 10% strengthening in the U.S.
dollar to foreign currencies at December 31, 2017 was greater than that effect at December 31, 2016 due to increased amounts of investments
that are primarily denominated in the South Korean won.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors
and Shareholders of Cigna Corporation

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cigna Corporation and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and 2016,
and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in total equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2017, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the ‘‘consolidated financial statements’’). We also
have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control –
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 based on criteria
established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (‘‘PCAOB’’) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or
fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our  audits  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the
consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also
included  evaluating  the  accounting  principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall
presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Our  audit  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  included  obtaining  an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Description of Business

NOTE 1
Cigna Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (either individually or collectively referred to as ‘‘Cigna,’’ the ‘‘Company,’’ ‘‘we,’’ ‘‘our’’ or ‘‘us’’)
is a global health services organization dedicated to a mission of helping individuals improve their health, well-being and sense of security. To
execute on our mission, Cigna’s evolved strategy is to ‘‘Go Deeper’’, ‘‘Go Local’’ and ‘‘Go Beyond’’ with a differentiated set of medical, dental,
disability, life and accident insurance and related products and services offered by our subsidiaries. The majority of these products are offered
through employers and other groups such as governmental and non-governmental organizations, unions and associations. Cigna also offers
commercial health and dental insurance, Medicare and Medicaid products and health, life and accident insurance coverages to individuals in
the United States and selected international markets. In addition to these ongoing operations, Cigna also has certain run-off operations.

The financial results of the Company’s businesses are reported in the following segments:

Global Health Care aggregates the Commercial and Government operating segments due to their similar economic characteristics, products
and services and regulatory environment:

•

The Commercial operating segment (‘‘Commercial segment’’) encompasses both the U.S. commercial and certain international health care
businesses serving employers and their employees, other groups, and individuals. Products and services include medical, dental, behavioral
health, vision, and prescription drug benefit plans, health advocacy programs and other products and services to insured and self-insured
customers.

•

The  Government  operating  segment  (‘‘Government  segment’’)  offers  Medicare  Advantage  and  Medicare  Part  D  plans  to  seniors.  This
segment also offers Medicaid plans in selected markets.

Global Supplemental Benefits includes supplemental health, life and accident insurance products offered in selected international markets
and in the United States.

Group Disability and Life provides group long-term and short-term disability, group life, accident and specialty insurance products and related
services.

Other Operations consist of:

•

corporate-owned life insurance (‘‘COLI’’);

•

run-off reinsurance business that is predominantly comprised of guaranteed minimum death benefit (‘‘GMDB’’) and guaranteed minimum
income benefit (‘‘GMIB’’) business effectively exited through reinsurance with Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska
(‘‘Berkshire’’) in 2013;

•

deferred gains recognized from the 1998 sale of the individual life insurance and annuity business and the 2004 sale of the retirement benefits
business; and

•

run-off settlement annuity business.

Corporate reflects amounts not allocated to operating segments, including net interest expense (defined as interest on corporate debt less
net investment income on investments not supporting segment operations), interest on uncertain tax positions, certain litigation matters,
intersegment eliminations, compensation cost for stock options and related excess tax benefits, expense associated with our frozen pension
plans and certain overhead and project costs.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

NOTE 2
Basis of Presentation
The  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  include  the  accounts  of  Cigna  Corporation  and  its  subsidiaries.  Intercompany  transactions  and
accounts  have  been  eliminated  in  consolidation.  These  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  were  prepared  in  conformity  with  accounting
principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  (‘‘GAAP’’).  Amounts  recorded  in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements
necessarily reflect management’s estimates and assumptions about medical costs, investment valuation, interest rates and other factors.
Significant estimates are discussed throughout these Notes; however, actual results could differ from those estimates. The impact of a change
in estimate is generally included in earnings in the period of adjustment. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to
conform to the current presentation.

Variable interest entities. See Note 13 for a discussion of consolidated variable interest entities.

Recent Accounting Guidance
The following tables provide information about recently adopted accounting guidance and accounting guidance not yet adopted that is
applicable to Cigna.

Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance

Accounting Standard and Adoption Date

Effects of Adopting New Guidance

GUIDANCE ADOPTED IN 2017

Guidance:

Securities and Exchange Commission (‘‘SEC’’) Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 118 (‘‘SAB 118’’), adopted December 31, 2017

•

•

Allows a company to recognize the effects of U.S. tax reform as
provisional in its 2017 financial statements when it does not have
the necessary information in reasonable detail to complete its
accounting for the change in tax law.
Establishes a maximum one-year measurement period that ends
when a company has obtained the information necessary to finalize
its accounting. During the measurement period, adjustments for the
effects of the law will be recorded to the extent a reasonable
estimate for all or a portion of the effects of the law can be made.

Effects of adoption:

•

•

The Company has reported reasonable estimates of the income tax
effects of U.S. tax reform as provisional in its financial statements.
See Note 20 for disclosures about the impact of U.S. tax reform on
the Company’s financial statements.

Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted

Accounting Standard and Effective Date Applicable for Cigna

Requirements and Expected Effects of New Guidance Not Yet Adopted

GUIDANCE TO BE ADOPTED JANUARY 1, 2018

Requires:

•

•
•

Companies to estimate and allocate the expected customer
contract revenues among distinct goods or services based on
relative standalone selling prices
Revenues to be recognized as goods or services are delivered
New disclosures including presenting relevant categories of
revenues and information about related contract assets and
liabilities
Adoption through retrospective restatement with or without using
certain practical expedients or adoption with a cumulative effect
adjustment
Expected effects:

•

Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Accounting Standards Update
(‘‘ASU’’) 2014-09 and related amendments)

Required as of January 1, 2018

•

•

•

•

•

Guidance applies to the Company’s administrative service, mail
order pharmacy and other non-insurance contracts, but does not
apply to certain contracts within the scope of other GAAP, such as
the Company’s insurance and investment contracts accounted for
under the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting
Standards Codification (‘‘ASC’’) 944.
The Company has completed its evaluation of the new requirements
and the adoption of the new guidance will not have a material
impact to its pattern of revenue recognition or net income.
The Company will adopt the new guidance through retrospective
restatement and is currently working to develop required
disclosures and restate historical periods in line with its chosen
method of adoption. The Company does not anticipate significant
changes to its systems, processes or controls.
The Company’s cumulative effect of implementing this guidance will
result in an immaterial decrease to the opening balance of retained
earnings from establishing a contract liability for service fee revenue
that must be recognized when services are provided after the
termination of certain administrative service contracts.
The Company also will reclassify certain fees as a result of
clarifications in the new guidance and its related interpretations.

Required as of January 1, 2018

•

•

Entities to measure equity investments at fair value in net income if
they are neither consolidated nor accounted for under the equity
method
Cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained
earnings at adoption

Expected effects:

•

•

•

Certain limited partnership interests carried at cost of
approximately $200 million as of December 31, 2017 will be
reported at fair value at adoption with future changes in fair value
reported in net investment income.
Changes in fair value for equity securities previously reported in
accumulated other comprehensive income will now be reported in
net realized investment gains.
Retained earnings will increase by approximately $60 million

Requires:

•

•

Entities to recognize the tax impacts of all intra-entity sales of
assets other than inventory even though the pre-tax effects of
those transactions are eliminated in consolidation
Modified retrospective approach for adoption with a cumulative-
effect adjustment recorded in retained earnings

Expected effects: the adoption of this standard will not have a material
effect on the Company’s financial statements.

Guidance:

•

•

Revises the definition of a business and provides a more robust
framework for entities to use in determining when a set of assets
and activities is a business.
Requires entities to apply this new definition to business
transactions beginning in the first quarter of 2018.

Expected effects: the Company does not expect this change in definition
will have a material impact on its financial statements.

Requires:

•

•

•

Employers to separate the service cost component from the other
components of net benefit cost
Only service cost is eligible for capitalization (as either deferred
policy acquisition costs or capitalized software), to be applied
prospectively upon adoption

cost to be disclosed

Expected effects: the Company does not expect the effect of this new
guidance to be material to results of operations because its most
significant plans are frozen. See Note 15 for additional information.

Required as of January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted in 2017

Guidance:

•

•

Relaxes requirements for financial and nonfinancial hedging
strategies to be eligible for hedge accounting and changes how
companies assess effectiveness.

transparency about the uses and results of hedging programs.

Expected effects: the Company is planning to adopt this guidance on
January 1, 2018 with an immaterial impact to its financial statements for
existing hedges.

GUIDANCE TO BE ADOPTED AFTER 2018 OR ADOPTION DATE HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED

Guidance:

•

•

•

Allows companies to reclassify tax effects stranded in accumulated
other comprehensive income as a result of U.S. tax reform to

Modified retrospective approach for leases in effect as of and after
the date of adoption with a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded
in retained earnings

Expected effects:

•

•

•

The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact this standard will
have on its financial statements.
While not yet quantified, the Company expects a material impact to
the Consolidated Balance Sheets from recognizing additional assets
and liabilities of operating leases upon adoption. The actual
increase in assets and liabilities will depend on the volume and
terms of leases in place at the time of adoption.
The Company is implementing a new lease system in connection
with the adoption.

Requires:

•

•

•

A new approach using expected credit losses to estimate and
recognize credit losses for certain financial instruments such as
mortgage loans, reinsurance recoverables and other receivables
Changes in the criteria for impairment of available-for-sale debt
securities

The Company is evaluating this new standard, its expected timing
of adoption and effects on its financial statements and disclosures.
An additional allowance for future expected credit losses for certain
financial instruments may be required at adoption.

Guidance:

•

•

•

Simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by eliminating
the need to determine the fair value of individual assets and
liabilities of a reporting unit to measure a goodwill impairment.
Redefines the amount of goodwill impairment to be equal to the
amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair
value, limited to the total amount of goodwill of the reporting unit.
Requires prospective adoption.

Expected effects: the Company is evaluating this new standard and its
expected timing of adoption.

Investments – Policy Loans

A.
Policy loans are carried at unpaid principal balances plus accumulated interest, the total of which approximates fair value. These loans are
collateralized by life insurance policy cash values and therefore have minimal exposure to credit loss. Interest rates are reset annually based on
a rolling average of benchmark interest rates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

B.
Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost that approximates fair value. Cash equivalents consist of short-term investments with maturities
of three months or less from the time of purchase. The Company reclassifies cash overdraft positions to accounts payable, accrued expenses
and other liabilities when the legal right of offset does not exist.

Premiums, Accounts and Notes Receivable and Reinsurance Recoverables

C.
Premiums,  accounts  and  notes  receivable  and  reinsurance  recoverables  are  reported  net  of  allowances  for  doubtful  accounts  and
unrecoverable reinsurance of $210 million as of December 31, 2017 and $ 203 million as of December 31, 2016. The Company estimates these
allowances for doubtful accounts and unrecoverable reinsurance using management’s best estimates of collectability, taking into consideration
the age of the outstanding amounts, historical collection patterns and other economic factors. See Note 22 for additional discussion of the
allowance established in 2016 for the risk corridor receivable.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs

D.
Costs eligible for deferral include incremental, direct costs of acquiring new or renewal insurance and investment contracts and other costs
directly related to successful contract acquisition. Examples of deferrable costs include commissions, sales compensation and benefits, policy

68 CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K

PART II
ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

issuance  and  underwriting  costs  and  premium  taxes.  The  Company  records  acquisition  costs  differently  depending  on  the  product  line.
Acquisition costs for:

•

Supplemental health, life and accident insurance products (primarily individual products) that comprise the majority of the Company’s
deferred policy acquisition costs and group health and accident insurance products are deferred and amortized, generally in proportion to
the ratio of periodic revenue to the estimated total revenues over the contract periods.

•

Universal life products are deferred and amortized in proportion to the present value of total estimated gross profits over the expected lives
of the contracts.

•

Other products are expensed as incurred.

Deferred policy acquisition costs also include the value of business acquired for certain acquisitions with material long-duration insurance
contracts.  The  Company  recorded  amortization  of  deferred  policy  acquisition  costs  of  $322  million  in  2017,  $292  million  in  2016  and
$286 million in 2015 primarily in other operating expenses.

Each  year,  deferred  policy  acquisition  costs  are  tested  for  recoverability.  For  universal  life  and  other  individual  products,  management
estimates the present value of future revenues less expected payments. For group health and accident insurance products, management
estimates  the  sum  of  unearned  premiums  and  anticipated  net  investment  income  less  future  expected  claims  and  related  costs.  If
management’s estimates of these sums are less than the deferred costs, the Company reduces deferred policy acquisition costs and records an
additional expense.

Other Assets, including Other Intangibles

E.
Other assets, including other intangibles consist primarily of GMIB assets, accrued net investment income, other intangible assets and various
other insurance-related assets. See Note 9 for the Company’s accounting policy for GMIB assets and see Note 17 for the Company’s accounting
policy for other intangibles. Additionally, these other assets include the carrying value of our equity-method investments in joint ventures in
China, India (as of 2017) and other foreign jurisdictions.

Contractholder Deposit Funds

F.
Liabilities  for  contractholder  deposit  funds  primarily  include  deposits  received  from  customers  for  investment-related  and  universal  life
products and investment earnings on their fund balances. These liabilities are adjusted to reflect administrative charges and, for universal life
fund  balances,  mortality  charges.  In  addition,  this  caption  includes:  1)  premium  stabilization  reserves  under  group  insurance  contracts
representing experience refunds left with the Company to pay future premiums; 2) deposit administration funds used to fund non-pension
retiree insurance programs; 3) retained asset accounts; and 4) annuities or supplementary contracts without significant life contingencies.
Interest credited on these funds is accrued ratably over the contract period.

Future Policy Benefits

G.
Future policy benefits represent the present value of estimated future obligations under long-term life and supplemental health insurance
policies and annuity products currently in force. These obligations are estimated using actuarial methods and consist primarily of reserves for
annuity  contracts,  life  insurance  benefits,  GMDB  contracts  (see  Note  9  for  additional  information)  and  certain  health,  life  and  accident
insurance products of our Global Supplemental Benefits segment.

Obligations for annuities represent specified periodic benefits to be paid to an individual or groups of individuals over their remaining lives.
Obligations for life insurance policies and GMDB contracts represent benefits expected to be paid to policyholders, net of future premiums
expected to be received. Management estimates these obligations based on assumptions as to premiums, interest rates, mortality or morbidity,
future  claim  adjudication  expenses  and  surrenders,  allowing  for  adverse  deviation  as  appropriate.  Mortality,  morbidity  and  surrender
assumptions  are  based  on  the  Company’s  own  experience  and  published  actuarial  tables.  Interest  rate  assumptions  are  based  on
management’s judgment considering the Company’s experience and future expectations, and range from 0.1% to 9%. Obligations for the
run-off settlement annuity business include adjustments for realized and unrealized investment returns consistent with GAAP when a premium
deficiency exists.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

H.
Products and services are offered in Turkey and India through joint venture entities. The Company is the principal equity holder and primary
beneficiary of the Turkey joint venture and accordingly, this entity is consolidated. In 2017, Cigna modified the agreement governing its joint
venture in India due to changes in the local regulatory environment that require control by a local partner. As a result of the changes in the joint
venture agreement, the Company determined that it is no longer the primary beneficiary of the joint venture and, effective with the third
quarter of 2017, no longer consolidates its results.

As of December 31, 2017 the redeemable noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets represent the Turkey joint venture
partner’s preferred and common stock interests in the entity. Our joint venture partner may, at their election, require the Company to purchase
their redeemable noncontrolling interests. We also have the right to require our joint venture partner to sell their redeemable noncontrolling
interests  to  us.  The  redeemable  noncontrolling  interests  were  recorded  at  fair  value  as  of  the  dates  of  purchase.  When  the  estimated
redemption  value  for  a  redeemable  noncontrolling  interest  exceeds  its  carrying  value,  an  adjustment  to  increase  the  redeemable
noncontrolling interest is recorded with an offsetting reduction to additional paid-in capital. When an adjustment is made to the carrying value
of the redeemable noncontrolling interest, the calculation of shareholders’ net income per share will be adjusted if the redemption value
exceeds the greater of the carrying value or fair value.

Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities

I.
Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities include liabilities for pension, other postretirement and postemployment benefits
(see Note 15), GMIB contract liabilities (see Note 9), self-insured exposures, management compensation, cash overdraft positions and various
insurance-related liabilities, including experience-rated refunds, reinsurance contracts and the risk adjustment and minimum medical loss ratio
rebate  accruals  under  The  Patient  Protection  and  Affordable  Care  Act  (the  ‘‘ACA’’).  Legal  costs  to  defend  the  Company’s  litigation  and
arbitration matters are expensed when incurred in cases where the Company cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate cost to defend. In cases
where the Company can reasonably estimate the cost to defend, a liability for these costs is accrued when the claim is reported.

Translation of Foreign Currencies

J.
The Company generally conducts its international business through foreign operating entities that maintain assets and liabilities in local
currencies that are generally their functional currencies. The Company uses exchange rates as of the balance sheet date to translate assets and
liabilities into U.S. dollars. Translation gains or losses on functional currencies, net of applicable taxes, are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss). The Company uses average monthly exchange rates during the year to translate revenues and expenses into U.S.
dollars.

Premiums and Related Expenses

K.
Premiums for group life, accident and health insurance and managed care coverages are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the
contract period. Benefits and expenses are recognized when incurred and, for our Global Health Care insured business, medical costs are
presented  net  of  pharmaceutical  manufacturer  rebates.  For  experience-rated  contracts,  premium  revenue  includes  an  adjustment  for
experience-rated refunds based on contract terms and calculated using the customer’s experience (including estimates of incurred but not
reported claims).

Premium revenue also includes an adjustment to reflect the estimated effect of rebates due to customers under the commercial minimum
medical loss ratio provisions of the ACA. These rebates are settled in the year following the policy year.

Premiums received for the Company’s Medicare Advantage Plans and Medicare Part D products from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (‘‘CMS’’) and customers are recognized as revenue ratably over the contract period. CMS provides risk-adjusted premium payments
for Medicare Advantage Plans and Medicare Part D products based on the demographics and wellness of enrollees. The Company recognizes
periodic changes to risk-adjusted premiums as revenue when the amounts are determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Additionally,
Medicare Part D premiums include payments from CMS for risk sharing adjustments. The risk sharing adjustments are estimated quarterly
based  on  claim  experience  by  comparing  actual  incurred  drug  benefit  costs  to  estimated  costs  submitted  in  original  contracts.  These
adjustments may result in more or less revenue from CMS. Final revenue adjustments are determined and settled with CMS in the year following
the contract year. Premium revenue also includes an adjustment to reflect the estimated effect of rebates due to CMS under the Medicare
Advantage and Medicare Part D minimum medical loss ratio provisions of the ACA.

The ACA prescribed three programs to mitigate the risk for participating health insurance companies selling coverage on the public exchanges:
risk adjustment, reinsurance and risk corridor. The reinsurance and risk corridor programs expired at the end of 2016, while the permanent risk
adjustment program continues. A summary of these programs and the Company’s accounting policy is provided below.

•

•

•

The risk adjustment program reallocates funds from insurers with lower risk populations to insurers with higher risk populations based on the
relative risk scores of participants in non-grandfathered plans in the individual and small group markets, both on and off the exchanges. We
estimate our receivable or payable based on the risk of our members compared to the risk of other members in the same state and market,
considering data obtained from industry studies and the United States Department of Health and Human Services (‘‘HHS’’). Receivables or
payables  are  recorded  as  adjustments  to  premium  revenue  based  on  our  year-to-date  experience  when  the  amounts  are  reasonably
estimable and collection is reasonably assured. Final revenue adjustments are determined by HHS in the year following the policy year.

The reinsurance program (discontinued as of December 31, 2016) was designed to provide reimbursement to insurers for high cost individual
business sold on or off the public exchanges. Reinsurance contributions associated with non-grandfathered individual plans were reported as
reductions in premium revenues, and estimated reinsurance recoveries were established with offsetting reductions in Global Health Care
medical costs. Reinsurance fee contributions for other insured business were reported in other operating expenses.

The risk corridor program (also discontinued as of December 31, 2016) was designed to limit insurer gains and losses by comparing allowable
medical costs to a target amount as defined by HHS. The Company recorded receivables or payables as adjustments to premium revenue
based  on  year-to-date  experience  when  the  amounts  were  reasonably  estimable  and  collection  was  reasonably  assured.  In  2016,  the
Company also recorded an allowance against these risk corridor receivables that is discussed further in Note 22.

Premiums for individual life, accident and supplemental health insurance and annuity products, excluding universal life and investment-related
products, are recognized as revenue when due. Benefits and expenses are matched with premiums.

Revenue for universal life products is recognized as follows:

•

•

Investment income on assets supporting universal life products is recognized in net investment income as earned.

Charges for mortality, administration and policy surrender are recognized in premiums as earned. Administrative fees are considered earned
when services are provided.

Benefits and expenses for universal life products consist of benefit claims in excess of policyholder account balances and income earned by
policyholders.  Expenses  are  recognized  when  claims  are  incurred,  and  income  is  credited  to  policyholders  in  accordance  with  contract
provisions.

The unrecognized portion of premiums received is recorded as unearned premiums.

Fees, Related Expenses and Mail Order Pharmacy Revenues and Costs

L.
Contract fees for administrative services only (‘‘ASO’’) programs and pharmacy programs and services are recognized in fees and other
revenues as services are provided, net of estimated pharmaceutical manufacturer rebates payable to ASO clients using our network of retail
pharmacies and estimated refunds under performance guarantees. Expenses associated with these programs and services are recognized in
other  operating  expenses  as  incurred,  net  of  estimated  pharmaceutical  rebates  from  manufacturers  for  prescriptions  filled  through  our
network of retail pharmacies.

In  some  cases,  the  Company  provides  performance  guarantees  associated  with  meeting  certain  service  standards,  clinical  outcomes  or
financial metrics. If these service standards, clinical outcomes or financial metrics are not met, the Company may be financially at risk up to a
stated percentage of the contracted fees or a stated dollar amount. The Company defers revenues for estimated payouts associated with these
performance guarantees. Approximately 11% of ASO fees reported for the year ended December 31, 2017 were at risk under performance
guarantees, with reimbursements estimated to be less than 1% of revenues.

Revenues for investment-related products are recognized as follows:

•

Investment income on assets supporting investment-related products is recognized in net investment income as earned.

•

Contract fees based upon related administrative expenses are recognized in fees and other revenues as they are earned ratably over the
contract period.

Benefits and expenses for investment-related products consist primarily of income credited to policyholders in accordance with contract
provisions.

Mail order pharmacy revenues and the cost of prescriptions are recognized as each prescription is shipped. Mail order pharmacy revenues are
presented net of estimated pharmaceutical manufacturer rebates payable to ASO clients using our mail order business. Mail order pharmacy
costs include the cost of prescriptions sold and other costs to operate this business including supplies, shipping and handling, net of estimated
pharmaceutical rebates from manufacturers for prescriptions filled through our mail order business.

Mergers, Acquisitions and Dispositions

NOTE 3
The following table presents transaction-related costs incurred by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
Transaction-related costs primarily consist of fees for legal, advisory and other professional services as well as employee costs. In addition,
because  the  merger  with  Anthem,  Inc.  (‘‘Anthem’’)  was  not  consummated,  certain  transaction-related  costs  that  were  previously  not
deductible  for  federal  income  tax  purposes  became  deductible.  The  Company  recognized  an  incremental  tax  benefit  for  these  newly
deductible costs in 2017 as presented below.

The proceeds of this debt were mainly used to pay the consideration for the cash tender offer as described below. The Company intends to use
the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the maturity of its Notes due in 2018.

At any time prior to July 15, 2027 (three months prior to the maturity date of the 10-Year Notes) or April 15, 2047 (six months prior to the
maturity date of the 30-Year Notes), the Company may redeem the 10-Year Notes or the 30-Year Notes, in whole or in part, with accrued and
unpaid interest, at a redemption price equal to the greater of:

•

100% of the principal amount of the applicable Notes; or

•

the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest (excluding interest accrued at the redemption
date) from the redemption date to the maturity date discounted at the applicable Treasury Rate plus 15 basis points for the 10-Year Notes and
20 basis points for the 30-Year Notes.

In the third quarter of 2017, the Company completed a cash tender offer to purchase $1.0 billion of aggregate principal amount of certain of its
outstanding debt securities. The Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $321 million ($209 million after-tax), consisting primarily of premium
payments on the tender.

During the first quarter of 2017, the Company repaid $250 million of long-term notes that had matured.

In April 2015, the Company redeemed two of its outstanding notes early. The Company paid $955 million, including accrued interest and
expenses that resulted in a pre-tax loss on early debt extinguishment of $100 million ($65 million after-tax).

In December 2017, the Company entered into an updated revolving credit and letter of credit agreement. This agreement extends through
December 2022 and is diversified among 15 banks. Under this agreement, the Company can borrow up to $1.5 billion for general corporate
purposes, of which up to $500 million can be used for letters of credit. The credit agreement includes options to increase the commitment
amount to $2 billion and to extend the term past December 2022, subject to consent by the lenders. The agreement contains customary
covenants and restrictions, including a financial covenant that the Company may not permit its leverage ratio – total consolidated debt to total
consolidated capitalization (each as defined in the credit agreement) – to be greater than 50%. The Company was in compliance with its debt
covenants as of December 31, 2017.

The Company maintains a share repurchase program authorized by its Board of Directors. Under this program, the Company may repurchase
shares from time to time. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general
business and market conditions, and alternate uses of capital. The share repurchase program may be effected through open market purchases
or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including through
Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

The Company has authorized a total of 25 million shares of $1 par value preferred stock. No shares of preferred stock were outstanding at
December 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015.

Global Health Care Medical Costs Payable

NOTE 7
Medical costs payable for the Global Health Care segment reflects estimates of the ultimate cost of claims that have been incurred but not
reported, including expected development on reported claims, those that have been reported but not yet paid (reported claims in process),
and other medical care expenses and services payable that are primarily comprised of accruals for incentives and other amounts payable to
health care professionals and facilities.

Accounting  policy. The  Company  uses  actuarial  principles  and  assumptions  that  are  consistently  applied  each  reporting  period  and
recognizes the actuarial best estimate of the ultimate liability along with a margin for adverse deviation. This approach is consistent with
actuarial standards of practice that the liabilities be adequate under moderately adverse conditions.

This liability predominately consists of incurred but not reported amounts and reported claims in process including expected development on
reported claims. The liability is primarily calculated using ‘‘completion factors’’ developed by comparing the claim incurral date to the date
claims were paid. Completion factors are impacted by several key items including changes in: 1) electronic (auto-adjudication) versus manual
claim processing, 2) provider claims submission rates, 3) membership and 4) the mix of products. The Company uses historical completion
factors combined with an analysis of current trends and operational factors to develop current estimates of completion factors. The Company
estimates the liability for claims incurred in each month by applying the current estimates of completion factors to the current paid claims data.
This approach implicitly assumes that historical completion rates will be a useful indicator for the current period.

For more recent months, the Company relies more heavily on medical cost trend analysis that reflects expected claim payment patterns and
other relevant operational considerations. Medical cost trend is primarily impacted by medical service utilization and unit costs that are
affected by changes in the level and mix of medical benefits offered, including inpatient, outpatient and pharmacy, the impact of copays and
deductibles, changes in provider practices and changes in consumer demographics and consumption behavior.

For each reporting period, the Company compares key assumptions used to establish the medical costs payable to actual experience. When
actual  experience  differs  from  these  assumptions,  medical  costs  payable  are  adjusted  through  current  period  shareholders’  net  income.
Additionally, the Company evaluates expected future developments and emerging trends that may impact key assumptions. The process used
to determine this liability requires the Company to make critical accounting estimates that involve considerable judgment, reflecting the

CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K 73

PART II

variability inherent in forecasting future claim payments. These estimates are highly sensitive to changes in the Company’s key assumptions,
specifically completion factors and medical cost trends.

Reinsurance and other amounts recoverable reflect amounts due from reinsurers and policyholders to cover incurred but not reported and
pending claims for certain business where the Company administers the plan benefits but the right of offset does not exist. See Note 9 for
additional information on reinsurance.

The total of incurred but not reported liabilities plus expected development on reported claims, including reported claims in process, was
$2.6 billion at December 31, 2017 and $2.4 billion at December 31, 2016. The remaining balance in both periods reflects amounts due for
physician incentives and other medical care expenses and services payable.

(3) Other amounts in 2017 primarily related to an increase in the 2016 reinsurance reimbursement rate from CMS under the ACA. Other amounts in 2016 primarily related to increased medical

costs in the Government segment resulting from sharing additional risk adjustment revenue with providers.

Incurred costs related to prior years in the table above, although adjusted through shareholders’ net income, do not directly correspond to an
increase  or  decrease  to  shareholders’  net  income.  The  primary  reason  for  this  difference  is  that  decreases  to  prior  year  incurred  costs
pertaining to the portion of the liability established for moderately adverse conditions are not considered as impacting shareholders’ net
income if they are offset by increases in the current year provision for moderately adverse conditions.

The net impact of prior year development on shareholders’ net income was a $112 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2017. The
net  impact  of  prior  year  development  on  shareholders’  net  income  was  insignificant  in  2016.  Favorable  prior  year  development  implies
primarily lower than expected utilization of medical services and vice versa while amounts close to zero imply utilization of medical services
that are consistent with expectations.

More than 95% of health claims for an accident year are paid within one year of their incurred date.

There is no single or common claim frequency metric used in the health care industry. The Company believes a relevant metric for the Global
Health Care segment is the number of customers for whom an insured medical claim was paid. Customers for whom no insured medical claim
was paid are excluded from the calculation. Claims that did not result in a liability are not included in the frequency metric.

Liabilities for Unpaid Claims and Claim Expenses
NOTE 8
The following information relates to the Company’s unpaid claims and claim expense liabilities.

Accounting  policy. Liabilities  for  unpaid  claims  and  claim  expenses  are  established  by  book  of  business  within  the  Company’s  Group
Disability and Life, Global Supplemental Benefits and Other Operations segments. The Group Disability and Life segment’s liability for unpaid
claims  and  claim  expenses  consists  of  the  following  primary  products:  long-term  and  short-term  disability,  life  insurance,  and  accident
coverages. Unpaid claims and claim expenses consist of (1) case or claims reserves for reported claims that are unpaid as of the balance sheet
date; (2) incurred but not reported reserves for claims when the insured event has occurred but has not been reported to the Company; and
(3) loss adjustment expense reserves for the expected costs of settling these claims. The Company consistently estimates incurred but not yet
reported losses using actuarial principles and assumptions based on historical and projected claim incidence patterns, claim size and the
expected payment period. The Company recognizes the actuarial best estimate of the ultimate liability within a level of confidence, consistent
with actuarial standards of practice that the liabilities be adequate under moderately adverse conditions. When estimates of these liabilities
change, the Company immediately records the adjustment in benefits and expenses.

The majority of the Company’s liability for disability claims consists of the present value of estimated future benefit payments, including
expected development, for each reported claim that is currently receiving benefit payments, or pending a decision on eligibility for benefits,
over the expected disability period. The Company projects the expected disability period by using historical resolution rates combined with an
analysis of current trends and operational factors to develop current estimates of resolution rates. Using the Company’s experience, expected
claim resolution rates may vary based upon the anticipated disability period, the covered benefit period, the cause of disability, the benefit
design and the claimant’s age, gender and income level. The gross monthly benefit is reduced (offset) by disability income received under
other benefit programs, most commonly Social Security Disability Income, workers’ compensation, statutory disability or other group benefit
plans. For certain offsets not yet finalized, the Company estimates the probability and amount of future offset awards and lapses based on the
Company’s experience.

The Company also establishes a liability for the expected present value of future benefit payments for known claims that have recently been
resolved but may reopen in the future, based on Company experience. Prior to a claim becoming known, the Company establishes a liability for
incurred but not reported claims, using standard actuarial techniques and calculations based on completion factors and loss ratio assumptions
using the Company’s experience combined with an analysis current trends and operational factors. Completion factors are impacted by several
key items including changes in claim inventory levels, claim payment patterns, changes in business volume and other factors. Loss ratio
assumptions are developed using historical Company experience, adjusted prospectively for expected changes in the underlying business
including rate actions, persistency and inforce growth.

Reinsurance  in  the  previous  table  reflects  amounts  due  from  reinsurers  related  to  unpaid  claims  liabilities.  The  Company’s  insurance
subsidiaries enter into agreements with other companies primarily to limit losses from large exposures and to permit recovery of a portion of
incurred losses. See Note 9 for additional information on reinsurance.

The majority of the liability for unpaid claims and claim expenses is related to disability claims with long-tailed payouts. Interest earned on
assets backing these liabilities is an integral part of pricing and reserving. Therefore, interest accreted on prior year balances is shown as a
separate component of prior year incurred claims. This interest is calculated by applying the average discount rate used in determining the
liability balance to the average liability balance over the period. The remaining prior year incurred claims amount primarily reflects updates to
the Company’s liability estimates and variances between actual experience during the period relative to the assumptions and expectations
reflected in determining the liability. Assumptions reflect the Company’s expectations over the life of the book of business and will vary from
actual experience in any period, both favorably and unfavorably, with variation in resolution rates being the most significant driver for the
long-term  disability  business.  Prior  year  incurred  claims  reported  in  2016  included  the  impact  of  changes  made  to  our  disability  claims
management process and a period of elevated life claims.

The claims frequency metric used for the Company’s long-term disability line of business represents the number of unique claim events for
which benefits have been approved and payments made. Claim events are identified using a unique claimant identifier and incurral date. Thus,
if an individual has multiple claims for different disabling events (and therefore different incurral dates), each will be determined to be a unique
claim event. However, if an individual receives multiple benefits under more than one policy (for example for supplemental disability benefits
such as pension contribution benefits or survivor benefits), the Company treats this as a single claim occurrence because they related to the
same claim event. Claims frequency metrics for the most recent year are expected to be low reflecting the long-term disability product features
including waiting and elimination periods that result in delayed eligibility for contract benefits. Claims that did not result in a liability are not
included in the frequency metric.

The  following  is  supplementary  and  unaudited  information  about  average  historical  claims  payout  patterns  for  the  long-term  disability
business for the years presented in the development table as of December 31, 2017. The average annual percentage payout of incurred claims,
net of reinsurance, is approximately 9% in year one, 24% in year two, 16% in year three, 9% in year four, 7% in year five, and 6% in year six.

The following table reconciles the long-term disability net incurred and paid claims development table to the liability for unpaid claims and

The other short-duration insurance books of business, net of reinsurance, primarily include liabilities for life, accident and short-term disability
insurance products. Liabilities for these products are typically complete within one year. Claim development on these liabilities is largely driven
by completion factors and loss ratio assumptions. In 2016, development on these liabilities was driven by a period of elevated life claims.

Reinsurance

NOTE 9
The Company’s insurance subsidiaries enter into agreements with other insurance companies to assume and cede reinsurance. Reinsurance is
ceded primarily to limit losses from large exposures and to permit recovery of a portion of direct or assumed losses. Reinsurance is also used in
acquisition and disposition transactions when the underwriting company is not being acquired. Reinsurance does not relieve the originating
insurer of liability. Therefore, reinsured liabilities must continue to be reported along with the related reinsurance recoverables. The Company
regularly evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentrations of its credit risk.

Reinsurance Recoverables
The majority of the Company’s reinsurance recoverables resulted from acquisition and disposition transactions in which the underwriting
company was not acquired. Components of the Company’s reinsurance recoverables are presented in the following table:

Effective Exit of GMDB and GMIB Business
In 2013, the Company entered into an agreement with Berkshire to effectively exit the GMDB and GMIB business via a reinsurance transaction.
Berkshire reinsured 100% of the Company’s future claim payments in this business, net of other reinsurance arrangements existing at that time.
The reinsurance agreement is subject to an overall limit with approximately $3.4 billion remaining at December 31, 2017.

GMDB is accounted for as reinsurance and GMIB assets and liabilities are reported as derivatives at fair value as discussed below. GMIB assets
are reported in other assets, including intangibles, and GMIB liabilities are reported in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities.

GMDB
The majority of the GMDB exposure arises under annuities written by ceding companies that guarantee the benefit received at death will be no
less than the highest historical account value of the related mutual fund investments on a contractholder’s anniversary date. Under this type of
death benefit, the Company’s exposure arises when the highest anniversary account value exceeds the fair value of the related mutual fund
investments at the time of a contractholder’s death.

Accounting policy. The Company estimates the gross liability and reinsurance recoverable with an internal model based on the Company’s
experience  and  future  expectations  over  an  extended  period,  consistent  with  the  long-term  nature  of  this  product.  As  a  result  of  the
reinsurance transaction, reserve increases have a corresponding increase in the recorded reinsurance recoverable, provided the increased
recoverable remains within the overall Berkshire limit (including the GMIB asset presented below). The ending net retained reserve covers
ongoing administrative expenses, as well as minor claim exposure retained by the Company.

Because the product is premium deficient, the Company records an increase to the net retained reserve if it is inadequate based on the model.

The following table presents the account value, net amount at risk and average attained age of underlying contractholders for guarantees
assumed by the Company in the event of death. The net amount at risk is the amount that the Company would have to pay if all contractholders
died as of the specified date. Unless the Berkshire reinsurance limit is exceeded, the Company should be reimbursed in full for these payments.

GMIB
In  this  business,  the  Company  reinsured  contracts  with  issuers  of  GMIB  products.  The  Company’s  exposure  represents  the  excess  of  a
contractually guaranteed amount over the level of variable annuity account values. Payment by the Company depends on the actual account
value in the underlying mutual funds and the level of interest rates when the contractholders elect to receive minimum income payments that
must occur within 30 days of a policy anniversary after the appropriate waiting period. The Company has purchased retrocessional coverage
(‘‘GMIB assets’’) for these contracts.

Accounting policy. The Company reports GMIB liabilities and assets as derivatives at fair value because cash flows of these liabilities and
assets are affected by equity markets and interest rates, but are without significant life insurance risk and are settled in lump sum payments.
Periodically, the Company receives and pays fees based on either contractholders’ account values or deposits increased at a contractual rate.
The Company will also pay and receive cash depending on changes in account values and interest rates when contractholders first elect to
receive minimum income payments. Cash flows on these contracts are reported in operating activities.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were three reinsurers for GMIB as follows:

Assumptions used in fair value measurement. GMIB assets and liabilities are established using capital market assumptions (including market
returns, interest rates and market volatilities of the underlying equity and bond mutual fund investments) and assumptions related to future
annuitant behavior (including mortality, lapse, and annuity election rates). As assumptions related to future annuitant behavior are largely
unobservable, the Company classifies GMIB assets and liabilities in Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy presented in Note 10.

The only assumption expected to impact future shareholders’ net income is non-performance risk. The non-performance risk adjustment
reflects a market participant’s view of nonpayment risk by adding an additional spread to the discount rate in the calculation of both (a) the
GMIB liabilities to be paid by the Company, and (b) the GMIB assets to be paid by the reinsurers, after considering collateral.

The Company regularly evaluates each of the assumptions used in establishing these assets and liabilities. Significant decreases in assumed
lapse rates or spreads used to calculate non-performance risk of the Company, or significant increases in assumed annuity election rates or
spreads used to calculate the non-performance risk of the reinsurers, would result in higher fair value measurements. A change in one of these
assumptions is not necessarily accompanied by a change in another assumption.

ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

GMIB guarantees. Future payments are not fixed and determinable under the terms of these contracts. Accordingly, the Company calculated
exposure, without considering any reinsurance coverage, using the following hypothetical assumptions:

•

no annuitants surrendered their accounts;

•

all annuitants lived to elect their benefit;

•

all annuitants elected to receive their benefit on the next available date (2018 through 2022); and

•

all underlying mutual fund investment values remained at the December 31, 2017 value of $822 million with no future returns.

The Company has reinsurance coverage in place that covers the exposures on these contracts. Using these hypothetical assumptions, GMIB
exposure is $573 million, which is lower than the recorded liability for GMIB calculated using fair value assumptions.

Fair Value Measurements

NOTE 10
The  Company  carries  certain  financial  instruments  at  fair  value  in  the  financial  statements  including  fixed  maturities,  equity  securities,
short-term investments and derivatives. Other financial instruments are measured at fair value only under certain conditions, such as when
impaired.

Fair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between market participants at the balance
sheet date. A liability’s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a market participant, not the amount that
would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor.

The Company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value have been classified based upon a hierarchy defined by GAAP. The hierarchy
gives the highest ranking to fair values determined using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1)
and the lowest ranking to fair values determined using methodologies and models with unobservable inputs (Level 3). An asset’s or a liability’s
classification is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to its measurement. For example, a financial asset or liability carried at fair
value would be classified in Level 3 if unobservable inputs were significant to the instrument’s fair value, even though the measurement may be
derived using inputs that are both observable (Levels 1 and 2) and unobservable (Level 3).

The Company estimates fair values using prices from third parties or internal pricing methods. Fair value estimates received from third-party
pricing services are based on reported trade activity and quoted market prices when available, and other market information that a market
participant  may  use  to  estimate  fair  value.  The  internal  pricing  methods  are  performed  by  the  Company’s  investment  professionals  and
generally involve using discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating current market inputs for similar financial instruments with comparable
terms and credit quality, as well as other qualitative factors. In instances where there is little or no market activity for the same or similar
instruments, fair value is estimated using methods, models and assumptions that the Company believes a hypothetical market participant
would use to determine a current transaction price. These valuation techniques involve some level of estimation and judgment that becomes
significant with increasingly complex instruments or pricing models.

The Company is responsible for determining fair value, as well as for assigning the appropriate level within the fair value hierarchy, based on the
significance  of  unobservable  inputs.  The  Company  reviews  methodologies,  processes  and  controls  of  third-party  pricing  services  and
compares prices on a test basis to those obtained from other external pricing sources or internal estimates. The Company performs ongoing
analyses of both prices received from third-party pricing services and those developed internally to determine that they represent appropriate
estimates of fair value. The controls executed by the Company include evaluating changes in prices and monitoring for potentially stale
valuations. The Company also performs sample testing of sales values to confirm the accuracy of prior fair value estimates. The minimal
exceptions identified during these processes indicate that adjustments to prices are infrequent and do not significantly impact valuations.
Annually, we conduct an on-site visit of the most significant pricing service to review their processes, methodologies and controls. This on-site
review includes a walk-through of inputs for a sample of securities held across various asset types to validate the documented pricing process.

A. Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Carried at Fair Value
The following table provides information as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 about the Company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair
value. Separate account assets that are also recorded at fair value on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets are reported separately in
the Separate Accounts section as gains and losses related to these assets generally accrue directly to policyholders.

Level 1 Financial Assets
Inputs  for  instruments  classified  in  Level  1  include  unadjusted  quoted  prices  for  identical  assets  in  active  markets  accessible  at  the
measurement date. Active markets provide pricing data for trades occurring at least weekly and include exchanges and dealer markets.

Assets in Level 1 include actively-traded U.S. government bonds and exchange-listed equity securities. Given the narrow definition of Level 1
and the Company’s investment asset strategy to maximize investment returns, a relatively small portion of the Company’s investment assets
are classified in this category.

Level 2 Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
Inputs for instruments classified in Level 2 include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices from those
willing to trade in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are market observable or can be corroborated by market data for the term of
the instrument. Such other inputs include market interest rates and volatilities, spreads and yield curves. An instrument is classified in Level 2 if
the Company determines that unobservable inputs are insignificant.

Fixed maturities and equity securities. Approximately  94%  of  the  Company’s  investments  in  fixed  maturities  and  equity  securities  are
classified  in  Level  2  including  most  public  and  private  corporate  debt  and  equity  securities,  federal  agency  and  municipal  bonds,
non-government mortgage-backed securities and preferred stocks. Because many fixed maturities do not trade daily, third-party pricing
services and internal methods often use recent trades of securities with similar features and characteristics. When recent trades are not
available, pricing models are used to determine these prices. These models calculate fair values by discounting future cash flows at estimated
market interest rates. Such market rates are derived by calculating the appropriate spreads over comparable U.S. Treasury securities, based on
the credit quality, industry and structure of the asset. Typical inputs and assumptions to pricing models include, but are not limited to, a
combination of benchmark yields, reported trades, issuer spreads, liquidity, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, and industry and
economic events. For mortgage-backed securities, inputs and assumptions may also include characteristics of the issuer, collateral attributes,
prepayment speeds and credit rating.

Nearly all of these instruments are valued using recent trades or pricing models. Less than 1% of the fair value of investments classified in Level 2
represents foreign bonds that are valued using a single unadjusted market-observable input derived by averaging multiple broker-dealer
quotes, consistent with local market practice.

Short-term investments are carried at fair value which approximates cost. On a regular basis, the Company compares market prices for these
securities to recorded amounts to validate that current carrying amounts approximate exit prices. The short-term nature of the investments
and corroboration of the reported amounts over the holding period support their classification in Level 2.

Other derivatives classified in Level 2 represent over-the-counter instruments such as interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts. Fair
values for these instruments are determined using market observable inputs including forward currency and interest rate curves and widely
published market observable indices. Credit risk related to the counterparty and the Company is considered when estimating the fair values of
these  derivatives.  However,  the  Company  is  largely  protected  by  collateral  arrangements  with  counterparties  and  determined  that  no
adjustment for credit risk was required as of December 31, 2017 or 2016. Level 2 also includes exchange-traded interest rate swap contracts.

CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K 81

PART II
ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Credit  risk  related  to  the  clearinghouse  counterparty  and  the  Company  is  considered  minimal  when  estimating  the  fair  values  of  these
derivatives because of upfront margin deposits and daily settlement requirements. The nature and use of these other derivatives are described
in Note 12.

Level 3 Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
Certain inputs for instruments classified in Level 3 are unobservable (supported by little or no market activity) and significant to their resulting
fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s best estimate of what hypothetical market participants would use to
determine a transaction price for the asset or liability at the reporting date.

The Company classifies certain newly issued, privately-placed, complex or illiquid securities, as well as assets and liabilities relating to GMIB, in
Level 3. Approximately 3% of fixed maturities and equity securities are priced using significant unobservable inputs and classified in this
category.

Fair values of mortgage and other asset-backed securities, corporate and government fixed maturities are primarily determined using pricing
models that incorporate the specific characteristics of each asset and related assumptions including the investment type and structure, credit
quality, industry and maturity date in comparison to current market indices, spreads and liquidity of assets with similar characteristics. For
mortgage and other asset-backed securities, inputs and assumptions for pricing may also include collateral attributes and prepayment speeds.
Recent trades in the subject security or similar securities are assessed when available, and the Company may also review published research in
its evaluation, as well as the issuer’s financial statements.

Quantitative Information about Unobservable Inputs
The following table summarizes the fair value and significant unobservable inputs used in pricing the following securities that were developed
directly by the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The range and weighted average basis point amounts (‘‘bps’’) for fixed maturity
spreads (adjustment to discount rates) and price-to-earnings multiples for equity investments reflect the Company’s best estimates of the
unobservable adjustments a market participant would make to calculate these fair values.

Mortgage and other asset-backed securities. The significant unobservable inputs used to value the following mortgage and other asset-
backed securities are liquidity and weighting of credit spreads. When there is limited trading activity for the security, an adjustment for liquidity
is made as of the measurement date that considers current market conditions, issuer circumstances and complexity of the security structure.
An adjustment to weight credit spreads is needed to value a more complex bond structure with multiple underlying collateral and no standard
market  valuation  technique.  The  weighting  of  credit  spreads  is  primarily  based  on  the  underlying  collateral’s  characteristics  and  their
proportional cash flows supporting the bond obligations.

Corporate and government fixed maturities. The significant unobservable input used to value the following corporate and government fixed
maturities is an adjustment for liquidity. When there is limited trading activity for the security, an adjustment is needed to reflect current market
conditions and issuer circumstances.

Private equity securities. The significant unobservable input used to value the following private equity securities is a multiple of earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (‘‘EBITDA’’). These securities are comprised of private equity investments with limited
trading activity and therefore a ratio of EBITDA is used to estimate value based on company circumstances and relative risk characteristics.

Hybrid equity securities. The significant unobservable input used to value the following hybrid equity securities is an adjustment for liquidity
due to limited trading activity. These cumulative preferred shares are deemed likely to exercise certain call options and the Company estimates
an adjustment used to discount cash flows based on current market conditions and issuer circumstances.

Significant increases in liquidity or credit spreads would result in lower fair value measurements while decreases in these inputs would result in
higher fair value measurements. Significant decreases in equity price-to-EBITDA multiples would result in lower fair value measurements while
increases in these inputs would result in higher fair value measurements. Generally, the unobservable inputs are not interrelated and a change in
the assumption used for one unobservable input is not accompanied by a change in the other unobservable input.

As noted in the preceding tables, total gains and losses included in shareholders’ net income are reflected in the following captions in the
Consolidated Statements of Income:

•

Realized investment gains (losses) and net investment income for amounts related to fixed maturities and equity securities and realized
investment  gains  (losses)  for  the  impact  of  changes  in  non-performance  risk  related  to  GMIB  assets  and  liabilities,  similar  to  hedge
ineffectiveness; and

•

Other operating expenses for amounts related to GMIB assets and liabilities (GMIB fair value gain/loss), except for the impact of changes in
non-performance risk.

In the tables above, gains and losses included in other comprehensive income are reflected in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on
securities in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

Reclassifications impacting Level 3 financial instruments are reported as transfers into or out of the Level 3 category as of the beginning of the
quarter in which the transfer occurs. Therefore gains and losses in income only reflect activity for the period the instrument was classified in
Level 3.

Transfers  into  or  out  of  the  Level  3  category  occur  when  unobservable  inputs,  such  as  the  Company’s  best  estimate  of  what  a  market
participant would use to determine a current transaction price, become more or less significant to the fair value measurement. During 2017 and
2016, transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 primarily reflected changes in liquidity and credit risk estimates for certain private placement
issuers across several sectors including metals, mining, energy, utilities, capital goods, consumer products and transportation services.

Separate Accounts
Accounting  policy. Separate  account  assets  and  liabilities  are  contractholder  funds  maintained  in  accounts  with  specific  investment
objectives. The assets of these accounts are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of any of the Company’s other
businesses. These separate account assets are carried at fair value with equal amounts recorded for related separate account liabilities. The
investment income and fair value gains and losses of these accounts generally accrue directly to the contractholders and, together with their
deposits and withdrawals, are excluded from the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income and Cash Flows. Fees and charges earned for
mortality risks, asset management or administrative services are reported in either premiums or fees and other revenues. Investments that are
measured using the practical expedient of Net Asset Value (‘‘NAV’’) are excluded from the fair value hierarchy.

B. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value under Certain Conditions
Some financial assets and liabilities are not carried at fair value each reporting period, but may be measured using fair value only under certain
conditions, such as investments in real estate, partnership entities and commercial mortgage loans when they become impaired. Impaired
values for these asset types classified as Level 3 representing less than 1% of total investments, were written down to their fair values, resulting
in immaterial realized investment losses in 2017 and 2016.

The fair values for all financial instruments presented in the table above have been estimated using market information when available. The
following valuation methodologies and inputs are used by the Company to determine fair value.

Commercial mortgage loans. The Company estimates the fair value of commercial mortgage loans generally by discounting the contractual
cash flows at estimated market interest rates that reflect the Company’s assessment of the credit quality of the loans. Market interest rates are
derived by calculating the appropriate spread over comparable U.S. Treasury rates based on the property type, quality rating and average life
of the loan. The quality ratings reflect the relative risk of the loan considering debt service coverage, the loan-to-value ratio and other factors.
Fair values of impaired mortgage loans are based on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral generally determined using an internal
discounted cash flow model. The fair value measurements were classified in Level 3 because the cash flow models incorporate significant
unobservable inputs.

Contractholder deposit funds, excluding universal life products. Generally, these funds do not have stated maturities. Approximately 70% of
these balances can be withdrawn by the customer at any time without prior notice or penalty. The fair value for these contracts is the amount
estimated to be payable to the customer as of the reporting date, which is generally the carrying value. Most of the remaining contractholder
deposit  funds  are  reinsured  by  the  buyers  of  the  individual  life  and  annuity  and  retirement  benefits  businesses.  The  fair  value  for  these
contracts is determined using the fair value of these buyers’ assets supporting these reinsured contracts. The Company had reinsurance
recoverables equal to the carrying value of these reinsured contracts. These instruments were classified in Level 3 because certain inputs are
unobservable (supported by little or no market activity) and significant to their resulting fair value measurement.

Long-term debt, including current maturities, excluding capital leases. The fair value of long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for
recent trades. When quoted market prices are not available, fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis and the Company’s
estimated current borrowing rate for debt of similar terms and remaining maturities. These measurements were classified in Level 2 because
the fair values are based on quoted market prices or other inputs that are market observable or can be corroborated by market data.

Fair values of off-balance sheet financial instruments were not material as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Investments, Investment Income and Gains and Losses

NOTE 11
Cigna’s investment portfolio consists of a broad range of investments including fixed maturities and equity securities, commercial mortgage
loans, other long-term investments and short-term investments. The sections below provide more detail regarding our accounting policies,
investment balances, net investment income and realized investment gains and losses. See Note 10 for information about the valuation of the
Company’s investment portfolio.

A.

Investment Portfolio

Fixed Maturities and Equity Securities
Accounting policy. Fixed maturities (including bonds, mortgage and other asset-backed securities and preferred stocks redeemable by the
investor) and most equity securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders’ equity. Net unrealized appreciation on investments supporting the
Company’s run-off settlement annuity business is reported in future policy benefit liabilities rather than accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss).

Equity securities include hybrid investments consisting of preferred stock with call features that are carried at fair value with changes in fair
value reported in other realized investment gains (losses) and dividends reported in net investment income. As of December 31, 2017, fair
values of these securities were $49 million and amortized cost was $61 million. As of December 31, 2016, fair values of these securities were
$36 million and amortized cost was $49 million.

The Company records impairment losses in net income for fixed maturities with fair value below amortized cost that meet either of the
following conditions:

•

•

If the Company intends to sell or determines that it is more likely than not to be required to sell these fixed maturities before their fair values
recover, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the amortized cost over fair value.

If the net present value of projected future cash flows of a fixed maturity (based on qualitative and quantitative factors, including the
probability of default, and the estimated timing and amount of recovery) is below the amortized cost basis, that difference is recognized as an
impairment loss. For mortgage and asset-backed securities, estimated future cash flows are also based on assumptions about the collateral
attributes including prepayment speeds, default rates and changes in value.

(1) Net unrealized appreciation for these investments is excluded from accumulated other comprehensive income.

As of December 31, 2017, the Company had commitments to purchase $118 million of fixed maturities, all of which bear interest at a fixed market
rate.

Review of declines in fair value. Management reviews fixed maturities with a decline in fair value from cost for impairment based on criteria
that include:

•

length of time and severity of decline;

•

financial health and specific near term prospects of the issuer;

•

changes in the regulatory, economic or general market environment of the issuer’s industry or geographic region; and

•

the Company’s intent to sell or the likelihood of a required sale prior to recovery.

Based on this review, management believes the unrealized depreciation below to be temporary, and therefore has not impaired these amounts.
The table below summarizes fixed maturities with a decline in fair value from amortized cost by the length of time these securities have been in
an unrealized loss position.

Commercial Mortgage Loans
Mortgage loans held by the Company are made exclusively to commercial borrowers and are diversified by property type, location and
borrower. Loans are generally issued at a fixed rate of interest and are secured by high quality, primarily completed and substantially leased
operating properties.

Accounting policy. Commercial mortgage loans are carried at unpaid principal balances or, if impaired, the lower of unpaid principal or fair
value of the underlying real estate. See the ‘‘Impaired commercial mortgage loans’’ section below for the Company’s accounting policy for
impaired commercial mortgage loans.

At December 31, commercial mortgage loans were distributed among the following property types and geographic regions:

As  of  December  31,  2017,  approximately  86%  of  the  Company’s  commercial  mortgage  loan  portfolio  is  scheduled  to  mature  in  2022  or
thereafter.

Actual maturities could differ from contractual maturities for several reasons: borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations with or
without prepayment penalties; the maturity date may be extended; and loans may be refinanced.

As of December 31, 2017, the Company had commitments to extend credit under commercial mortgage loan agreements of $21 million.

Credit quality. The Company regularly evaluates and monitors credit risk, beginning with the initial underwriting of a mortgage loan and
continuing throughout the investment holding period. Mortgage origination professionals employ an internal credit quality rating system
designed to evaluate the relative risk of the transaction at origination that is then updated each year as part of the annual portfolio loan review.
The Company evaluates and monitors credit quality on a consistent and ongoing basis, classifying each loan as a loan in good standing,
potential problem loan or problem loan.

Quality ratings are based on our evaluation of a number of key inputs related to the loan, including real estate market-related factors such as
rental rates and vacancies, and property-specific inputs such as growth rate assumptions and lease rollover statistics. However, the two most
significant contributors to the credit quality rating are the debt service coverage and loan-to-value ratios. The debt service coverage ratio
measures the amount of property cash flow available to meet annual interest and principal payments on debt, with a ratio below 1.0 indicating
that there is not enough cash flow to cover the required loan payments. The loan-to-value ratio, commonly expressed as a percentage,
compares the amount of the loan to the fair value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan.

The following table summarizes the credit risk profile of the Company’s commercial mortgage loan portfolio based on loan-to-value and debt
service coverage ratios, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016:

The Company’s annual in-depth review of its commercial mortgage loan investments is the primary mechanism for identifying emerging risks
in the portfolio. The most recent review was completed by the Company’s investment professionals in the second quarter of 2017 and included
an analysis of each underlying property’s most recent annual financial statements, rent rolls, operating plans, budgets, a physical inspection of
the property and other pertinent factors. Based on historical results, current leases, lease expirations and rental conditions in each market, the
Company estimates the current year and future stabilized property income and fair value for each loan.

CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K 87

PART II
ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

The Company will reevaluate a loan’s credit quality between annual reviews if new property information is received or an event such as
delinquency or a borrower’s request for restructure causes management to believe that the Company’s estimate of financial performance, fair
value or the risk profile of the underlying property has been impacted.

Impaired commercial mortgage loans. A commercial mortgage loan is considered impaired when it is probable that the Company will not
collect all amounts due according to the terms of the original loan agreement. These loans are included in either problem or potential problem
loans. The Company monitors credit risk and assesses the impairment of loans individually and on a consistent basis for all loans in the
portfolio. Impaired loans are carried at the lower of unpaid principal balance or the fair value of the underlying real estate. The Company
estimates the fair value of the underlying real estate using internal valuations generally based on discounted cash flow analyses. Certain
commercial  mortgage  loans  without  valuation  reserves  are  considered  impaired  because  the  Company  will  not  collect  all  interest  due
according to the terms of the original agreements; however, the Company expects to recover the unpaid principal because it is less than the fair
value of the underlying real estate. Because of the risk profile of the underlying investment, the Company recognizes interest income on
impaired mortgage loans only when payment is actually received.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, impaired commercial mortgage loans and valuation reserves associated with impaired loans were not
material. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the average recorded investment in impaired loans and interest income on impaired
loans were not material.

Other Long-Term Investments
Accounting  policy. Other  long-term  investments  include  investments  in  unconsolidated  entities.  These  entities  include  certain  limited
partnerships and limited liability companies holding real estate, securities or loans. These investments are carried at cost plus the Company’s
ownership percentage of reported income or loss in cases where the Company has significant influence; otherwise the investment is carried at
cost. Income from certain entities is reported on a one quarter lag depending on when their financial information is received. Other long-term
investments are considered impaired, and written down to their fair value, when cash flows indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. Fair value is generally determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis.

Other long-term investments also include investment real estate carried at depreciated cost less any impairment write downs to fair value
when cash flows indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Depreciation is generally recorded using the straight-line method
based on the estimated useful life of each asset. Investment real estate as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 is expected to be held longer than one
year and includes real estate acquired through the foreclosure of commercial mortgage loans.

Additionally, other long-term investments include interest rate and foreign currency swaps carried at fair value. See Note 12 for information on
the Company’s accounting policies for these derivative financial instruments.

Other long-term investments and related commitments are diversified by issuer, property type and geographic regions. The following table
provides unfunded commitment and fair value information on these investments. The Company expects to disburse approximately 31% of the
committed amounts in 2018.

Short-Term Investments and Cash Equivalents
Accounting policy. Security investments with maturities of greater than three months to one year from time of purchase are classified as
short-term,  available  for  sale  and  carried  at  fair  value  that  approximates  cost.  Cash  equivalents  consist  of  short-term  investments  with
maturities of three months or less from the time of purchase and are carried at cost that approximates fair value.

NOTE 12

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage the characteristics of investment assets (such as duration, yield, currency and
liquidity) to meet the varying demands of the related insurance and contractholder liabilities (such as paying claims, investment returns and
withdrawals) and to hedge interest rate risk of its long-term debt. The Company has written and purchased GMIB reinsurance contracts in its
run-off reinsurance business that are accounted for as freestanding derivatives and further discussed in Note 9. Derivatives in the Company’s

CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K 89

PART II
ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

separate accounts are excluded from the following discussion because associated gains and losses generally accrue directly to separate
account policyholders.

Accounting  policy. The  Company  applies  hedge  accounting  when  derivatives  are  designated,  qualified  and  highly  effective  as  hedges.
Effectiveness is formally assessed and documented at inception and each period throughout the life of a hedge using various quantitative
methods appropriate for each hedge, including regression analysis and dollar offset. Under hedge accounting, the changes in fair value of the
derivative and the hedged risk are generally recognized together and offset each other when reported in shareholders’ net income. Changes in
the fair value of a derivative instrument may not always equal changes in the fair value of the hedged item. This is referred to as ‘‘hedge
ineffectiveness’’ and is generally recorded in realized investment gains and losses. In the event of an early hedge termination, the changes in fair
value of derivatives that qualified for hedge accounting are reported in shareholders’ net income, generally as a part of realized investment
gains and losses. Derivative cash flows are generally reported in operating activities.

The following tables provide information on the Company’s specific applications of derivative financial instruments during the years ended
December 31.

Fair Value Hedge of Long-Term Corporate Debt

Type of instrument.

Interest rate swap contracts

Notional Value (in millions)
2016
2017
$ 750
$ 750

Purpose. To convert a portion of the interest rate exposure on the Company’s long-term debt from fixed to variable rates. This more
closely aligns the Company’s interest expense with the interest income received on its cash equivalent and short-term investment balances.
The variable rates are benchmarked to LIBOR.

Terms of derivative instruments. The Company provides upfront margin and settles fair value changes and net interest between variable
and fixed rates daily with a central clearinghouse.

Accounting. Using  fair  value  hedge  accounting,  the  fair  values  of  the  swap  contracts  are  reported  in  other  assets,  including  other
intangibles, or accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities. The critical terms of these swaps match those of the long-term
debt being hedged. As a result, the carrying value of the hedged debt is adjusted to reflect changes in its fair value driven by LIBOR. The
effects of those adjustments on other operating expenses are offset by the effects of corresponding changes in the swaps’ fair value. The
net impact from the hedge reported in other operating expenses reflects interest expense on the hedged debt at the variable interest rate.

Fair Value Hedges of Fixed Maturity Bonds
Type of instrument. Foreign currency swap contracts

Notional Value (in millions)
2016
2017
$ 318
$ 78

Purpose. To hedge the foreign exchange related changes in fair values of the Company’s fixed maturity bonds.

Terms of derivative instruments. The Company periodically exchanges cash flows between two currencies for both principal and interest.
Foreign currency swaps are Euros and British pounds and have terms for up to twelve years.

Accounting. Using fair value hedge accounting, fair values are reported in other long-term investments or accounts payable, accrued
expenses, and other liabilities. Changes in fair values of the swap contracts, as well as changes in the fair values of the hedged bonds
attributable to the hedged risk, are reported in other realized investment gains and losses.

Economic Hedges of a Fixed Maturity Bond Portfolio

Type of instrument. Foreign currency forward contracts

Notional Value (in millions)
2016
2017
$ 255
$ 149

Purpose. To hedge the foreign exchange related changes in fair values of a U.S. dollar-denominated fixed maturity bond portfolio to
reflect the local currency for one of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries.

Terms  of  derivative  instruments. The  Company  agrees  to  purchase  South  Korean  won  in  exchange  for  U.S.  dollars  at  a  future  date,
generally within three months from the contracts’ trade dates.

Accounting. As these arrangements were not designated as accounting hedges, fair values are reported in short-term investments or
accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities, and changes in fair values are reported in other realized investment gains and
losses.

As  of  and  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2017  and  2016,  the  effects  of  these  derivative  instruments  on  the  Consolidated  Financial
Statements were not material, including the amounts of gains or losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into
shareholders’ net income. No material amounts were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and no significant gains or losses
were recognized due to hedge ineffectiveness.

Collateral and termination features. The Company routinely monitors exposure to credit risk associated with derivatives and diversifies the
portfolio among approved dealers of high credit quality to minimize this risk. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $9 million in cash on

90 CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K

PART II
ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

deposit  representing  the  upfront  margin  required  for  the  Company’s  centrally-cleared  derivative  instruments.  Certain  of  the  Company’s
over-the-counter derivative instruments contain provisions requiring either the Company or the counterparty to post collateral or demand
immediate  payment  depending  on  the  amount  of  the  net  liability  position  and  predefined  financial  strength  or  credit  rating  thresholds.
Collateral  posting  requirements  vary  by  counterparty.  The  net  asset  or  liability  positions  of  these  derivatives  were  not  material  as  of
December 31, 2017 or 2016.

NOTE 13

Variable Interest Entities

When the Company becomes involved with a variable interest entity, as well as when there is a change in the Company’s involvement with an
entity, the Company must determine if it is the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the entity. The Company would be considered the
primary beneficiary if it has the power to direct the entity’s most significant economic activities or has the right to receive benefits or obligation
to absorb losses that could be significant to the entity. The Company evaluates the following criteria:

•
•
•

the structure and purpose of the entity;
the risks and rewards created by and shared through the entity; and
the Company’s ability to direct its activities, receive its benefits and absorb its losses relative to the other parties involved with the entity
including its sponsors, equity holders, guarantors, creditors and servicers.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company determined it was not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entities. The
Company’s involvement in variable interest entities where it is not the primary beneficiary is described below.

Securities limited partnerships and real estate limited partnerships. The Company owns interests in securities limited partnerships and real
estate limited partnerships that are defined as variable interest entities. These partnerships invest in the equity or mezzanine debt of privately
held companies and real estate properties. General partners unaffiliated with the Company control decisions that most significantly impact the
partnership’s operations and the limited partners do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights. The Company’s maximum exposure
to these entities of $2.4 billion across approximately 116 limited partnerships as of December 31, 2017 includes $1.2 billion reported in other
long-term investments and commitments to contribute an additional $1.2 billion. The Company’s non-controlling interest in each of these
limited partnerships is generally less than 10% of the partnership ownership interests.

Other asset-backed and corporate securities.
In the normal course of its investing activities, the Company also makes passive investments in
certain asset-backed and corporate securities that are issued by variable interest entities whose sponsors or issuers are unaffiliated with the
Company. The Company receives fixed-rate cash flows from these investments and the maximum potential exposure to loss is limited to the
carrying amount of $0.6 billion as of December 31, 2017 that is reported in fixed maturities. The Company’s combined ownership interests are
insignificant relative to the total principal amounts issued by these entities.

The Company is also involved in real estate joint ventures, independent physician associations (‘‘IPAs’’) and a joint venture in India that are
variable interest entities. The carrying values and maximum exposures associated with these arrangements are immaterial.

The Company has not provided, and does not intend to provide, financial support to any of the above entities that it is not contractually
required to provide. The Company performs ongoing qualitative analyses of its involvement with these variable interest entities to determine if
consolidation is required.

NOTE 15

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

About our Plans

A.
Pension plans. The Company’s principal qualified defined benefit pension plans, the Cigna Pension Plan and the Cigna Pension Plan for
Certain Former Employees, cover approximately 22,200 retirees, 14,500 vested former employees and 14,000 active employees. Current
retirees, certain vested former employees and longer-service active employees are entitled to an annuity benefit based on pay and length of
service. Most pension-eligible active employees and certain vested former employees are entitled to a cash balance defined benefit. The Cigna
Supplemental Pension Plan, a non-qualified and unfunded plan, covers only certain employees. We froze future benefit accruals for all of these
domestic pension plans in 2009. Additionally the Company has foreign pension and other postretirement benefit plans that are immaterial to
our results of operations, liquidity and financial position.

As further discussed in Note 21, Cigna Corporation and the Cigna Pension Plan are defendants in a class action lawsuit related to the Plan’s
conversion of certain employees from an annuity to a cash balance benefit in 1997. When the required plan amendment related to this litigation
is adopted, the pension benefit obligation will be updated to reflect benefits resulting from this litigation.

ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Other postretirement benefit plans. The Company’s postretirement benefit medical plan covers approximately 18,400 retirees and 18,600
active employees. Post-1988 retirees contribute to the cost of this coverage, whereas pre-1989 retirees do not. For post-1988 retirees, the
Company’s cost is capped at 200% of the per capita cost in 2000. Pharmacy coverage for Medicare-eligible retirees is delivered using an
Employer Group Waiver Plan. Under that plan, the Company receives subsidies from CMS. The postretirement medical plan is unfunded and
future benefit accruals were frozen in 2013. The Company also offers certain postretirement life insurance benefits through various plans.
Retirees do not contribute to the cost of life insurance benefits.

Accounting policy. The Company measures the assets and liabilities of its domestic pension and other postretirement benefit plans as of
December 31. Benefit obligations are measured at the present value of estimated future payments based on actuarial assumptions. The
Company uses the ‘‘corridor’’ method to account for changes in the benefit obligation when actual results differ from those assumed, or when
assumptions  change.  These  changes  are  called  net  unrecognized  actuarial  gains  (losses).  Under  the  corridor  method,  net  unrecognized
actuarial gains (losses) are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. When the unrecognized gain (loss) exceeds 10% of
the benefit obligation, that excess is amortized to other operating expense over the expected remaining lives of plan participants.

For balance sheet purposes, we measure plan assets at fair value. When the actual return differs from the expected return, those differences are
reflected in the net unrealized actuarial gain (loss) discussed above. However, to measure pension benefit costs, we use a ‘‘market-related’’
asset valuation that differs from the actual fair value for domestic pension plan assets invested in non-fixed income investments. The ‘‘market-
related’’ value recognizes the difference between actual and expected long-term returns in the portfolio over five years, a method that reduces
the short-term impact of market fluctuations on pension costs. At December 31, 2017, the market-related asset value was approximately
$4.1 billion compared with a fair value of approximately $4.3 billion.

(1) Loss in each year reflects a decrease in the discount rate, partially offset by a favorable change in the mortality assumption.

We fund our qualified pension plans at least at the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the
Pension Protection Act of 2006. For 2018, we do not expect to make any contributions to the qualified pension plans because none are
required. Future years’ contributions will ultimately be based on a wide range of factors including but not limited to asset returns, discount
rates and funding targets. Non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally funded on a pay-as-you-go basis as
there are no plan assets for these plans.

We expect to recognize pre-tax losses of $69 million in 2018 from amortization of the net actuarial loss in our pension plans and pre-tax gains
of $3 million in 2018 from amortization of prior service cost in the other postretirement benefit plans. These estimates are based on a weighted
average amortization period for the frozen and inactive plans that is based on the average expected remaining life of plan participants of
approximately 26 years.

Mortality table for pension and postretirement benefit obligations

RP 2014 with MP 2017

projection scale

RP 2014 with MP 2016

projection scale

The Company used the Society of Actuaries mortality table RP2014 and the updated improvement scales published in 2016 and 2017 to value
its benefit obligations because the Company’s mortality experience closely matched these tables based on internal studies. The updated
improvement  scales  published  in  2016  and  2017  both  indicated  that  mortality  improvement  is  expected  to  be  lower  than  was  originally
projected when the study was first published in 2014, resulting in decreases to the benefit obligations in both years.

The Company sets discount rates by applying actual annualized yields for high quality bonds at various durations to the expected cash flows of
the pension and other postretirement benefits liabilities. A discount rate curve is constructed using an array of bonds in various industries
throughout the domestic market, but only selects those for the curve that have an above average return at each duration. Management
believes that this curve is representative of the yields that the Company is able to achieve through its plan asset investment strategy.

Expected long-term rates of return on plan assets were developed considering actual long-term historical returns, expected long-term market
conditions, plan asset mix and management’s investment strategy that continues a significant allocation to domestic and foreign equity
securities as well as securities partnerships, real estate and hedge funds. Expected long-term market conditions take into consideration certain
key macroeconomic trends including expected domestic and foreign GDP growth, employment levels and inflation.

The estimated rate of future increases in the per capita cost of postretirement health care benefits is 6.50% in 2018, decreasing by 0.25% per
year to 4.75% in 2024 and beyond. The impact of a 1% increase or decrease in the estimated rate would be immaterial to postretirement cost
and benefit obligation.

Pension Plan Assets

E.
As of December 31, 2017, pension assets included $3.9 billion invested in the separate accounts of Connecticut General Life Insurance Company
and Life Insurance Company of North America, subsidiaries of the Company, as well as an additional $342 million invested directly in funds
offered by the buyer of the retirement benefits business.

(1) A pooled separate account has several participating benefit plans and each owns a share of the total pool of investments.

The  Company’s  current  target  investment  allocation  percentages  (50%  fixed  income,  30%  public  equity  securities  and  20%  in  other
investments, including private equity (securities partnerships), real estate and hedge funds) are developed by management as guidelines,
although the fair values of each asset category are expected to vary as a result of changes in market conditions. The Company would expect to
further reduce the allocation to equity securities and other investments and increase the allocation to fixed income investments as funding
levels improve.

See Note 10 for further details regarding how fair value is determined, including the level within the fair value hierarchy and the procedures we
use to validate fair value measurements. Within pension plan assets, the Company classifies substantially all fixed maturities in Level 2. These
assets are valued using recent trades of similar securities or are fund investments priced using their daily net asset value that is the exit price.
Within  pension  assets,  a  substantial  portion  of  domestic  equity  securities  are  classified  as  Level  1,  while  international  equity  funds  are
predominantly classified in Level 2 using daily net asset value.

Securities partnerships, real estate and hedge funds are valued using NAV as a practical expedient and are excluded from the fair value
hierarchy. See Note 10 for additional disclosures related to these assets invested in the separate accounts of the Company’s subsidiaries.
Certain securities as described in Note 10, as well as commercial mortgage loans and guaranteed deposit account contracts, are classified in
Level 3 because unobservable inputs used in their valuation are significant.

401(k) Plans

F.
The Company sponsors a 401(k) plan in which the Company matches a portion of employees’ pre-tax contributions. Participants in the plan
may invest in various funds that invest in the Company’s common stock, several diversified stock funds, a bond fund or a fixed-income fund.

The Company may elect to increase its matching contributions if the Company’s annual performance meets certain targets. The Company’s
annual expense for these plans was as follows:

A. About Our Plans
The People Resources Committee (‘‘the Committee’’) of the Board of Directors awards stock options, restricted stock, deferred stock and
strategic performance shares (‘‘SPS’’) to certain employees. The Committee has issued common stock instead of cash compensation. The
Company issues shares from Treasury stock for these awards.

The Company records compensation expense for stock and option awards over their vesting periods primarily based on the estimated fair
value at the grant date. Fair value is determined differently for each type of award as discussed below.

Shares of common stock available for award at December 31 were as follows:

B. Stock Options
Accounting policy. The Company awards options to purchase Cigna common stock at the market price of the stock on the grant date.
Options vest over periods ranging from one to three years and expire no later than 10 years from grant date. Fair value is estimated using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model by applying the assumptions presented below. That fair value is reduced by options expected to be
forfeited during the vesting period. The Company estimates forfeitures at the grant date based on our experience and adjusts the expense to
reflect actual forfeitures over the vesting period. The fair value of options, net of forfeitures, is recognized in operating expenses on a straight
line basis over the vesting period.

The expected volatility reflects the past daily stock price volatility of Cigna stock. The Company does not consider volatility implied in the
market prices of traded options to be a good indicator of future volatility because remaining traded options will expire within one year. The
risk-free interest rate is derived using the four-year U.S. Treasury bond yield rate as of the award date for the primary annual grant. Expected
option life reflects the Company’s historical experience.

C. Restricted Stock
The Company awards restricted stock to the Company’s employees with vesting periods ranging from three to five years. Recipients of
restricted  stock  awards  accumulate  dividends  during  the  vesting  period,  but  forfeit  their  awards  and  accumulated  dividends  if  their
employment terminates before the vesting date.

Accounting policy. Fair value of restricted stock awards is equal to the market price of Cigna’s common stock on the date of grant. This fair
value is reduced by awards that are expected to forfeit. At the grant date, the Company estimates forfeitures based on experience and adjusts

the expense to reflect actual forfeitures over the vesting period. This fair value, net of forfeitures, is recognized in other operating expenses

At the end of 2017, approximately 4,800 employees held 1.3 million restricted stock awards with $68 million of related compensation expense
to be recognized over the next two years (weighted average period).

D. Strategic Performance Shares (‘‘SPS’’)
The Company awards SPSs to executives and certain other key employees generally with a performance period of three years. Half of these
shares are subject to a market condition (total shareholder return relative to industry peer companies) and half are subject to a performance
condition (cumulative adjusted net income). These targets are set by the Committee. At the end of the performance period, holders of SPSs are
awarded shares of Cigna common stock ranging anywhere from 0 to 200% of the original grant of SPSs.

Accounting policy. Compensation expense for SPSs is recorded over the performance period. For ‘‘market condition’’ SPSs, fair value is
determined at the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model and not subsequently adjusted regardless of the final outcome. For
‘‘performance condition’’ SPSs, expense is initially accrued based on the most likely outcome, but evaluated for adjustment each period for
updates in the expected outcome. At the end of the performance period, expense is adjusted to the actual outcome (number of shares
awarded times the share price at the grant date). At the grant date, the Company estimates forfeitures based on experience and adjusts the
expense to reflect actual forfeitures over the vesting period.

At the end of 2017, approximately 1,500 employees held 778,000 SPSs and $38 million of related compensation expense is expected to be
recognized over the next two years. For ‘‘performance condition’’ SPSs, the amount of expense may vary based on actual performance in 2018
and 2019.

E. One-Time Employee Stock Award
In 2017, the Company granted most employees a one-time stock award of five shares that immediately vested. In connection with this program,
approximately 205,000 shares were issued at a price of $162.96, resulting in a pre-tax cost of $33 million.

F. Compensation Cost and Tax Effects of Share-based Compensation
During the vesting period, the Company records tax benefits in shareholders’ net income based on the amount of expense being recognized.
When stock options are exercised, or when restricted stock and SPSs vest, the difference between tax benefits based on the expense and the
actual tax benefit realized are also recorded in net income beginning in 2016 in accordance with ASU 2016-09. Prior to 2016, such excess tax
benefits were recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. The table below provides information about the cost and tax benefits
related to all of our share-based compensation arrangements discussed above.

NOTE 17

Goodwill, Other Intangibles and Property and Equipment

A. Goodwill
Accounting policy. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of their net assets. The resulting
goodwill is assigned to those reporting units expected to realize cash flows from the acquisition, allocated to reporting units based on relative
fair values, primarily reported in the Global Health Care segment ($5.9 billion) and, to a lesser extent, the Global Supplemental Benefits
segment ($0.3 billion).

The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually during the third quarter at the reporting unit level and writes it down through
shareholders’ net income if impaired. Fair value of a reporting unit is generally estimated based on either market data or a discounted cash flow
analysis using assumptions that the Company believes a hypothetical market participant would use to determine a current transaction price.
The significant assumptions and estimates used in determining fair value include the discount rate and future cash flows. A range of discount
rates is used that corresponds with the reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital, consistent with that used for investment decisions
considering the specific and detailed operating plans and strategies within the reporting unit. Projections of future cash flows for the reporting
unit are consistent with our annual planning process for revenues, claims, operating expenses, taxes, capital levels and long-term growth rates.

B. Other Intangibles
Accounting policy. The Company’s other intangible assets include purchased customer and producer relationships, provider networks and
trademarks. The fair value of purchased customer relationships and the amortization method were determined as of the dates of purchase
using an income approach that relies on projected future net cash flows including key assumptions for the customer attrition rate and discount
rate. The Company amortizes other intangibles on an accelerated or straight-line basis over periods from five to 30 years. Management revises
amortization periods if it believes there has been a change in the length of time that an intangible asset will continue to have value. Costs
incurred to renew or extend the terms of these intangible assets are generally expensed as incurred.

C. Property and Equipment
Accounting policy. Property and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. When applicable, cost includes interest, real
estate taxes and other costs incurred during construction. Also included in this category is internal-use software that is acquired, developed or
modified solely to meet the Company’s internal needs, with no plan to market externally. Costs directly related to acquiring, developing or
modifying internal-use software are capitalized.
The Company calculates depreciation and amortization principally using the straight-line method generally based on the estimated useful life
of each asset as follows: buildings and improvements, 10 to 40 years; purchased software, three to five years; internally developed software,
three to seven years; and furniture and equipment (including computer equipment), three to 10 years. Improvements to leased facilities are
depreciated  over  the  lesser  of  the  remaining  lease  term  or  the  estimated  life  of  the  improvement.  The  Company  considers  events  and
circumstances that would indicate the carrying value of property, equipment or capitalized software might not be recoverable. If the Company
determines the carrying value of any of these assets is not recoverable, an impairment charge is recorded.

NOTE 19

Shareholders’ Equity and Dividend Restrictions

State insurance departments and foreign jurisdictions that regulate certain of the Company’s subsidiaries prescribe accounting practices
(differing in some respects from GAAP) to determine statutory net income and surplus. The Company’s life, accident and health insurance and
Health  Maintenance  Organization  (‘‘HMO’’)  subsidiaries  are  regulated  by  such  statutory  requirements.  Due  to  regulatory  changes  in  the
jurisdiction  of  one  of  our  foreign  insurance  affiliates,  surplus  increased  significantly  in  2017,  primarily  due  to  including  deferred  policy
acquisition costs as an admitted asset. The statutory net income of the Company’s life, accident and health insurance and HMO subsidiaries for
the years ended, and their statutory surplus as of December 31, were as follows:

The Company’s HMO and life, accident and health insurance subsidiaries are also subject to minimum statutory surplus requirements and may
be required to maintain investments on deposit with state departments of insurance or other regulatory bodies. Additionally, these subsidiaries
may be subject to regulatory restrictions on the amount of annual dividends or other distributions (such as loans or cash advances) that
insurance companies may extend to the parent company without prior approval. As of December 31, 2017, these amounts, including restricted
GAAP net assets of the Company’s subsidiaries, were as follows:

Minimum statutory surplus required by regulators

NOTE 20

Income Taxes

U.S. Tax Reform Legislation
Major U.S. tax reform legislation was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The legislation is highlighted by a reduction in the corporate
income tax rate from the current 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The Company expects a significant decline in its effective tax rate
beginning in 2018 as a result of the rate reduction. The remaining provisions of the law, most of which take effect on January 1, 2018, are not
expected to have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations beginning in 2018.

The Company recorded additional tax expense of $232 million in 2017 resulting from this legislation, comprised of $144 million due to the
revaluation of net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate and $88 million due to the assessment of U.S. taxes
related to the Company’s accumulated unremitted foreign earnings. The legislation provides an election to pay these taxes over eight years,
and we expect to adopt this election. Both the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the taxes on accumulated unremitted

100 CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K

PART II
ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

foreign earnings are considered provisional as permitted under SAB 118 (see Note 2) because certain adjustments used to calculate the taxes at
year-end were based on estimates.

Also as a result of tax reform, the Company recorded a reduction in operating expenses of $56 million ($36 million after-tax) reflecting a
decrease in a liability to reimburse a reinsurer for taxes related to a block of business sold through reinsurance. An offsetting tax effect is
included in the $144 million charge discussed above, resulting in no after-tax effect for this item.

Accounting policy. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for differences between the financial and income tax reporting
bases of the underlying assets and liabilities and established based upon enacted tax rates and laws, including the U.S. tax reform legislation
enacted in December 2017. Deferred income tax assets are recognized when available evidence indicates that realization is more likely than
not. The deferred income tax provision generally represents the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year,
excluding amounts reported as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income or amounts initially recorded due to business
combinations. The current income tax provision generally represents estimated amounts due on various income tax returns for the year
reported plus the effect of any uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated in accordance with GAAP.

Income taxes for the Company’s foreign operations are provided using the respective foreign jurisdictions’ tax rate.

The  Company’s  foreign  operations  continue  to  retain  a  significant  portion  of  their  earnings  overseas.  These  undistributed  earnings  are
deployed outside of the United States in support of the liquidity and capital needs of our foreign operations as well as to support growth
initiatives overseas. The Company does not intend to repatriate these earnings.

Consolidated pre-tax income from the Company’s foreign operations was approximately 14% of the Company’s pre-tax income in 2017. The
comparable amount in prior years was 11% in 2016 and 2015. South Korean operations produced approximately 13% of the Company’s pre-tax
income in 2017, 11% in 2016 and 8% in 2015.

The consolidated effective tax rate was 38.1% in both 2017 and 2016. The additional tax expense associated with the recently enacted U.S. tax
reform legislation was offset by the favorable effects of the one-year moratorium on the non-deductible health insurance industry tax and
recognizing an incremental tax benefit associated with transaction-related costs that is included in ‘‘Other’’ in the above table.

The Company retains a significant portion of its foreign earnings overseas. If the Company intended to remit these earnings it would have
recorded additional deferred tax liabilities of approximately $120 million for foreign withholding taxes. A portion of these taxes may be eligible
for credit against the Company’s U.S. tax liability.

Deferred income tax balances as of December 31, 2017 have been adjusted to reflect the reduced statutory tax rate that took effect as of
January 1, 2018 pursuant to the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation. The Company has recorded incremental tax expense of $144 million
including the adjustment of deferred tax balances related to items reported in accumulated other comprehensive income.

Included in the consolidated net deferred tax asset of $33 million is approximately $175 million of deferred tax liabilities attributable to foreign
jurisdictions, most notably South Korea and Taiwan.

Management believes that future results will be sufficient to realize the Company’s deferred tax assets. With the exception of certain net
operating loss related tax benefits, the Company’s deferred tax benefits may be carried forward indefinitely. Net operating loss benefits are
primarily attributable to foreign jurisdictions. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when it determines that realization of a deferred
tax asset does not meet the more likely than not standard. Valuation allowances have been established against certain federal, foreign and
state deferred tax assets, generally when there is a requirement to assess them on a separate entity basis.

The Internal Revenue Service has completed review of the Company’s consolidated income tax returns through 2012. The statute of limitations
for 2013 has expired, but the Company has filed an amended return for which the pending refund is subject to review. The Company conducts
business in a number of state and foreign jurisdictions, and may be engaged in multiple audit proceedings at any given time. Generally, no
further state or foreign audit activity is expected for tax years prior to 2011.

NOTE 21
The Company, through its subsidiaries, is contingently liable for various guarantees provided in the ordinary course of business.

Contingencies and Other Matters

A.

Financial Guarantees: Retiree and Life Insurance Benefits

The Company guarantees that separate account assets will be sufficient to pay certain life insurance or retiree benefits. The sponsoring
employers are primarily responsible for ensuring that assets are sufficient to pay these benefits and are required to maintain assets that exceed
a certain percentage of benefit obligations. If employers fail to do so, the Company or an affiliate of the buyer of the retirement benefits
business (Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company or ‘‘Prudential’’) has the right to redirect the management of the related
assets to provide for benefit payments. As of December 31, 2017, employers maintained assets that exceeded the benefit obligations under
these arrangements of approximately $470 million. Approximately 12% of these are reinsured by Prudential. The remaining guarantees are
provided by the Company with minimal reinsurance from third parties. The Company establishes an additional liability if management believes

102 CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K

PART II
ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

that the Company will be required to make payment under the guarantees; there were no additional liabilities required for these guarantees as
of December 31, 2017. Separate account assets supporting these guarantees are classified in Levels 1 and 2 of the GAAP fair value hierarchy (see
Note 10).

The Company does not expect that these financial guarantees will have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations,
liquidity or financial condition.

B.

Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit Contracts

See Note 9 for discussion.

C.

Certain Other Guarantees

The Company had indemnification obligations to a lender of approximately $90 million as of December 31, 2017, related to a borrowing by a
certain real estate joint venture that the Company records as an investment. This borrowing (a nonrecourse obligation of the Company) is
secured  by  the  joint  venture’s  real  estate  property  with  a  fair  value  in  excess  of  the  loan  amount  and  matures  in  2021.  The  Company’s
indemnification obligation would require payment to the lender for any actual damages resulting from certain acts such as unauthorized
ownership transfers, misappropriation of rental payments by others or environmental damages. Based on initial and ongoing reviews of
property management and operations, the Company does not expect that payments will be required under this indemnification obligation.
Any payment that might be required could be recovered through a refinancing or sale of the assets. The Company also has recourse to the
partner for their proportionate share of amounts paid. There were no liabilities required for this indemnification obligation as of December 31,
2017.

The Company had indemnification obligations as of December 31, 2017 in connection with acquisition and disposition transactions. These
indemnification obligations are triggered by the breach of representations or covenants provided by the Company, such as representations for
the presentation of financial statements, the filing of tax returns, compliance with law or the identification of outstanding litigation. These
obligations are typically subject to various time limitations, defined by the contract or by operation of law, such as statutes of limitation. In
some cases, the maximum potential amount due is subject to contractual limitations based on a percentage of the transaction purchase price,
while in other cases limitations are not specified or applicable. The Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum
potential amount due under these obligations because not all amounts due under these indemnification obligations are subject to limitation.
There were no liabilities for these indemnification obligations as of December 31, 2017.

D.

Guaranty Fund Assessments

The  Company  operates  in  a  regulatory  environment  that  may  require  its  participation  in  assessments  under  state  insurance  guaranty
association laws. The Company’s exposure to assessments for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and
claimants is based on its share of business written in the relevant jurisdictions.

On March 1, 2017, the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania entered an order of liquidation of Penn Treaty Network America Insurance
Company, together with its subsidiary American Network Insurance Company (collectively ‘‘Penn Treaty’’, a long-term care insurance carrier),
triggering guaranty fund coverage and accrual of a liability. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded in operating
expenses approximately $130 million pre-tax (approximately $85 million after-tax), representing its estimate of the total assessments, net of
premium tax offsets for insurance contracts currently written. Some of the assessments were recorded on a discounted basis, using a weighted
average discount rate of 3.5%. As of December 31, 2017, the recorded liability was approximately $55 million and total future cash outflows as of
December 31, 2017 are expected to approximate $65 million. This assessment is expected to be updated in future periods for changes in the
estimate of the insolvency. In addition, a portion of this assessment is expected to be offset in the future by premium tax credits that will be
recognized in the period received.

E.

Legal and Regulatory Matters

The Company is routinely involved in numerous claims, lawsuits, regulatory audits, investigations and other legal matters arising, for the most
part, in the ordinary course of managing a global health services business. Except for the specific matters noted below, the Company believes
that the legal actions, regulatory matters, proceedings and investigations currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity based upon our current knowledge and taking into consideration
current accruals. Disputed tax matters arising from audits by the Internal Revenue Service (‘‘IRS’’) or other state and foreign jurisdictions,
including those resulting in litigation, are accounted for under GAAP guidance for uncertain tax positions. Further information on income tax
matters can be found in Note 20.

Pending litigation and legal or regulatory matters that the Company has identified with a reasonably possible material loss are described
below. When litigation and regulatory matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable, the Company accrues the
estimated loss by a charge to shareholders’ net income. The estimated loss is the Company’s best estimate of the probable loss at the time or an
amount within a range of estimated losses reflecting the most likely outcome or the minimum amount of the range (if no amount is better than
any other estimated amount in the range.) The Company provides disclosure in the aggregate for material pending litigation and legal or
regulatory matters, including accruals, range of loss, or a statement that such information cannot be estimated. Due to numerous uncertain
factors presented in these cases, it is not possible to estimate an aggregate range of loss (if any) for these matters at this time. In light of the
uncertainties involved in these matters, there is no assurance that their ultimate resolution will not exceed the amounts currently accrued by
the Company. An adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to the Company’s results of operations, financial

CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K 103

PART II
ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

condition or liquidity for any particular period. The Company had pre-tax reserves as of December 31, 2017 of $195 million ($155 million
after-tax) for the matters discussed below under ‘‘Litigation Matters.’’ Litigation related to the Company’s claim processing practices for a
commercial client, for which the Company held a reserve of $40 million pre-tax ($25 million after-tax) at September 30, 2016, was settled for
that amount during the fourth quarter of 2016.

Litigation Matters
Amara cash balance pension plan litigation.
In December 2001, Janice Amara filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Connecticut against Cigna Corporation and the Cigna Pension Plan (the ‘‘Plan’’) on behalf of herself and other similarly situated Plan
participants affected by the 1998 conversion to a cash balance formula. The plaintiffs allege various violations of the Employee Retirement
Income  Security  Act  of  1974  (‘‘ERISA’’),  including  that  the  Plan’s  cash  balance  formula  discriminates  against  older  employees;  that  the
conversion resulted in a wear-away period (when the pre-conversion accrued benefit exceeded the post-conversion benefit); and that the Plan
communications contained inaccurate or inadequate disclosures about these conditions.

In 2008, the District Court (1) affirmed the Company’s right to convert to a cash balance plan prospectively beginning in 1998; (2) found for
plaintiffs on the disclosure claim only; and (3) required the Company to pay pre-1998 benefits under the pre-conversion traditional annuity
formula and post-1997 benefits under the post-conversion cash balance formula. From 2008 through 2015, this case has undergone a series of
court proceedings that resulted in the original District Court order being largely upheld. In 2015, the Company submitted to the District Court
its proposed method for calculating the additional pension benefits due to class members and plaintiffs responded in August 2015.

In January 2016, the District Court ordered the method of calculating the additional pension benefits due to class members. The court order left
several aspects of the calculation of additional plan benefits open to interpretation. From that time through the present, both parties have
disputed various aspects of the Court’s interpretation and the Court has attempted to clarify. On July 14, 2017, the Court issued a ruling
clarifying certain aspects of the January 2016 order. The Plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the July 14, 2017 ruling that was denied
by the Court on November 7, 2017. The Company’s reserve for this litigation is adequate at December 31, 2017, based on calculations consistent
with the Company’s interpretation of the latest guidance from the Court. Due to the continuing inability of the parties to agree on the details of
calculating the pension benefits, the final timing of the resolution of this matter remains uncertain. Once these issues are resolved, the Plan will
be amended to comply with the District Court’s orders and the benefits will begin to be paid.

Ingenix.
In April 2004, the Company was sued in a number of putative nationwide class actions alleging that the Company improperly
underpaid  claims  for  out-of-network  providers  through  the  use  of  data  provided  by  Ingenix,  Inc.,  a  subsidiary  of  one  of  the  Company’s
competitors. These actions were consolidated into Franco v. Connecticut General Life Insurance Company, et al., pending in the U.S. District
Court for the District of New Jersey. The consolidated amended complaint, filed in 2009 on behalf of subscribers, health care providers and
various  medical  associations,  asserted  claims  related  to  benefits  and  disclosure  under  ERISA,  the  Racketeer  Influenced  and  Corrupt
Organizations (‘‘RICO’’) Act, the Sherman Antitrust Act and New Jersey state law and seeks recovery for alleged underpayments from 1998
through the present. Other major health insurers have been the subject of, or have settled, similar litigation.

In September 2011, the District Court (1) dismissed all claims by the health care provider and medical association plaintiffs for lack of standing;
and (2) dismissed the antitrust claims, the New Jersey state law claims and the ERISA disclosure claim. In January 2013 and again in April 2014,
the District Court denied separate motions by the plaintiffs to certify a nationwide class of subscriber plaintiffs. The Third Circuit denied
plaintiffs’ request for an immediate appeal of the January 2013 ruling. As a result, the case is proceeding on behalf of the named plaintiffs only.
In June 2014, the District Court granted the Company’s motion for summary judgment to terminate all claims, and denied the plaintiffs’ partial
motion for summary judgment. In July 2014, the plaintiffs appealed all of the District Court’s decisions in favor of the Company, including the
class  certification  decision,  to  the  Third  Circuit.  On  May  2,  2016,  the  Third  Circuit  affirmed  the  District  Court’s  decisions  denying  class
certification for the claims asserted by members, the granting of summary judgment on the individual plaintiffs’ claims, as well as the dismissal
of the antitrust claims. However, the Third Circuit also reversed the earlier dismissal of the providers’ ERISA claims. The Company will continue
to vigorously defend its position.

Regulatory Matters
Civil Investigative Demand. The U.S. Department of Justice (‘‘DOJ’’) is currently conducting an industry review of the risk adjustment data
submission practices and business processes, including review of medical charts, of Medicare Advantage organizations under Medicare Parts C
and D. In connection with this industry review, in December 2016, the Company received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Civil Division of
the DOJ. We are in the process of voluntarily cooperating with the DOJ’s request and responding to the information request.

Disability claims regulatory matter. During the second quarter of 2013, the Company finalized an agreement with the Departments of
Insurance for Maine, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and California (together, the ‘‘monitoring states’’) related to the Company’s
long-term disability claims handling practices. The agreement requires primarily: (1) enhanced procedures related to documentation and
disposition and (2) a two-year monitoring period followed by a re-examination that began in the second quarter of 2016. Management believes
the Company has addressed the requirements of the agreement. If the monitoring states find material non-compliance with the agreement
upon re-examination, the Company may be subject to additional costs and penalties or requests to change its business practices that could
negatively impact future earnings for this business.

Other Legal Matters
Litigation with Anthem.
In February 2017, the Company delivered a notice to Anthem terminating the merger agreement, and notifying
Anthem that it must pay the Company the $1.85 billion reverse termination fee pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. Also in
February  2017,  the  Company  filed  suit  against  Anthem  in  the  Delaware  Court  of  Chancery  (the  ‘‘Chancery  Court’’)  seeking  declaratory
judgments that the Company’s termination of the merger agreement was valid and that Anthem was not permitted to extend the termination
date. The complaint also sought payment of the reverse termination fee and additional damages in an amount exceeding $13 billion, including
the lost premium value to the Company’s shareholders caused by Anthem’s willful breaches of the merger agreement.

104 CIGNA CORPORATION - 2017 Form 10-K

PART II
ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Also in February 2017, Anthem filed a lawsuit in the Chancery Court against the Company seeking (i) a temporary restraining order to enjoin
Cigna from terminating and taking any action contrary to the terms of the merger agreement, (ii) specific performance compelling Cigna to
comply with the merger agreement and (iii) damages.

On February 15, 2017, the Chancery Court granted Anthem’s motion for a temporary restraining order and temporarily enjoined the Company
from terminating the merger agreement. In May 2017, the Chancery Court denied Anthem’s motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin Cigna
from terminating the merger agreement but stayed its ruling pending Anthem’s determination as to whether to seek an appeal. Anthem
subsequently notified Cigna and the Chancery Court that it did not intend to appeal the Chancery Court’s decision. As a result, the merger
agreement was terminated.

The litigation between the parties remains pending. Trial is scheduled for 2019. We believe in the merits of our claims and dispute Anthem’s
claims, and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves and pursue our claims. The outcomes of lawsuits are inherently unpredictable, and we
may be unsuccessful in the ongoing litigation or any future claims or litigation.

NOTE 22
See Note 1 for a description of our reporting segments.

Segment Information

In the Company’s segment disclosures, we present ‘‘operating revenues,’’ defined as total revenues excluding realized investment results. The
Company excludes realized investment results from this measure because its portfolio managers may sell investments based on factors largely
unrelated to the underlying business purposes of each segment. As a result, gains or losses created in this process may not be indicative of past
or future underlying performance of the business.

The  Company  uses  ‘‘adjusted  income  from  operations’’  as  its  principal  financial  measure  of  segment  operating  performance  because
management believes it best reflects the underlying results of business operations and permits analysis of trends in underlying revenue,
expenses and profitability. Adjusted income from operations is defined as shareholders’ net income excluding after-tax realized investment
gains and losses, net amortization of other acquired intangible assets and special items. Income or expense amounts are excluded from
adjusted income from operations for the following reasons:

•

•

•

Realized investment results are excluded because, as noted above, our portfolio managers may sell investments based on factors largely
unrelated to the underlying business purposes of each segment.

Net amortization of other intangible assets is excluded because it relates to costs incurred for acquisitions and, as a result, it does not relate to
the core performance of the Company’s business operations. In 2015, the amortization amount was net of a bargain purchase gain on an
acquisition.

Special items, if any, are excluded because management believes they are not representative of the underlying results of operations. This is
generally because the nature and size of these matters are not indicative of our ongoing business operations. Additional details about these
items that provide further context as to why they are not considered indicative of ongoing business operations may be found in the footnotes
referenced in the table below.

The following table presents the special items recorded by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

The Company had net receivables from CMS of $0.5 billion as of December 31, 2017 and $0.6 billion as of December 31, 2016. These amounts
were included in premiums, accounts and notes receivable and reinsurance recoverables. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, premiums
and fees from CMS were 17% in 2017, 20% in 2016 and 21% in 2015. These amounts were reported in the Global Health Care segment.

In 2016, the Company recorded an allowance for the balance of its risk corridor receivable from CMS of $124 million based on court decisions
and the large risk corridor program deficit. As of December 31, 2017, the Company continues to hold an allowance for the balance of its risk
corridor  receivable  of  $109  million  based  on  the  current  status  of  court  decisions.  However,  the  Company  continues  to  believe  that  the
government has a binding obligation to satisfy the risk corridor receivable.

ITEM 9A.

Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

A.
Based on an evaluation of the effectiveness of Cigna’s disclosure controls and procedures conducted under the supervision and with the
participation of Cigna’s management, Cigna’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period
covered by this report, Cigna’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Cigna in
the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in the SEC’s rules and forms.

B.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management of Cigna Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting. The
Company’s internal controls were designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board of Directors that the
Company’s  consolidated  published  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  were  prepared  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles
generally accepted in the United States. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

(i)

(ii)

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
and liabilities of the Company;

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
accordance with authorization of management and directors of the Company; and

(iii)

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use or disposition of the Company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. In making this
assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (‘‘COSO’’) in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on management’s assessment and the criteria set forth by COSO, it was determined that
the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting are effective as of December 31, 2017.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report located on page 57 in this Form 10-K.

I have reviewed this Annual Report on Form 10-K of Cigna Corporation;

Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to
make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the
period covered by this report;

Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material
respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

The registrant’s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined  in  Exchange  Act  Rules  13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e))  and  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  (as  defined  in  Exchange  Act
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:

a)

b)

c)

d)

designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us
by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;

designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
our  supervision,  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about
the  effectiveness  of  the  disclosure  controls  and  procedures,  as  of  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  report  based  on  such
evaluation; and

disclosed in this report any change in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant’s most
recent fiscal quarter (the registrant’s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting; and

5.

The registrant’s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial
reporting, to the registrant’s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant’s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent
functions):

a)

all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and

b) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant’s internal

control over financial reporting.
