“Our performance this year is a testament to our best-in-
class global team and to the strength of our diversified 

portfolio and multiple engines of growth.”

WILLIAM P. 

LAUDER

Executive Chairman

Dear Fellow Stockholders, 

The Estée Lauder Companies achieved another year of strong performance in fiscal 2017. At the 
same time, our commitment to the well-being of our employees and the sustainability of the 
markets in which we work has never been stronger. We continue to build upon our position as 
The Global House of Prestige Beauty, delivering outstanding products and experiences to our 
consumers, while growing our global community investments in both scope and impact.

Our performance this year is a testament to our best-in-class global team and to the strength of 
our diversified portfolio and multiple engines of growth. Despite a constantly evolving landscape, 
our ability to embrace and initiate change has empowered us to successfully address industry 
shifts, reach new consumers, and position ourselves for continued long-term, sustainable growth. 

In  fiscal  2017,  we  welcomed  two  fast-growing  makeup  brands,  Too  Faced  and  BECCA,  to  
The Estée Lauder Companies. Too Faced, a brand known for innovative formulas that create 
an  authentic  connection  with  consumers,  has  a  strong  following  among  Millennials.  BECCA, 
a highly coveted brand, is committed to developing premium products in a range of wearable 
shades for all skin tones. Both brands are expected to strengthen the Company’s leadership in 
prestige beauty globally.

We  are  a  Company  that  has  invested  in  our  digital  capabilities  for  many  years.  Today,  the 
intersection of social media, digital marketing, and e-commerce is integral to our brands’ strategies, 
and we are creating a digital-first mindset throughout the Company. In the past year, we have 
strengthened our social media capabilities, gained share in earned media value, and grown our 
brands’ influencer partnerships. We also re-launched our corporate website, ELCompanies.com, 
digitally showcasing our rich history and exceptional portfolio of brands.

As an organization made up of great brands and great people, fostering an innovative, collaborative, 
and creative culture has always been a top priority. We place the highest importance on providing 
ongoing  development  opportunities  and  offering  recognition  and  advancement  across  our 
workforce – from our newest hires to our most seasoned executives. As a learning organization, 
we encourage employees to take smart risks and celebrate the potential of big ideas. We are 
proud to have created an environment in which leaders are dedicated to building future leaders, 
and the opportunities for education and shared insights are plentiful.

Again this year, we received numerous honors and awards that recognize our commitment to 
our employees. For example, we earned a coveted spot on Indeed’s “50 Best Places to Work 
in the Fortune 500”; were named one of the “Top Companies to Work for in the UAE” by the 
Great Place to Work Institute UAE; and in China, were presented with the “China Top Employer 
2017” certification by the Top Employers Institute. We were also recognized in Mexico as one of  
“The Places Everyone Wants to Work” for the 10th consecutive year by Expansión Magazine, 
and in the U.K. & Ireland, The Estée Lauder Companies was ranked as one of the Sunday Times’  
“30 Best Big Companies to Work For.”

We  continue  to  follow  in  our  founder’s  footsteps  to  empower  women  at  all  levels  of  the 
Company.  We  recently  underscored  this  effort  by  supporting  the  Equal  Pay  Act;  a  pledge 
that  demonstrates  our  deep  and  ongoing  commitment  to  wage  parity.  Additionally,  this  year 
we  launched  our  newest  Employee  Resource  Group,  the  Women’s  Leadership  Network, 
which  supports,  encourages,  and  engages  women  across  the  Company  to  reach  their  full  
potential both personally and professionally. We are an active participant in the 30% Club, an 
organization committed to achieving a minimum of 30 percent of women on public company 
boards, sharing the belief that gender balance on boards encourages better leadership. At the 
start of the current fiscal 2018 year, about 84 percent of our global workforce is female, nearly  
50 percent of U.S.-based senior positions are held by women, and women constitute 40 percent 
of our Board of Directors.

This year, and every year, we strive to be a welcoming and inclusive workplace for all of our 
diverse  talent,  encompassing  a  wide  range  of  identities,  points  of  view,  and  orientations.  In 
December  2016,  The  Estée  Lauder  Companies  achieved  a  perfect  100  percent  score  on  the 
2017 Corporate Equality Index, the most distinguished U.S. benchmarking report on corporate 
policies and practices related to LGBTQ workplace equality, administered by the Human Rights 
Campaign.  In  satisfying  all  the  criteria  in  the  2017  Corporate  Equality  Index,  the  Company  is 
recognized among “Best Places to Work for LGBT Equality.”

6

Sustainability and social investment in the communities in which we live and work remain the 
key focus of our core values, and our employees continue to drive many of our initiatives in these 
areas. In our increasingly connected world, sustainable growth is a collective experience driven 
by shared responsibility. We are steadfast in our belief that in order to grow together, we must 
learn, act, and support our communities together.

The  Estée  Lauder  Companies  Charitable  Foundation  was  established  in  fiscal  2016  with  the 
launch of our multi-year Girls’ Education Initiative. In its second year, fiscal 2017, the Foundation 
granted  funds  to  support  15  nonprofit  organizations  and  reached  more  than  30,000  children 
across five continents via locally-tailored education programs. 

The Breast Cancer Campaign, which will celebrate its 25th anniversary in fiscal 2018, has helped 
fund breast cancer research globally through brand contributions, employee fundraising, outside 
donations, and the sale of our brands’ Pink Ribbon products. In fiscal 2017 alone, the Campaign 
raised $7.3 million, $5.6 million of which was donated to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation 
to  support  individual  research  grants  and  research  hours.  Our  goal  is  a  world  without  breast 
cancer, and we are proud to be making great strides.

M•A•C has long been a leader in raising critical funds globally for HIV/AIDS awareness, treatment, 
and prevention through the M•A•C AIDS Fund, and it raised over $32 million this year through its 
annual VIVA GLAM Campaign. The original idea behind VIVA GLAM was to celebrate life, and 
this mission remains strong to this day; this year on World AIDS Day, more than 3,000 M•A•C 
employees volunteered at HIV /AIDS organizations in 35 countries, a tremendous achievement 
and show of service from the M•A•C team.

Environmentally, we are committed to reducing our own carbon footprint and doing our part 
to help ensure the health and beauty of our planet for future generations. We continue to hold 
ourselves accountable to thoughtfully managing our environmental and social impacts. 

We are proud to be part of the fight against climate change. It is our responsibility as a global 
company,  employer,  and  corporate  citizen.  We  believe  that  working  together  toward  a  low-
carbon future will help ensure a healthier and safer world for all, which is why in 2016, we made an 
important pledge to work towards a net zero carbon goal by the year 2020. In addition, by signing 
on to the We Are Still In campaign and joining RE100, we are underscoring our commitment and 
standing with cities, states, and businesses around the world on this important issue. 

As we look forward to continuing our momentum and executing our long-term strategy, I extend 
my heartfelt thanks to my father, Leonard A. Lauder; our President and Chief Executive Officer, 
Fabrizio Freda; our Board of Directors; our Executive Leadership Team for their vision; to all of our 
employees for so successfully putting that vision in action; and to you, our stockholders for your 
continued support.

William P. Lauder

“We proved that we can pivot our business,  

execute with speed and excellence, and make courageous 

choices that create momentum for the coming years.”

FABRIZIO

FREDA

President and Chief Executive Officer

Dear Fellow Stockholders,

The Estée Lauder Companies achieved another year of strong financial performance in fiscal 2017, 
demonstrating the strength of our winning strategy of multiple engines of growth fueled by our 
diversified portfolio of brands. This is the eighth consecutive year we generated strong organic 
growth and outperformed the industry. We proved that we can pivot our business, execute with 
speed  and  excellence,  and  make  courageous  choices  that  create  momentum  for  the  coming 
years. As The Global House of Prestige Beauty, we aim to exceed our consumers’ expectations, 
and this drive for excellence permeates all that we do. 

In  fiscal  2017,  we  delivered  net  sales  of  $11.82  billion,  net  earnings  of  $1.25  billion  and  diluted 
earnings per share of $3.35. In constant currency, net sales rose 7 percent, which was ahead 
of  global  prestige  beauty  growth,  and  adjusted  constant  currency  diluted  earnings  per  share 
increased 11 percent.* During fiscal 2017, we returned $899 million to our stockholders through 
dividends  and  stock  repurchases;  we  increased  our  common  stock  dividend  13  percent  and 
repurchased 4.7 million shares of our Class A Common Stock.  

We  achieved  these  results  against  a  backdrop  of  geopolitical  and  economic  challenges. 
Declining  foot  traffic  in  some  brick  and  mortar  U.S.  department  stores,  particularly  in  smaller 
malls and certain tourist-driven doors, weakness in international markets such as the Middle East, 
geopolitical tensions and currency volatility are just some of the headwinds that we faced. Once 
again, we demonstrated the resilience and sustainability of our strategy and our ability to execute 
with excellence. Our overall performance helped us gain share and strengthened our leadership 
in global prestige beauty.

9

Throughout fiscal 2017, we remained focused on long-term value creation. We continue to be 
guided by our 10-Year Compass, an important tool that identifies our most promising growth areas 
and the future trends we believe will drive growth in prestige beauty. We drew upon our enduring 
strengths — distinct brand equities, superior product quality, engaging consumer communication 
and High-Touch service — and pivoted towards those areas of prestige beauty where we saw 
the greatest opportunities. This broadened our reach across fast-growing channels, younger and 
more diverse consumer groups, and in new emerging markets. In the process, we demonstrated 
our ability to address changes while positioning our Company for sustainable growth.

GLOBAL PRESTIGE BEAUTY: 

DYNAMIC AND GROWING

Beauty  is  an  industry  that  has  been  growing  steadily  for  many  years,  outpacing  most  other 
household and personal care sectors. Within our industry, we’ve kept our focus solely on prestige 
beauty, which means delivering quality products, consumer education, customization and High-
Touch service. Global prestige beauty has grown approximately 4 to 5 percent a year, and we 
believe our goal of exceeding that pace by at least 1 percent annually continues to be attainable 
under our strategy.

With a desire to always be camera-ready, consumers’ appetites for beauty products is intensifying, 
particularly in the luxury arena. The playing field for high-end cosmetics continues to expand 
as  the  barriers  to  entry  have  come  down,  largely  due  to  digital  commerce  and  social  media. 
Awareness and sampling of new products is made easier as a result of these new platforms, yet 
it is the repeat purchase that is a true sign of success. We recognize the staying power of “hero” 
products – iconic products of the highest-quality that are the backbone of our brands. We are 
confident that with our mix of innovative new products and services, our coveted collection of 
bestsellers, and our digital-first mindset, we are well-positioned to sustain strong and profitable 
growth over the long-term.

MULTIPLE ENGINES OF GROWTH

Our long-term strategy is working well as we are responding to new consumer preferences while 
identifying new opportunities to fuel growth in our brands, categories, geographies and channels 
of distribution. In a world where volatility and change is the new normal, these multiple engines 
of growth are driving our business performance and reinforcing our leadership position.

ENRICHING OUR PORTFOLIO

Our  portfolio  strategy  includes  growing  existing  brands  and  discovering  and  acquiring  high-
potential brands that align with our values and complement our other brands. This past year 
we welcomed two exciting additions to The Estée Lauder Companies’ family of brands, BECCA 
and Too Faced. Key considerations for us in these acquisitions were the brands’ entrepreneurial 
approaches to beauty, creative spirits, and distinct strengths in specialty-multi, social media, and 
with  Millennial  consumers.  We  also  made  a  minority  investment  in  DECIEM,  a  fast-growing 
multi-brand beauty company with a nimble, consumer-centric focus. 

10

Our  mid-sized  luxury  brands  each  experienced  strong  double-digit  growth  this  fiscal  year.  
Tom  Ford’s  innovative  Lips  &  Boys  collection  grew  exponentially  and  helped  the  brand  gain 
share in the prestige lip sub-category, while the brand overall captured the hearts of the Chinese 
consumer by strategically engaging social media influencers and  accelerating its Travel Retail 
distribution.  Jo  Malone  London  had  numerous  successful  product  launches,  including  Star 
Magnolia Hair Mist, a new product form for the brand. La Mer’s introduction of the Soft Fluid 
Long Wear Foundation, infused with its Miracle Broth, exceeded expectations and is helping to 
attract new, younger consumers to the brand.

Among  our  large  brands,  Estée  Lauder  achieved  a  solid  return  to  growth  in  fiscal  2017,  with 
higher sales in skin care and makeup compared to the prior year. The brand was well-positioned 
to  capitalize  on  increased  travel  and  consumption  from  Chinese  consumers,  and  its  makeup 
sales  excelled  internationally.  Estée  Lauder  continued  to  support  two  of  its  hero  franchises, 
Advanced Night Repair and Double Wear, with new products and more effective marketing and 
communications. The investment paid off with these two highly desirable product lines reaching 
new consumers and posting positive growth in every region. Double Wear is now the best-selling 
prestige foundation in many markets, and it attracts consumers across generations to the brand, 
including Millennials. 

Clinique is reaching new consumers and building on its authority in skin care to drive growth. 
The brand accelerated distribution in North America specialty-multi, both in-store and online, 
and with high-growth, brand-building channels and retailers internationally. The global launch 
of Clinique’s Fresh Pressed Daily Booster with Pure Vitamin C 10% was highly successful and 
is having a halo effect, increasing sales of the brand’s core moisturizing business because the 
product is used in tandem with Moisture Surge and Even Better Moisturizer. 

M•A•C remains the number one prestige makeup brand in the world and continues to increase 
consumer  reach  globally  through  targeted  distribution  and  increased  social  media  outreach.  
The brand grew well internationally, but experienced weakness in the U.S., attributed, in part, to 
its overexposure in mid-tier department stores. M•A•C had a successful fourth quarter launch in 
fast-growing Ulta Beauty and on Tmall, a digital platform in China. The brand’s collaborations 
with locally relevant social media influencers in various countries also generated high consumer 
engagement  and  positive  sales  trends.  In  fact,  M•A•C  is  mobilizing  its  global  team  of  20,000 
makeup artists to engage consumers with impactful social media content, using influencer and 
user-generated posts to augment its storytelling. 

POWERFUL GROWTH IN MAKEUP

Staying ahead of the curve is critical to our success. The desire for instant, camera-ready beauty 
is driving growth in makeup, not only with Millennials and Generation Z, but across demographic 
groups around the world. We continued to see strong organic growth in this category through 
the performance of Estée Lauder, Tom Ford, and Smashbox, and we added incremental sales 
from our recently acquired brands, Too Faced and BECCA. M•A•C and Bobbi Brown performed 
well internationally. One of the most anticipated and successful launches in M•A•C’s history was 
the introduction of M•A•C Selena, celebrating the life of the late Latina singer Selena Quintanilla. 
Bobbi Brown’s Art Stick Liquid Lip became the U.K.’s number one color launch in brand history 
and, in Asia, helped drive over 75 percent growth in the brand’s lip business in its launch month. 

11

NEW GROWTH ENGINE IN LUXURY FRAGRANCE

Artisanal  and  luxury  fragrances  have  emerged  as  a  profitable  new  growth  engine  for  the 
Company. We began cultivating this sub-category a number of years ago based on our strategic 
Compass insights. We recognized a growing trend in customization and Millennials’ interest in 
individuality. We set out to create a more personalized fragrance journey for consumers, which 
was a tremendous opportunity for existing brands like Jo Malone London, Tom Ford, and AERIN.  
It also encouraged us to identify and acquire brands that emphasize craftsmanship and the art 
of fragrance, such as Le Labo, Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, and By Kilian. This strategy is 
paying off, as our ultra-prestige fragrance portfolio experienced double-digit growth in fiscal 2017, 
a trend we expect to continue in fiscal 2018.   

REIGNITION OF SKIN CARE

The demand for skin care products is  on the rise, and we anticipate it will continue to grow 
as Millennials age. We are pleased to see an acceleration of sales growth in this category, as 
a result of the resurgence in Chinese demand for Estée Lauder and La Mer products, as well 
as an improved retail strategy for Darphin. We also saw outstanding double-digit growth from 
GLAMGLOW through additional product assortments and targeted expanded consumer reach. 
Several other brands, including Bobbi Brown, Origins, and Aveda, each posted solid gains in the 
category during fiscal 2017. 

MOMENTUM AROUND THE GLOBE

Geographically, we benefited from growth in each region and in some key emerging markets. 
And, we are pleased to report that our sales in more than a quarter of our markets grew by 
double-digits this fiscal year. 

Asia/Pacific (APAC) growth accelerated, up 9 percent in constant currency, driven by a resurgence 
of our business in China as well as solid sales growth in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Indonesia. 
Selfie culture, which is thriving in APAC, has revolutionized the way consumers shop and what 
they are buying, with makeup growing three to four times faster than skin care. We have been 
able to capitalize on this trend with our leading makeup brand portfolio and strategic initiatives 
like the launch of M•A•C on Tmall in the fourth quarter, considered the most successful launch in 
Tmall prestige beauty history. Our luxury fragrances Jo Malone London and Tom Ford drove the 
growth of the fragrance category in the region.

Our business in Europe, the Middle East & Africa (EMEA) performed strongly with sales rising  
10 percent in constant currency over the prior year. Virtually all countries generated sales gains, 
from  both  developed  countries  like  Italy,  to  emerging  markets  like  Russia.  Among  the  many 
successful  programs,  we  expanded  our  consumer  loyalty  initiatives  to  help  move  consumers 
from trial to replenishment, and build brand loyalty among shifting consumer preferences across 
our products, brands, and channels. The region also benefited from accelerations in Travel Retail 
and online. Online net sales in EMEA grew 32 percent versus last year as we focused on e/m-
commerce, digital, and social media efforts to reach and engage our consumers. Our success 
in the region is notable considering headwinds caused by uncertainties surrounding Brexit and 
macroeconomic conditions in the Middle East, as well as challenges from increased competition 
in makeup. Estée Lauder’s Double Wear and Advanced Night Repair franchises and Clinique’s 
Moisture  Surge  achieved  double-digit  growth,  proving  that  our  hero  products  remain  strong 
engines of growth.

Our  sales  in  the  Americas  grew  2  percent  in  constant  currency  this  year,  with  strong  growth 
coming from markets in Latin America, including Argentina, Chile, and Peru. Many of our brands 
generated strong growth in the region; notably, Tom Ford, Smashbox, and Jo Malone London 
all had double-digit gains, and La Mer also performed well. U.S. department stores represented 
approximately 17 percent of our global sales last year, and we are encouraged by new signs of 
strength in some retailers’ top doors. We are working with department stores to improve our 
merchandising,  service,  and  communications  activities,  and  to  boost  their  online  businesses 
which have been healthier. 

BUILDING AWARENESS IN EMERGING MARKETS

We continue to build our presence in emerging markets, bringing our brands and high-quality 
products to new consumers around the world. Net sales in emerging markets rose 11 percent 
in  constant  currency,  with  the  strongest  growth  from  China,  Russia,  and  Mexico,  offsetting 
weaker results from the Middle East and Brazil, markets that have been impacted by economic 
and political factors. The Estée Lauder brand significantly lifted its sales in China by leveraging 
outstanding products with a combination of in-store and social media campaigns, particularly 
around  the  spokesmodel  signing  of  Yang  Mi,  famed  Chinese  actress  and  beauty  icon.  Estée 
Lauder China also achieved the number one position —and the only Genius spot— in the L2 
Digital IQ Index: Beauty China 2017. Mexico’s e-commerce business grew triple digits this year, 
and  creative  initiatives  with  Mexican  social  media  influencers  for  Clinique  and  M•A•C  were 
instrumental in engaging consumers. 

REACHING CONSUMERS  

IN FAST-GROWING CHANNELS

Our  Company  has  built  the  most  desirable  portfolio  of  prestige  brands  in  the  industry,  and 
we  are  known  for  honoring  each  of  our  brand’s  distinctive  qualities  when  evaluating  market 
opportunities.  We  have  always  been  deliberate  about  operating  in  channels  that  are  brand-
builders, and we are actively deploying our brands across the fastest-growing prestige channels 
and consumer segments around the world. 

INCREASED COVERAGE IN SPECIALTY-MULTI

Channels representing nearly one-third of our sales are growing double-digits, including specialty-
multi, online, and Travel Retail. Specialty-multi has been an effective channel for attracting new 
consumers globally, especially Millennials. During fiscal 2017, Jo Malone London created a retail 
format and business model to enter the specialty-multi channel through Sephora, where it has 
been very well received. In Latin America, multiple brands also launched in Sephora, including 
Tom Ford and La Mer, while brands such as Clinique, M•A•C, and Smashbox continue to have 
strong sales in-store and online. M•A•C launched in Ulta Beauty in the fourth quarter, where it 
is being introduced to new consumers. In Asia, as more high-growth, brand-building specialty-
multi retailers emerge, our brands are capturing this opportunity. For example, Clinique was our 
first brand in Eve and Boy in Thailand and in Olive Young in Korea.

ONLINE SUCCESS

Fiscal 2017 was another excellent year for our online business, which delivered accelerated growth 
of 33 percent in constant currency. Over the past five years, our online sales, which include sales 
on our own sites and sales on our authorized retailers’ sites, have more than doubled and now 
account for 11 percent of our total net sales. The U.S. and the U.K. remain our two largest online 
markets, accounting for approximately 70 percent of our global online business. China, our third 
largest  market,  nearly  doubled  online  sales  in  fiscal  2017.  Bright  spots  included  the  successful 
introduction of M•A•C and Lab Series on China’s Tmall, and the surge in sales across our brands 
on  Tmall  on  Singles  Day,  where  we  were  the  beauty  category  winner.  We  also  made  good 
progress online in other emerging markets. We recently launched in India and plan to roll out in 
the Middle East and Southeast Asia in fiscal 2018. 

16

Our  efforts  in  support  of  retailer.com  sites  also  proved  fruitful  as  we  helped  our  authorized 
retailers  win  with  our  brands  online.  In  fact,  many  of  our  brands,  particularly  Estée  Lauder, 
Clinique, and M•A•C, had an outstanding year on Macys.com. Mobile commerce continues to 
drive our results, as it provides consumers with an always-connected and always-on channel.   
Currently, two-thirds of our online traffic and nearly half of our online sales come from mobile 
devices. We expect this trend to accelerate and therefore, we are expanding our mobile team 
and  increasing  investments  in  mobile  innovation  in  order  to  provide  our  unique  High-Touch 
services  and  experiences  to  consumers.  As  our  Online  team  likes  to  say,  access  to  a  beauty 
expert is as easy as reaching for your phone.  

We have also been strategically focused on designing a seamless omnichannel experience across 
our in-store and online direct-to-consumer channels, making it easier for consumers to buy what 
they want, when and where they want it. Omnichannel initiatives to help enhance this cross-
channel consumer journey have included services like click and collect, buy online/return in-
store, and order online from in-store. We also developed new loyalty programs for a number of 
our brands in the U.S., Canada, Korea, and the U.K. Additionally, we advanced the concept of 
delivering High-Touch service online. For example, we launched the ability to text gift cards in 
real time and have developed chat bots to drive online appointments and innovative gifting with 
our pop-up store in the U.K. 

GROWTH IN TRAVEL RETAIL

International  passenger  traffic  growth  was  solid  in  fiscal  2017,  helping  to  accelerate  the  Travel 
Retail channel, where our sales grew 22 percent in constant currency. We are expanding more of 
our portfolio into additional airports and are finding success with digital acceleration that enables 
pre-order sales, as well as with new store formats such as our Lip Studio in Shanghai Pudong 
Airport.  Our  expanded  offerings  in  luxury  fragrance  performed  very  well  this  year,  including 
products from Le Labo as well as Jo Malone London, particularly its Blossom Belle collection that 
launched exclusively in Travel Retail. Tom Ford achieved record growth in Travel Retail, winning 
with traveling Chinese consumers in both makeup and fragrance. Looking forward, we expect 
higher  passenger  traffic,  coupled  with  effective  marketing,  to  increase  conversion,  leading  to 
strong sales growth again in fiscal 2018.  

THE BEST IN CONSUMER ENGAGEMENT

Our Company was founded by Mrs. Estée Lauder, an incredible woman who was known for 
making  instant  connections  with  consumers  through  her  commitment  to  provide  individual 
attention, whether personally applying a cream or a lipstick to demonstrate its benefits, offering 
a quick lesson in skin care or demonstrating a three-minute beauty regimen. High-Touch service 
is in our DNA, and we have evolved this concept through the years, giving us a competitive 
advantage  in  addressing  today’s  consumer  wants  and  needs.  High-Touch  in  the  digital  age 
includes leveraging technology and social media at all touch points in the consumer journey. 

Our brands are using new social media strategies and memorable 360˚ marketing campaigns 
to drive awareness, trial, purchase, and loyalty, and they are using digital tools to provide real-
time analytics and feedback to understand what is resonating. Partnerships with social media 

17

influencers  are  integral  to  our  digital  marketing  efforts  across  brands  –  these  efforts  have  led 
to increased share in earned media value (EMV). In fact, we ended fiscal 2017 as the number 
one prestige beauty company in the U.S. in EMV according to Tribe Dynamics. Online how-to 
content continues to be an effective engagement technique for brands like Bobbi Brown, the 
top beauty brand on Facebook Live, where the brand hosts weekly demonstrations, reaching 
as many as 400,000 fans. Aveda has leveraged the professional authority of Aveda Artists and 
social-savvy  influencers  to  create  on-trend,  shareable  tutorial  content,  positioning  the  brand 
as  a  trusted  source  for  “do-it-yourself”  Millennial  consumers.  Jo  Malone  London  introduced  
“The  Talk  of  the  Townhouse,”  a  magazine  and  digital  editorial  platform  offering  consumers 
original  content  designed  to  build  brand  equity,  drive  sales  and  elevate  the  brand’s  unique 
boutique positioning, boosting its brand storytelling and voice along the lines of “Estée Stories” 
and Clinique’s “The Wink.”

STRENGTHENING OUR CAPABILITIES

In fiscal 2016, we announced the launch of Leading Beauty Forward, a multi-year initiative to 
build on our strengths and better leverage our cost structure to free resources for investment to 
continue sustaining our strong growth momentum. This initiative is designed to fuel our long-
term,  profitable  growth,  enhance  our  go-to-market  capabilities,  and  reinforce  our  leadership 
position in global prestige beauty. 

Leading Beauty Forward is on track to help us increase our effectiveness by infusing additional 
speed and agility into our business, so that we can more quickly respond to our changing industry. 
We’ve begun establishing more efficient structures in certain areas of the Company, including 
some of our regional organizations and corporate functions, and redesigned our procurement 
organization  to  generate  further  savings  opportunities.  These  efforts  have  already  enabled  us 
to begin accelerating the changes we need to support stronger digital consumer engagement, 
enable greater cost leverage, and more aggressively reallocate resources into stronger growth 
drivers.  

Leading Beauty Forward is strengthening our capabilities in critical growth areas while designing 
a lower cost organization for greater net sales leverage. Combined with our more disciplined cost 
management efforts, we are helping to drive strong topline growth by providing more resources 
to fuel our business.

CORE STRENGTHS

While our industry has been evolving, there are still certain fundamentals that hold true. We have 
responded to changing consumer preferences and will continue to leverage our core strengths. 
These  include:  high-quality  products  and  authentic  brands  that  engender  loyalty  and  repeat 
purchase; the nurturing of hero products and franchises; and High-Touch service and experiences 
in distribution channels committed to brand-building and to excellent consumer engagement.

In an arena marked by incredible variety, where consumers are constantly flooded with options, 
creativity is still a differentiator that sets great brands apart. To be noticed, we must be daring 
with our products, business models, and in our communications. Creativity also means making 
the most of new analytics that technology provides, connecting the market data and consumer 
insights in ways that are unique and illuminating.

18

There  are  a  number  of  ways  we  are  committed  to  cultivating  creativity.  Diversity  of  gender, 
ethnicity, nationality and experience bring together different perspectives. Fostering an inclusive 
and diverse workforce is paramount to generating fresh ideas. We are inspired by the various 
generations represented among our employees. Our reverse mentoring program is a rich source 
of innovation, and our Millennial Advisory Board is helping us discover and implement new ways 
to reach consumers.

We  also  benefit  tremendously  from  the  entrepreneurial  spirit  of  new,  innovative  companies. 
When we have the privilege to acquire a new brand, our goal is to help it be the best and to learn 
from it in the process.  Our model isn’t focused on assimilation. Rather, it’s a model of listening 
and providing a way for our talent to create and succeed.

19

PIVOTING TO TOMORROW

As The Global House of Prestige Beauty  with  a  70-year  heritage  of  entrepreneurial  success, 
we have a solid foundation to build upon for the future. The art of leading through change is 
understanding what has not changed—and how to leverage our historical strengths in new and 
exciting ways.

We are winning in brand-building, high-growth channels, including online, specialty-multi, and 
Travel Retail. We have a coveted and diverse portfolio of prestige brands that we are leveraging 
across regions and channels. Our resources are being deployed in growing geographies as we 
focus on the biggest opportunities to reach new consumers. We are communicating directly with 
consumers in new ways, and applying our digital-first mindset through social media, influencers, 
and via new digital/online technologies. We continue to streamline our operations to increase 
efficiency and agility, positioning us for greater profitability.

We expect the great momentum we built throughout the past year to continue in fiscal 2018. 
Our full-year outlook in constant currency reflects net sales growth of 7 to 8 percent, including 
incremental sales from our fiscal 2017 acquisitions, and double-digit adjusted earnings per share 
growth. Looking out over the next three years, we continue to target constant currency net sales 
growth of 6 to 8 percent and double-digit adjusted EPS growth.

OUR WORLD-CLASS TEAM

Our  talented  and  dedicated  employees  drive  our  Company’s  achievements  by  bringing  their 
passion  for  beauty,  innovation,  and  success  to  every  aspect  of  our  business.  Our  Executive 
Leadership  Team  brings  an  extraordinary  mix  of  industry  experience,  entrepreneurial  spirit, 
and commitment to win in this dynamic and highly competitive environment. We announced 
a number of strategic leadership appointments this past year including the internal promotion 
of  talented  employees  into  senior  roles,  as  well  as  the  recruitment  of  future  leaders  into  the 
Company. We are particularly proud that women represent the majority of our global workforce 
and senior leadership positions. As we continue to build our world-class team, our focus remains 
on inclusion and diversity, and education and leadership development at all levels. Our results in 
fiscal 2017 would not be possible without the brilliant execution by our people around the globe, 
and we thank them for their hard work and commitment.

We are also grateful to the members of our Board of Directors for their wise counsel and their 
guidance and support of our strategic focus on long-term value creation. On behalf of our entire 
senior leadership team, I thank the Board for the invaluable advice and oversight as we position 
the Company for continued success.

As  a  family-controlled  company,  we  derive  tremendous  benefits  from  the  Lauder  family’s 
dedication  to  preserving  the  legacy  of  our  Company  while  inspiring  us  to  innovate.  It  is  
my  privilege  to  partner  with  William  P.  Lauder,  whose  leadership,  commitment  to  ensuring 
long-term sustainability, and dedication to cultivating the leaders of the future are integral to our 
Company’s performance. 

And importantly, I thank you, our valued stockholders, for your continued support and confidence 
as we look ahead to great achievements in fiscal 2018 and beyond.

Fabrizio Freda 
President and Chief Executive Officer

*This letter contains references to the following non-GAAP financial measures: constant currency and adjusted diluted earnings per share.  
We use such measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we 
conduct and view our business. Management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period, or reflect 
the Company’s underlying ongoing business, provides transparency for such items and helps investors and others compare and analyze our 
operating performance from period to period. In the future, we expect to incur charges or adjustments similar in nature to those presented 
below; however, the impact to the Company’s results in a given period may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Our non-GAAP financial 
measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by, or determined in a manner consistent with, other companies. While we 
consider the non-GAAP measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation 
included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP.

During fiscal 2017, the Company recorded restructuring and other charges of $212 million ($143 million after tax) equal to $.38 per diluted 
common share; goodwill and other intangible asset impairments of $31 million ($23 million after tax) equal to $.06 per diluted common share; 
a gain related to changes in fair value of contingent consideration of $57 million ($44 million after tax) or $.12 per diluted common share; and 
a China deferred tax asset valuation allowance reversal of $75 million, or $.20 per diluted common share. During fiscal 2016, the Company 
recorded restructuring and other charges of $134 million ($90 million after tax) equal to $.24 per diluted common share; and a charge related 
to changes in fair value of contingent consideration of $8 million ($8 million after tax) or $.02 per diluted common share. Excluding the effect 
of the items referenced above, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ended June 30, 2017 increased 8%. As reported (including these 
items), for the year ended June 30, 2017, net sales increased 5% and diluted earnings per share increased 13%. Information about GAAP and 
non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliation information, is included in the Financial Section beginning on page 31of this Annual 
Report and in the Company’s Form 8-K submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 18, 2017.

(a) Fiscal 2017 results included $143 million, after tax, or $.38 per diluted common share related to total charges associated with restructuring and other activities. Fiscal 2016 results 
included $90 million, after tax, or $.24 per diluted common share related to total charges associated with restructuring and other activities. Fiscal 2014 results included $(2) million, 
after tax, related to total adjustments associated with restructuring and other activities. Fiscal 2013 results included $12 million, after tax, or $.03 per diluted common share related 
to total charges associated with restructuring and other activities.

(b) As a result of our July 2014 Strategic Modernization Initiative rollout, approximately $178 million of accelerated orders were recorded as net sales and approximately $127 million 
as operating income in fiscal 2014 that would have occurred in the fiscal 2015 first quarter, equal to approximately $.21 per diluted common share.

(c) During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a $5 million charge, on a before and after tax basis, related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela, equal 
to $.01 per diluted common share. During the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded a $38 million charge, on a before and after tax basis, related to the remeasurement of net 
monetary assets in Venezuela, equal to $.10 per diluted common share.

(d) In February 2017, we issued 1.80%, 3.15% and 4.15% Senior Notes in a public offering, each with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. These Senior Notes are due 
in February 2020, March 2027 and March 2047, respectively. We used the net proceeds of the offerings to redeem the Senior Notes due May 15, 2017 and for general corporate 
purposes. In May 2016, we issued $450 million of 1.70% Senior Notes due May 10, 2021 and an additional $150 million of our 4.375% Senior Notes due June 15, 2045 in a public 
offering. In June 2015, we issued $300 million of 4.375% Senior Notes due June 15, 2045 in a public offering. In September 2012, we redeemed the $230 million principal amount 
of our 7.75% Senior Notes due November 1, 2013 (“2013 Senior Notes”) at a price of 108% of the principal amount. We recorded a pre-tax expense on the extinguishment of debt 
of $19 million ($12 million after tax, or $.03 per diluted share) representing the call premium of $19 million and the pro-rata write-off of less than $1 million of issuance costs and 
debt discount. In August 2012, we issued $250 million of 2.35% Senior Notes due August 15, 2022 and $250 million of 3.70% Senior Notes due August 15, 2042 in a public offering.  
We used the net proceeds of the offering to redeem the 2013 Senior Notes and for general corporate purposes.

(e) Fiscal 2017 results included $23 million, after tax, or $.06 per diluted common share related to goodwill and other intangible asset impairments.

(f) Fiscal 2017 included a $44 million gain, after tax, or $.12 per diluted common share and fiscal 2016 and 2015 included $8 million and $6 million of expense, after tax, respectively, 
or $.02 per diluted common share, associated with the changes in fair value of contingent consideration related to certain of our acquisitions.

(g) Fiscal 2017 results include $75 million, or $.20 per diluted common share, related to the reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance. The deferred tax asset and associated 
valuation allowance related to the accumulated carryforward of excess advertising and promotional expenses. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, a favorable change to the tax law 
in China was enacted that expanded the corporate income tax deduction allowance for advertising and promotional expenses, resulting in this change in realizability of the asset.

In  order  to  meet  the  demands  of  consumers,  we  continually 
introduce new products, support new and established products 
through advertising, merchandising and sampling and phase out 
existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers 
or  our  objectives.  The  economics  of  developing,  producing, 
launching, supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales 
and operating performance each period. The introduction of new 
products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing 
products, which we take into account in our business planning.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

We  use  certain  non-GAAP  financial  measures,  among  other 
financial  measures,  to  evaluate  our  operating  performance, 
which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our 
business. Management believes that excluding certain items that 
are not comparable from period to period helps investors and 
others compare operating performance between periods. While 
we consider the non-GAAP measures useful in analyzing our 
results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, 
any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements 
prepared  in  conformity  with  U.S.  GAAP.  See Reconciliations 
of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  beginning  on  page  49  for 
reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the 
most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.

generated outside the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations 
in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  can  affect  our  results  of 
operations. Therefore, we present certain net sales, operating 
results and diluted net earnings per common share information 
excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide 
a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying 
business outside the United States. Constant currency information 
compares  results  between  periods  as  if  exchange  rates  had 
remained constant period-over-period. We calculate constant 
currency information by translating current year results using prior 
year weighted-average foreign currency exchange rates.

OVERVIEW

We  believe  the  best  way  to  increase  stockholder  value  is  to 
continue to provide superior products and services in the most 
efficient  and  effective  manner  while  recognizing  consumers’ 
changing behaviors and shopping preferences. We are guided 
by our long-term strategy, which has numerous initiatives across 
geographic  regions,  product  categories,  brands,  channels  of 
distribution and functions that are designed to grow our sales, 
provide cost efficiencies, leverage our strengths and make us more 
productive and profitable. We plan to build upon and leverage 
our history of outstanding creativity and innovation, high quality 
products  and  services,  and  engaging  communications  while 
investing for long-term sustainable growth.

Our  balanced,  diverse  and  highly  desirable  brand  portfolio 
positions us well to capitalize on opportunities in fast growing 
and profitable areas of prestige beauty. We believe that our range 
of prestige product offerings allows us to increase our share of a 
consumer’s beauty routine and source consumers from brands 
sold in mass-market distribution.

•  Our skin care product category benefits from hero product 
lines  such  as  Advanced  Night  Repair  from  Estée  Lauder 
and  Crème  de  La  Mer  from  La  Mer.  During  fiscal  2017, 
we  continued  to  expand  these  product  lines  through  the 
introduction of the Advanced Night Repair Eye Concentrate 
Matrix from Estée Lauder and the Revitalizing Hydrating Serum 
from La Mer. GLAMGLOW also contributed to the success 
in the category through targeted expanded consumer reach 
and new launches such as Plumprageous. In the fourth quarter  
of fiscal 2017, we purchased a minority interest in DECIEM,  
a  skin  care  brand,  which  provides  us  with  a  strategic 
investment in a company that attracts millennials and a diverse 
consumer base.

• 

In our makeup category, we further developed hero product 
lines such as Double Wear and Pure Color Envy from Estée 
Lauder through the launch of additional products including 
Double  Wear  Nude  Cushion  Stick  Radiant  Makeup  and 
Pure  Color  Envy  Hi-Lustre  Light  Sculpting  Lipstick.  We 
continuously look to acquire brands that complement our 
existing business, have significant sales growth potential and 
provide opportunities for future profitable growth. During our 
fiscal 2017 second quarter, we expanded our makeup portfolio 
with the acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA. Both of these 
brands are primarily distributed in the faster growing specialty-
multi and online channels. They are expected to help us reach 
new consumers, to increase our sales in these channels and to 
continue generating strong profitable growth.

•  Our fragrance category continues to benefit from increased 
sales of Jo Malone London and Tom Ford fragrances, as well 
as from our fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016 acquisitions. We have 
also benefited from the growth of the fragrance category in 
the Asia/Pacific region and look for further opportunities to 
strengthen our business in this category there.

• 

In our hair care category, we are reaching new consumers as 
we expand our presence beyond salons, such as the planned 
September 2017 launch of Bumble and bumble in Ulta Beauty, 
a leading specialty-multi retailer in the United States.

Our  global  footprint  provides  many  avenues  of  growth.  We 
leverage our regional organizations and the talents and expertise 
of our people to continue to be locally relevant through evolving 
the way we connect with our consumers in stores, online and 
where  they  travel.  This  includes  the  expansion  of  our  digital 
and social media presence and the engagement of global and 
local influencers to amplify brand or product stories. We tailor 

our strategy by country with our products, services, channels, 
marketing and visual merchandising. We continuously strengthen 
our presence in large, image-building core markets, such as the 
United States and the United Kingdom, and broaden our presence 
in emerging markets, including the Middle East, Russia, South 
Africa and Brazil.

• 

• 

• 

In  North  America,  we  continue  to  deploy  a  number  of 
strategies  to  accelerate  growth,  despite  a  challenging 
environment especially in brick and mortar department stores, 
and  in  Latin  America  we  continue  to  launch  new  brands, 
expand  the  integration  of  social  media  and  gain  share  in 
prestige beauty by encouraging consumers to trade up from 
mass-market products.

In Europe, the Middle East & Africa, we are expanding our 
digital and social media presence as well as leveraging our 
makeup strength to gain share in prestige beauty.

In Asia/Pacific, particularly in China, we are leveraging our 
diversified brand portfolio to benefit from the growth of the 
makeup and fragrance categories as well as continuing to 
launch new skin care products such as the Clinique Fresh 
Pressed line of products with Vitamin C.

We  approach  distribution  strategically  by  brand,  distribution 
channel and product category. We are adding brands to faster 
growing channels, such as e- and m-commerce and specialty 
multi-brand retailers, and we are expanding certain brands into 
geographic markets where they are not yet sold.

• 

• 

In fiscal 2017, we increased our penetration in the specialty-multi 
channel through the acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced,  
and we expanded the representation of our existing brands, 
such as the launch of M•A•C in Ulta Beauty. In addition, we 
have opportunities to accelerate our growth within specialty-
multi brand retailers as they open new doors.

Internationally, we are expanding our business in freestanding 
retail stores operated by us and by authorized third parties, 
in European perfumeries and pharmacies, and in department 
stores, particularly in the United Kingdom and certain markets 
in Asia.

•  We  seek  to  optimize  distribution  in  both  channels  and 
geographies,  matching  each  brand  with  appropriate 
opportunities while maintaining high productivity per door.  
We  focus  on  brand-building  retail  opportunities  that  will 
expand  consumer  coverage  for  our  brands.  As  part  of 
this  strategy,  we  continue  to  diversify  our  business  in  our 
travel retail channel across brands and product categories.  
Travel retail continues to be an important channel for brand 
building  and  profit  margin  expansion.  At  the  same  time  it 
is  susceptible  to  a  number  of  external  factors,  including 
fluctuations  in  currency  exchange  rates  and  consumers’ 
willingness and ability to travel and spend.

•  Online net sales continue to grow strongly on a global basis 
and we are continuing to launch e- and m-commerce sites 
in new and existing markets. We are also partnering with our 
retailers globally to drive sales of our products on their online 
sites. We believe our success in delivering particularly strong 
online growth is a result of customization of our strategy to 
meet local market needs. We also continue to develop and 
implement omnichannel concepts to deliver an integrated 
consumer experience and better serve consumers as they 
shop across channels. 

While our business is performing well overall, we continue to face 
strong competition globally and economic challenges in certain 
countries. In particular, we are cautious of the continued decline in 
retail traffic primarily related to brick-and-mortar department stores 
in the United States as a result of the impact of shifts in consumer 
preferences as to where and how they shop. We are also cautious 
of foreign currency movements, including their impact on tourism, 
which has particularly impacted certain tourist-driven stores in the 
United States. Additionally, we continue to monitor the effects of 
the macroeconomic environments in certain countries such as 
Brazil and in the Middle East, the United Kingdom’s anticipated 
exit from the European Union, geopolitical tensions and global 
security issues. 

We believe we can, to some extent, offset the impact of these 
challenges by accelerating areas of strength among our brands, 
product categories, channels and markets. However, if economic 
conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen, or the 
adverse conditions previously described are further prolonged, 
there could be a negative effect on consumer confidence, demand 
and spending and, as a result, on our business. We will continue to 
monitor these and other risks that may affect our business. 

We navigate through short-term volatility while focusing on our 
long-term  strategy  and  using  our  multiple  engines  of  growth 
that we believe will help promote sustainable results. We are 
increasing our presence in emerging markets, continuing efforts 
to revitalize and accelerate growth in our heritage brands, focusing 
on key demographics and seeking opportunities to add to our 
diverse brand portfolio. We are also strengthening our consumer 
engagement by leveraging digital marketing and enhancing our 
social media strategies and execution. We will continue to drive 
product, packaging, and conceptual innovation and creativity that 
we believe enable us to introduce products that resonate with 
consumers. Some initiatives will involve new sub-categories and 
others may expand key franchises. 

Leading Beauty Forward

In  May  2016,  we  announced  a  multi-year  initiative  (“Leading 
Beauty Forward”) to build on our strengths and better leverage 
our cost structure to free resources for investment to continue 
our growth momentum. Leading Beauty Forward is designed to 
enhance our go-to-market capabilities, reinforce our leadership in 
global prestige beauty and continue creating sustainable value. We 
plan to approve specific initiatives under Leading Beauty Forward 
through fiscal 2019 related to the optimization of select corporate 
functions,  supply  chain  activities,  and  corporate  and  regional 
market support structures, as well as the exit of underperforming 
businesses,  and  expect  to  complete  those  initiatives  through 
fiscal 2021. Inclusive of charges recorded from inception through  
June 30, 2017, we expect that Leading Beauty Forward will result 
in  related  restructuring  and  other  charges  totaling  between  
$600  million  and  $700  million,  before  taxes,  consisting  of 
employee-related  costs,  asset  write-offs  and  other  costs  to 
implement these initiatives. After its full implementation, we expect 
Leading Beauty Forward to yield annual net benefits, primarily in 
Selling, general and administrative expenses, of between $200 
million and $300 million, before taxes. We expect to reinvest a 
portion of these savings in future growth initiatives. For additional 
information about Leading Beauty Forward, see Note 8 – Charges 
Associated with Restructuring and Other Activities of Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Global Technology Infrastructure

In October 2015, we approved plans to transform and modernize 
our  global  technology  infrastructure  (“GTI”)  to  fundamentally 
change  the  way  we  deliver  information  technology  services 
internally (such initiative, the “GTI Restructuring”). As part of the 
GTI Restructuring, we transitioned our GTI from Company-owned 
assets to a primarily vendor-owned, cloud-based model where 
we pay for services as they are used. The implementation of the 
GTI Restructuring was substantially completed during fiscal 2016. 
For additional information about the GTI restructuring, see Note 8 
– Charges Associated with Restructuring and Other Activities of 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Strategic Modernization Initiative Implementation

We rolled out the last major wave of our Strategic Modernization 
Initiative (“SMI”) in July 2014, and most of our locations are now 
SAP-enabled. We plan to continue the implementation of SAP 
at our remaining locations throughout the next few fiscal years. 
In connection with the July 2014 implementation, some retailers 
accelerated their sales orders that would have occurred in our 
fiscal 2015 first quarter into our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter in advance 
of this implementation to provide adequate safety stock to mitigate 
any potential short-term business interruption associated with the 
SMI rollout. The negative impact on the net sales and operating 
results for the year ended June 30, 2015 by product category and 
geographic region was as follows:

The lower orders during the year ended June 30, 2015 created 
a  favorable  comparison  between  fiscal  2016  and  fiscal  2015 
of  approximately  $178  million  in  net  sales  and  approximately  
$127  million  in  operating  results  and  impacted  our  operating 
margin comparisons. We believe that the presentation of certain 
year-to-date comparative information in the following discussions 
that excludes the impact of the timing of these orders is useful 
in analyzing the net sales performance and operating results of 
our business.

Fiscal 2017 Annual Impairment Testing

We assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets 
at  least  annually  for  impairment  or  more  frequently  if  certain 
events  or  circumstances  exist.  Based  on  our  annual  goodwill 
and other intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2017, 
we  determined  that  the  carrying  values  of  the  RODIN  olio 
lusso  and  Editions  de  Parfums  Frédéric  Malle  reporting  units 

exceeded their fair values. This determination was made based 
on  updated  long-term  plans,  finalized  and  approved  in  June 
2017, that reflected lower sales growth projections due to a softer 
than expected retail environment for those brands. As a result, a 
Step 2 impairment assessment was performed and we recorded 
an impairment charge of the goodwill related to these reporting 
units of $28 million. The fair values of the reporting units were 
based upon the average of the income approach, which utilizes 
estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of 
return that reflects the relative risk of cash flows, and the market 
approach, which utilizes performance multiples based on market 
peers. As of June 30, 2017, no goodwill remained related to the 
RODIN olio lusso reporting unit and the remaining carrying value 
of the goodwill related to the Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle 
reporting unit was $6 million.

We also determined that the carrying values of the RODIN olio 
lusso and Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle trademarks, as well as 
the RODIN olio lusso persona and customer relationship intangible 
assets exceeded their estimated fair values. The fair values of the 
trademarks were determined utilizing a royalty rate to determine 
discounted projected future cash flows. As a result, we recognized 
impairment charges of $3 million for the remaining carrying values 
of the RODIN olio lusso trademark, customer relationship and 
persona intangible assets. We also recognized an impairment 
charge for the Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle trademark, which 
was de minimis. The remaining carrying value of this trademark 
was $32 million as of June 30, 2017.

The combined goodwill and other intangible asset impairment 
charges of $9 million and $22 million are reflected in the skin care 
and fragrance product categories, respectively, and $17 million and 
$14 million are reflected in the Americas and Europe, the Middle 
East & Africa regions, respectively.

If the softness in the retail environment impacting our growth 
projections for the Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle reporting 
unit is more severe than we have anticipated, or other business 
disruptions arise, a resulting change in the long-term plans could 
have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of the related 
goodwill and trademark and it is possible we could recognize an 
impairment charge in the future. Based on the latest quantitative 
assessment, the fair values of all other reporting units with material 
goodwill  and  other  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets,  with  the 
exception of our fiscal 2017 acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA, 
were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values. 
With regard to Too Faced and BECCA, the carrying values of the 
related goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of 
the assessment date approximated their fair values.

for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly

impacted the comparison of fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2015.

Reported net sales in fiscal 2017 increased in each major product 
category, except hair care, and grew in each geographic region. 
Skin  care  net  sales  primarily  benefited  from  higher  sales  of  
La  Mer  products.  Incremental  net  sales  from  our  fiscal  2017 
second quarter acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA, as well as 
net sales increases from Tom Ford, Estée Lauder and Smashbox, 
drove growth in the makeup product category. Our fragrance 
category  primarily  benefited  from  net  sales  increases  from  
Jo Malone London. Increased net sales from our fiscal 2016 and 
2015 acquisitions of GLAMGLOW, By Kilian, Le Labo and Editions 
de Parfums Frédéric Malle, also contributed to growth in our skin 
care and fragrance categories. The net sales decrease in our hair 
care category primarily reflected a difficult comparison with the 
prior-year period that featured greater launch activity. Each of our 
product categories benefited from targeted expanded consumer 
reach, new product offerings and growth from emerging markets 
and in the specialty-multi and online channels.

Reported net sales in fiscal 2016 grew in each product category, 
with the exception of skin care, and in each geographic region, 
with the exception of Asia/Pacific. The overall decline in the skin 
care category was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of 
foreign currency translation and the relatively slow growth in global 
prestige skin care that particularly impacted net sales in North 
America, Asia/Pacific and travel retail. However, this category 
benefited from increased sales of certain products, particularly 
from La Mer and Origins. Net sales increases in product offerings 
by  M•A•C,  Smashbox,  Tom  Ford,  Clinique,  Bobbi  Brown  and 
Estée Lauder globally drove the growth in the makeup category. 
Our fragrance category benefited from net sales increases from 
our luxury brands. Incremental sales from our acquisitions during 
fiscal 2016 and 2015 also helped drive our skin care and fragrance 
sales. The net sales increase in our hair care category was driven 
by product offerings from Aveda and Bumble and bumble, as well 
as expanded consumer coverage. Each of our product categories 
benefited from targeted expanded consumer reach, comparable 

door sales growth from certain brands, new product offerings and 
growth from emerging markets.

The  reported  net  sales  increases  were  adversely  affected  by 
approximately $187 million and $488 million of unfavorable foreign 
currency translation for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.

Returns  associated  with  restructuring  and  other  activities  are 
not allocated to our product categories or geographic regions 
because they result from activities that are deemed a Company-
wide initiative to redesign, resize and reorganize select corporate 
functions and go-to-market structures. Accordingly, the following 
discussions of Net Sales by Product Categories and Geographic 
Regions  exclude  the  fiscal  2017  and  2016  impact  of  returns 
associated with restructuring and other activities of approximately 
$2 million and $1 million, respectively.

for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly

impacted the comparison of fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2015.

Reported skin care net sales increased in fiscal 2017, reflecting 
higher  net  sales  from  La  Mer,  GLAMGLOW,  Estée  Lauder,  
Bobbi Brown and Origins of approximately $157 million, combined, 
partially offset by lower net sales from Clinique and M•A•C of 
approximately  $93  million,  combined.  Higher  net  sales  from  
La Mer were primarily due to targeted expanded consumer reach 
in the Americas region and in our travel retail business, and the 
increase in net sales from GLAMGLOW reflected incremental 
sales from additional product assortments and targeted expanded 
consumer reach. Higher net sales from Estée Lauder were partially 
due to net sales growth in our travel retail business and in China 
resulting from higher net sales of the Advanced Night Repair and 
Revitalizing Supreme lines of products. Net sales growth from 
Bobbi  Brown  was  driven  by  new  launches  including  Instant 
Confidence Stick and Extra Repair Nourishing Milk. The higher net 
sales from Origins reflected net sales growth in the Asia/Pacific 
region and in our travel retail business resulting from higher net 
sales of toners and facial masks.

39

The lower net sales of Clinique products primarily reflected a soft 
retail environment for our products, particularly in our travel retail 
business, Asia/Pacific and, to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom 
and  brick-and-mortar  department  stores  in  the  United  States.  
The lower net sales from M•A•C were driven by slower retail traffic 
in brick-and-mortar stores in the United States reflecting the impact 
of shifts in consumer preferences as to where and how they shop. 

The net sales increase for skin care was adversely affected 
by approximately $60 million of unfavorable foreign currency 
translation.

Reported skin care net sales decreased in fiscal 2016, reflecting 
approximately  $163  million  of  unfavorable  foreign  currency 
translation, partially offset by the favorable comparison due to the 
fiscal 2015 accelerated orders of approximately $91 million. The 
reported net sales decrease reflected lower net sales from Estée 
Lauder and Clinique of approximately $138 million, combined. 
The decrease in net sales of Estée Lauder and Clinique products 
was due, in part, to lower sales in certain countries within Asia/
Pacific, particularly Hong Kong reflecting continued retail softness. 
The lower net sales from Clinique also reflected decreased sales 
in travel retail. These decreases were partially offset by higher net 
sales of La Mer and Origins products, as well as incremental sales 
from our fiscal 2015 acquisitions of GLAMGLOW and RODIN 
olio lusso, of approximately $108 million, combined. Net sales 
of La Mer products grew in all regions, driven by the continued 
momentum  of  the  fiscal  2016  launches  of  The  Renewal  Oil,  
The Lifting Eye Serum and Genaissance de La Mer The Serum 
Essence and an increase in distribution in specialty-multi brand 
retailers  and  department  stores.  Net  sales  growth  of  Origins 
products benefited from higher sales of facial mask products.

impacted the comparison of fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2015.

Reported  makeup  net  sales  increased  in  fiscal  2017,  reflecting 
incremental  net  sales  from  our  fiscal  2017  second  quarter 
acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA, as well as higher net sales 
from Tom Ford and Estée Lauder, of approximately $391 million, 

combined. Increased net sales from Tom Ford were driven by 
higher  sales  of  lipstick  and  eyeshadow  products,  such  as  the  
Tom Ford Soleil Color Collection. Increased net sales of Estée 
Lauder products were due, in part, to higher sales from the Double 
Wear line of products and the Pure Color franchise.

Partially offsetting these increases were approximately $84 million 
of  lower  net  sales  of  M•A•C  and  Clinique  products,  primarily 
reflecting slower retail traffic in brick-and-mortar stores in the 
United States. Partially offsetting these lower net sales from M•A•C 
was the net sales growth of the brand in Asia/Pacific and in our 
travel retail business.

The net sales increase for makeup was adversely affected by 
approximately  $76  million  of  unfavorable  foreign  currency 
translation.

Reported  makeup  net  sales  increased  in  fiscal  2016  despite 
approximately  $233  million  of  unfavorable  foreign  currency 
translation.  The  increase  was  also  impacted  by  the  favorable 
comparison  due  to  the  fiscal  2015  accelerated  orders  of 
approximately  $65  million.  The  reported  net  sales  increase 
primarily reflected higher net sales from our makeup artist brands, 
Clinique, Smashbox, Tom Ford and Estée Lauder of approximately 
$397  million,  combined.  Sales  from  our  makeup  artist  brands 
benefited from new product offerings, as well as the continued 
broadening of the brands’ presence in a number of channels, 
including our freestanding retail stores and travel retail. The higher 
net  sales  from  Clinique  reflected  incremental  sales  from  new 
launches such as Clinique Beyond Perfecting makeup products. 
Sales from Smashbox were primarily driven by specialty multi-
brand  retailers,  reflecting  the  overall  strength  of  the  makeup 
category in that channel. The increase in Tom Ford net sales was 
driven by higher sales of lip color products. Net sales of Estée 
Lauder products improved partially due to higher sales from the 
Double Wear line of products and the Pure Color Envy franchise.

Reported fragrance net sales increased in fiscal 2017, primarily 
reflecting higher net sales from our luxury brands of approximately 
$172  million  combined.  The  higher  net  sales  from  Jo  Malone 
London were, in part, due to targeted expanded consumer reach in 
the travel retail, department store and freestanding store channels, 
as well as the launch of Basil & Neroli. Increased net sales from 
Tom Ford reflected, in part, the continued success and growth 
of existing fragrances such as the Signature and Private Blend 
Franchises. Partially offsetting the increases was approximately 
$33 million of lower net sales of certain Estée Lauder and designer 
fragrances. The lower net sales of certain Estée Lauder fragrances 
were partially due to a decline in net sales of the Modern Muse 
franchise.  Lower  net  sales  from  certain  designer  fragrances 
reflected the expiration of our license agreement with Coach.

The net sales increase for fragrance was adversely affected 
by approximately $47 million of unfavorable foreign currency 
translation.

Reported  fragrance  net  sales  increased  in  fiscal  2016  despite 
approximately  $75  million  of  unfavorable  foreign  currency 
translation.  This  increase  was  also  impacted  by  the  favorable 
comparison  due  to  the  fiscal  2015  accelerated  orders  of 
approximately $21 million. The reported net sales increase primarily 
reflected higher net sales of luxury fragrances from Jo Malone 
London and Tom Ford, as well as incremental sales from our fiscal 
2015 acquisitions of Le Labo and Editions de Parfums Frédéric 
Malle and the fiscal 2016 acquisition of By Kilian of approximately 
$134 million, combined. The higher net sales from Jo Malone 
London were, in part, due to brand expansion in department 
stores, freestanding stores and travel retail, the recent launch of 
Mimosa & Cardamom, and increased sales of existing products. 
The increase in Tom Ford net sales reflected incremental sales from 
new product launches, including Tom Ford Noir Pour Femme and 
increased distribution, particularly in travel retail. Partially offsetting 
these increases were lower sales of certain fragrances from our 
heritage brands and certain designer fragrances of approximately 
$62 million, combined.

Reported hair care net sales decreased in fiscal 2017, primarily 
reflecting a difficult comparison with the prior-year period that 
featured greater launch activity.

Reported hair care net sales increased in fiscal 2016 despite the 
negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 
$14  million.  The  increase  in  net  sales  reflected  new  product 
launches  from  Aveda,  such  as  Invati  Men  and  Shampure  dry 
shampoo and, to a lesser extent, an increase in distribution of 
Aveda products in salons and travel retail and Bumble and bumble

impacted the comparison of fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2015.

Reported  net  sales  in  the  Americas  increased  in  fiscal  2017, 
reflecting incremental sales, primarily in the United States, from 
our recent acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA of approximately 
$220 million, combined. Net sales growth from certain of our 
brands, including Tom Ford, Smashbox, La Mer and Jo Malone 
London, also contributed to the higher net sales in the region. 
Higher net sales in Chile and Brazil contributed an additional 
increase of approximately $25 million, combined. Net sales in the 
United States were adversely impacted by slower retail traffic in 
brick-and-mortar stores that particularly affected M•A•C and our 
heritage brands. This slower retail traffic reflected the impact of 
shifts in consumer preferences as to where and how they shop, as 
well as declines in tourism attributable, in part, to the strong U.S. 
dollar in relation to most currencies.

Reported net sales in the Americas increased in fiscal 2016 despite 
the negative impact of approximately $101 million of unfavorable 
foreign  currency  translation.  Net  sales  in  the  United  States 
and  Canada  increased  approximately  $191  million,  combined, 
and reflected the favorable comparison due to the fiscal 2015 
accelerated orders of approximately $84 million. The increase also 
reflected higher makeup net sales, driven by Clinique, Smashbox, 
Estée Lauder and M•A•C, as well as higher skin care and hair care 
net sales from La Mer and Aveda, respectively. Also contributing 

41

were higher fragrance net sales from Tom Ford and Jo Malone 
London, which were more than offset by lower net sales of Estée 
Lauder fragrances. Net sales were impacted by a decline in retail 
traffic in the United States related primarily to mid-tier department 
stores that principally affected Estée Lauder and Clinique, as well 
as certain M•A•C freestanding stores, as a result of a decrease 
in tourism, particularly from Brazilian travelers. Net sales in Latin 
America increased approximately $6 million, primarily reflecting 
higher net sales in Mexico and Argentina, partially offset by lower 
sales in Brazil as a result of unfavorable foreign currency translation 
of  approximately  $33  million.  Excluding  the  impact  of  foreign 
currency translation, the emerging markets of Brazil and Mexico 
had net sales increases of approximately $56 million, primarily 
driven by M•A•C.

impacted the comparison of fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2015.

Reported net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa increased in 
fiscal 2017, reflecting higher net sales from our travel retail business, 
Russia and Italy of approximately $338 million, combined. The net 
sales growth in our travel retail business for fiscal 2017 reflected 
higher net sales from Tom Ford, Jo Malone London, La Mer and 
M•A•C, driven, in part, by targeted expanded consumer reach 
and new product offerings. The higher net sales in Russia were 
primarily driven by increased net sales from Estée Lauder, Clinique 
and Bobbi Brown, reflecting successful marketing and promotional 
activities  supporting  new  and  existing  products.  Russia  also 
benefited from incremental sales from the fiscal 2016 acquisition 
of By Kilian and the introduction of GLAMGLOW to the market 

during the current year. The higher net sales in Italy were primarily 
driven by M•A•C. These increases were partially offset by lower net 
sales in the United Kingdom and the Middle East of approximately 
$130 million, combined. Excluding the impact of foreign currency 
translation, net sales in the United Kingdom increased, primarily 
driven by higher net sales from Tom Ford, La Mer and Jo Malone 
London, reflecting an increase in tourism, as well as increased 
net sales from Estée Lauder partially due to the Victoria Beckham 
collection. The lower net sales in the Middle East were primarily 
driven  by  the  impact  of  the  macroeconomic  environment  on 
consumer purchases and the associated rebalancing of inventory 
levels by certain of our distributors.

Net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa were adversely 
affected  by  approximately  $185  million  of  unfavorable  
foreign  currency  translation  which  primarily  impacted  the  
United Kingdom.

Reported net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa increased 
in fiscal 2016. This increase includes approximately $265 million 
of unfavorable foreign currency translation due to the strength 
of the U.S. dollar in relation to all currencies in the region. The 
increase was also impacted by the favorable comparison due to 
the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders of approximately $68 million. 
Higher sales in our travel retail business, the United Kingdom and 
the Middle East totaled approximately $225 million, combined. 
The sales growth in our travel retail business was partially driven 
by the favorable comparison due to the fiscal 2015 accelerated 
orders. Travel retail growth also reflected higher net sales from 
Jo Malone London, Tom Ford, M•A•C and Smashbox, driven in 
part by increased distribution and new product offerings. Higher 
sales in the United Kingdom and the Middle East were primarily 
due to increased net sales from Estée Lauder, our makeup artist 
brands  and  Smashbox,  reflecting  the  strength  of  our  makeup 
category, as well as higher sales from certain of our luxury brands. 
These increases were partially offset by lower net sales in Russia 
and South Africa of approximately $17 million, combined, driven 
by the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding 
this impact, net sales in Russia and South Africa increased $57 
million, combined. The sales growth in Russia was primarily due 
to higher net sales from certain of our heritage and luxury brands. 
The higher net sales in South Africa were primarily driven by our 
makeup artist brands and certain of our luxury brands, reflecting 
successful in-store promotional events.

impacted the comparison of fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2015.

Reported net sales in Asia/Pacific increased in fiscal 2017, reflecting 
higher net sales in China, Japan and Korea of approximately $152 
million, combined. These increases were partially offset by lower 
net sales of approximately $8 million in Hong Kong. The higher net 
sales in China, led by Estée Lauder, La Mer and M•A•C, benefited 
from targeted expanded consumer reach and reflected an increase 
in online sales from all brands, primarily driven by marketing and 
promotional events. The net sales increase in Japan was primarily 
due to higher net sales from M•A•C, particularly of lip products, 
as well as Jo Malone London, which benefited from an increase 
in tourist traffic and online growth. The net sales growth in Korea 
reflected higher net sales from M•A•C, particularly of lip products 
and  the  cushion  compact,  La  Mer,  which  benefited  from  the 
introduction of new products, and Jo Malone London and Tom 
Ford, resulting from targeted expanded consumer reach. The lower 

net sales in Hong Kong were primarily driven by the decrease in 
Chinese consumers traveling there and changes in their spending 
patterns,  which  particularly  impacted  the  Estée  Lauder  and 
Clinique brands and, to a lesser extent, La Mer.

Reported  net  sales  in  Asia/Pacific  decreased  in  fiscal  2016, 
reflecting  approximately  $122  million  of  unfavorable  foreign 
currency  translation  due  to  the  strength  of  the  U.S.  dollar  in 
relation  to  all  currencies  in  the  region,  partially  offset  by  the 
favorable comparison due to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders of 
approximately $26 million. Lower sales in Hong Kong, Thailand, 
Malaysia and Korea totaled approximately $56 million, combined. 
The lower net sales in Hong Kong were primarily driven by a 
decrease in Chinese consumers traveling there and changes in 
their spending patterns, which particularly impacted the Estée 
Lauder, Clinique and La Mer brands. The decrease in net sales in 
Thailand, Malaysia, and Korea was driven by the negative impact 
of foreign currency translation. Excluding this negative impact, the 
higher sales in Korea were primarily driven by our makeup artist 
brands, reflecting successful in-store promotional events from 
M•A•C and the launch of the Skin Foundation Cushion Compact 
from Bobbi Brown, as well as new product introductions from 
certain of our luxury brands, such as Genaissance de La Mer The 
Serum Essence from La Mer. These decreases were partially offset 
by higher net sales in Japan and, to a lesser extent, the Philippines 
of approximately $48 million, combined. The net sales in Japan 
reflected higher tourism and increased net sales from virtually all 
of our brands, which was primarily driven by the makeup product 
category. In the Philippines, the higher net sales reflected the 
introduction of Jo Malone London and Origins.

We  strategically  stagger  our  new  product  launches  by  
geographic  market,  which  may  account  for  differences  in  
regional sales growth.

Fiscal 2017 as compared with Fiscal 2016

OPERATING RESULTS

As  a  percentage  of  net  sales,  operating  expenses  improved 
as  compared  to  fiscal  2016,  reflecting  disciplined  expense 
management across all areas and favorable mix shifts in the growth 
of  our  brands  and  channels.  The  favorable  impact  of  general 
and  administrative  expenses  also  reflected  equity  investment 
income, partially offset by transaction costs related to our fiscal 
2017  acquisitions.  Selling  expenses  were  favorable  compared  
to fiscal 2016, reflecting lower demonstration costs, partially due 
to changes in distribution channel mix. The changes in the fair 
value of contingent consideration were due to the reassessment, 
in June 2017, of the potential earn-out amounts related to certain 
of  our  fiscal  2015  and  fiscal  2016  acquisitions.  See Note 13 –  
Fair Value Measurements  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial 
Statements  for  further  information  regarding  contingent 
consideration. 

Fiscal 2016 as compared with Fiscal 2015

The lower advertising, merchandising and sampling costs in fiscal 
2016, as a percentage of net sales, as compared to fiscal 2015, 
were in part due to the brand and channel mix of our spend as 
certain media formats carry different cost structures. Certain of our 
brands have lower costs associated with advertising as they focus 
on digital and social media strategies and rely less on print and 
television advertising, which carry a higher media cost.

Adjusting for the impact of the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders, 
operating expense margin in fiscal 2016 would have increased 
an additional 90 basis points, to 160 basis points unfavorable as 
compared to fiscal 2015. This additional increase, as a percentage 
of net sales, was reflected in general and administrative, selling and 
shipping, and advertising, merchandising and sampling costs.

impacted the comparison of fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2015.

Reported operating results and operating margin in fiscal 2017 
were impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 
$59  million,  which  had  the  largest  impact  on  the  Europe,  the 
Middle East & Africa region and the makeup product category. 
Operating margin in fiscal 2017 was flat as compared to fiscal 
2016 as the decrease in gross margin was offset by our lower 
operating expense margin, as previously noted. The change in 
operating margin was unfavorably impacted by charges associated 
with restructuring and other activities of approximately 60 basis 
points and goodwill and other intangible asset impairments of 
approximately 30 basis points, partially offset by the favorable 
changes in fair value of contingent consideration of approximately 
60 basis points. Adjusting for these items, operating margin for 
fiscal 2017 would have increased approximately 30 basis points.

Reported operating results and operating margin in fiscal 2016 
were impacted by a favorable comparison of approximately $127 
million related to the fiscal 2015 accelerated orders, more than 
offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately 
$134 million, which negatively impacted each product category 
and geographic region. In addition, the operating results for fiscal 
2016 include the impact of charges associated with restructuring 
and other activities of $134 million. Adjusting for the impact of the 
accelerated orders and charges associated with restructuring and 
other activities, operating income would have increased 1% and 
operating margin would have decreased 30 basis points.

Charges  associated  with  restructuring  and  other  activities  are 
not allocated to our product categories or geographic regions 
because they result from activities that are deemed a Company-
wide initiative to redesign, resize and reorganize select corporate 
functions  and  go-to-market  structures  and  to  transform  
and modernize the Company’s GTI. Accordingly, the following 
discussions  of  Operating  Income  by  Product Categories  
and Geographic Regions exclude the fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 
impact of charges associated with restructuring and other activities 
of $212 million, or 2% of net sales, and $134 million, or 1% of net 
sales, respectively.

Reported  skin  care  operating  income  increased  in  fiscal  2017, 
reflecting higher results from La Mer, Estée Lauder and Clinique, 
partially  offset  by  lower  results  from  M•A•C.  The  increase  in 
operating income from La Mer and Estée Lauder reflected higher 
net  sales.  The  higher  results  from  Estée  Lauder  also  reflected 
a favorable comparison to the higher level of support spending 
in fiscal 2016. The increase in operating income from Clinique 
reflected disciplined expense management. The lower results from 
M•A•C reflected lower net sales. Skin care operating income also 
reflected the favorable year-over-year net impact of $10 million due 
to the changes in fair value of contingent consideration partially 
offset by the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in 
fiscal 2017, as previously discussed.

Reported skin care operating income increased in fiscal 2016,

Reported operating income in the Americas decreased in fiscal 
2017,  primarily  reflecting  lower  results  from  M•A•C  due  to  a

certain of our luxury brands, as well as higher store operating 
and selling costs as a result of increased distribution. Operating 
income was impacted by a decline in retail traffic in the United 
States related primarily to mid-tier department stores that primarily 
affected Estée Lauder and Clinique, as well as certain M•A•C 
freestanding stores, as a result of a decrease in tourism, particularly 
from Brazilian travelers.

Reported operating income in Europe, the Middle East & Africa 
increased in fiscal 2017, primarily driven by higher results from our 
travel retail business and the United Kingdom of approximately 
$192 million, combined. The higher operating results in our travel 
retail business were driven by an increase in net sales. Operating 
income within the United Kingdom partially reflected the favorable 
year-over-year net impact of $8 million due to the changes in fair 
value of contingent consideration partially offset by the impairment 
of goodwill and other intangible assets in fiscal 2017, as previously 
discussed. The higher results in the region were partially offset 
by lower results in the Middle East, France and South Africa of 
approximately $51 million, combined. The lower results in the 
Middle East reflected lower net sales. The lower results in South 
Africa  and  France  reflected  higher  spending  on  marketing, 
advertising and promotion behind new and existing products, as 
well as increased selling costs.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

Reported operating income in Europe, the Middle East & Africa 
increased in fiscal 2016, primarily reflecting higher results from 
our  travel  retail  business,  Germany  and  the  Middle  East  of 
approximately $92 million, combined. The higher results from 
our travel retail business reflected the fiscal 2015 impact of the 
accelerated orders of $106 million. The higher results in Germany 
were due to increased sales from certain of our heritage brands 
and  our  makeup  artist  brands,  primarily  due  to  new  product 
introductions, as well as more effective promotional programs. 
These higher results were partially offset by lower results in the 
United Kingdom, France and Russia of approximately $33 million. 
The  lower  results  in  the  United  Kingdom  were  driven  by  the 
negative impact of foreign currency. The lower results in France 
were partially due to higher investment spending behind certain of 
our heritage and luxury brands.

impacted the comparison of fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2015.

Reported operating income in Asia/Pacific increased in fiscal 2017, 
primarily reflecting higher results in China, Japan and Korea of 
approximately $48 million, combined, driven by net sales growth. 
These higher results were partially offset by lower results in Hong 
Kong  and  Indonesia  of  approximately  $9  million,  combined, 
primarily driven by lower net sales.

Reported  operating  income  in  Asia/Pacific  increased  in  fiscal 
2016, reflecting the favorable comparison due to the fiscal 2015 
accelerated orders of $42 million. Excluding this impact, operating 
income decreased. Lower results in Hong Kong and China totaled 
approximately $36 million, combined. The decline in operating 
results in China was also attributable to higher selling and shipping 
costs. These lower results were partially offset by higher results 
in Japan, driven by the impact of the accelerated orders, and, 
to a lesser extent, Australia, Korea and Taiwan of approximately 
$44 million, combined. The improved results in Australia were 
due to higher sales from virtually all of our brands, as well as an

improvement in selling and shipping costs. The higher results in 
Korea were primarily due to lower advertising, merchandising 
and sampling expenses. The improved results from Taiwan were 
primarily due to an increase in net sales.

Interest income and investment income, net increased in fiscal 
2017 primarily due to an increase in cash, short- and long-term 
investment balances and rates, and in fiscal 2016 primarily due to 
higher interest income as a result of an increase in short- and long-

The  effective  tax  rate  in  fiscal  2017  decreased  approximately  
460  basis  points  due  to  the  reversal  of  a  deferred  tax  asset 
valuation  allowance  (the  “China  deferred  tax  asset  valuation 
allowance  reversal”).  The  deferred  tax  asset  and  associated 
valuation  allowance  related  to  the  accumulated  carryforward 
of excess advertising and promotional expenses. In the fourth 
quarter of fiscal 2017, a favorable change to the tax law in China 
was enacted that expanded the corporate income tax deduction 
allowance for advertising and promotional expenses, resulting in 
this change in realizability of the asset. Also contributing to this 
decrease was a reduction in income tax reserve adjustments of 
approximately 100 basis points.

The  decrease  in  the  effective  tax  rate  in  fiscal  2016  was 
principally attributable to a lower effective tax rate related to our 
foreign operations, as well as a decrease in income tax reserve 
adjustments recorded in fiscal 2016.

The provision for income taxes represents U.S. federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The effective rate differs from the federal 
statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes, the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments, 
which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of 
limitations. Our effective tax rate will change from quarter to quarter based on recurring and non-recurring factors including, but not limited 
to, the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, tax reserve adjustments, the ultimate disposition of 
deferred tax assets relating to stock-based compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies. In addition, changes in judgment 
from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition, derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual 
period are recognized separately in the quarter of change.

RECONCILIATIONS OF 
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

We  use  certain  non-GAAP  financial  measures,  among  other 
financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which 
represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business. 
Management believes that excluding certain items that are not 
comparable  from  period  to  period,  or  reflect  the  Company’s 
underlying  ongoing  business,  provides  transparency  for  such 
items and helps investors and others compare and analyze our 
operating performance from period to period. In the future, we 
expect to incur charges or adjustments similar in nature to those 
presented below; however, the impact to the Company’s results in 
a given period may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Our 
non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly 
titled measures used by, or determined in a manner consistent 
with,  other  companies.  While  we  consider  the  non-GAAP 

measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended 
to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in 
the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with 
U.S. GAAP. The following tables present Net Sales, Operating 
Income and Diluted net earnings per common share adjusted to 
exclude the impact of charges associated with restructuring and 
other activities, goodwill and other intangible asset impairments, 
the  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  contingent  consideration,  the 
China deferred tax asset valuation allowance reversal, the fiscal 
2015 impact of accelerated orders associated with the SMI rollout, 
the fiscal 2015 Venezuela remeasurement charge and the effects 
of foreign currency translation. The tables provide reconciliations 
between  these  non-GAAP  financial  measures  and  the  most 
directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. Certain information in 
the prior-year periods have been restated to conform to current 
period presentation.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Overview

Our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows 
from operations, borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper 
program, borrowings from the issuance of long-term debt and 
committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and 
other lenders in the United States and abroad. At June 30, 2017,  
we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,136 million compared 
with $914 million at June 30, 2016. Our cash and cash equivalents  
are maintained at a number of financial institutions. To mitigate the 
risk of uninsured balances, we select financial institutions based  
on  their  credit  ratings  and  financial  strength  and  we  perform 
ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration 
risk exposure.

In addition, we purchase short and long-term investments pursuant 
to  our  cash  investment  strategy.  Our  investment  objectives 
include  capital  preservation,  maintaining  adequate  liquidity, 
asset diversification, and achieving appropriate returns within the 

guidelines set forth in our investment policy. These investments 
are classified as available-for-sale and totaled $1,498 million and  
$1,505 million at June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Our business is seasonal in nature and, accordingly, our working 
capital needs vary. From time to time, we may enter into investing 
and financing transactions that require additional funding. To the 
extent that these needs exceed cash from operations, we could, 
subject to market conditions, issue commercial paper, issue long-
term debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities. 

Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe 
that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available credit 
lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support 
currently  planned  business  operations,  information  systems 
enhancements, capital expenditures, potential stock repurchases, 
restructuring  initiatives,  commitments  and  other  contractual 
obligations on both a near-term and long-term basis. Our cash and 
cash equivalents and short- and long-term investment balances 
at June 30, 2017 include $2,376 million of cash and short- and 
long-term investments in offshore jurisdictions associated with 
our permanent reinvestment strategy. We do not believe that the 

54

indefinite reinvestment of these funds offshore impairs our ability 
to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations. If these 
indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the United 
States as dividends, we would be subject to additional taxes.

The effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall 
operating results in recent years. Generally, we have been able 
to introduce new products at higher prices, increase prices and 
implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost 
increases, which have been moderate.

Credit Ratings

Changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our 
borrowing costs. Our credit ratings also impact the cost of our 
revolving credit facility. Downgrades in our credit ratings may 
reduce our ability to issue commercial paper and/or long-term debt 
and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing. A credit 
rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is 
subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating 
organization, and should be evaluated independently of any other 
rating or information. As of August 18, 2017, our commercial paper 
is rated A-1 by Standard & Poor’s and P-1 by Moody’s, and our 
long-term debt is rated A+ with a stable outlook by Standard & 
Poor’s and A2 with a stable outlook by Moody’s. 

Debt and Access to Liquidity

Total  debt  as  a  percent  of  total  capitalization  (excluding 
noncontrolling  interests)  increased  to  45%  at  June  30,  2017  
from 39% at June 30, 2016, primarily due to the February 2017 
issuance  of  the  1.80%  Senior  Notes  due  February  7,  2020  
(“2020 Senior Notes”), 3.15% Senior Notes due March 15, 2027 
(“2027 Senior Notes”) and 4.15% Senior Notes due March 15, 2047 
(“2047 Senior Notes”).

For  further  information  regarding  our  current  and  long-term 
debt  and  available  financing,  see Note 11 – Debt of  Notes  to 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The  fiscal  2017  increase  in  net  cash  provided  by  operating 
activities as compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by 

an increase in net earnings, a decrease in discretionary pension 
and  post-retirement  benefit  contributions  and  a  favorable 
change in accounts receivable due to the timing of shipments 
and  collections.  These  improvements  were  partially  offset  by 
unfavorable changes in accounts payable, primarily due to the 
timing of payments, and other accrued and noncurrent liabilities, 
related to a change in legal accruals, accrued professional fees 
and accrued employee incentive compensation, partially offset by 
advertising and promotional accruals. The overall change in cash 
flows from certain working capital components was impacted by 
our fiscal 2017 acquisitions.

The  fiscal  2016  decrease  in  net  cash  provided  by  operating 
activities  as  compared  with  fiscal  2015  was  primarily  driven  
by  the  accelerated  orders  in  connection  with  our  July  2014  
SMI  implementation,  which  contributed  to  an  unfavorable 
comparison  in  certain  working  capital  components  and  the 
increase  in  net  earnings.  The  decrease  in  net  cash  provided 
by  operating  activities  also  reflected  an  unfavorable  change 
in accounts receivable, reflecting the timing of shipments and 
collections,  and  higher  long-term  payments  related  to  new 
freestanding  retail  store  locations,  including  cash  payments 
made to former tenants to acquire the rights under commercial 
property  leases.  Also  contributing  to  the  decrease  was  an 
unfavorable change in accounts payable, primarily due to the 
timing of expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an 
increase in other accrued liabilities, due, in part, to higher accrued 
restructuring costs and employee incentive compensation.

The fiscal 2017 increase in net cash used for investing activities 
primarily reflected cash paid in connection with the fiscal 2017 
second quarter acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA, partially 
offset by lower net purchases of investments in connection with 
our cash investment strategy.

The fiscal 2016 decrease in net cash used for investing activities as 
compared with fiscal 2015 primarily reflected lower net purchases 
of investments in connection with our cash investment strategy. 
The decrease in cash used for investing activities also reflected 
lower payments related to acquisitions. Cash paid in connection 
with the fiscal 2015 acquisitions was partially offset by cash paid 
in connection with the fiscal 2016 acquisition of By Kilian and 
an additional purchase price true-up payment related to a fiscal 
2015 acquisition. Partially offsetting the decrease was cash paid in 
the second quarter of fiscal 2016 for the long-term investment in  
Have & Be Co. Ltd., the company behind the skin care brands 
Dr.  Jart  +  and  Do  The  Right  Thing,  as  well  as  higher  capital 
expenditure activity, primarily related to leasehold improvements.

The fiscal 2017 increase in net cash provided by financing activities 
reflected the issuance of the 2020 Senior Notes, 2027 Senior Notes 
and 2047 Senior Notes, partially offset by the repayment of the 
5.55% Senior Notes due May 15, 2017. The increase also reflected 
lower  treasury  stock  purchases  and  higher  commercial  paper 
borrowings, partially offset by higher dividend payments.

55

The fiscal 2016 decrease in net cash used for financing activities 
as compared with fiscal 2015 primarily reflected the proceeds 
from the issuance of the 1.70% Senior Notes due May 10, 2021 
and additional 4.375% Senior Notes due June 15, 2045, as well  
as  lower  treasury  stock  purchases,  partially  offset  by  higher 
dividend payments.

Dividends

For a summary of quarterly cash dividends declared per share  
on  our  Class  A  and  Class  B  Common  Stock  during  the  year 
 ended June 30, 2017 and through August 18, 2017, see Note 16 – 
Common Stock of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pension and Post-retirement Plan Funding

Several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our 
pension  plans.  For  our  domestic  trust-based  noncontributory 
qualified defined benefit pension plan (“U.S. Qualified Plan”), 
we seek to maintain appropriate funded percentages. For any 
future contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan, we would seek to 
contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the 
minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security 
Act  of  1974,  as  amended,  (“ERISA”)  and  subsequent  pension 
legislation, and would not be more than the maximum amount 
deductible for income tax purposes. For each international plan, 
our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations. 
In addition, amounts necessary to fund future obligations under 
these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as 
detailed in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. The effect of 
our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend 
on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, 
the number of participants electing to take lump-sum distributions, 
investment performance and funding decisions.

For the U.S. Qualified Plan, we maintain an investment strategy of 
matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets 
with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities. This strategy 
assists us in maintaining our overall funded ratio. For fiscal 2017 
and  2016,  we  met  or  exceeded  all  contribution  requirements 
under ERISA regulations for the U.S. Qualified Plan. In fiscal 2016,  
we made a discretionary cash contribution to the U.S. Qualified 
Plan of $30 million. As we continue to monitor the funded status, 
we may decide to make cash contributions to the U.S. Qualified 
Plan or our post-retirement medical plan in the United States 
during fiscal 2018.

The  following  table  summarizes  actual  and  expected  benefit 
payments  and  contributions  for  our  other  pension  and  post-
retirement plans:

Commitments and Contingencies

Certain of our business acquisition agreements include contingent 
consideration or “earn-out” provisions. These provisions generally 
require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional 
amounts based on the performance of the acquired business. 
Since the size of each payment depends upon performance of 
the acquired business, we do not expect that such payments will 
have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations 
or financial condition.

For additional contingencies refer to Note 15 – Commitments and 
Contingencies (Contractual Obligations) of Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

Market Risk

During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we changed our market 
risk assessment model from a value-at-risk model to a sensitivity 
based model. This sensitivity analysis utilizes hypothetical changes 
in currency exchange rates and interest rates at the end of the 
reporting  period  to  express  the  potential  future  losses  for  an 
instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors. 
We believe this model provides greater insight into the impact of 
market risk exposures on our derivative instruments.

We  address  certain  financial  exposures  through  a  controlled 
program  of  market  risk  management  that  includes  the  use  of 
foreign  currency  forward  contracts  to  reduce  the  effects  of 
fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and to mitigate the 
change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance 
sheet. To perform a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency 
forward contracts, we assess the change in fair values from the 
impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange 
rates. A hypothetical 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar against the 
foreign exchange rates for the currencies in our portfolio would 
have resulted in a net decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of 
approximately $26 million and $22 million as of June 30, 2017 and 
2016, respectively. This potential change does not consider our 
underlying foreign currency exposures.

In  addition,  we  enter  into  interest  rate  derivatives  to  manage 
the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability 
portfolio, including future debt issuances. Based on a hypothetical 
100 basis point increase in interest rates, the estimated fair value of 
our interest rate derivatives would decrease by $34 million and $15 
million as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Our  sensitivity  analysis  represents  an  estimate  of  reasonably 
possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of 
derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements 
in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual 
results, which may or may not occur. It does not represent the 
maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, 
since  actual  future  gains  and  losses  will  differ  from  those 
estimated,  based  upon  actual  fluctuations  in  market  rates, 
operating  exposures,  and  the  timing  thereof,  and  changes  in 
our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year.  
We  believe,  however,  that  any  such  loss  incurred  would  be 
offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective 
underlying  transactions  for  which  the  derivative  financial 
instrument was intended.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We  do  not  maintain  any  off-balance  sheet  arrangements, 
transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated 
entities, other than operating leases, that would be expected to 
have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition 
or results of operations.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING 
STANDARDS

Refer  to  Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  
for discussion regarding the impact of accounting standards that 
were recently issued but not yet effective, on our consolidated 
financial statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
AND ESTIMATES

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition at June 
30, 2017 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years 
ended June 30, 2017 are based upon our consolidated financial 
statements,  which  have  been  prepared  in  conformity  with 
U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (“U.S.  GAAP”).  
The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make 
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  amounts  of  assets, 
liabilities,  revenues  and  expenses  reported  in  those  financial 
statements. These estimates and assumptions can be subjective 
and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from 
those estimates. We consider accounting estimates to be critical 
if both (i) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material 
due  to  the  levels  of  subjectivity  and  judgment  involved,  and  
(ii)  the  impact  within  a  reasonable  range  of  outcomes  of  the 
estimate and assumption is material to the Company’s financial 
condition. Our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue 
recognition, inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit  
costs, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets and 
income taxes.

Management  of  the  Company  has  discussed  the  selection  of 
significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the 
Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has 
a direct impact on reported net sales. This accrual is calculated 
based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and 
information provided by retailers regarding their inventory levels. 
Consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated 
sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal 
fluctuations. Experience has shown a relationship between retailer 
inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period, as 
well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature 
of our business. In addition, as necessary, specific accruals may 
be established for significant future known or anticipated events.  
The types of known or anticipated events that we have considered, 
and will continue to consider, include, but are not limited to, the 
financial condition of our customers, store closings by retailers, 
changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue to 
support new and existing products.

57

For a discussion of our Revenue Recognition accounting policy, 
which includes information about the sales return accrual, see 
Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

INVENTORY

We state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair-market value, 
with cost being based on standard cost and production variances, 
which approximate actual cost on the first-in, first-out method.  
We believe this method most closely matches the flow of our 
products from manufacture through sale. The reported net value 
of our inventory includes saleable products, promotional products, 
raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be 
sold or used in future periods.

We  also  record  an  inventory  obsolescence  reserve,  which 
represents  the  difference  between  the  cost  of  the  inventory 
and  its  estimated  realizable  value,  based  on  various  product 
sales projections. This reserve is calculated using an estimated 
obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, 
historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales.  
In addition, and as necessary, we may establish specific reserves 
for future known or anticipated events.

For further discussion of our Inventory accounting policy, see  
Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT  
BENEFIT COSTS

We offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees: 
the U.S. Qualified Plan and an unfunded, non-qualified domestic 
noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of 
statutory limitations (collectively with the U.S. Qualified Plan, the 
“Domestic Plans”); a domestic contributory defined contribution 
plan; international pension plans, which vary by country, consisting 
of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans; 
deferred compensation arrangements; and certain other post-
retirement benefit plans.

The amounts needed to fund future payouts under our defined 
benefit  pension  and  post-retirement  benefit  plans  are  subject 
to  numerous  assumptions  such  as  an  anticipated  discount 
rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, mortality rates and 
future  compensation  levels.  We  evaluate  these  assumptions 
with  our  actuarial  advisors  and  select  assumptions  that  we 
believe reflect the economics underlying our pension and post-
retirement obligations. While we believe these assumptions are 
within accepted industry ranges, an increase or decrease in the 
assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a 
direct impact on reported net earnings.

The discount rate for each plan used for determining future net 
periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term 
bonds. For fiscal 2017, net periodic benefit cost was determined 
using discount rates for our Domestic Plans of 3.70% and 3.00% 
and varying rates on our international plans between .25% and 
6.00%. The discount rates for our Domestic Plans were based 
on  a  bond  portfolio  that  includes  only  long-term  bonds  with 
an  Aa  rating,  or  equivalent,  from  a  major  rating  agency.  We 
used an above-mean yield curve which represents an estimate 
of the effective settlement rate of the obligation, and the timing 
and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this 
portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit 
payment streams of our Domestic Plans. For our international 
plans, the discount rate in a particular country was principally 
determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality 
corporate  bonds  in  each  country,  with  the  resulting  portfolio 
having a duration matching that particular plan.

For fiscal 2017, we used an expected return on plan assets of 7.00% 
for our U.S. Qualified Plan and varying rates of between 1.50% 
and 6.00% for our international plans. In determining the long-
term rate of return for a plan, we consider the historical rates of 
return, the nature of the plan’s investments and an expectation for 
the plan’s investment strategies. See Note 14 – Pension, Deferred 
Compensation and Post-retirement Benefit Plans  of  Notes  to 
Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  details  regarding  the 
nature of our pension and post-retirement plan investments. The 
difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is 
reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive 
income.  Those  gains/losses  that  are  subject  to  amortization 
over future periods will be recognized as a component of the 
net periodic benefit cost in such future periods. For fiscal 2017, 
our pension plans had actual return on assets of approximately 
$99  million  as  compared  with  expected  return  on  assets  of 
approximately  $68  million.  The  resulting  net  deferred  gain  of 
approximately $31 million, when combined with gains and losses 
from previous years, will be amortized over periods ranging from 
approximately 7 to 19 years. The actual return on plan assets from 
our global pension plans was higher than expected due to the 
strong performance of equity assets globally and enhanced by 
fixed income returns in the United Kingdom plan.

A 25 basis-point change in the discount rate or the expected rate of 
return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 
2017 pension expense:

To determine the fiscal 2018 net periodic benefit cost, we are 
using discount rates of 3.90% and 3.40% for the U.S. Qualified 
Plan and the non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension 
plan, respectively, and varying rates for our international plans 
of between .50% and 6.75%. We are using an expected return 
on plan assets of 7.00% for the U.S. Qualified Plan and varying 
rates for our international pension plans of between 1.75% and 
6.75%. The net change in these two key assumptions from those 
used in fiscal 2017 will result in a decrease in pension expense of 
approximately $1 million in fiscal 2018. 

GOODWILL, OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS  
AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS 

Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased 
businesses  over  the  fair  value  of  their  underlying  net  assets.  
Other  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  principally  consist  of 
trademarks. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets 
are not amortized.

When testing goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets 
for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative 
assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that 
the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a 
quantitative impairment test. For fiscal 2017 and 2016, we elected to 
perform the qualitative assessment for certain of our reporting units 
and indefinite-lived intangible assets. This qualitative assessment 
included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-
specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more-likely-than-
not that the fair values of our reporting units were below carrying 
value.  For  our  other  reporting  units  and  other  indefinite-lived 
intangible assets, including those acquired during and subsequent 
to  fiscal  2015,  a  quantitative  assessment  was  performed.  We 
engaged  third-party  valuation  specialists  and  used  industry 
accepted valuation models and criteria that were reviewed and 
approved by various levels of management. With regard to our 

fiscal 2017 acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced, the carrying 
values of the related goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible 
assets as of the assessment date approximated their fair values.

For further discussion of the methods used and factors considered 
in our estimates as part of the impairment testing for Goodwill, 
Other  Intangible  Assets  and  Long-Lived  Assets,  see  Note 
2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of  Notes  to 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

INCOME TAXES

We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach 
that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for 
the expected future tax consequences of events that have been 
recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. 
As of June 30, 2017, we have net deferred tax assets of $322 million. 
The net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for 
their realization, as well as the continued application of currently 
anticipated  tax  rates.  Included  in  net  deferred  tax  assets  is  a 
valuation allowance of $42 million for deferred tax assets, where 
management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred 
tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction.

We provide tax reserves for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign 
exposures relating to periods subject to audit. The development  
of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax 
issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical 
estimate. We assess our tax positions and record tax benefits 
for all years subject to examination based upon management’s 
evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at 
the reporting dates.

For further discussion of our Income Taxes accounting policy, see 
Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS

During the three-year period ended June 30, 2017, there have not 
been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical 
accounting policies, nor to the related significant estimates. The 
results of our business underlying these assumptions have not 
differed significantly from our expectations.

While we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper 
and the related results of operations for the period are presented 
fairly in all material respects, other assumptions could reasonably 
be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales, 
cost of sales or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the 
provisions for anticipated sales returns, inventory obsolescence 
reserve and income taxes.

We and our representatives from time to time make written or oral 
forward-looking statements, including statements contained in this 
and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in 
our press releases and in our reports to stockholders. The words 
and  phrases  “will  likely  result,”  “expect,”  “believe,”  “planned,” 
“may,” “should,” “could,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “project,” “intend,” 
“forecast” or similar expressions are intended to identify “forward-
looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities 
Litigation  Reform  Act  of  1995.  These  statements  include,  our 
expectations regarding sales, earnings or other future financial 
performance and liquidity, product introductions, entry into new 
geographic regions, information systems initiatives, new methods 
of sale, our long-term strategy, restructuring and other charges 
and resulting cost savings, and future operations or operating 
results. Although we believe that our expectations are based on 
reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of 
our business and operations, actual results may differ materially 
from our expectations. Factors that could cause actual results to 
differ from expectations include:

(1) increased competitive activity from companies in the skin care, 
makeup, fragrance and hair care businesses;

(2) our ability to develop, produce and market new products on 
which future operating results may depend and to successfully 
address challenges in our business;

(3) consolidations, restructurings, bankruptcies and reorganizations 
in the retail industry causing a decrease in the number of stores 
that sell our products, an increase in the ownership concentration 
within the retail industry, ownership of retailers by our competitors 
or ownership of competitors by our customers that are retailers 
and our inability to collect receivables;

(4) destocking and tighter working capital management by retailers;

(5) the success, or changes in timing or scope, of new product 
launches and the success, or changes in the timing or the scope, of 
advertising, sampling and merchandising programs;

(6) shifts in the preferences of consumers as to where and how 
they shop;

(7) social, political and economic risks to our foreign or domestic 
manufacturing,  distribution  and  retail  operations,  including 
changes in foreign investment and trade policies and regulations 
of the host countries and of the United States;

(8) changes in the laws, regulations and policies (including the 
interpretations  and  enforcement  thereof)  that  affect,  or  will 
affect, our business, including those relating to our products or 
distribution networks, changes in accounting standards, tax laws 
and regulations, environmental or climate change laws, regulations 
or accords, trade rules and customs regulations, and the outcome 
and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings, and any action we 
may take as a result;

(9) foreign currency fluctuations affecting our results of operations 
and the value of our foreign assets, the relative prices at which 
we  and  our  foreign  competitors  sell  products  in  the  same  
markets and our operating and manufacturing costs outside of the 
United States;

(10) changes in global or local conditions, including those due 
to the volatility in the global credit and equity markets, natural or 
man-made disasters, real or perceived epidemics, or energy costs, 
that could affect consumer purchasing, the willingness or ability of 
consumers to travel and/or purchase our products while traveling, 
the financial strength of our customers, suppliers or other contract 
counterparties, our operations, the cost and availability of capital 
which we may need for new equipment, facilities or acquisitions, 
the returns that we are able to generate on our pension assets 
and the resulting impact on funding obligations, the cost and 
availability of raw materials and the assumptions underlying our 
critical accounting estimates;

(11) shipment delays, commodity pricing, depletion of inventory 
and  increased  production  costs  resulting  from  disruptions  of 
operations at any of the facilities that manufacture nearly all of 
our supply of a particular type of product (i.e. focus factories) or 
at our distribution or inventory centers, including disruptions that 
may be caused by the implementation of information technology 
initiatives, or by restructurings;

(12) real estate rates and availability, which may affect our ability 
to increase or maintain the number of retail locations at which we 
sell our products and the costs associated with our other facilities;

60

(13) changes in product mix to products which are less profitable;

(14) our ability to acquire, develop or implement new information 
and distribution technologies and initiatives on a timely basis and 
within our cost estimates and our ability to maintain continuous 
operations of such systems and the security of data and other 
information that may be stored in such systems or other systems 
or media;

(15)  our  ability  to  capitalize  on  opportunities  for  improved 
efficiency, such as publicly-announced strategies and restructuring 
and cost-savings initiatives, and to integrate acquired businesses 
and realize value therefrom;

(16) consequences attributable to local or international conflicts 
around the world, as well as from any terrorist action, retaliation 
and the threat of further action or retaliation;

(17)  the  timing  and  impact  of  acquisitions,  investments  and 
divestitures; and

(18) additional factors as described in our filings with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission, including the Annual Report on Form 
10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.

We assume no responsibility to update forward-looking statements 
made herein or otherwise.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 – DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Currency Translation and Transactions

skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products around the 
world. Products are marketed under brand names, including: Estée

Kiton, Donna Karan New York, DKNY, Michael Kors, Tom Ford, 
Ermenegildo  Zegna,  Tory  Burch  and  AERIN  brand  names  for 
fragrances and/or cosmetics.

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the 
accounts of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and its subsidiaries 
(collectively, the “Company”). All significant intercompany balances 
and transactions have been eliminated.

Certain  amounts  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of 
prior  years  have  been  reclassified  to  conform  to  current  year 
presentation.

Management Estimates

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures 
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 
(“U.S.  GAAP”)  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and 
assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and 
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the 
date  of  the  financial  statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of 
revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements. 
Certain  significant  accounting  policies  that  contain  subjective 
management estimates and assumptions include those related to 
revenue recognition, inventory, pension and other post-retirement 
benefit  costs,  goodwill,  other  intangible  assets  and  long-lived 
assets, and income taxes. Management evaluates its estimates 
and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience 
and other factors, including the current economic environment, 
and makes adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate. 
As future events and their effects cannot be determined with 
precision,  actual  results  could  differ  significantly  from  those 
estimates and assumptions. Significant changes, if any, in those 
estimates and assumptions resulting from continuing changes in 
the economic environment will be reflected in the consolidated 
financial statements in future periods.

All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are 
translated  at  year-end  rates  of  exchange,  while  revenue  and 
expenses are translated at weighted-average rates of exchange 
for the period. Unrealized translation gains (losses) reported as 
cumulative translation adjustments through other comprehensive 
income (loss) (“OCI”) attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies 
Inc. amounted to $32 million, $(109) million and $(322) million, 
net  of  tax,  in  fiscal  2017,  2016  and  2015,  respectively.  For  the 
Company’s Venezuelan and Ukrainian subsidiaries operating in 
highly inflationary economies, the U.S. dollar is the functional 
currency. Remeasurement adjustments in financial statements in 
a highly inflationary economy and other transactional gains and 
losses are reflected in earnings. These subsidiaries are not material 
to the Company’s consolidated financial statements or liquidity in 
fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015.

The  Company  enters  into  foreign  currency  forward  contracts 
and may enter into option contracts to hedge foreign currency 
transactions for periods consistent with its identified exposures. 
Accordingly,  the  Company  categorizes  these  instruments  as 
entered into for purposes other than trading.

The accompanying consolidated statements of earnings include 
net exchange gains on foreign currency transactions of $15 million, 
$16 million and $4 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include $434 million and $205 million 
of short-term time deposits at June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Investments

The Company’s investment objectives include capital preservation, 
maintaining adequate liquidity, asset diversification, and achieving 
appropriate returns within the guidelines set forth in the Company’s 
investment policy. These investments are classified as available-
for-sale, with any temporary difference between the cost and 
fair value of an investment presented as a separate component 
of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”). See 
Note 13 – Fair Value Measurements for further information about 
how the fair values of investments are determined.

Investments in the common stock of privately-held companies 
in which the Company has significant influence, but less than 
a  controlling  financial  interest,  are  accounted  for  under  the 
equity  method  of  accounting.  The  Company  accounts  for  all 
other investments using the cost-method of accounting. These 
investments were not material to the Company’s consolidated 
financial statements as of June 30, 2017 and 2016 and are included 
in  Long-term  investments  in  the  accompanying  consolidated 
balance sheets.

67

The  Company  evaluates  investments  held  in  unrealized  loss 
positions for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly 
basis.  Such  evaluation  involves  a  variety  of  considerations, 
including assessments of the risks and uncertainties associated 
with general economic conditions and distinct conditions affecting 
specific issuers. Factors considered by the Company include, but 
are not limited to (i) the length of time and extent the security has 
been in a material loss position; (ii) the financial condition and 
creditworthiness of the issuer; (iii) future economic conditions 
and market forecasts related to the issuer’s industry, sector, or 
geography;  (iv)  the  Company’s  intent  and  ability  to  retain  its 
investment until maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow 
for recovery of market value; and (v) an assessment of whether it 
is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell its 
investment before recovery of market value. 

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable is stated net of the allowance for doubtful 
accounts  and  customer  deductions  totaling  $30  million  and  
$24 million as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This reserve 
is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging, specific 
exposures and historical trends.

Inventory and Promotional Merchandise

Inventory and promotional merchandise only includes inventory 
considered  saleable  or  usable  in  future  periods,  and  is  stated 
at the lower of cost or fair-market value, with cost being based 
on standard cost and production variances, which approximate 
actual cost on the first-in, first-out method. Cost components 
include raw materials, componentry, direct labor and overhead 
(e.g., indirect labor, utilities, depreciation, purchasing, receiving, 
inspection  and  warehousing)  as  well  as  inbound  freight. 
Manufacturing overhead is allocated to the cost of inventory based 
on the normal production capacity. Unallocated overhead during 
periods of abnormally low production levels are recognized as 
cost of sales in the period in which they are incurred. Promotional 
merchandise is charged to expense at the time the merchandise is 
shipped to the Company’s customers. Included in inventory and 
promotional merchandise is an inventory obsolescence reserve, 
which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory 
and  its  estimated  realizable  value,  based  on  various  product 
sales projections. This reserve is calculated using an estimated 
obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, 
historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales. In 
addition, and as necessary, specific reserves for future known or 
anticipated events may be established.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company’s derivative financial instruments are recorded as 
either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at 
fair value. All derivatives are (i) designated as a hedge of the fair 

value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm 
commitment (“fair-value” hedge), (ii) designated as a hedge of 
a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be 
received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash-
flow”  hedge),  or  (iii)  not  designated  as  a  hedging  instrument. 
Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and 
qualifies as a fair-value hedge that is highly effective are recorded in 
current-period earnings, along with the loss or gain on the hedged 
asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk (including 
losses or gains on unrecognized firm commitments). Changes 
in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies 
as a cash-flow hedge of a forecasted transaction that is highly 
effective are recorded in OCI. Gains and losses deferred in OCI 
are then recognized in current-period earnings when earnings are 
affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged forecasted 
transaction (e.g., when periodic settlements on a variable-rate asset 
or liability are recorded in earnings). Changes in the fair value of 
derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are 
reported in current-period earnings.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment, including leasehold and other 
improvements  that  extend  an  asset’s  useful  life  or  productive 
capabilities, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
amortization. Costs incurred for computer software developed 
or obtained for internal use are capitalized during the application 
development  stage  and  expensed  as  incurred  during  the 
preliminary project and post-implementation stages. For financial 
statement purposes, depreciation is provided principally on the 
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
ranging from 3 to 40 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized 
on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lives of the respective 
leases or the expected useful lives of those improvements. 

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets

Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased 
businesses  over  the  fair  value  of  their  underlying  net  assets.  
Other  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  principally  consist  of 
trademarks. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets 
are not amortized.

The  Company  assesses  goodwill  and  other  indefinite-lived 
intangible assets at least annually for impairment as of the beginning 
of the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if certain events or 
circumstances exist. The Company tests goodwill for impairment 
at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the Company’s 
operating segments. The Company identifies its reporting units 
by assessing whether the components of its operating segments 
constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is 
available and management of each operating segment regularly 
reviews the operating results of those components. The Company 
makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and 

68

liabilities to determine carrying values for its reporting units. When 
testing goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option of 
first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it 
is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less 
than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is 
necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If 
necessary, the quantitative impairment test is performed in two 
steps: (i) the Company determines if an indication of impairment 
exists  by  comparing  the  fair  value  of  a  reporting  unit  with  its 
carrying value, and (ii) if there is an impairment, the Company 
measures  the  amount  of  impairment  loss  by  comparing  the 
implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that 
goodwill. When testing other indefinite-lived intangible assets for 
impairment, the Company also has the option of first performing a 
qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-
not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis 
for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative 
test. The quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible 
assets encompasses calculating the fair value of an indefinite-lived 
intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value. 
If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge 
is recorded.

For fiscal 2017 and 2016, the Company elected to perform the 
qualitative  assessment  for  certain  of  its  reporting  units  and 
indefinite-lived  intangible  assets.  This  qualitative  assessment 
included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-
specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more-likely-than-
not that the fair values of its reporting units were below carrying 
value. The Company considered macroeconomic factors including 
the global economic growth, general macroeconomic trends for 
the markets in which the reporting units operate and the intangible 
assets are employed, and the growth of the global prestige beauty 
industry. In addition to these macroeconomic factors, among other 
things, the Company considered the reporting units’ current results 
and forecasts, any changes in the nature of the business, any 
significant legal, regulatory, contractual, political or other business 
climate factors, changes in the industry/competitive environment, 
changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets and 
its intention to sell or dispose of a reporting unit or cease the use 
of a trademark.

For the Company’s other reporting units and other indefinite-lived 
intangible assets, including those acquired during and subsequent 
to  fiscal  2015,  a  quantitative  assessment  was  performed.  
The  Company  engaged  third-party  valuation  specialists  and 
used industry accepted valuation models and criteria that were 
reviewed  and  approved  by  various  levels  of  management.  
To determine the fair value of the reporting units, the Company 
used an equal weighting of the income and market approaches. 
Under the income approach, we determined fair value using a 
discounted cash flow method, projecting future cash flows of 
each reporting unit, as well as a terminal value, and discounting 
such  cash  flows  at  a  rate  of  return  that  reflected  the  relative 

risk of the cash flows. Under the market approach, we utilized 
market  multiples  from  publicly  traded  companies  with  similar 
operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. 
The  key  estimates  and  factors  used  in  these  two  approaches 
include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal 
forecasts, terminal value, the weighted-average cost of capital used 
to discount future cash flows and comparable market multiples. To 
determine the fair value of other indefinite-lived intangible assets, 
we use an income approach, the relief-from-royalty method. This 
method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would 
be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the 
comparable asset.

Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in 
circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed comparing 
projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual 
disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the 
projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, 
then an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of 
the carrying value over the fair value, which is determined by 
discounting estimated future cash flows.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The  Company  is  a  worldwide  manufacturer,  marketer  and 
distributor of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products. 
The  Company’s  sales  that  are  subject  to  credit  risk  are  made 
primarily to department stores, perfumeries, specialty multi-brand 
retailers and retailers in its travel retail business. The Company 
grants credit to all qualified customers and does not believe it is 
exposed significantly to any undue concentration of credit risk.

The  Company’s  largest  customer  sells  products  primarily 
within the United States and accounted for $922 million, or 8%,  
$1,065 million, or 9%, and $1,060 million, or 10%, of the Company’s 
consolidated net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
This customer accounted for $112 million, or 8%, and $164 million, 
or 13%, of the Company’s accounts receivable at June 30, 2017 and 
2016, respectively.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues from product sales are recognized upon transfer of 
ownership, including passage of title to the customer and transfer 
of the risk of loss related to those goods. In the Americas region, 
sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped 
to the customer and in the Europe, the Middle East & Africa and 
Asia/Pacific regions, sales are generally recognized based upon the 
customer’s receipt. In certain circumstances, transfer of title takes 
place at the point of sale, for example, at the Company’s retail 

69

stores. The Company records revenues generated from purchase 
with purchase promotions in Net Sales and costs of its purchase 
with purchase and gift with purchase promotions in Cost of Sales. 

Revenues are reported on a net sales basis, which is computed 
by  deducting  from  gross  sales  the  amount  of  actual  product 
returns received, discounts, incentive arrangements with retailers 
and an amount established for anticipated product returns. The 
Company’s practice is to accept product returns from retailers 
only if properly requested and approved. In accepting returns, the 
Company typically provides a credit to the retailer against accounts 
receivable from that retailer. As a percentage of gross sales, returns 
were 3.5% in fiscal 2017, 3.1% in fiscal 2016 and 3.4% in fiscal 2015.

Payments to Customers

Certain incentive arrangements require the payment of a fee to 
customers  based  on  their  attainment  of  pre-established  sales 
levels. These fees have been accrued and recorded as a reduction 
of Net Sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of 
earnings and were not material to the results of operations in any 
period presented.

The Company enters into transactions related to demonstration, 
advertising  and  counter  construction,  some  of  which  involve 
cooperative relationships with customers. These activities may be 
arranged either with unrelated third parties or in conjunction with 
the customer. To the extent the Company receives an identifiable 
benefit in exchange for consideration and the fair-value of the 
benefit can be reasonably estimated, the Company’s share of the 
counter depreciation and the other costs of these transactions 
(regardless of to whom they were paid) are reflected in Selling, 
general  and  administrative  expenses  in  the  accompanying 
consolidated  statements  of  earnings  and  were  approximately 
$1,405 million, $1,387 million and $1,378 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 
and 2015, respectively. 

Advertising and Promotion

Global net expenses for advertising, merchandising, sampling, 
promotion and product development were $2,908 million, $2,821 
million and $2,772 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, 
and are expensed as incurred. Excluding the impact of purchase 
with  purchase  and  gift  with  purchase  promotions,  which  are 
included in Net Sales and Cost of Sales, costs for advertising, 
merchandising, sampling, promotion and product development 
included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the 
accompanying consolidated statements of earnings were $2,689 
million, $2,607 million and $2,559 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 
2015, respectively.

Research and Development

Research  and  development  costs  of  $179  million,  $191  million 
and $178 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are 
recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the 
accompanying  consolidated  statements  of  earnings  and  are 
expensed as incurred.

Shipping and Handling

Shipping and handling expenses of $400 million, $363 million 
and  $364  million  in  fiscal  2017,  2016  and  2015,  respectively,  
are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in  
the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of  earnings  and 
include distribution center costs, third-party logistics costs and 
outbound freight.

Operating Leases

The Company recognizes rent expense from operating leases with 
periods of free and scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis 
over the applicable lease term. The Company considers lease 
renewals when such renewals are reasonably assured. From time 
to time, the Company may receive capital improvement funding 
from its lessors. These amounts are recorded as deferred liabilities 
and amortized over the remaining lease term as a reduction of 
rent expense.

License Arrangements

The Company’s license agreements provide the Company with 
worldwide rights to manufacture, market and sell beauty and 
beauty-related products (or particular categories thereof) using 
the  licensors’  trademarks.  Our  current  licenses  have  an  initial 
term of approximately 5 years to 10 years, and are renewable 
subject to the Company’s compliance with the license agreement 
provisions. Most of our license agreements have renewal terms 
in  5  year  increments,  with  potential  renewal  periods  ranging 
from  approximately  5  years  to  25  years.  Under  each  license, 
the Company is required to pay royalties to the licensor, at least 
annually, based on net sales to third parties.

Most of the Company’s licenses were entered into to create new 
business. In some cases, the Company acquired, or entered into, a 
license where the licensor or another licensee was operating a pre-
existing beauty products business. In those cases, other intangible 
assets are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives.

Certain  license  agreements  may  require  minimum  royalty 
payments, incremental royalties based on net sales levels and 
minimum  spending  on  advertising  and  promotional  activities. 
Royalty expenses are accrued in the period in which net sales 
are recognized while advertising and promotional expenses are 
accrued at the time these costs are incurred.

Stock-Based Compensation

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

The Company records stock-based compensation, measured at 
the fair value of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest, 
as an expense in the consolidated financial statements. Upon the 
exercise of stock options or the vesting of restricted stock units, 
performance  share  units,  performance  share  units  based  on 
total stockholder return and long-term performance share units, 
the resulting excess tax benefits, if any, are credited to additional 
paid-in capital. Any resulting tax deficiencies will first be offset 
against those cumulative credits to additional paid-in capital. If the 
cumulative credits to additional paid-in capital are exhausted, tax 
deficiencies will be recorded to the provision for income taxes. 

Income Taxes

The  Company  accounts  for  income  taxes  using  an  asset  and 
liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax 
assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences 
of events that have been recognized in its consolidated financial 
statements or tax returns. The net deferred tax assets assume 
sufficient  future  earnings  for  their  realization,  as  well  as  the 
continued application of currently anticipated tax rates. Included 
in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance for deferred tax 
assets, where management believes it is not more-likely-than-
not that the deferred tax assets will be realized in the relevant 
jurisdiction.  If  the  Company’s  assessment  of  realizability  of  a 
deferred tax asset changes, an increase to a valuation allowance 
will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time while the 
reduction of a valuation allowance will result in an increase of net 
earnings at that time.

The  Company  provides  tax  reserves  for  U.S.  federal,  state, 
local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit.  
The  development  of  reserves  for  these  exposures  requires 
judgments  about  tax  issues,  potential  outcomes  and  timing, 
and  is  a  subjective  critical  estimate.  The  Company  assesses 
its tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to 
examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, 
circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates. 
For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a 
tax  benefit  will  be  sustained,  the  Company  has  recorded  the 
largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood 
of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has 
full knowledge of all relevant information. For those tax positions 
where  it  is  more-likely-than-not  that  a  tax  benefit  will  not  be 
sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated 
financial statements. The Company classifies applicable interest 
and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes. 
Although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, 
in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes 
have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from 
these exposures. If actual outcomes differ materially from these 
estimates, they could have a material impact on the Company’s 
consolidated results of operations.

Pension-related Costs

In March 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) 
issued  authoritative  guidance  that  amends  how  companies 
present net periodic benefit cost in the income statement and 
balance sheet relating to defined benefit pension and/or other 
postretirement benefit plans. Within the income statement, the 
new  guidance  requires  companies  to  report  the  service  cost 
component  within  operating  expenses  and  report  the  other 
components of net periodic benefit cost below operating income 
(if  one  is  reported).  In  addition,  within  the  balance  sheet,  the 
guidance changes the components of the pension cost eligible for 
capitalization to the service cost component only (e.g., as a cost 
of internally manufactured inventory or a self-constructed asset).

Effective for the Company – Fiscal 2019 first quarter, with early 
adoption permitted as of the first interim period in fiscal 2018. 
The guidance must be applied (a) retrospectively as it pertains 
to the income statement classification of the components of net 
periodic benefit cost and (b) prospectively as it pertains to future 
capitalization of service costs.

Impact on consolidated financial statements –  The  Company 
will adopt this guidance when it becomes effective and although 
certain components of pension expense will be reclassified out of 
operating income, the Company does not believe this will have a 
material impact on reported operating income.

Goodwill

In  January  2017,  FASB  issued  authoritative  guidance  which 
simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating 
the second step from the quantitative goodwill impairment test. 
The single quantitative step test requires companies to compare 
the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and 
record an impairment charge for the amount that the carrying 
amount exceeds the fair value, up to the total amount of goodwill 
allocated to that reporting unit. The Company will continue to 
have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to 
determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative 
goodwill impairment test.

Effective for the Company – Fiscal 2021 first quarter, with early 
adoption permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests 
performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.

Impact on consolidated financial statements – The Company did 
not elect to apply this guidance to its fiscal 2017 impairment testing 
and will continue to assess the impact of adopting it on future 
interim and annual impairment tests.

71

Income Taxes

In  October  2016,  the  FASB  issued  authoritative  guidance 
that  changes  the  way  companies  account  for  income  taxes 
relating to intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.  
This new guidance requires that an entity recognize the income 
tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than 
inventory in the period in which the transfer takes place. Under 
current guidance, recognition of current and deferred income 
taxes of an intra-entity asset transfer is deferred. This new guidance 
may affect consolidated earnings where the intra-entity transfer of  
an  asset  other  than  inventory  occurs  between  entities  in 
jurisdictions with different tax rates. This guidance must be adopted 
using  a  modified  retrospective  approach  with  a  cumulative- 
effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the 
period of adoption.

Effective for the Company – Fiscal 2019 first quarter, with early 
adoption permitted.

Impact on consolidated financial statements – The adoption of 
this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the 
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

also  permits  an  employer  to  withhold  up  to  the  maximum 
statutory  withholding  rates  in  a  jurisdiction  without  triggering 
liability classification, allows companies to elect to account for 
forfeitures as they occur, and provides requirements for the cash 
flow classification of cash paid by an employer when directly 
withholding  shares  for  tax-withholding  purposes  and  for  the 
classification of excess tax benefits. The new guidance prescribes 
different transition methods for the various provisions.

Effective for the Company – Fiscal 2018 first quarter, with early 
adoption permitted.

Impact on consolidated financial statements – The Company will 
adopt this guidance in its fiscal 2018 first quarter. For the fiscal 
years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company recognized $42 
million and $22 million of excess tax benefits, respectively, directly 
in its consolidated statements of equity. These amounts may or 
may not be representative of future amounts to be recognized in 
the income statement upon the adoption of this new standard, 
as the impact of the adoption will be primarily dependent on the 
timing and intrinsic value of stock-based compensation awards, 
employee exercise behavior and applicable tax rates.

Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

Leases

In June 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires 
companies  to  utilize  an  impairment  model  for  most  financial 
assets measured at amortized cost and certain other financial 
instruments, which include trade and other receivables, loans 
and held-to-maturity debt securities, to record an allowance for 
credit risk based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. 
In addition, this new guidance changes the recognition method 
for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities, which can 
occur as a result of market and credit risk, as well as additional 
disclosures.  In  general,  this  guidance  will  require  modified 
retrospective adoption for all outstanding instruments that fall 
under this guidance.

Effective for the Company – Fiscal 2021 first quarter.

Impact on consolidated financial statements – The Company is 
currently evaluating the impact of applying this guidance on its 
financial instruments, such as accounts receivable and short- and 
long-term investments.

Compensation - Stock Compensation

In  March  2016,  the  FASB  issued  authoritative  guidance  that 
changes the way companies account for certain aspects of share-
based payments to employees. This new guidance requires that 
all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share-based 
compensation awards be recorded as income tax expense or 
benefit  in  the  income  statement.  In  addition,  companies  are 
required to treat the tax effects of exercised or vested awards 
as discrete items in the period that they occur. This guidance 

In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that 
requires  lessees  to  account  for  most  leases  on  their  balance 
sheets with the liability being equal to the present value of the 
lease payments. The right-of-use asset will be based on the lease 
liability  adjusted  for  certain  costs  such  as  direct  costs.  Lease 
expense will be recognized similar to current accounting guidance  
with  operating  leases  resulting  in  a  straight-line  expense,  and 
financing  leases  resulting  in  a  front-loaded  expense  similar  to 
the  current  accounting  for  capital  leases.  This  guidance  must 
be adopted using a modified retrospective transition approach 
for  leases  that  exist  or  are  entered  into  after  the  beginning  of 
the earliest comparative period in the financial statements, and 
provides for certain practical expedients.

Effective for the Company – Fiscal 2020 first quarter, with early 
adoption permitted.

Impact on consolidated financial statements  –  The  Company 
currently has an implementation team in place that is performing 
a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of the adoption of this 
guidance. While the Company has not completed its evaluation, it 
believes the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact 
on its consolidated balance sheets. As disclosed in Note 15 – 
Commitments and Contingencies, the Company has $2,427 million 
in future minimum lease commitments as of June 30, 2017. Upon 
adoption, the Company’s lease liability will generally be based 
on the present value of such payments and the related right-of 
use asset will generally be based on the lease liability, adjusted for 
initial direct costs.

72

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that defines 
how  companies  should  report  revenues  from  contracts  with 
customers. The standard requires an entity to recognize revenue 
to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers 
in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity 
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. 
It  provides  companies  with  a  single  comprehensive  five-step 
principles-based model to use in accounting for revenue and 
supersedes current revenue recognition requirements, including 
most industry-specific and transaction-specific revenue guidance. 

In  March  2016,  the  FASB  issued  authoritative  guidance  that 
amended the principal versus agent guidance in its new revenue 
recognition  standard.  These  amendments  do  not  change  
the  key  aspects  of  the  principal  versus  agent  guidance,  
including the definition that an entity is a principal if it controls  
the good or service prior to it being transferred to a customer, 
but the amendments clarify the implementation guidance related 
to  the  considerations  that  must  be  made  during  the  contract 
evaluation process.

In  April  2016,  the  FASB  issued  authoritative  guidance  that 
amended  the  new  standard  to  clarify  the  guidance  on  
identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses  
of intellectual property.

In May 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that clarified 
certain terms, guidance and disclosure requirements during the 
transition  period  related  to  completed  contracts  and  contract 
modifications.  In  addition,  the  FASB  provided  clarification  on 
the concept of collectability, the calculation of the fair value of 
noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and other 
similar taxes.

In May 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to reflect the 
Securities and Exchange Commission Staff’s rescission of their 
prior comments that covered, among other things, accounting 
for shipping and handling costs and accounting for consideration 
given by a vendor to a customer.

In December 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that 
amends various aspects of the new standard to clarify certain 
terms,  guidance  and  disclosure  requirements.  In  particular, 
the guidance addresses disclosure requirements for remaining 
performance obligations, impairment testing for contract costs and 
accrual of advertising costs, as well as clarifies several examples. 

Effective for the Company  –  Fiscal  2019,  with  early  adoption 
permitted. An entity is permitted to apply the foregoing guidance 
retrospectively to all prior periods presented, with certain practical 
expedients, or apply the requirements in the year of adoption, 
through a cumulative adjustment.

Impact on consolidated financial statements – The Company will 
apply all of this new guidance when they become effective in fiscal 
2019 and has not yet selected a transition method. Although the 
Company has not yet completed its evaluation, it has preliminarily 
determined  that  certain  promotional  goods,  such  as  samples  
and  testers,  may  be  reclassified  from  Selling,  general  and 
administrative  expenses  to  Cost  of  Sales  in  the  consolidated 
financial statements upon adoption. Additionally, the Company’s 
customer  loyalty  programs,  which  have  historically  been 
accounted  for  under  the  incremental  cost  approach,  will  be 
accounted for as a reduction of revenue based on the fair value of 
estimated future redemptions when the obligation is created (i.e. 
upon sale of the product to the consumer).

No  other  recently  issued  accounting  pronouncements  are 
expected  to  have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company’s 
consolidated financial statements.

The cost of assets related to projects in progress of $183 million 
and $186 million as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, is 
included in their respective asset categories above. Depreciation 
and  amortization  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  was  
$428 million, $401 million and $400 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 
and  2015,  respectively.  Depreciation  and  amortization  related 
to the Company’s manufacturing process is included in Cost of 
Sales and all other depreciation and amortization is included in 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying 
consolidated statements of earnings.

NOTE 6 – ACQUISITION OF BUSINESSES

On December 19, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of Too Faced, 
a makeup brand, for approximately $1.5 billion. This acquisition 
is expected to complement the Company’s distribution in the 
specialty-multi channel. The amount paid at closing was funded 
by cash on hand including the proceeds from the issuance of 
commercial paper. In February 2017, the Company issued long-
term debt to refinance a portion of the outstanding commercial 
paper,  see Note 11 – Debt.  A  working  capital  adjustment  of 
approximately $8 million was received by the Company in the 
fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The results of operations of Too Faced 
are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements 
commencing on the acquisition date.

The Company has recorded an allocation of the purchase price to 
the Company’s tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed based on their fair value at the acquisition 
date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the 
net  tangible  and  intangible  assets  was  recorded  as  goodwill, 
which  includes  value  associated  with  assembled  workforce.

For the year ended June 30, 2017, the Company’s statements of 
earnings included approximately $165 million of net sales and 
$22 million, net of tax, of net loss, inclusive of acquisition-related 
costs,  related  to  Too  Faced.  Acquisition-related  costs,  which 
primarily include financial advisory, accounting and legal fees, 
in the amount of $11 million for the year ended June 30, 2017,  
are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in  
the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of  earnings. 
Measurement  period  adjustments  were  not  material  to  the 
consolidated financial statements. 

On November 14, 2016, the Company also acquired 100% of 
BECCA, a makeup brand. Pro forma results of operations reflecting 
the Too Faced and BECCA acquisitions have not been presented, 
as the impact on the Company’s consolidated financial results 
would not have been material. 

NOTE 7 – GOODWILL AND OTHER  
INTANGIBLE ASSETS

As previously discussed in Note 6 – Acquisition of Businesses, 
during  the  year  ended  June  30,  2017,  the  Company  acquired  
Too Faced and BECCA, which included the addition of goodwill 
of  $705  million,  amortizable  intangible  assets  of  $397  million 
(with a weighted-average amortization period of approximately 
10 years) and non-amortizable intangible assets of $623 million. 
Goodwill associated with the acquisitions is primarily attributable 
to  the  future  revenue  growth  opportunities  associated  with 
additional share in the makeup category. As such, the goodwill 
has been allocated to the Company’s makeup product category. 
Approximately $316 million of goodwill recorded in connection 
with certain of these acquisitions is expected to be deductible for 

75

tax purposes. These amounts are provisional pending finalization 
of tax-related items and completion of the related final valuations. 
During the year ended June 30, 2017, the Company recognized 
$11 million of goodwill associated with the continuing earn-out 
obligations related to the acquisition of the Bobbi Brown brand.

The intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisitions 
of Too Faced and BECCA are classified as Level 3 in the fair value 
hierarchy. The estimate of the fair values of acquired amortizable 

intangible  assets  was  determined  using  a  multi-period  excess 
earnings income approach. Fair value was determined under this 
approach by estimating future cash flows over multiple periods, 
as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at 
a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows.  
The  estimate  of  the  fair  values  of  acquired  intangible  assets 
not subject to amortization was determined using an income 
approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method.

Goodwill

The Company assigns goodwill of a reporting unit to the product category in which that reporting unit predominantly operates at the time of 
acquisition. The following table presents goodwill by product category and the related change in the carrying amount:

Other Intangible Assets

Other intangible assets include trademarks and patents, as well 
as license agreements and other intangible assets resulting from 
or related to businesses and assets purchased by the Company. 
Indefinite-lived intangible assets (e.g., trademarks) are not subject 
to amortization and are assessed at least annually for impairment 
during the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if certain events 
or circumstances exist. Other intangible assets (e.g., non-compete 

agreements, customer lists) are amortized on a straight-line basis 
over their expected period of benefit, approximately 2 years to 
20 years. Intangible assets related to license agreements were 
amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based 
on the terms of the respective agreements. The costs incurred 
and expensed by the Company to extend or renew the term of 
acquired intangible assets during fiscal 2017 and 2016 were not 
significant to the Company’s results of operations.

Fiscal 2017 Annual Impairment Testing

The  Company  assesses  goodwill  and  other  indefinite-lived 
intangible assets at least annually for impairment or more frequently 
if certain events or circumstances exist. Based on the Company’s 
annual goodwill and other intangible asset impairment testing as 
of April 1, 2017, the Company determined that the carrying values 
of the RODIN olio lusso and Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle 
reporting units exceeded their fair values. This determination was 
made based on updated long-term plans, finalized and approved 
in June 2017, that reflected lower sales growth projections due 
to a softer than expected retail environment for those brands. 
As a result, a Step 2 impairment assessment was performed and 
the Company recorded an impairment charge of the goodwill 
related to these reporting units of $28 million. The fair values of 
the reporting units were based upon the average of the income 
approach,  which  utilizes  estimated  cash  flows  and  a  terminal 
value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of 
cash flows, and the market approach, which utilizes performance 
multiples based on market peers.

The  Company  also  determined  that  the  carrying  values  of 
the RODIN olio lusso and Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle 
trademarks, as well as the RODIN olio lusso persona and customer 
relationship intangible assets exceeded their estimated fair values. 
The  fair  values  of  the  trademarks  were  determined  utilizing  a 
royalty rate to determine discounted projected future cash flows. 
As  a  result,  the  Company  recognized  impairment  charges  of  
$3 million for the remaining carrying values of the RODIN olio 
lusso trademark, customer relationship and persona intangible 
assets.  The  Company  also  recognized  an  impairment  charge  
for the Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle trademark, which was 
de minimis.

The combined goodwill and other intangible asset impairment 
charges of $9 million and $22 million are reflected in the skin care 
and fragrance product categories, respectively, and $17 million and 
$14 million are reflected in the Americas and Europe, the Middle 
East & Africa regions, respectively.

The types of activities included in restructuring and other charges, 
and the related accounting criteria, are described below.

Leading Beauty Forward 

Background

In  May  2016,  the  Company  announced  a  multi-year  initiative 
(“Leading Beauty Forward,” “LBF” or the “Program”) to build on 
its strengths and better leverage its cost structure to free resources 
for investment to continue its growth momentum. LBF is designed 
to enhance the Company’s go-to-market capabilities, reinforce 
its  leadership  in  global  prestige  beauty  and  continue  creating 
sustainable value.

The  Company  plans  to  approve  specific  initiatives  under  LBF 
through fiscal 2019 related to the optimization of select corporate 
functions,  supply  chain  activities,  and  corporate  and  regional 
market support structures, as well as the exit of underperforming 
businesses, and expects to complete those initiatives through 
fiscal 2021. Inclusive of charges recorded from inception through 
June 30, 2017, the Company expects that LBF will result in related 
restructuring and other charges totaling between $600 million and 
$700 million before taxes.

Program-to-Date Approvals

Restructuring actions to be taken over the duration of LBF involve 
the redesigning, resizing and reorganization of select corporate 
functions and go-to-market structures to improve effectiveness 
and create cost efficiencies in support of increased investment in 
growth drivers. As the Company continues to grow, it is important 
to  more  efficiently  support  its  diverse  portfolio  of  brands, 
channels and geographies in the rapidly evolving prestige beauty 
environment. The initiatives being evaluated include the creation 
of a shared-services structure in existing or lower-cost locations, 
either  using  Company  resources  or  through  external  service 
providers. The Company also believes that decision-making in  
key areas of innovation, marketing and digital communications 
should be moved closer to the consumer to increase speed and 
local relevance.

In connection with LBF, at this time, the Company estimates a net 
reduction over the duration of LBF in the range of approximately 
900 to 1,200 positions globally, which is about 2.5% of its current 
workforce. This reduction takes into account the elimination of 
some positions, retraining and redeployment of certain employees 
and investment in new positions in key areas.

Of the $600 million to $700 million restructuring and other charges expected to be incurred, total cumulative charges approved by the 
Company through June 30, 2017, some of which were recorded during fiscal 2017 and 2016, were:

Specific actions taken since the Program inception include:

•  Optimize  Select  Corporate  Functions  –  The  Company 
approved initiatives to realign and optimize its organization to 
better leverage scale, improve productivity, reduce complexity 
and achieve cost savings across various functions, including 
finance, research and development, human resources, global 
information  systems  and  legal.  Such  approvals  included 
consulting,  other  professional  services,  temporary  labor 
backfill and, to a lesser extent, costs for training and recruiting 
related  to  new  capabilities,  which  are  necessary  for  the 
design of the future structures, processes and technologies of 
these functions, as well as similar expenses for certain other 
corporate functions. These actions will result in a net reduction 
of the workforce, which includes position eliminations, the 
re-leveling  of  certain  positions  and  an  investment  in  new 
capabilities.  The  Company  also  approved  other  charges 
to  support  the  LBF  Project  Management  Office  (“PMO”), 
primarily consisting of internal costs for employees dedicated 
solely to project management activities, with a focus on project 
integration and change management.

The future design of certain corporate functions includes the 
creation of a shared-services structure, either using Company 
resources or through external service providers. As part of the 
future service delivery model, the Company approved the 
organizational design of the management and governance 
platform  of  a  shared-services  structure  using  Company 
resources,  as  well  as  the  transition  of  select  transactional 
activities to an external service provider, which is expected 
to  result  in  other  charges  for  implementation,  project  and 
consulting costs.

•  Optimize  Supply  Chain  –  An  initiative  to  centralize  the 
Company’s supply chain management was approved. This 
includes the relocation of certain operations and positions, 
with some employees being separated and positions replaced 
in  a  new  location.  Other  charges  approved  are  primarily 
related  to  consulting  fees  for  design  and  implementation, 
temporary  labor  backfill  during  the  transition  and  project 
management costs.

In  addition,  the  Company  approved  certain  activities 
related  to  initiatives  to  enable  distribution  capabilities  and 
generate  efficiencies  through  an  external  service  provider 

and  to  optimize  certain  supply  chain  activities  through 
organizational design in certain key areas. Collectively, these 
actions will result in a net reduction of the workforce, which 
includes  position  eliminations,  the  re-leveling  of  certain 
positions and an investment in new capabilities. Initiatives 
to redesign certain supply chain planning and transportation  
management  activities  and  to  improve  the  organizational 
design of manufacturing and engineering processes related  
to  certain  product  lines  were  also  approved,  primarily  
resulting in consulting fees and, to a lesser extent, project 
management costs.

•  Optimize Corporate and Region Market Support Structures – 
The  Company  approved  initiatives  to  enhance  its  go-
to-market  support  structures  and  achieve  synergies 
across  certain  geographic  regions,  brands  and  channels.  
These initiatives are primarily intended to shift certain areas of 
focus from traditional to social and digital marketing strategies 
to  provide  enhanced  consumer  experience,  as  well  as  to 
support expanded omnichannel opportunities. These actions 
will result in a net reduction of the workforce, which includes 
position  eliminations,  the  re-leveling  of  certain  positions  
and an investment in new capabilities. The Company also 
approved consulting and other professional services related 
to the design of future structures, processes and technologies 
and, to a lesser extent, other costs for recruitment and training 
related to new capabilities. In addition, the Company approved 
initiatives to enhance consumer engagement strategies across 
certain channels in Europe, which is expected to result in 
product returns.

•  Exit  Underperforming  Businesses  –  To  further  improve 
profitability in certain areas of the Company’s brands and 
regions,  the  Company  approved  initiatives  to  exit  certain 
businesses  in  select  markets  and  channels  of  distribution. 
The  Company  has  also  decided  to  close  a  number  of 
underperforming freestanding retail stores and exit mid-tier 
department stores for certain brands in the United States to 
redirect resources to other retail locations and channels with 
potential for greater profitability. These activities will result in 
product returns, inventory write-offs, reduction of workforce, 
accelerated depreciation and termination of contracts.

Program-to-Date Restructuring and Other Charges

Restructuring charges are comprised of the following:

Employee-Related Costs – Employee-related costs are primarily 
comprised  of  severance  and  other  post-employment  benefit 
costs, calculated based on salary levels, prior service and other 
statutory minimum benefits, if applicable. Employee-related costs 
are  expensed  when  specific  employees  have  been  identified 
and when payment is probable and estimable, which generally 
occurs upon approval of the related initiative by management with 
authority delegated from the Company’s Board of Directors.

Asset-Related Costs – Asset-related costs primarily consist of asset 
write-offs or accelerated depreciation related to long-lived assets 
that will be taken out of service prior to their existing useful life as 
a direct result of a restructuring initiative. The accelerated portion 
of depreciation expense will be expensed on a straight-line basis 
and be classified as restructuring charges, while the portion relating 
to the previous existing useful life will continue to be reported in 
Selling, general and administrative expenses.

Contract Terminations – Costs related to contract terminations 
include continuing payments to a third party after the Company 
has ceased benefiting from the rights conveyed in the contract, 
or a payment made to terminate a contract prior to its expiration. 
These may include continuing operating lease payments (less 
estimated sublease payments) to a landlord after exiting a location 
prior  to  the  lease-end  date  as  a  direct  result  of  an  approved 
restructuring initiative. Contract terminations also include minimum 
payments or fees related to the early termination of license or other 
personal service contracts. Costs related to contract terminations 
are expensed upon the cease-use date of a leased property or 
upon the notification date to the third party in the event of a 
license or personal service contract termination.

Other Exit Costs  –  Other  exit  costs  related  to  restructuring 
activities generally include costs to relocate facilities or employees, 
recruiting to fill positions as a result of relocation of operations, and 
employee outplacement for separated employees. Other exit costs 
are charged to expense as incurred.

Other  charges  associated  with  restructuring  activities  are 
comprised of the following:

Sales Returns and Cost of Sales – Product returns (offset by the 
related cost of sales) and inventory write-offs or write-downs as 
a direct result of an approved restructuring initiative to exit certain 
businesses or locations will be recorded as a component of Net 
Sales and/or Cost of Sales when estimable and reasonably assured. 
Consulting and other professional services, primarily related to the 
design of supply chain planning activities, are expensed in Cost of 
Sales as incurred.

Other Charges – The Company approved other charges related to 
the design and implementation of approved initiatives, which are 
charged to Operating Expenses as incurred and primarily include 
the following:

•  Consulting and other professional services for organizational 
design of the future structures, processes and technologies, 
and implementation thereof,

•  Temporary labor backfill, 

•  Costs to establish and maintain a PMO for the duration of 
Leading Beauty Forward, including internal costs for employees 
dedicated solely to project management activities, and other 
PMO-related expenses incremental to the Company’s ongoing 
operations (e.g., rent and utilities), and 

•  Recruitment  and  training  costs  for  new  and  reskilled 
employees  to  acquire  and  apply  the  capabilities  needed 
to perform responsibilities as a direct result of an approved 
restructuring initiative. 

The Company records approved charges that are associated with restructuring and other activities once the relevant accounting criteria have 
been met. Total cumulative charges recorded associated with restructuring and other activities for LBF were:

Restructuring charges for employee-related costs in fiscal 2017 are 
net of adjustments to the accrual estimate for certain employees 
who  either  resigned  or  transferred  to  other  existing  positions 
within the Company. Accrued restructuring charges at June 30, 
2017 are expected to result in cash expenditures funded from cash 
provided by operations of approximately $97 million, $47 million 
and $6 million in fiscal 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.

Global Technology Infrastructure

In  October  2015,  the  Company  approved  plans  to  transform 
and  modernize  its  global  technology  infrastructure  (“GTI”) 
to  fundamentally  change  the  way  the  Company  delivers 
information  technology  services  internally  (such  initiative,  the  

NOTE 9 – INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes is comprised of the following:

“GTI  Restructuring”).  As  part  of  the  GTI  Restructuring,  the 
Company transitioned its GTI from Company-owned assets to a 
primarily vendor-owned, cloud-based model where the Company 
pays  for  services  as  they  are  used.  The  Company  incurred 
restructuring charges of $46 million for the year ended June 30, 
2016, reflecting contract terminations of $24 million, asset write-
offs of $18 million and employee-related costs of $4 million. Other 
charges in connection with the implementation of this initiative 
were $7 million for the year ended June 30, 2016, primarily related 
to consulting services. These charges are included in Restructuring 
and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statements 
of earnings. The implementation of the GTI Restructuring was 
substantially completed during fiscal 2016.

Earnings  before  income  taxes  include  amounts  contributed  by  the  Company’s  foreign  operations  of  approximately  $1,676  million,  
$1,448 million and $1,420 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A portion of these earnings is taxed in the United States.

A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the Company’s actual effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes  
is as follows:

Income  tax  reserve  adjustments  represent  changes  in  the 
Company’s net liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to 
prior-year tax positions including the impact of tax settlements and 
lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, a favorable change to the tax 
law in China was enacted that expanded the corporate income 
tax deduction allowance for advertising and promotional expenses 
to include all companies that distribute and sell cosmetics in the 
country. As a result of the new law, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
2017, the Company released into income its previously established 
China deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately 
$75  million  related  to  its  accumulated  carryforward  of  excess 
advertising and promotional expenses.

Federal income and foreign withholding taxes have not been 
provided on approximately $4,136 million of undistributed earnings 
of foreign subsidiaries at June 30, 2017. The Company intends to 
reinvest these earnings in its foreign operations indefinitely, except 
where it is able to repatriate these earnings to the United States 
without material incremental tax provision. The determination and 
estimation of the future income tax consequences in all relevant 
taxing jurisdictions involves the application of highly complex tax 
laws in the countries involved, particularly in the United States, and 
is based on the tax profile of the Company in the year of earnings 
repatriation. Accordingly, it is not practicable to determine the 
amount of tax associated with such undistributed earnings.

Significant components of the Company’s deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:

As of June 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company had net deferred tax 
assets of $322 million and $422 million, respectively, substantially 
all of which are included in Other assets in the accompanying 
consolidated balance sheets.

As of June 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company had gross unrecognized 
tax benefits of $68 million and $82 million, respectively. The total 
amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would 
affect the effective tax rate was $42 million.

As of June 30, 2017 and 2016, certain subsidiaries had net operating 
loss and other carryforwards for tax purposes of approximately 
$230 million and $410 million, respectively. With the exception 
of  approximately  $218  million  of  net  operating  loss  and  other 
carryforwards with an indefinite carryforward period as of June 
30, 2017, these carryforwards expire at various dates through fiscal 
2024.  Deferred  tax  assets,  net  of  valuation  allowances,  in  the 
amount of $34 million and $4 million as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, 
respectively, have been recorded to reflect the tax benefits of the 
carryforwards not utilized to date.

A full valuation allowance has been provided for those deferred 
tax assets for which, in the opinion of management, it is more-
likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The Company classifies applicable interest and penalties related 
to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for 
income taxes. During fiscal 2017, the Company recognized a gross 
interest and penalty benefit of $5 million in the accompanying 
consolidated statement of earnings. The total gross accrued interest 
and  penalty  expense  during  fiscal  2016  in  the  accompanying 
consolidated statement of earnings was de minimis. The total gross 
accrued interest and penalties in the accompanying consolidated 
balance sheets at June 30, 2017 and 2016 were $13 million and  
$18 million, respectively. A reconciliation of the beginning and 
ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Earnings from the Company’s global operations are subject to tax 
in various jurisdictions both within and outside the United States. 
The Company participates in the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the 
“IRS”) Compliance Assurance Program (“CAP”). The objective of 
CAP is to reduce taxpayer burden and uncertainty while assuring 
the IRS of the accuracy of income tax returns prior to filing, thereby 
reducing or eliminating the need for post-filing examinations.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company formally 
concluded the compliance process with respect to fiscal 2016 
under  the  IRS  CAP.  The  conclusion  of  this  process  did  not 
impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements. As of  
June 30, 2017, the compliance process was ongoing with respect to  
fiscal 2017.

The Company is currently undergoing income tax examinations 
and controversies in several state, local and foreign jurisdictions. 
These matters are in various stages of completion and involve 
complex multi-jurisdictional issues common among multinational 
enterprises,  including  transfer  pricing,  which  may  require  an 
extended period of time for resolution.

During fiscal 2017, the Company concluded various state, local and 
foreign income tax audits and examinations while several other 
matters, including those noted above, were initiated or remained 
pending. On the basis of the information available in this regard 
as of June 30, 2017, the Company does not expect any significant 
changes to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within 
the next 12 months.

83

The  Company  is  also  subject  to  income  tax  examinations 
in  numerous  other  state,  local  and  foreign  jurisdictions.  
The Company believes that its tax reserves are adequate for all 
years subject to examination.

(1) In November 2016, in anticipation of the issuance of the 2047 Senior Notes, the Company entered into a series of treasury lock agreements on a notional amount totaling $350 
million at a weighted-average all-in rate of 3.01%. The treasury lock agreements were settled upon the issuance of the new debt, and the Company recognized a gain in OCI of 
$3 million that is being amortized against interest expense over the life of the 2047 Senior Notes. As a result of the treasury lock agreements, the debt discount and debt issuance 
costs, the effective interest rate on the 2047 Senior Notes will be 4.17% over the life of the debt.

(2) In April and May 2015, in anticipation of the issuance of the 2045 Senior Notes in June 2015, the Company entered into a series of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements 
on a notional amount totaling $300 million at a weighted-average all-in rate of 2.38%. The forward-starting interest rate swap agreements were settled upon the issuance of the 
new debt and the Company recognized a gain in OCI of $18 million that will be amortized against interest expense over the life of the 2045 Senior Notes. As a result of the forward-
starting interest rate swap agreements, the debt discount and debt issuance costs, the effective interest rate on the 2045 Senior Notes will be 4.216% over the life of the debt. In May 
2016, the Company reopened this offering with the same terms and issued an additional $150 million for an aggregate amount outstanding of $450 million of 2045 Senior Notes.

(3) In April 2007, in anticipation of the issuance of the 2037 Senior Notes, the Company entered into a series of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements on a notional 
amount totaling $210 million at a weighted-average all-in rate of 5.45%. The forward-starting interest rate swap agreements were settled upon the issuance of the new debt and 
the Company recognized a loss in OCI of $1 million that is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2037 Senior Notes. As a result of the forward-starting interest rate 
swap agreements, the debt discount and debt issuance costs, the effective interest rate on the 2037 Senior Notes will be 6.181% over the life of the debt.

(4) In May 2003, in anticipation of the issuance of the 2033 Senior Notes, the Company entered into a series of treasury lock agreements on a notional amount totaling $195 million 
at a weighted-average all-in rate of 4.53%. The treasury lock agreements were settled upon the issuance of the new debt and the Company received a payment of $15 million that is 
being amortized against interest expense over the life of the 2033 Senior Notes. As a result of the treasury lock agreements, the debt discount and debt issuance costs, the effective 
interest rate on the 2033 Senior Notes will be 5.395% over the life of the debt.

(5) In November 2016, in anticipation of the issuance of the 2027 Senior Notes, the Company entered into a series of treasury lock agreements on a notional amount totaling $450 
million at a weighted-average all-in rate of 2.37%. The treasury lock agreements were settled upon the issuance of the new debt, and the Company recognized a gain in OCI of 
$2 million that is being amortized against interest expense over the life of the 2027 Senior Notes. As a result of the treasury lock agreements, the debt discount and debt issuance 
costs, the effective interest rate on the 2027 Senior Notes will be 3.18% over the life of the debt. 

(6) The Company entered into interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount totaling $250 million, $450 million and $250 million to effectively convert the fixed rate interest 
on its outstanding 2020 Senior Notes, 2021 Senior Notes and 2022 Senior Notes, respectively, to variable interest rates based on three-month LIBOR plus a margin.

(7) In April 2016, in anticipation of the issuance of the 2021 Senior Notes, the Company entered into a series of treasury lock agreements on a notional amount totaling $400 million 
at a weighted-average all-in rate of 1.27%. The treasury lock agreements were settled upon the issuance of the new debt and the Company made a payment of $1 million that is 
being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2021 Senior Notes. As a result of the treasury lock agreements, the debt discount and debt issuance costs, the effective 
interest rate on the 2021 Senior Notes will be 1.844% over the life of the debt.

In October 2016, the Company replaced its undrawn $1.0 billion 
unsecured revolving credit facility that was set to expire on July 15, 
2020 (the “Prior Facility”) with a new $1.5 billion senior unsecured 
revolving credit facility that expires on October 3, 2021, unless 
extended for up to two additional years in accordance with the 
terms set forth in the agreement (the “New Facility”). The New 
Facility may be used for general corporate purposes. Up to the 
equivalent of $500 million of the New Facility is available for 
multi-currency  loans.  Interest  rates  on  borrowings  under  the 
New Facility will be based on prevailing market interest rates in 
accordance with the agreement. The Company incurred costs of 
approximately $1 million to establish the New Facility, which will 
be amortized over the term of the facility. The New Facility has an 
annual fee of approximately $1 million, payable quarterly, based on 
the Company’s current credit ratings. The New Facility contains 
a cross-default provision whereby a failure to pay other material 
financial obligations in excess of $175 million (after grace periods 
and absent a waiver from the lenders) would result in an event 
of default and the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding 
debt under this facility. At June 30, 2017, no borrowings were 
outstanding under the New Facility.

In  November  2016,  the  Company  increased  the  size  of  its 
commercial paper program, under which it may issue commercial 
paper  in  the  United  States,  to  $3  billion  (from  $1.5  billion)  to 
finance the Company’s second quarter acquisitions. In November 
2016, the Company also entered into a senior unsecured credit 
agreement that provided for a 364 day revolving credit facility (the 
“364 Day Facility”) in the amount of $1.5 billion for credit support 
for the Company’s commercial paper program and for general 
corporate purposes.

In February 2017, the Company completed a public offering of 
$500 million aggregate principal amount of its 2020 Senior Notes, 
$500 million aggregate principal amount of its 2027 Senior Notes 
and $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 2047 Senior 
Notes. The Company used proceeds from this offering for general 
corporate purposes, including to repay outstanding commercial 
paper as it matured and to refinance its $300 million aggregate 
principal amount of the 2017 Senior Notes when it became due 
in May 2017.

In  February  2017,  the  Company  decreased  the  size  of  its 
commercial paper program, under which it may issue commercial 
paper  in  the  United  States,  to  $1.5  billion  and  terminated  the 
undrawn $1.5 billion 364 Day Facility.

As of June 30, 2017, the Company had $170 million of commercial 
paper  outstanding  that  matured  through  July  2017,  which  the 
Company  refinanced  as  it  matured.  At  August  18,  2017,  the 
Company had $431 million of commercial paper outstanding, 
which may be refinanced on a periodic basis as it matures at the 
then-prevailing market interest rates.

The Company maintains uncommitted credit facilities in various 
regions throughout the world. Interest rate terms for these facilities 
vary by region and reflect prevailing market rates for companies 
with strong credit ratings. During fiscal 2017 and 2016, the monthly 
average  amount  outstanding  was  approximately  $17  million  
and  $31  million,  respectively,  and  the  annualized  monthly  
weighted-average interest rate incurred was approximately 11.2%  
and 12.5%, respectively.

Refer  to Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies  for  the 
Company’s projected debt service payments, as of June 30, 2017, 
over the next five fiscal years.

NOTE 12 – DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The  Company  addresses  certain  financial  exposures  through 
a controlled program of risk management that includes the use 
of  derivative  financial  instruments.  The  Company  enters  into 
foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into option 
contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency 
exchange rates. In addition, the Company enters into interest rate 
derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on the 
Company’s aggregate liability portfolio, including potential future 
debt issuances. The Company also enters into foreign currency  
forward contracts and may use option contracts, not designated as 
hedging instruments, to mitigate the change in fair value of specific 
assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. The Company does not 
utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative 
purposes. Costs associated with entering into derivative financial 
instruments have not been material to the Company’s consolidated 
financial results.

For each derivative contract entered into where the Company 
looks  to  obtain  hedge  accounting  treatment,  the  Company 
formally  and  contemporaneously  documents  all  relationships 
between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its 
risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge 
transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging 
instruments’ effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be 
assessed prospectively and retrospectively, and a description of 
the method of measuring ineffectiveness. This process includes 
linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance 
sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. 
The Company also formally assesses, both at the inception of 
the hedges and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives 
that  are  used  in  hedging  transactions  are  highly  effective  in 
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. 
If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective, or that 
it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company will 
be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that 
derivative prospectively.

Cash-Flow Hedges

The  Company  enters  into  foreign  currency  forward  contracts 
to  hedge  anticipated  transactions,  as  well  as  receivables  and 
payables denominated in foreign currencies, for periods consistent 
with the Company’s identified exposures. The purpose of the 
hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate 
movements on costs and on the cash flows that the Company 
receives from foreign subsidiaries. The majority of foreign currency 
forward  contracts  are  denominated  in  currencies  of  major 
industrial countries. The Company may also enter into foreign 
currency  option  contracts  to  hedge  anticipated  transactions 
where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will 
materialize.  The  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  entered 
into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as 
cash-flow hedges and have varying maturities through the end of  
June  2019.  Hedge  effectiveness  of  foreign  currency  forward 
contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative methodology and 
excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spot-forward 
difference which is recorded in current-period earnings. Hedge 
effectiveness of foreign currency option contracts is based on a 
dollar offset methodology.

The Company may enter into interest rate forward contracts to 
hedge anticipated issuance of debt for periods consistent with 
the Company’s identified exposures. The purpose of the hedging 
activities is to minimize the effect of interest rate movements on the 
cost of debt issuance.

The  ineffective  portion  of  both  foreign  currency  forward  and 
interest rate derivatives is recorded in current-period earnings. For 
hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective, hedge 
accounting  is  discontinued  and  gains  and  losses  in  AOCI  are 
reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction 
occurs. If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no 
longer occur, then any gains or losses in AOCI are reclassified to 
current-period earnings. As of June 30, 2017, the Company’s foreign 
currency cash-flow hedges were highly effective.

At  June  30,  2017,  the  Company  had  foreign  currency  forward 
contracts in the amount of $2,895 million. The foreign currencies 
included  in  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  (notional 
value  stated  in  U.S.  dollars)  are  principally  the  British  pound  

($541 million), Swiss franc ($457 million), Hong Kong dollar ($355 
million), Euro ($295 million), Chinese yuan ($160 million), Canadian 
dollar ($148 million) and Thailand baht ($126 million).

At June 30, 2016, the Company had foreign currency forward 
contracts in the amount of $3,265 million. The foreign currencies 
included in foreign currency forward contracts (notional value 
stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Euro ($962 million), British 
pound ($497 million), Chinese yuan ($313 million), Hong Kong 
dollar ($274 million), Swiss franc ($256 million), Australian dollar 
($157 million) and Taiwan dollar ($130 million).

In April 2016, in anticipation of the issuance of the 2021 Senior 
Notes,  the  Company  entered  into  a  series  of  treasury  lock 
agreements,  which  were  designated  as  cash-flow  hedges.  In 
November 2016, in anticipation of the issuance of the 2027 and 
2047 Senior Notes, the Company entered into a series of treasury 
lock agreements, which were designated as cash-flow hedges, see 
Note 11 – Debt for further discussion.

The estimated net loss on the Company’s derivative instruments 
designated  as  cash-flow  hedges  as  of  June  30,  2017  that  is 
expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings, net of tax, 
within the next twelve months is $18 million. The accumulated 
gain (loss) on derivative instruments in AOCI was $(4) million and  
$50 million as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Fair-Value Hedges

The  Company  enters  into  interest  rate  derivative  contracts  to 
manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its funded 
indebtedness. The Company has interest rate swap agreements, 
with notional amounts totaling $250 million, $450 million and 
$250  million  to  effectively  convert  the  fixed  rate  interest  on 
its  2020  Senior  Notes,  2021  Senior  Notes  and  2022  Senior  
Notes, respectively, to variable interest rates based on three-month 
LIBOR plus a margin. These interest rate swap agreements are 
designated as fair-value hedges of the related long-term debt, and 
the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements 
are exactly offset by the change in the fair value of the underlying 
long-term debt.

88

Credit Risk

As a matter of policy, the Company enters into derivative contracts 
only with counterparties that have a long-term credit rating of 
at least A- or higher by at least two nationally recognized rating 
agencies. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial 
institutions. Exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance 
by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of 
contracts in asset positions, which totaled $13 million at June 30, 
2017. To manage this risk, the Company has strict counterparty 
credit  guidelines  that  are  continually  monitored.  Accordingly, 
management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts 
is remote.

NOTE 13 – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company records certain of its financial assets and liabilities 
at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received 
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in the principal or 
most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 
The accounting for fair value measurements must be applied to 

nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that require initial 
measurement or remeasurement at fair value, which principally 
consist  of  assets  and  liabilities  acquired  through  business 
combinations  and  goodwill,  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets 
and long-lived assets for the purposes of calculating potential 
impairment. The Company is required to maximize the use of 
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs that may be 
used to measure fair value are as follows:

Level 1: Inputs based on quoted market prices for identical assets 
or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date.

Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in 
Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in 
active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and 
liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are 
observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.

Level 3: Inputs reflect management’s best estimate of what market 
participants  would  use  in  pricing  the  asset  or  liability  at  the 
measurement date. The inputs are unobservable in the market and 
significant to the instrument’s valuation.

To determine the fair value of the RODIN olio lusso and Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle reporting units as of April 1, 2017, the Company 
used the average of the income approach, which utilizes estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects 
the relative risk of cash flows, and the market approach, which utilizes performance multiples based on market peers. For both reporting 
units, decreased cash flows in future forecasted periods would not support a value in excess of carrying value and therefore the Company 
concluded that $28 million of goodwill was impaired.

To determine the fair value of the RODIN olio lusso and Editions 
de  Parfums  Frédéric  Malle  trademarks  as  of  April  1,  2017,  the 
Company assessed the future performance of the reporting units 
and determined that decreased cash flows in future forecasted 
periods would not support the carrying values of the trademarks. 
The Company therefore concluded that the remaining carrying 
value  of  the  RODIN  olio  lusso  trademark  was  impaired.  The 
impairment charge for the Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle 
trademark  was  de  minimis.  The  fair  values  of  the  trademarks 
were determined utilizing a royalty rate to determine discounted 
projected future cash flows. An assessment related to the carrying 
value of the RODIN olio lusso customer relationship and persona 
intangible assets also led to the conclusion of full impairment.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate 
the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments for which it is 
practicable to estimate that value:

Cash and cash equivalents – Cash and all highly-liquid securities 
with original maturities of three months or less are classified as 
cash and cash equivalents, primarily consisting of cash deposits in 
interest bearing accounts, money market funds and time deposits. 
The carrying amount approximates fair value, primarily due to the 
short maturity of cash equivalent instruments.

Available-for-sale  securities  –  Available-for-sale  securities  are 
classified  within  Level  2  of  the  valuation  hierarchy  and  are 
valued using third-party pricing services, and for time deposits, 
the carrying amount approximates fair value. To determine fair  
value, the pricing services use market prices or prices derived 
from other observable market inputs such as benchmark curves,  
credit  spreads,  broker/dealer  quotes,  and  other  industry  and 
economic factors.

Foreign  currency  forward  contracts  –  The  fair  values  of  the 
Company’s foreign currency forward contracts were determined 
using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on an 
income approach. The significant observable inputs to the model, 
such as swap yield curves and currency spot and forward rates, 
were obtained from an independent pricing service. To determine 
the fair value of contracts under the model, the difference between 
the contract price and the current forward rate was discounted 
using  LIBOR  for  contracts  with  maturities  up  to  12  months,  
and  swap  yield  curves  for  contracts  with  maturities  greater  
than 12 months.

Interest rate swap contracts – The fair values of the Company’s 
interest rate swap contracts were determined using an industry-
standard  valuation  model,  which  is  based  on  the  income 
approach. The significant observable inputs to the model, such as 
treasury yield curves, swap yield curves and LIBOR forward rates, 
were obtained from independent pricing services.

Current and long-term debt – The fair value of the Company’s debt 
was estimated based on the current rates offered to the Company 
for debt with the same remaining maturities. To a lesser extent, 

debt also includes capital lease obligations for which the carrying 
amount  approximates  the  fair  value.  The  Company’s  debt  is 
classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

Additional purchase price payable – The Company’s additional 
purchase  price  payable  represents  fixed  minimum  additional 
purchase  price  that  was  discounted  using  the  Company’s 
incremental borrowing rate, which was approximately 1%. The 
additional purchase price payable is classified within Level 2 of the 
valuation hierarchy.

Contingent consideration – Contingent consideration obligations 
consist  of  potential  obligations  related  to  the  Company’s 
acquisitions in previous years. The amounts to be paid under these 
obligations are contingent upon the achievement of stipulated 
financial targets by the business subsequent to acquisition. The fair 
values of the contingent consideration related to certain acquisition 
earn-outs were estimated using a probability-weighted discount 
model that considers the achievement of the conditions upon 
which the respective contingent obligation is dependent (“Monte 
Carlo Method”).

The Monte Carlo Method has various inputs into the valuation 
model, in addition to the risk-adjusted projected future operating 
results of the acquired entities, which include the following ranges 
at June 30, 2017:

Risk-adjusted discount rate
Revenue volatility
Asset volatility
Revenue and earnings before income tax,

depreciation and amortization correlation 
coefficient factor

Revenue discount rates
Earnings before income tax, depreciation

and amortization discount rates

1.5% to 2.3%
3.7% to 8.5%
21.1% to 27.3%

80%
3.0% to 4.8%

10.7% to 13.1%

Significant changes in the projected future operating results would 
result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. 
Changes to the discount rates, volatilities or correlation factors 
would have a lesser effect. The implied rates are deemed to be 
unobservable  inputs  and,  as  such,  the  Company’s  contingent 
consideration is classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 

Changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  contingent  consideration 
obligations  for  the  year  ended  June  30,  2017  are  included  in 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying 
consolidated statements of earnings and were as follows:

In  June  2017,  the  Company  revised  and  approved  the  long-

the Company noted that for certain of its fiscal 2015 and 2016

Restoration Plan (U.S.)

The  Company  also  has  an  unfunded,  non-qualified  domestic 
noncontributory pension Restoration Plan to provide benefits in 
excess of Internal Revenue Code limitations.

International Pension Plans

The  Company  maintains  international  pension  plans,  the 
most  significant  of  which  are  defined  benefit  pension  plans.  
The Company’s funding policies for these plans are determined 
by local laws and regulations. The Company’s most significant 
defined  benefit  pension  obligations  are  included  in  the  plan 
summaries below.

Post-retirement Benefit Plans

The Company maintains a domestic post-retirement benefit plan 
which provides certain medical and dental benefits to eligible 
employees. Employees hired after January 1, 2002 are not eligible 
for  retiree  medical  benefits  when  they  retire.  Certain  retired 
employees who are receiving monthly pension benefits are eligible 
for participation in the plan. Contributions required and benefits 
received by retirees and eligible family members are dependent on 
the age of the retiree. It is the Company’s practice to fund a portion 
of  these  benefits  as  incurred  and  may  provide  discretionary 
funding for future liabilities up to the maximum amount deductible 
for income tax purposes.

Certain of the Company’s international subsidiaries and affiliates 
have post-retirement plans, although most participants are covered 
by government-sponsored or administered programs.

acquisitions, actual results and the most recent projections were 
lower during their respective earn-out measurement periods than 
the financial targets made at June 30, 2016 and it reassessed the 
likelihood of achieving those targets. As a result, the Company 
recognized  a  $57  million  gain  within  Selling,  general  and 
administrative expenses to reflect the adjusted fair value of its 
contingent consideration, primarily related to the acquisitions of 
GLAMGLOW, Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle and Le Labo 
as of June 30, 2017. The gain impacted the skin care and fragrance 
product categories by $24 million and $33 million, respectively, and 
the Americas and Europe, the Middle East & Africa regions by $43 
million and $14 million, respectively. The Company also considered 
whether the change in the financial projections impacted the fair 
values of the related reporting units and intangible assets, see  
Note 7 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for discussion of 
fiscal 2017 impairments.

NOTE 14 – PENSION, DEFERRED COMPENSATION 
AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

The Company maintains pension plans covering substantially all 
of its full-time employees for its U.S. operations and a majority of 
its international operations. Several plans provide pension benefits 
based primarily on years of service and employees’ earnings. In 
certain instances, the Company adjusts benefits in connection 
with international employee transfers.

Retirement Growth Account Plan (U.S.)

The  Retirement  Growth  Account  Plan  is  a  trust-based, 
noncontributory  qualified  defined  benefit  pension  plan.  
The Company seeks to maintain appropriate funded percentages. 
For  contributions,  the  Company  would  seek  to  contribute  an 
amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum 
required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 
1974 (“ERISA”), as amended, and subsequent pension legislation, 
and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible  
for income tax purposes.

The discount rate for each plan used for determining future net 
periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-
term bonds. The discount rate for the Company’s Domestic Plans 
is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds 
with  an  Aa  rating,  or  equivalent,  from  a  major  rating  agency.  
The Company used an above-mean yield curve which represents 
an  estimate  of  the  effective  settlement  rate  of  the  obligation, 
and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds 
included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated 
defined benefit payment streams of the Company’s Domestic 
Plans. For the Company’s international plans, the discount rate in 
a particular country was principally determined based on a yield 
curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in each 
country, with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching 
that particular plan. In determining the long-term rate of return for 
a plan, the Company considers the historical rates of return, the

The Company’s investment strategy for its pension and post-retirement plan assets is to maintain a diversified portfolio of asset classes 
with the primary goal of meeting long-term cash requirements as they become due. Assets are primarily invested in diversified funds that 
hold equity or debt securities to maintain the security of the funds while maximizing the returns within each plan’s investment policy.  
The investment policy for each plan specifies the type of investment vehicles appropriate for the plan, asset allocation guidelines, criteria for 
selection of investment managers and procedures to monitor overall investment performance, as well as investment manager performance. 

The Company’s target asset allocation at June 30, 2017 is as follows:

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used 
for plan assets measured at fair value:

Cash and Cash Equivalents – Cash and all highly-liquid securities 
with original maturities of three months or less are classified as 
cash and cash equivalents, primarily consisting of cash and time 
deposits. The carrying amount approximates fair value, primarily 
because of the short maturity of cash equivalent instruments.

Short-term investment funds – The fair values are determined using 
the Net Asset Value (“NAV”) provided by the administrator of the 
fund when the Company has the ability to redeem the assets at 
the measurement date. These assets are classified within Level 2 of 
the valuation hierarchy. For some assets the Company is utilizing 
the NAV as a practical expedient and those investments are not 
included in the valuation hierarchy.

Government  and  agency  securities  –  The  fair  values  are 
determined using third-party pricing services using market prices or 
prices derived from observable market inputs such as benchmark 
curves, broker/dealer quotes, and other industry and economic 
factors. These investments are classified within Level 2 of the 
valuation hierarchy.

Debt instruments – The fair values are determined using third-
party pricing services using market prices or prices derived from 
observable market inputs such as credit spreads, broker/dealer 
quotes,  benchmark  curves  and  other  industry  and  economic 
factors. These investments are classified within Level 2 of the 
valuation hierarchy.

Equity securities – The fair values are determined using the closing 
price reported on a major market where the individual securities 
are traded. These investments are classified within Level 1 of the 
valuation hierarchy.

Commingled funds – The fair values of publicly traded funds are 
based upon market quotes and are classified within Level 1 of the 
valuation hierarchy. The fair values for non-publicly traded funds 
are determined using the NAV provided by the administrator of 
the fund when the Company has the ability to redeem the assets 
at the measurement date. These assets are classified within Level 
2 of the valuation hierarchy. When the Company is utilizing the  
NAV as a practical expedient those investments are not included 
in  the  valuation  hierarchy.  These  investments  have  monthly 
redemption frequencies with redemption notice periods ranging 
from 10 to 30 days. There are no unfunded commitments related 
to these investments.

96

Insurance contracts – The fair values are based on negotiated 
value and the underlying investments held in separate account 
portfolios, as well as the consideration of the creditworthiness of 
the issuer. The underlying investments are primarily government, 
asset-backed and fixed income securities. Insurance contracts 
are generally classified as Level 3 as there are no quoted prices or 
other observable inputs for pricing.

Interests  in  limited  partnerships  and  hedge  fund  investments  – 
The  fair  values  are  determined  using  the  NAV  provided  
by  the  administrator  as  a  practical  expedient,  and  therefore 
these investments are not included in the valuation hierarchy.  
These  investments  have  monthly  and  quarterly  redemption 
frequencies with redemption notice periods ranging from 30 to 
90 days. Unfunded commitments related to these investments are 
de minimis.

401(k) Savings Plan (U.S.)

The  Company’s  401(k)  Savings  Plan  (“Savings  Plan”)  is  a 
contributory defined contribution plan covering substantially all 
regular U.S. employees who have completed the hours and service 
requirements, as defined by the plan document. Regular full-time 
employees are eligible to participate in the Savings Plan thirty 
days following their date of hire. The Savings Plan is subject to the 
applicable provisions of ERISA. The Company matches a portion 
of the participant’s contributions after one year of service under 
a predetermined formula based on the participant’s contribution 
level. The Company’s contributions were $39 million, $37 million 

97

and $35 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock are not an investment option in 
the Savings Plan and the Company does not use such shares to match participants’ contributions.

Deferred Compensation

The Company has agreements with certain employees and outside directors who defer compensation. The Company accrues for such 
compensation, and either interest thereon or for the change in the value of cash units. The amounts included in the accompanying 
consolidated balance sheets under these plans were $75 million and $71 million as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The expense for 
fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $6 million, $6 million and $9 million, respectively.

(1) Includes long-term and current debt and the related projected interest costs, and to a lesser extent, capital lease commitments. Interest costs on long-term and current debt 
in fiscal 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and thereafter are projected to be $123 million, $117 million, $117 million, $108 million, $101 million and $1,645 million, respectively. Projected 
interest costs on variable rate instruments were calculated using market rates at June 30, 2017.

(2) Minimum operating lease commitments only include base rent. Certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception and primarily include rents based 
on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated levels, as well as common area maintenance. These amounts are excluded from minimum operating lease commitments and are 
included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably measurable. Such amounts have not been 
material to total rent expense. Total rental expense included in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings was $457 million, $442 million and $402 million in fiscal 2017, 
2016 and 2015, respectively. In July 2017, the Company entered into new lease commitments for its principal offices at the same location. The Company’s rental obligations under 
the new leases will commence in fiscal 2020 and expire in fiscal 2040. Minimum lease obligations pursuant to the leases in fiscal 2020, 2021, 2022 and thereafter are $5 million, 
$24 million, $32 million and $597 million, respectively.

(3) Unconditional purchase obligations primarily include: inventory commitments, additional purchase price payable and contingent consideration which resulted from the fiscal 
2016 and 2015 acquisitions, earn-out payments related to the acquisition of Bobbi Brown, royalty payments pursuant to license agreements, advertising commitments, capital 
improvement commitments, non-discretionary planned funding of pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations and commitments pursuant to executive compensation 
arrangements. Future contingent consideration, earn-out payments and royalty and advertising commitments were estimated based on planned future sales for the term that was 
in effect at June 30, 2017, without consideration for potential renewal periods.

(4) Refer to Note 9 – Income Taxes for information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. As of June 30, 2017, the noncurrent portion of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits, 
including related accrued interest and penalties was $73 million. At this time, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of the unrecognized tax benefits, including related 
accrued interest and penalties, cannot be determined and therefore was not included.

Legal Proceedings

The Company is involved, from time to time, in litigation and other 
legal proceedings incidental to its business. Management believes 
that the outcome of current litigation and legal proceedings will 
not have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s results 
of  operations,  financial  condition  or  cash  flows.  However, 
management’s assessment of the Company’s current litigation and 
other legal proceedings could change in light of the discovery of 

facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending 
against the Company, not presently known to the Company or 
determinations by judges, juries or other finders of fact which are 
not in accord with management’s evaluation of the possible liability 
or outcome of such litigation or proceedings. Reasonably possible 
losses in addition to the amounts accrued for litigation and other 
legal proceedings are not material to the Company’s consolidated 
financial statements.

NOTE 17 – STOCK PROGRAMS

As  of  June  30,  2017,  the  Company  has  two  active  equity 
compensation plans which include the Amended and Restated 
Fiscal 2002 Share Incentive Plan (the “Fiscal 2002 Plan”) and the 
Amended and Restated Non-Employee Director Share Incentive 
Plan (collectively, the “Plans”). These Plans currently provide for the 
issuance of approximately 76.8 million shares of Class A Common 
Stock, which consist of shares originally provided for and shares 
transferred to the Fiscal 2002 Plan from other inactive plans and 
employment agreements, to be granted in the form of stock-based 
awards to key employees, consultants and non-employee directors 
of the Company. As of June 30, 2017, approximately 11.9 million 
shares of Class A Common Stock were reserved and available to 
be granted pursuant to these Plans. The Company may satisfy the 
obligation of its stock-based compensation awards with either new

(1) The intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option.

The exercise period for all stock options generally may not exceed 
ten years from the date of grant. Stock option grants to individuals 
generally become exercisable in three substantively equal tranches 
over a service period of up to four years. The Company attributes 
the value of option awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite 
service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if 
the award was, in substance, multiple awards.

The  Company  uses  a  weighted-average  expected  stock-price 
volatility assumption that is a combination of both current and 
historical implied volatilities of the underlying stock. The implied 
volatilities were obtained from publicly available data sources. 
For the weighted-average expected option life assumption, the 
Company considers the exercise behavior for past grants and 

100

models  the  pattern  of  aggregate  exercises.  The  average  risk-
free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury strip rate for the 
expected term of the options and the average dividend yield is 
based on historical experience.

Restricted Stock Units

The Company granted approximately 1.6 million RSUs during fiscal 
2017 which, at the time of grant, were scheduled to vest as follows: 
0.5 million in fiscal 2018, 0.5 million in fiscal 2019, 0.5 million in 
fiscal 2020 and 0.1 million in fiscal 2022. Vesting of RSUs granted 
is generally subject to the continued employment of the grantees. 
RSUs are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights, payable 
upon settlement of the RSU either in cash or shares (based on the 
terms of the particular award) upon settlement of the RSU and, as 
such, were valued at the closing market price of the Company’s 
Class A Common Stock on the date of grant.

The following is a summary of the status of the Company’s RSUs 
as of June 30, 2017 and activity during the fiscal year then ended:

During fiscal 2017, the Company granted PSUs with a target payout 
of approximately 0.3 million shares with a grant date fair value 
per share of $89.47, which will be settled in stock subject to the 
achievement of the Company’s net sales, diluted net earnings per 
common share and return on invested capital goals for the three 

fiscal years ending June 30, 2020, all subject to the continued 
employment or retirement of the grantees. In January 2017, the 
Company granted PSUs with a target payout of approximately 
0.3 million shares with a grant date fair value per share of $80.79, 
which  will  be  settled  in  stock  subject  to  the  achievement  of 
certain net sales and net operating profit goals of a subsidiary of 
the Company for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020. In January 
2017, the Company also granted PSUs with a target payout of 
approximately 0.2 million shares with a grant date fair value per 
share  of  $80.79,  which  will  be  settled  in  stock  subject  to  the 
achievement of certain net sales and net operating profit goals of a 
subsidiary of the Company for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022.

Settlement  of  all  PSUs  will  be  made  pursuant  to  a  range  of 
opportunities  relative  to  the  target  goals  and,  as  such,  the 
compensation cost of the PSU is subject to adjustment based upon 
the attainability of these target goals. No settlement will occur for 
results below the applicable minimum threshold of a target and 
additional  shares  shall  be  issued  if  performance  exceeds  the 
targeted performance goals. PSUs are accompanied by dividend 
equivalent rights that will be payable in cash upon settlement of 
the PSU and, as such, were valued at the closing market value 
of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. 
These awards are subject to the provisions of the agreement under 
which the PSUs are granted. The PSUs generally vest at the end 
of the performance period. Approximately 0.2 million shares of 
Class A Common Stock are anticipated to be issued, relative to 
the target goals set at the time of issuance, in settlement of the 
0.3 million PSUs that vested as of June 30, 2017. In September 
2016, approximately 0.3 million shares of the Company’s Class 
A Common Stock were issued and related accrued dividends 
were paid, relative to the target goals set at the time of issuance, 
in settlement of 0.3 million PSUs which vested as of June 30, 2016.

Performance Share Units Based  
on Total Stockholder Return

During fiscal 2013, the Company granted PSUs to an executive of 
the Company with an aggregate target payout of 162,760 shares 
of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, subject to continued 
employment through the end of the relative performance periods 
of June 30, 2015, 2016, and 2017. Settlement of the PSUs are based 

upon the Company’s relative total stockholder return (“TSR”) over 
the relevant performance period as compared to companies in the 
S&P 500 on July 1, 2012. The PSUs are accompanied by dividend 
equivalent rights that will be payable in cash upon settlement. 
The grant date fair value of the PSUs of $11 million was estimated 
using  a  lattice  model  with  a  Monte  Carlo  simulation  and  the 
following assumptions for each performance period, respectively: 
contractual life of 33, 45 and 57 months, average risk-free interest 
rate of 0.3%, 0.5% and 0.7% and a dividend yield of 1.0%. Using 
the historical stock prices and dividends from public sources, the 
Company estimated the covariance structure of the returns on S&P 
500 stocks. The volatility for the Company’s stock produced by 
this estimation was 32%. The average risk-free interest rate is based 
on the U.S. Treasury strip rates over the contractual term of the 
grant, and the dividend yield is based on historical experience.

Through June 30, 2017, 92,431 shares of the Company’s Class A 
Common Stock were issued, and related dividends were paid, in 
accordance with the terms of the grant, related to the performance 
periods  ended  June  30,  2016  and  2015.  In  August  2017,  an 
additional 30,267 shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock 
are anticipated to be issued, and related dividends to be paid, in 
accordance with the terms of the grant, related to the performance 
period ended June 30, 2017.

Long-term Performance Share Units

During  September  2015,  the  Company  granted  PSUs  to  an 
executive of the Company with an aggregate target payout of 
387,848 shares (in three tranches of approximately 129,283 each) 
of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, generally subject to 
continued employment through the end of relative performance 
periods,  which  end  June  30,  2018,  2019  and  2020.  Since  the 
Company  achieved  positive  Net  Earnings,  as  defined  in  the 
PSU award agreement, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, 
performance and vesting of each tranche will be based on the 
Company  achieving  positive  Cumulative  Operating  Income, 
as  defined  in  the  PSU  award  agreement,  during  the  relative 
performance period. Payment with respect to a tranche will be 
made on the third anniversary of the last day of the respective 
performance period. The PSUs are accompanied by dividend 
equivalent rights that will be payable in cash at the same time as 
the payment of shares of Class A Common Stock. The grant date 
fair value of these PSUs of $30 million was estimated using the 
closing stock price of the Company’s Class A Common Stock as of 
September 4, 2015, the date of grant.

During January 2016, the Company granted PSUs to an executive 
of  the  Company  with  an  aggregate  target  payout  of  71,694 
shares  (in  three  tranches  of  23,898  each)  of  the  Company’s 
Class A Common Stock. Since the Company achieved positive 
Net Earnings, as defined in the PSU award agreement, for the 
fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, the vesting of each tranche will 
generally be subject to continued employment through the end 

101

of relative service periods that end on January 29, 2018, 2019 and 
2020. Payment with respect to a tranche will be made within 30 
business days of the date on which the PSUs vest. The PSUs are 
accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that will be payable in 
cash at the same time as the payment of shares of the Company’s 
Class A Common Stock. The grant date fair value of these PSUs 
of $6 million was estimated using the closing stock price of the 
Company’s Class A Common Stock as of January 28, 2016, the 
date of grant.

Share Units

The Company grants share units to certain non-employee directors 
under the Amended and Restated Non-Employee Director Share 
Incentive  Plan.  The  share  units  are  convertible  into  shares  of 
the Company’s Class A Common Stock as provided for in that 
plan. Share units are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights  
that are converted to additional share units when such dividends 
are declared.

The  following  is  a  summary  of  the  status  of  the  Company’s 
share units as of June 30, 2017 and activity during the fiscal year  
then ended:

Cash Units

Certain  non-employee  directors  defer  cash  compensation  in 
the form of cash payout share units, which are not subject to the 
Plans. These share units are classified as liabilities and, as such, 
their fair value is adjusted to reflect the current market value of 
the Company’s Class A Common Stock. The Company recorded 
$2 million, $2 million and $3 million as compensation expense to 
reflect additional deferrals and the change in the market value for 
fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

NOTE 18 – NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. PER COMMON SHARE

Net earnings attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. per common share (“basic EPS”) is computed by dividing net earnings 
attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and contingently issuable 
shares (which satisfy certain conditions). Net earnings attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. per common share assuming dilution 
(“diluted EPS”) is computed by reflecting potential dilution from stock-based awards.

A reconciliation between the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations is as follows:

As of June 30, 2017, there were 1.8 million stock options excluded from the computation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would be 
anti-dilutive. As of June 30, 2016, there were 0.2 million stock options excluded from the computation of diluted EPS because their inclusion 
would be anti-dilutive. As of June 30, 2015, there were no anti-dilutive stock options to be excluded from the computation of diluted EPS. 
As of June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 1.0 million, 0.5 million and 0.6 million, respectively, of PSUs have been excluded from the calculation of 
diluted EPS because the number of shares ultimately issued is contingent on the achievement of certain performance targets of the Company, 
as discussed in Note 17 – Stock Programs.

NOTE 21 – SEGMENT DATA  
AND RELATED INFORMATION

Reportable  operating  segments  include  components  of  an 
enterprise about which separate financial information is available 
that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker 
(the  “Chief  Executive”)  in  deciding  how  to  allocate  resources 
and in assessing performance. As a result of the similarities in the 
manufacturing, marketing and distribution processes for all of  
the Company’s products, much of the information provided in 
the consolidated financial statements is similar to, or the same as,  
that reviewed on a regular basis by the Chief Executive. Although 
the  Company  operates  in  one  business  segment,  beauty 
products, management also evaluates performance on a product  
category basis.

While the Company’s results of operations are also reviewed on a 
consolidated basis, the Chief Executive reviews data segmented on 
a basis that facilitates comparison to industry statistics. Accordingly, 
net sales, depreciation and amortization, and operating income 
are available with respect to the manufacture and distribution of 
skin care, makeup, fragrance, hair care and other products. These 
product categories meet the definition of operating segments 
and, accordingly, additional financial data are provided below.

The  “other”  segment  includes  the  sales  and  related  results  of 
ancillary products and services that do not fit the definition of skin 
care, makeup, fragrance and hair care.

Product category performance is measured based upon net sales 
before returns associated with restructuring and other activities, 
and  earnings  before  income  taxes,  interest  expense,  interest 
income  and  investment  income,  net,  and  charges  associated 
with  restructuring  and  other  activities.  Returns  and  charges 
associated with restructuring and other activities are not allocated 
to  the  product  categories  because  they  result  from  activities 
that are deemed a Company-wide initiative to redesign, resize 
and  reorganize  select  corporate  functions  and  go-to-market 
structures, and to transform and modernize the Company’s GTI. 
The accounting policies for the Company’s reportable segments 
are the same as those described in the summary of significant 
accounting policies, except for depreciation and amortization 
charges, which are allocated, primarily, based upon net sales. The 
assets and liabilities of the Company are managed centrally and 
are reported internally in the same manner as the consolidated 
financial statements; thus, no additional information is produced 
for the Chief Executive or included herein.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (including its subsidiaries) (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining 
adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). 

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records 
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally 
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations 
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, 
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision of and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company’s management 
conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria 
established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission. Based on this assessment, the Company’s management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2017, the Company’s internal control 
over financial reporting was effective.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2017 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an 
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears under the heading “Report of Independent Registered 
Public Accounting Firm.”

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.:

We have audited The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and subsidiaries’ (“the Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 
2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial 
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s 
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over 
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those 
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial 
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe 
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations 
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, 
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial 
reporting as of June 30, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated 
balance sheets of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements 
of earnings, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2017 and our 
report dated August 25, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and subsidiaries (“the Company”)  
as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows 
for each of the years in the three year period ended June 30, 2017. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements,  
we also have audited the financial statement schedule as listed on the index on page 32. These consolidated financial statements and financial 
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated 
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States).  
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free 
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as 
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of  
The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for 
each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our 
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, 
present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We  also  have  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States),  
The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2017, based on criteria established  
in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 
(COSO), and our report dated August 25, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control  
over financial reporting.

Performance Graph

The following graph compares the cumulative five-year total stockholder return (stock price appreciation plus dividends) on the Company’s 
Class A Common Stock with the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 Index, the S&P Consumer Staples Index and a market weighted index 
of a publicly traded peer group. The returns are calculated by assuming an investment of $100 in the Class A Common Stock and in each 
index on June 30, 2012.

The publicly traded companies included in our previous peer group are: Avon Products, Inc., Beiersdorf AG, L’Oreal S.A., LVMH Moët 
Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.A., The Procter & Gamble Company and Shiseido Company, Ltd. After The Procter & Gamble Company divested 
substantially all of its prestige beauty brands, our Company reviewed its use of this peer group. Beginning in fiscal 2017, the Company is using 
the S&P Consumer Staples Index to provide for a broader relative comparison.

THE EST{E LAUDER COMPANIES INC. 2017 ANNUAL REPORT ENVIRONMENTAL FIGURES

The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. 2017 Annual Report is printed on paper that is made with certified renewable electricity 
and is Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC®) Certified, ensuring all papers come from responsibly managed forests.  
Paper used in the financial section is made with 100% post-consumer recycled fiber (PCRF), Green Seal™ Certified and 
Carbon Neutral Plus, all of which ensure a reduction in carbon emissions and demonstrate a commitment to conserve 
the environment.
The coated paper in the Annual Report is Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF), a technique that uses chlorine dioxide for the 
bleaching of wood pulp. It does not use elemental chlorine gas during the bleaching process and prevents the formation 
of dioxin. The paper made with 100% PCRF is Processed Chlorine Free (PCF), recycled paper in which the recycled 
 content is unbleached or bleached without chlorine or chlorine derivatives.

Combined savings from using 5,885 lbs of paper made with 100% PCRF and 5,535 lbs of paper made with  
20% PCRF to produce this report: 

26,183 lbs wood 

 A total of 88 trees, which supply enough oxygen for 44 people annually.

17 trees 
 

 PCRF displaces wood fiber with savings translated as trees.
(Assumes a mix of hardwoods and softwoods 6” to 8” in diameter and 40’ tall.)

36,835 gal water 

 Enough water to take 2,203 eight-minute showers. 

7,485 gal waste water 
 

 PCRF content eliminates wastewater produced by processing equivalent virgin fiber. 
(Swimming pools —1 Olympic-sized swimming pool holds 660,430 gallons.)

492 lbs solid waste  

 

 PCRF content eliminates solid waste generated through the pulp and paper  
manufacturing process. 
(Garbage trucks —1 fully loaded garbage truck weighs an average of 28,000 lbs.)

2,220 lbs solid waste  

 Solid waste trash thrown away by 495 people in a single day.

6.79 million BTU 
 

 PCRF content displaces energy used to process equivalent virgin fiber. 
 (Homes per year — The average US household uses 91 million BTUs of energy in a year.)

25 min BTUs energy 

 Enough energy to power an average American household for 103 days. 

8,189 lbs emissions  

 Carbon sequestered by 65 tree seedlings grown for 5 years. 

Reduction of emissions derived from using paper made with 100% renewable energy:

5,614 lbs 

6,882 lbs 
(1 cars/year) 
 
 

 Combined amount of CO2, SO2, and NOx not emitted.

Greenhouse Gas Reduction — PCRF content reduces greenhouse gas emissions (measured 
in CO2 equivalents) that would be generated by equivalent virgin fiber production. 
Purchasing green power significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions, as well.
(Cars per year — the average car emits 11,013 pounds of CO2 in a year.)

Savings of these greenhouse gas emissions are equivalent to:

2,906 hours 

744 hours  

3,474 lbs  

 Number of kilowatt-hours of electricity offset by  
purchase of renewable energy.

Total continuous electricity used by a single-family home.

Amount of waste recycled instead of disposed in landfills.

Sandy Alexander Inc., an ISO 14001:2004 certified printer with FSC® Chain-of-Custody Certification, printed this report 
with the use of 100% certified renewable wind power sources, which benefit the environment by preventing emissions 
of greenhouse gases. 

Reduction of emissions from printing using wind-generated electricity:
2,858 lbs of CO2 not emitted.

This amount of wind-generated electricity is equivalent to: 
2,480 miles not driven in an automobile or 195 trees being planted.
