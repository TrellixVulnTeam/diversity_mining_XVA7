A Message from Our Chairman

Our Valued Shareholders, 

Thanks to our employees and customers, PPG delivered  
a solid performance in 2017. As I travel to PPG facilities 
around the world, I am always impressed by our 
people and their focus on strengthening our 
company, serving our customers’ needs, and 
bringing life to our purpose and promise:

We protect and beautify the world.

with more than $1.2 billion returned 
in 2017 through share repurchases 
and dividends. We take great pride 
in having paid annual dividends for 
118 consecutive years, including a  
13 percent per-share increase last 
July that marked 46 consecutive 
years of increased per share 
payouts.

PPG maintained excellent financial 
flexibility with cash and short-term 
investments of about $1.5 billion  
at year-end.

We have committed to deploy a 
minimum of $2.4 billion of cash 
in 2018 on acquisitions and 
share repurchases as part of our 
previously communicated target 
to deploy $3.5 billion in 2017 and 
2018 combined. 

(continued next page)

This focus, which begins with the 
performance of our business, 
was a key to our success in 2017. 
With the dedication of our 47,000 
employees and the trust of our 
customers, we have continued  
to strengthen our position as a 
global leader in the paint and 
coatings industry. 

PPG in 2017 delivered adjusted 
earnings diluted per share 
growth; we continued to 
aggressively manage costs; and 
we completed the multi-year 
strategic transformation of our 
business portfolio by divesting 
our North American fiber glass 
business. Today, PPG is entirely 
focused on innovating paints, 
coatings and specialty materials 
to deliver growth and value in our 
business. We further strengthened 
our portfolio by completing four 
acquisitions during the year.

We have also continued our legacy 
of returning cash to shareholders, 

Michael H. McGarry 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

A Message from Our Chairman

135 years of heritage, committed to the future 
As we begin 2018, our 135th year in operation, the focus on our purpose has never been stronger and 
extends beyond the economic boundaries of our business to ensure the long-term sustainability of 
PPG. There is no better example than the investments we are making in communities where we operate. 
Recently, I was privileged to join PPG’s top 100 global leaders at an elementary school in Miami to truly 
personalize our mission. As part of PPG’s COLORFUL COMMUNITIES® initiative, we painted murals, 
brightened the school’s library and cafeteria, and created an outdoor learning classroom. It was a 
special opportunity to help the school create a brighter, more vibrant learning environment.

Supporting communities 
PPG and the PPG Foundation collaborate with our employees and 
community partners to breathe continuous life into our mission: We 
protect and beautify the world. We dedicate financial resources, 
apply our products and use the power of our passionate employee-
volunteers to address the needs of communities – and to help 
transform lives in the process. 
Through the Colorful Communities initiative and other community 
engagement programs, we invested more than $10.5 million in 
2017, supporting hundreds of organizations across 29 countries. 
Committed volunteers contribute their time and apply PPG paint 
products to help transform community assets – from painting 
classrooms, to bringing color to a maternity ward and redesigning a 
playground. Since 2015, PPG has completed more than 125 Colorful 
Communities projects, improving life for more than 4 million people. 
I encourage you to visit ppg.com to view our videos that show how 
these projects positively impact the many children and their families.

Enduring commitment to innovation  
and sustainability
Our commitment to innovation is intertwined with growth and 
sustainability. It covers a wide range of products and services that 
provide environmental, safety and other benefits to our customers. 
Our products contribute to lighter, more fuel-efficient vehicles, 
airplanes and ships, and they help our customers reduce their 
energy consumption, conserve water and reduce waste.  
Our technologies are helping manufacturers to protect their assets 
and products from corrosion, and we are sharing those technologies 
across our businesses. 
Our goal is to achieve 25 percent of total sales from products 
introduced in the last four years. In 2017, we invested nearly $500 
million in research and development. Examples include PPG’s 
award-winning waterborne technologies, our compact painting 
process for vehicles, and new coatings for lithium batteries needed 
for electric cars.

Emerging opportunities 
We’re continuously focused on emerging trends, working alongside customers 
to create innovative solutions. We’re embracing new ways of thinking and trying 
new approaches. A prime example is our newly formed mobility team, which 
is focused on developing and commercializing growth opportunities in the 
emerging, global market for autonomous and electric vehicles. We are preparing 
for a future of shared and connected vehicles. In addition, we are leveraging 
digital initiatives across our businesses. We are focused on the future and 
constantly preparing to take advantage of evolutions in our markets. 

Growing long-term value with sustainable business practices
PPG’s culture of continuous improvement underpins our approach and 
commitment to sustainability. Whether it’s increasing the efficiency of our 
operations or developing our people, our improvement efforts naturally extend to 
many areas that impact our sustainability performance.
Our employees continued to enhance and strengthen our sustainable operations. 
During the year, we recognized more than 200 projects through our internal 
sustainability awards initiative. These projects, which we estimate saved more 
than $17 million, helped us reduce our energy consumption, waste, water use and 
emissions. 
As PPG’s portfolio has continued to evolve, we are evaluating our business and 
striving to achieve even more. With the release of our Corporate Sustainability 
Report in April 2018, we will announce new, aggressive goals that will guide our 
company in increasing the use of sustainable business practices.

A Message from Our Chairman

The value of diverse perspectives 
One of PPG’s greatest strengths is the diversity of our people, 
who represent wide-ranging nationalities, cultures, languages, 
religions, ethnicities, lifestyles and professional and educational 
backgrounds. PPG’s ongoing diversity and inclusion efforts 
begin at the highest levels of our company. We are proud of the 
diversity represented in our 11-member board of directors. Our 
board plays an instrumental role in our focus, strategic direction 
and path forward.
Through extensive, new recruiting and hiring efforts, we 
are committed to attracting, hiring and retaining future 
generations of diverse and talented employees. In 2017, we 
achieved a 100-percent score on the Human Rights Campaign 
Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index and were recognized by 
Forbes Magazine on its list of “World’s Best Employers.” 
We firmly believe that our company and communities benefit 
when we provide equal opportunities for diverse suppliers to 
compete for our business. So through a variety of supplier-
diversity programs, we seek out small businesses and 
businesses owned by veterans, minorities and women that 
provide quality products and services at competitive prices.
Looking forward, we are well-positioned to benefit from 
continued global economic growth because of our 
geographic reach; robust growth strategy; excellent product 
portfolio, innovation and advanced customer technologies; 
transformational leadership; and enduring commitments to 
sustainability, ethics and community engagement.
Thank you for your continued investment and belief in PPG as 
we continue our mission: We protect and beautify the world.

 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
Below are our key financial results from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017:
•  Net sales were $14.8 billion, up 3% from the prior year, driven primarily by higher sales volumes and acquisition-related 

sales.

•  Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization increased 7% to $8.2 billion, driven primarily by raw material 

cost inflation, higher sales volumes and higher cost of sales from acquired businesses.

•  Selling, general and administrative expenses of $3.6 billion were slightly lower compared to the prior year.
• 

Income before income taxes was $2,008 million up $1.2 billion year-over-year, due to the absence of pension settlement 
charges related to the purchase of group annuity contracts and a business restructuring charge.

•  Net income from continuing operations was $1,371 million and earnings per diluted share was $5.32.
•  Adjusted net income from continuing operations was $1,513 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share was $5.87.
•  Cash and short-term investments were approximately $1.5 billion at year-end.
•  Cash from operating activities - continuing operations was $1,556 million.
•  Capital expenditures for modernization, productivity and regulatory improvements was $360 million.
•  Cash used for business acquisitions (net of cash acquired), was $325 million.
•  The Company raised the per-share dividend by 13%, paid approximately $434 million in dividends and also repurchased 

$813 million of its outstanding common stock.

•  The Company expects to deploy at least $3.5 billion for acquisitions and share repurchases during 2017 and 2018 

combined, with $1.1 billion deployed in 2017.

•  The 2017 effective tax rate was 30.7%, which includes a $134 million net charge related to the enactment of the U.S. 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This net charge is $37 million higher than the net charge included in PPG’s fourth quarter earnings 
release and Form 8-K furnished on January 18, 2018, primarily due to new IRS regulations issued and refinements of 
the Company’s estimates. While the Company has made a preliminary assessment of the new legislation’s impact on 
PPG, U.S. regulatory agencies will be issuing further regulations and clarifying interpretations over 2018 which could 
alter the Company’s conclusions regarding the impact of the new law. Further, PPG may continue to refine its estimates 
to incorporate new or better information as it comes available. The Company’s adjusted effective tax rate was 24.4%.

For further information and a full discussion and analysis of business performance for the years ended December 31, 2017, 
2016, and 2015 and a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K.

Part I
Item 1. Business 
PPG Industries, Inc., manufactures and distributes a broad range of paints, coatings and specialty materials. PPG was 
incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1883. PPG’s vision is to be the world’s leading coatings company by consistently delivering 
high-quality, innovative and sustainable solutions that customers trust to protect and beautify their products and surroundings.  
PPG’s business is comprised of two reportable business segments: Performance Coatings and Industrial Coatings. 
In September 2017, PPG completed the sale of its North American fiber glass business, which represents the culmination 
of a multi-year strategic shift in the Company's business portfolio, resulting in the exit of all glass operations. Accordingly, all 
historical information has been recast to present the Glass segment as discontinued operations and assets held for sale. 
Refer to Note 2, “Acquisitions and Divestitures” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information relating to this transaction.
Performance Coatings and Industrial Coatings
PPG is a major global supplier of coatings. The Performance Coatings and Industrial Coatings reportable business segments 
supply coatings and specialty materials to customers in a wide array of end-use markets, including industrial equipment and 
components,  packaging  material;  aircraft  and  marine  equipment;  automotive  original  equipment  (“automotive  OEM”); 
automotive refinish; as well as for other industrial and consumer products. PPG also serves commercial and residential new 
build and maintenance markets by supplying coatings to painting and maintenance contractors and directly to consumers 
for decoration and maintenance. The coatings industry is highly competitive and consists of several large firms with global 
presence and many smaller firms serving local or regional markets. PPG competes in its primary markets with the world’s 
largest coatings companies, most of which have global operations, and many smaller regional coatings companies.

Technology innovation has been a hallmark of PPG’s success throughout its history. The Company seeks to optimize its 
investment in research and development to create new products to drive profitable growth. We align our product development 
with the macro trends in the end-use markets we serve and leverage core technology platforms to develop products for 
unmet market needs. Our history of successful technology introductions is based on a commitment to an efficient and effective 
innovation process and disciplined portfolio management. We have obtained government funding for a small portion of the 
Company’s research efforts, and we will continue to pursue government funding where appropriate.
PPG owns and operates several facilities to conduct research and development for new and improved products and processes. 
In addition to the Company’s centralized principal research and development centers (See Item 2. “Properties” of this Form 
10-K), operating segments manage their development through centers of excellence. As part of our ongoing efforts to manage 
our formulations and raw material costs effectively, we operate a global competitive sourcing laboratory in China. Because 
of the Company’s broad array of products and customers, PPG is not materially dependent upon any single technology 
platform.
Raw Materials and Energy
The effective management of raw materials and energy is important to PPG’s continued success. The Company’s most 
significant raw materials are epoxy and other resins, titanium dioxide and other pigments, and solvents in the coatings 
businesses and sand and soda ash for the specialty coatings and materials business. Coatings raw materials, which include 
both organic, primarily petroleum based, materials and inorganic materials, including titanium dioxide, comprise between 
70% and 80% of the Company’s cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization, in most coatings formulations and 
represent PPG’s single largest production cost component. 
Most of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources, and the Company has made, 
and plans to continue to make, supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future. Supply of 
critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts, multiple sources, and identifying alternative materials 
or technology whenever possible. Our products use both petroleum-derived and bio-based materials as part of a product 
renewal strategy. While prices for these raw materials typically fluctuate with energy prices, such fluctuations are impacted 
by the fact that the manufacture of our raw materials is several steps downstream from crude oil and natural gas. 
The Company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to broaden our supply of high quality raw materials. These 
initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply, including suppliers from Asia and other lower cost regions 
of the world, adding on-site resin production at certain manufacturing locations and a reduction in the amount of titanium 
dioxide used in our product formulations. 
Our global efforts to reduce titanium dioxide consumption have been successful to date and are expected to continue. Titanium 
dioxide is a raw material widely used in the paint and coatings industry as a pigment to provide hiding, durability and whiteness 
characteristics. PPG purchases both sulfate-grade and chloride-grade titanium dioxide from suppliers for use in coatings 
formulations. The Company has undertaken a strategic initiative to secure and enhance PPG’s supply of titanium dioxide, 
as well as to minimize PPG’s use of this raw material. PPG possesses intellectual property and expertise in the production 
and finishing of titanium dioxide pigment. PPG intends to continue to leverage this technology and intends to develop innovative 
supply solutions through technical collaborations, joint ventures and licensing arrangements with other interested parties. 
We are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the registration of chemicals which could potentially impact the 
availability  and  viability  of  some  of  the  raw  materials  we  use  in  our  production  processes.  Our  ongoing  global  product 
stewardship efforts are directed at maintaining our compliance with these standards.
Changes to chemical registration regulations have been proposed or implemented in the EU and many other countries, 
including China, Canada, the United States (U.S.), and Korea. Because implementation of many of these programs has not 
been finalized, the financial impact cannot be estimated at this time. We anticipate that the number of chemical registration 
regulations will continue to increase globally, and we have implemented programs to track and comply with these regulations.
Given the recent volatility in certain energy-based input costs and foreign currencies, the Company is not able to predict with 
certainty the 2018 full year impact of related changes in raw material pricing; however, PPG currently expects overall coatings 
raw material costs to increase a mid-single-digit percentage in the first half of 2018, with impacts varied by region and 
commodity. Further, given the distribution nature of many of our businesses, logistics and distribution costs are sizable, as 
are wages and benefits but to a lesser degree. PPG typically experiences fluctuating prices for energy and raw materials 

12 

 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

driven by various factors, including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories, global industry activity levels, foreign 
currency exchange rates, government regulation, and global supply and demand factors. In aggregate, average raw material 
cost inflation rose by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2017 versus 2016, driven mostly by supply related factors including an 
unusually high number of supplier force majeure events in Europe, Chinese environmental regulation enforcement and severe 
hurricanes in the U.S. In addition, oil prices moved much higher in the second half of 2017 also contributing to raw material 
inflation.

PPG considers patent protection to be important; however, the Company’s operating segments are not materially dependent 
upon any single patent or group of related patents. 
Backlog
In general, PPG does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders. Production and inventory levels are geared 
primarily to projections of future demand and the level of incoming orders.
Global Operations
PPG has a significant investment in non-U.S. operations. This broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance 
of economic impacts occurring in any one region on PPG’s total net sales and income from continuing operations. As a result 
of our expansion outside the U.S., we are subject to certain inherent risks, including economic and political conditions in 
international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. During 2017, favorable foreign currency translation 
increased net sales by approximately $55 million and decreased income from continuing operations by $7 million.
Our net sales in the developed and emerging regions of the world for the years ended December 31st are summarized below:

Refer to Note 19, “Reportable Business Segment Information” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for geographic information 
related to PPG’s property, plant and equipment, and for additional geographic information pertaining to sales. 
Seasonality 
PPG’s income from continuing operations has typically been greater in the second and third quarters and cash from operating 
activities has been greatest in the fourth quarter due to end-use market seasonality, primarily in PPG’s architectural coatings 
businesses. Demand for PPG’s architectural coatings products is typically the strongest in the second and third quarters due 
to higher home improvement, maintenance and construction activity during the spring and summer months in the U.S., 
Canada and Europe. The Latin America paint season is the strongest in the fourth quarter. These cyclical activity levels result 
in the collection of outstanding receivables and lower inventory on hand in the fourth quarter generating higher cash from 
operating activities.
Employee Relations
The average number of people employed worldwide by PPG during 2017 was about 47,200. The Company has numerous 
collective bargaining agreements throughout the world. We observe local customs, laws and practices in labor relations when 
negotiating collective bargaining agreements. There were no significant work stoppages in 2017. While we have experienced 
occasional work stoppages as a result of the collective bargaining process and may experience some work stoppages in the 
future, we believe that we will be able to negotiate all labor agreements on satisfactory terms. To date, these work stoppages 
have not had a significant impact on PPG’s results of operations. Overall, the Company believes it has good relationships 
with its employees. 
Environmental Matters
PPG is committed to operating in a sustainable manner and to helping our customers meet their sustainability goals. Our 
sustainability efforts are led by the Technology and Environment Committee of our Board of Directors and our Sustainability 
Committee, which is comprised of members of PPG’s senior management team. The Sustainability Committee establishes 

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      13

policies, programs, procedures and goals to address sustainability in our business practices, including resource management, 
climate change, innovation, communications, purchasing, manufacturing and employee wellness. 

Our dedication to innovation is intertwined with sustainability. Once again in 2017, we increased the percent of our sales 
from sustainable products. We are marketing an ever-growing variety of products and services that provide environmental, 
safety and other benefits to our customers. Our products contribute to lighter, more fuel-efficient vehicles, airplanes and 
ships, and they help our customers reduce their energy consumption, conserve water and reduce waste. These products 
include a compact automotive paint process that saves energy and reduces water usage; sustainable, waterborne coatings 
formulations; lightweight sealants and coatings for aircraft; coatings that cool surfaces; and solutions for autonomous and 
battery-powered vehicles. 

Public and governmental concerns related to climate change continue to grow, leading to efforts to limit the greenhouse gas 
(“GHG”) emissions believed to be responsible. While PPG has operations in many countries, a substantial portion of PPG’s 
GHG emissions are generated by locations in the U.S. where considerable legislative and regulatory activity has been taking 
place. PPG has, and will continue to, annually report our global GHG emissions to the voluntary Carbon Disclosure project.
PPG participates in both the U.S. Department of Energy, BETTER BUILDINGS®, BETTER PLANTS® program, formerly the 
SAVE  ENERGY  NOW®  Leadership  program,  and  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  ENERGY  STAR®  Industrial 
Partnership program, both reinforcing the company’s voluntary efforts to significantly reduce its industrial energy intensity. 
These programs include developing and implementing energy management processes and setting energy savings targets 
while providing a suite of educational, training, and technical resources to help meet those targets. Recognizing the continuing 
importance of this matter, PPG has a senior management group with a mandate to guide the Company’s progress in this 
area. 
Our commitment to sustainability continues to yield tangible results. In 2017, we again made significant progress reducing 
our energy intensity, greenhouse gas emissions intensity, water usage intensity and waste intensity. More information about 
PPG’s sustainability values, efforts, goals and data and our community and employee engagement programs can be found 
in our Sustainability Report and on our sustainability website at http://sustainability.ppg.com and on the Carbon Disclosure 
Project’s website at www.cdp.net. 

PPG is subject to existing and evolving standards relating to protection of the environment. In management’s opinion, the 
Company operates in an environmentally sound manner and is well positioned, relative to environmental matters, within the 
industries in which it operates. PPG is negotiating with various government agencies concerning 126 current and former 
manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations, including 24 sites on the National Priority List. While PPG is not 
generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations, each potentially responsible party may face 
governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability. Generally, however, a final allocation of costs is made based 
on relative contributions of wastes to the site. There is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites, due largely 
to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to be employed for their 
remediation. The Company has established reserves for onsite and offsite remediation of those sites where it is probable 
that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. 
The Company’s experience to date regarding environmental matters leads it to believe that it will have continuing expenditures 
for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at 
waste and plant sites. Management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time.
In addition to the $258 million currently reserved for environmental remediation efforts, we may be subject to loss contingencies 
related to environmental matters estimated to be approximately $100 million to $200 million. These reasonably possible 
unreserved losses relate to environmental matters at a number of sites, none of which are individually significant. The loss 
contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at 
these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them.

It is expected that expenditures for such projects in 2018 will be in the range of $10 million to $20 million. Although future 
capital expenditures are difficult to estimate accurately because of constantly changing regulatory standards and policies, it 
can be anticipated that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance will 
increase.
Management believes that the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on 
PPG’s financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular 
period in which costs, if any, are recognized. See Note 13, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” under Item 8 of this

Item 1A. Risk Factors
As a global manufacturer of paints, coatings and specialty materials, we operate in a business environment that includes 
risks. These risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past nor are they unlike risks faced by our competitors. 
Each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity. 
While the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors, no such list should be considered to be a 
complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which 
may adversely affect our businesses and our results of operations.
Increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results.
Our financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials. Coatings raw materials, which include both organic, 
primarily petroleum based, materials and inorganic materials, including titanium dioxide, comprise between 70% and 80% 
of the Company’s cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, sold in most coatings formulations and represent 
PPG’s single largest production cost component.
While not our customary practice, we also import raw materials and intermediates, particularly for use at our manufacturing 
facilities in the emerging regions of the world. In most cases, those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and, 
therefore, if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility, our margins may be lower.
Most of our raw materials are purchased from outside sources, and the Company has made, and plans to continue to make, 
supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future. Adequate supply of critical raw materials is 
managed by establishing contracts, procuring from multiple sources, and identifying alternative materials or technology 
whenever possible. The Company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to effectively broaden our supply of high 
quality raw materials. These initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply, including suppliers from Asia 
and other lower cost regions of the world, adding on-site resin production at certain manufacturing locations, and a reduction 
in the amount of titanium dioxide and other raw materials used in our product formulations. Our products use both petroleum-
derived and bio-based materials as part of a product renewal strategy.
An inability to obtain critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products. Increases in the cost of 
raw materials may have an adverse effect on our income from continuing operations or cash from operating activities in the 
event we are unable to offset these higher costs in a timely manner. 
Refer to Item 1. “Raw Materials and Energy” of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the current year trends and outlook in raw 
material and energy costs.
The pace of economic growth and level of uncertainty could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
and cash flows. 
During 2017, economic conditions improved in all of our major geographical regions while remaining mixed by end-use 
market. PPG provides products and services to a variety of end-use markets in many geographies. This broad end-use 
market exposure and expanded geographic presence lessens the significance of any individual decrease in activity levels; 
nonetheless, lower demand levels may result in lower sales, which would result in reduced income from continuing 
operations and cash from operating activities. 
Refer to Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-
K for discussion of the economic conditions in 2017 and our outlook on certain economic conditions in 2018.
We are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment.
Environmental laws and regulations control, among other things, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the 
handling, use, treatment, storage and clean-up of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, the investigation and remediation 

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      15

of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances, and regulate various health and safety matters. The environmental 
laws and regulations we are subject to impose liability for the costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up current sites, 
past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances. Violations of these laws and regulations can also result 
in fines and penalties. Future environmental laws and regulations may require substantial capital expenditures or may require 
or cause us to modify or curtail our operations, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition 
and results of operations.
As  described  in  Note  13,  “Commitments  and  Contingent  Liabilities,”  under  Item 8  of  this  Form  10-K,  we  are  currently 
undertaking environmental remediation activities at a number of our current and former facilities and properties, the cost of 
which is substantial. In addition to the amounts currently reserved, we may be subject to loss contingencies related to 
environmental matters estimated to be as much as $100 million to $200 million. Such unreserved losses are reasonably 
possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence.
We are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims, in which 
substantial monetary damages are sought.
PPG is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, in which substantial monetary damages are 
sought. Those lawsuits and claims relate to contract, patent, environmental, product liability, asbestos exposure, antitrust, 
employment and other matters arising out of the conduct of PPG’s current and past business activities. Any such claims, 
whether with or without merit, could be time consuming, expensive to defend and could divert management’s attention and 
resources. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential claims, and the levels of insurance we do 
maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses. We believe that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all current 
lawsuits and claims involving PPG, including those described in Note 13, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” under 
Item 8 of this Form 10-K, will not have a material effect on PPG’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, such 
outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. Nonetheless, 
the results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable, and such outcomes could have a material adverse 
effect on our results of operations, cash from operating activities or financial condition.
Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results.
We earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar. 
Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses into 
U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period, as well as assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at 
exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar 
against other currencies will affect our net sales, net income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign 
currencies. We may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
related  to  foreign  currency  transactions.  However,  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  particularly  the 
strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies, could adversely or positively affect our financial 
condition and results of operations expressed in U.S. dollars. In 2017, changes in the U.S. dollar versus our mix of currencies 
had a favorable impact on full year net sales and an unfavorable impact on income before income taxes from the translation 
of foreign earnings into U.S. dollars of approximately $55 million and $7 million, respectively.
We are subject to a variety of complex U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations which could increase our compliance 
costs.
We are subject to a wide variety of complex U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations, and legal compliance risks, including 
securities laws, tax laws, environmental laws, employment and pension-related laws, competition laws, U.S. and foreign 
export and trading laws, and laws governing improper business practices, including bribery. We are affected by new laws 
and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations, as well as interpretations by courts and regulators. These 
laws and regulations effectively expand our compliance obligations and potential enforcement actions by governmental 
authorities or litigation related to them.
New laws and regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their interpretation could increase our compliance 
costs. For example, regulations concerning the composition, use and transport of chemical products continue to evolve. 
Developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact the availability or viability of some of the raw materials 
we use in our product formulations and/or our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets. Import/export 
regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased compliance costs, slower product movements or additional 
complexity in our supply chains.
Our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results.
PPG has a significant investment in global operations. This broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of 
economic impacts occurring in any one region. Notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification, our ability to achieve 
and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and 

16 

 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries. As a result of our operations outside the U.S., we are 
subject to certain inherent risks, including political and economic uncertainty, inflation rates, exchange rates, trade protection 
measures,  local  labor  conditions  and  laws,  restrictions  on  foreign  investments  and  repatriation  of  earnings,  and  weak 
intellectual  property  protection.  Our  percentage  of  sales  generated  in  2017  by  products  sold  outside  the  U.S.  was 
approximately 62%.
Changes in the tax regimes and related government policies and regulations in the countries in which we operate 
could adversely affect our results and our effective tax rate.
As a multinational corporation, we are subject to various taxes in both the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. Due to economic 
and political conditions, tax rates in these various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our future effective 
income tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes 
in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. In December 2017, the U.S. enacted the 
U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act. While the Company has made a preliminary assessment of the new legislation’s impact on PPG, 
U.S. regulatory agencies will be issuing further regulations and clarifying interpretations over the next year which could alter 
the Company’s conclusions regarding  the impact of the new law. Further, PPG may continue to refine its estimates to 
incorporate new or better information as it comes available. Recent developments, including the European Commission’s 
investigations on illegal state aid as well as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development project on Base 
Erosion and Profit Shifting may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective 
tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. If our effective income tax rate was to increase, our cash from operating activities, 
financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.
Although we believe that our tax filing positions are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be 
different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. If future audits find that additional taxes 
are due, we may be subject to incremental tax liabilities, possibly including interest and penalties, which could have a material 
adverse effect on our cash from operating activities, financial condition and results of operations.
Business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
Unexpected events, including supply disruptions, temporary plant and/or power outages, work stoppages, natural disasters 
and severe weather events, computer system disruptions, fires, war or terrorist activities, could increase the cost of doing 
business or otherwise harm the operations of PPG, our customers and our suppliers. It is not possible for us to predict the 
occurrence or consequence of any such events. However, such events could reduce our ability to supply products, reduce 
demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products 
to customers.
Integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations. 
Part of the Company’s strategy is growth through acquisitions. Over the last decade, we have successfully completed more 
than 50 acquisitions and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future. 
Growth through acquisitions and the formation of joint ventures involve risks, including:

•  difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and products into our existing business;
•  delays in realizing the benefits from the acquired companies or products;
•  diversion of our management’s time and attention from other business concerns;
•  difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new markets we may enter;
•  unforeseen claims and liabilities, including unexpected environmental exposures or product liability;
•  unexpected losses of customers or suppliers of the acquired or existing business;
•  difficulty in conforming the acquired business’ standards, processes, procedures and controls to those of our 

operations; and

•  difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired businesses.

These risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and joint ventures could cause 
delays in realizing the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could adversely affect our results of 
operations, cash from operating activities or financial condition. 

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      17

Our ability to understand our customers’ specific preferences and requirements, and to innovate, develop, produce 
and market products that meet customer demand is critical to our business results. 
Our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop 
and sell products that appeal to customers. This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to produce products 
that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising 
and marketing programs. 
We  believe  the  automotive  industry  will  experience  significant  and  continued  change  in  the  coming  years. Vehicle 
manufacturers continue to develop new safety features such as collision avoidance technology and self-driving vehicles that 
may reduce vehicle collisions in the future, potentially lowering demand for our refinish coatings. In addition, through the 
introduction  of  new  technologies,  new  business  models  or  new  methods  of  travel,  such  as  ridesharing,  the  number  of 
automotive OEM new-builds may decline, potentially reducing demand for our automotive OEM coatings.
Our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to innovate our existing products and to develop and introduce new 
products. If we fail to keep pace with product innovation on a competitive basis or to predict market demands for our products, 
our businesses, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
The industries in which we operate are highly competitive.
With each of our businesses, an increase in competition may cause us to lose market share, lose a large regional or global 
customer, or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive, which could result in reduced margins for our products. 
Competitive pressures may not only reduce our margins but may also impact our revenues and our growth which could 
adversely affect our results of operations.
The security of our information technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect our ability 
to operate. 
Increased global information technology security requirements, threats and sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose 
a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Despite our efforts 
to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data, our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security 
breaches. This could lead to negative publicity, theft, modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information, 
manufacture of defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which could adversely affect our 
reputation, competitiveness and results of operations.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings
PPG is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against 
others,  in  which  substantial  monetary  damages  are  sought. These  lawsuits  and  claims  may  relate  to  contract,  patent, 
environmental, product liability, asbestos exposure, antitrust, employment and other matters arising out of the conduct of 
PPG’s current and past business activities. To the extent that these lawsuits and claims involve personal injury and property 
damage, PPG believes it has adequate insurance; however, certain of PPG’s insurers are contesting coverage with respect 
to some of these claims, and other insurers may contest coverage. PPG’s lawsuits and claims against others include claims 
against insurers and other third parties with respect to actual and contingent losses related to environmental, asbestos and 
other matters.
The results of any future litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable. However, management believes that, in the 
aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving PPG, including asbestos-related claims, will not have a material 
effect on PPG’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, such outcome may be material to the results of operations 
of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized.
For many years, PPG has been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos. 
For a description of asbestos litigation affecting the Company, see Note 13, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” under 
Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
In the past, the Company and others have been named as defendants in several cases in various jurisdictions claiming 
damages related to exposure to lead and remediation of lead-based coatings applications. PPG has been dismissed as a 
defendant from most of these lawsuits and has never been found liable in any of these cases.
In March 2016, the Natural Resource Trustees for the Calcasieu River Estuary (the United States Department of the Interior, 
acting through the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the United 
States Department of Commerce, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the Louisiana Department of 
Wildlife and Fisheries) reached an agreement in principle with PPG and two other potentially responsible parties to resolve 
the Trustees’ claims for natural resource damages alleged to have been caused by the release of hazardous substances 
into the Estuary. In the fourth quarter of 2017, PPG signed a consent decree prepared by the US Department of Justice for 
settlement of potential natural resource damage claims at the Calcasieu River Estuary. PPG’s share of this settlement is 
$3.6 million. Payment of PPG’s share of the settlement is required to be made into an escrow account within 30 days of filing 
the agreement with the court and is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2018.

Part II
Item 5. Market for the Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases 
of Equity Securities
The information required by Item 5 regarding market information, including stock exchange listings and quarterly stock market 
prices, dividends and holders of common stock is included in Exhibit 13.1 filed with this Form 10-K and is incorporated herein 
by reference. This information is also included in the PPG Shareholder Information on page 4 of the Annual Report to 
shareholders.
Directors who are not also officers of the Company may receive common stock equivalents pursuant to the PPG Industries, 
Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors (“PPG Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors”). Common stock equivalents 
are hypothetical shares of common stock having a value on any given date equal to the value of a share of common stock. 
Common stock equivalents earn dividend equivalents that are converted into additional common stock equivalents but carry 
no voting rights or other rights afforded to a holder of common stock. The common stock equivalents credited to directors 
under this plan are exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 as private offerings made 
only to directors of the Company in accordance with the provisions of the plan.
Under the PPG Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors, each director may elect to defer the receipt of all or any portion 
of the compensation paid to such director for serving as a PPG director. All deferred payments are held in the form of common 
stock equivalents. Payments out of the deferred accounts are made in the form of common stock of the Company (and cash 
as to any fractional common stock equivalent). The directors, as a group, were credited with 14,007; 17,807; and 15,445 
common stock equivalents in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, under this plan. The values of the common stock equivalents, 
when credited, ranged from $95.25 to $115.89 in 2017; $95.63 to $116.07 in 2016, and $90.13 to $98.73 in 2015.

Net sales from acquired businesses, net of divestitures, added over $200 million of sales in 2017, primarily MetoKote, 
DEUTEK, Univer and The Crown Group.
U.S. and Canada sales volumes declined slightly year-over-year, with mixed demand by business and end-use market 
segment. Sales volumes in architectural coatings U.S. company-owned stores grew by a mid-single-digit percentage, but 
were more than offset by sales volumes declines in the independent dealer networks and national retail (DIY) customer 
accounts in aggregate. Automotive OEM coatings sales volumes declined year-over-year and lagged industry demand 
levels due to a customer-driven market-share shift away from PPG that was offset in other regions of the world. These 
decreases in sales volumes were partially offset by higher sales volumes in specialty coatings and materials, automotive 
refinish coatings, general industrial coatings, aerospace coatings and packaging coatings.
EMEA sales volumes increased a low-single-digit percentage versus the prior year. Sales volumes in our automotive OEM 
coatings and aerospace coatings businesses each grew by a mid-single-digit percentage. Specialty coatings and materials 
sales volumes grew by a double-digit percentage, driven by strong silica demand. Protective coatings volumes also grew 
year-over-year. These increases in sales volumes were partially offset by lower demand in architectural coatings.
Asia Pacific sales volumes expanded by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year led by growth in each business within 
the Industrial Coatings segment along with sales volume growth in the architectural coatings business. These increases in 
sales volumes were partially offset by lower demand in marine coatings year-over-year. From a country and sub-region 
perspective, sales volumes grew in India, China, and Southeast Asia versus the prior year. Korea sales volumes continued 
to decline year-over-year primarily due to continued weakness in new shipbuilding.
Latin America sales volumes expanded by a mid-single-digit percentage versus the prior year primarily due to above market 
growth in our automotive OEM coatings and general industrial coatings businesses. The automotive OEM coatings growth 
was driven by industry production expansion with the opening of new assembly facilities in Mexico. Regional sales volumes 
were lower in architectural coatings versus the prior year primarily due to lower sales volumes in Brazil and in Mexico due 
to the impact of the natural disasters during the third quarter.

 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

Net sales increased $29 million due to the following:

2016 vs. 2015

Partially offset by:

Acquired  businesses  added  approximately  $310  million  of  sales  in  2016,  primarily  due  to  the  partial  year  sales  from 
businesses acquired in 2015, including Revocoat, IVC Industrial Coatings, Le Joint Francais and Cuming Microwave, as 
well as the 2016 acquisitions of MetoKote and Univer.
Sales volume growth, excluding acquisition related sales, grew 1% led by growth in Asia Pacific and EMEA, while U.S. and 
Canada sales volumes as a percentage of sales, declined modestly.
U.S. and Canada sales volumes declined a low-single-digit percentage year-over-year, with mixed demand by business 
and end-use market segment. Sales volumes in architectural coatings company-owned stores grew by a mid-single-digit 
percentage, but were more than offset by sales volumes declines in the independent dealer networks and several national 
retail (DIY) customer accounts. Automotive OEM coatings sales volumes declined year-over-year, in large-part due to lower 
industry production. These decreases in sales volumes were partially offset by higher sales volumes in automotive refinish 
coatings and packaging coatings.
EMEA sales volumes increased a low-single-digit percentage versus the prior year. Sales volumes in our automotive OEM 
coatings and general industrial coatings businesses each grew by a mid-single-digit percentage, above market. Specialty 
coatings and materials sales volumes grew by a mid-single-digit percentage, driven by silica demand. These increases in 
sales volumes were partially offset by modestly lower demand in architectural coatings.
Asia Pacific sales volumes expanded by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year led by growth in each business within 
the Industrial Coatings segment. These increases in sales volumes were partially offset by lower demand in marine coatings 
year-over-year. From a country and sub-region perspective, sales volumes grew in India, China, and Southeast Asia versus 
the prior year. Korea sales volumes declined year-over-year primarily due to continued weakness in new shipbuilding.
Latin America sales volumes expanded by a low-to-mid-single-digit percentage versus the prior year primarily due to above 
market growth in our architectural coatings, automotive OEM coatings and general industrial coatings businesses. 
Unfavorable foreign currency translation reduced net sales by approximately $385 million as the U.S. dollar strengthened 
against most foreign currencies year-over-year, notably the British pound, the Mexican peso, and the Chinese yuan.

Interest expense, net of Interest income
Interest expense, net of interest income decreased $14 million in 2017 versus 2016 primarily due to lower interest rate 
debt outstanding during 2017. Interest expense, net of Interest income increased $13 million in 2016 versus 2015 as 
interest income decreased year-over-year due to lower interest rates and lower average cash deposits on hand. 
Business restructuring
In 2016, PPG recorded a pre-tax business restructuring charge of $195 million. During 2017, PPG realized approximately 
$50 million of cost savings related to restructuring actions. Once fully implemented, the total annual savings run rate is 
expected to be approximately $125 million. Refer to Note 7, "Business Restructuring" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional 
information. 
In 2015, PPG recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $136 million, of which about 85% represented employee severance 
and other cash charges. As of December 31, 2016, substantially all actions have been completed.

24 

 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

Pension settlements
During 2017, PPG made lump-sum payments to certain retirees who had participated in PPG's U.S. qualified and non-
qualified pension plans totaling approximately $127 million. As the lump-sum payments were in excess of the expected 2017 
service and interest costs for the affected plans, PPG remeasured the periodic benefit obligation of these plans in the period 
payments were made and recorded settlement charges totaling $60 million ($38 million after-tax) during 2017. 
During 2016, PPG permanently transferred approximately $1.8 billion of its U.S. and Canadian pension obligations and 
assets to several highly rated insurance companies. These actions triggered remeasurement and partial settlement of certain 
of the Company’s defined benefit pension plans. PPG recognized a $968 million pre-tax settlement charge in connection 
with these transactions. Refer to Note 12, "Employee Benefit Plans" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. 
Other charges
Other charges in 2017 were lower than 2016 due to the absence of environmental charges and certain asset write-downs. 
In 2016, Other charges were higher than in 2015 due to environmental charges of $82 million. These charges were principally 
for environmental remediation at a former chromium manufacturing plant and associated sites in New Jersey. 
Other income
Other income was higher in 2017 than in 2016 primarily due to the gain from the sale of the Mexican Plaka business of $25 
million. Other income in 2016 was higher than in 2015 due to gains totaling $46 million resulting from the sale of a PPG 
legacy  U.S.  automotive  glass  and  services  business  and  a  U.S.  business  affiliate,  higher  equity  earnings  from  a  2017 
acquisition of a 40% interest in a joint venture and was partially offset by the absence of certain business transaction-related 
gains.

The effective tax rate for the year-ended December 31, 2017 was 30.7% and increased 3.1% from the prior year primarily 
due to recording the net charge triggered by the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This charge is approximately 
$37 million higher than the net charge included in PPG’s fourth quarter earnings release and Form 8-K furnished on January 
18, 2018, primarily due to new IRS regulations issued and refinements of management estimates.
As reported, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased year-
over-year, primarily due to the absence of the pension settlement charge of $616 million after-tax recorded in 2016. Refer 
to the Regulation G Reconciliations - Results of Operations for additional information. The Company’s earnings per diluted 
share and adjusted earnings per diluted share both benefited from the 7.4 million, 10.7 million and 7.0 million shares of stock 
repurchased in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Regulation G Reconciliations - Results of Operations
PPG Industries believes investors’ understanding of the company’s operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure 
of net income, earnings per diluted share and the effective tax rate adjusted for certain charges. PPG’s management 
considers this information useful in providing insight into the company’s ongoing operating performance because it excludes 
the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on a quarterly basis or that are not attributable to our 
primary operations. Net income and earnings per diluted share adjusted for these items are not recognized financial 
measures  determined  in  accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP)  and  should  not  be 
considered a substitute for net income or earnings per diluted share or other financial measures as computed in accordance 
with U.S. GAAP. In addition, adjusted net income, earnings per diluted share and the effective tax rate may not be 
comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies.

Performance Coatings net sales increased (2%) due to the following:

2017 vs. 2016

Partially offset by:

Selling prices increased year-over-year primarily due to selling price initiatives across all businesses to combat accelerating 
raw material cost inflation.
Architectural coatings - Americas and Asia Pacific sales volumes declined a low-single-digit-percentage versus the prior 
year. Sales volumes increased by a mid-single-digit percentage in company-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada, including 
the unfavorable impact from natural disasters in the third quarter 2017. This increase was more than offset by sales volume 
declines  in  the  U.S.  and  Canada  independent  dealer  networks  and  national  retail  (DIY)  customer  accounts,  as  both 
distribution channels continued to experience soft demand. Organic sales improved in both the Latin America and Asia 
Pacific regions.
Architectural  coatings  -  EMEA  net  sales  increased  by  a  high-single-digit  percentage  year-over-year,  primarily  due  to 
acquisition-related sales, principally DEUTEK and Univer, which contributed approximately $85 million to net sales. Sales 
volumes were down year-over-year primarily driven by continued weak demand in France and eastern Europe, as well as 
our turning away certain business due to low profitability or lack of customer acceptance of selling price increases. Demand 
growth continued in Northern Europe, where we continued to outperform the market. 
Automotive refinish coatings organic sales grew by a low-single-digit percentage year-over-year, led by above-market 
performance in U.S. and Canada as customers continued to adopt PPG’s industry leading technologies. Organic sales also 
increased in the Latin American region versus the prior year, reflecting high end-use market demand. In Asia Pacific, net 
sales increased, largely due to the recent Futian Xinshi acquisition in China.
Aerospace  coatings  sales  volumes  grew  by  a  low-single-digit  percentage  versus  the  prior  year, led  by  above  market 
performance in Europe and consistent with the overall industry demand.
Protective and marine coatings sales volumes declined by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year. Protective coatings 
sales  volumes  expanded  in  most  regions,  led  by  Europe,  but  were  more  than  offset  by  significant  weakness  in  new 
shipbuilding activity, primarily in the Asia Pacific region.
Segment income increased $9 million (1%) year-over-year primarily due to selling price increases, lower overhead and 
manufacturing costs, including the initial benefits from business restructuring actions, partially offset by increasing raw 
material costs, wage and other cost inflation, and lower sales volumes.

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      27

2016 vs. 2015

Performance Coatings net sales decreased (2%) due to the following:
 Unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately $260 million (3%), most notably the Mexican peso, the British 
pound, the Chinese yuan and the euro.
Partially offset by:
 Net sales from acquisitions (+1%)
Architectural coatings - Americas and Asia Pacific organic sales were flat versus the prior year. In the U.S. and Canada, 
sales volumes advanced in the company-owned store channel versus the prior year, mainly due to recent growth-related 
investments and initiatives. The increase in the company-owned stores channel was more than offset by sales volume 
declines  in  national  retail  (DIY)  accounts  and  U.S.  independent  dealer  channel  year-over-year,  despite  DIY  channel 
strengthening in the second half of 2016. Latin America organic sales were up year-over-year, led by Mexico which grew 
at more than double the Mexican GDP growth rate.
Architectural coatings - EMEA sales volumes were flat year-over-year. Growth in western Europe was offset by reduced 
demand levels in central Europe and in Africa, where economies are closely linked to depressed commodity prices. 
Acquisition-related sales from Univer in Italy added about $10 million in the fourth quarter 2016.
Automotive refinish coatings organic sales grew at a low-single-digit percentage rate year-over-year, outperforming end-
use market demand levels in the U.S. and Canada and Asia Pacific, as customers continued to adopt PPG’s industry leading 
technologies.
Aerospace coatings sales volumes increased modestly year-over-year, in line with industry growth rates. Sales growth 
occurred in all major regions. 
Protective and marine coatings net sales volumes declined a low-to-mid-single-digit-percentage year-over-year as growth 
in protective coatings was offset by declines in marine coatings, primarily due to lower shipbuilding activity in the Asia 
Pacific region and the ongoing impact of decreased capital investment and maintenance in the oil and gas sector. 
Protective coatings sales volumes grew versus the prior year, led by the U.S. and Canada and Latin America regions, 
including benefits from expanded distribution through the PPG-Comex concessionaire network.
Segment income increased $12 million (+1%) primarily due to the benefits from prior year business restructuring initiatives, 
modestly  higher  selling  prices,  lower  manufacturing  costs,  acquisition-related  income  (Cumings  Microwave,  Le  Joint 
Francais, Univer), partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and higher growth-related spending in the U.S. 
architectural coatings business. Segment income margins expanded, increasing 40 basis points year-over-year.
Looking Ahead
In the first quarter 2018, we expect sales volumes in the architectural coatings - Americas and Asia Pacific business to be 
seasonally lower than the fourth quarter 2017. In addition, overall volume trends by customer channel are anticipated to be 
consistent with the fourth quarter 2017. The PPG TIMELESS® product, launched in certain HOME DEPOT® stores in 2017, 
is projected to continue to meet our sales targets and is being expanded to more locations during 2018. We also anticipate 
additional growth-related spending of up to $5 million in the first quarter to support the continued momentum in the region. 
The volume growth trend for architectural coatings - EMEA is expected to improve modestly in the first quarter 2018, with 
results remaining uneven by country. We expect continued, high end-use demand in our automotive refinish coatings business 
as  customers  continue  to  adopt  PPG’s  industry  leading  technologies.  In  aerospace  coatings,  we  anticipate  continued 
improvement in industry demand growth. The protective and marine coatings business is expected to perform in-line with 
the market in the first quarter 2018. 
We expect raw material costs to remain elevated in the first-quarter 2018 at similar levels experienced in the fourth quarter. 
Further selling price increases in 2018 will be needed to offset more recent raw material inflation. There will be no material 
benefit from acquisition-related sales in the segment, and, based on mid-January exchange rates, foreign currency translation 
is expected to have a similar sequential favorable impact on segment sales and income in the first quarter 2018. 
Due to the timing of the Easter holiday, there is one fewer ship day in the first-quarter 2018 compared to first-quarter 2017, 
which is expected to unfavorably impact global architectural coatings sales volumes by about $20 million to $25 million in 
net sales. This unfavorable impact will reverse in the second quarter.

Industrial Coatings segment net sales increased (6%) due to the following:

2017 vs. 2016

Partially offset by:

PPG’s automotive OEM coatings sales volumes increased by a low-single-digit percentage versus the prior year, consistent 
with the global automotive industry production growth rate, led by China, Mexico, Europe and Brazil. Sales volumes declined 
in the U.S. and Canada, partially reflecting fewer automotive new builds.
General industrial coatings and specialty coatings and materials sales volumes, in aggregate, grew by a mid-single-digit 
percentage year-over-year. Sales volumes grew year-over-year in every major region with mixed demand by end-use market 
and geography. This growth was led by Asia Pacific and the U.S., which outpaced regional industrial production demand 
growth. Sales volumes grew across most sub-segments, including year-over-year increases in electronics materials, heavy 
duty equipment and organic light emitting diode (OLED) materials. Acquisition-related sales, primarily MetoKote, added 
approximately $155 million.
Packaging coatings sales volumes grew by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year, primarily driven by ongoing industry 
conversions to PPG’s new can coatings technologies, led by the U.S.
Segment income decreased $70 million (-7%) year-over-year primarily due to increasing raw material costs, lower selling 
prices and wage and other cost inflation. These cost increases were partially offset by income from higher sales volumes, 
lower manufacturing and overhead costs, including the initial benefits from business restructuring actions, and acquisition-
related income.

Industrial Coatings segment net sales increased (4%) due to the following:

2016 vs. 2015

Partially offset by:

British pound, the Chinese yuan and the euro.
 Lower selling prices (1%)

PPG’s automotive OEM coatings  business sales volumes increased  a low-single-digit-percentage  over the prior year, 
consistent with global automotive industry production growth. PPG's sales volumes differed by region, led by year-over-
year growth in Europe and Asia Pacific, while U.S. and Canada sales volumes lagged industry demand levels due to a 
customer-driven market-share shift away from PPG that was offset in other regions of the world.
General industrial coatings and specialty coatings and materials sales volumes, in aggregate, increased a mid-single-digit 
percentage year-over-year. Sales volume growth was led by Asia Pacific and EMEA, and was driven by strong end-market 
demand for automotive components, electronic materials, and coil and extrusion products. Latin America sales volumes 
advanced moderately, while volumes in the U.S. and Canada declined modestly.
Packaging  coatings  sales  volumes  were  up  a  mid-to-high  single-digit  percentage  year-over-year,  primarily  driven  by 
continued strong sales growth momentum related to the adoption of PPG's new can coatings technologies. This above 
market sales volume growth was led by U.S. and Canada and Asia Pacific regions.
Segment income increased $57 million (+6%) primarily due to lower manufacturing costs, higher sales volumes, acquisition-
related income (MetoKote, IVC Industrial Coatings, Revocoat) and the benefits from prior year restructuring initiatives, 
partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and modestly lower selling prices. PPG experienced higher 
transportation and logistics costs required to meet increasing customer demand in Asia. Segment income margins continued 
to improve, increasing 30 basis points year-over-year.

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      29

Looking ahead
In the first quarter of 2018, we expect global automotive industry production growth to be about 1% led by Europe and Mexico. 
In China, automotive production is expected to modestly decrease in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting the expiration of a 
small engine subsidy that had been in effect the past several years. We anticipate solid general industrial demand growth 
trends to continue in aggregate, but remain mixed by geography and end-use market. PPG’s market outperformance is 
expected to continue. In our packaging coatings business, we anticipate volume growth will continue due to the ongoing 
industry conversion to BPA non-intent interior can coatings, with PPG’s year-over-year growth rates continuing at an above 
market level in 2018. We expect acquisition-related sales to add approximately $30 million to first quarter 2018 segment 
sales and, based on mid-January exchange rates, foreign currency translation is expected to have a similar sequential 
favorable impact on segment sales and income in the first quarter 2018. 
Segment margin recovery continues to be a priority for 2018. Based on recent raw material inflation, segment margin recovery 
is expected to continue through the first half of 2018. All businesses in the segment have made progress with selling price 
initiatives and additional price increases have been announced for early 2018. Also, efforts to reduce costs remain a key 
focus in 2018. 
Review and Outlook
During 2017, economic conditions improved in all of our major geographical regions while remaining mixed by end-use 
market. PPG’s aggregate organic sales grew 1.5% versus the prior year and were higher in the second half of 2017 compared 
to the first half of 2017. Acquisition-related sales from two acquisitions completed in 2016 and the four completed in 2017 
contributed over 1% to net sales growth year-over-year. Foreign currency translation was modestly favorable to net sales 
year-over-year. Favorable foreign currency translation experienced in the second half of 2017 slightly offset unfavorable 
impacts during the first half of the year. Raw material inflation rose by a mid-single-digit percentage driven mostly by supply 
related  factors,  including  an  unusual  high  number  of  supplier  force  majeure  events  in  Europe,  government  mandated 
production curtailments in China to help improve pollution, and severe hurricanes in the U.S. In addition, oil prices moved 
sharply higher in the second half of the year also contributing to raw material inflation. 
U.S. and Canada
During 2017, the pace of economic activity improved in the U.S. and Canada region versus the prior year, with higher industrial 
production despite lower automotive industry builds. Demand in the residential and commercial construction markets were 
modestly higher in 2017 compared to 2016. New home starts advanced about 2% in 2017 versus approximately 6% in 2016. 
Residential remodeling declined 1% in 2017 versus 2016, while commercial construction was flat compared to 7% growth 
in 2016. Market demand for architectural paint shifted more to trade paint as U.S. unemployment continued to decline. 
Demand in the overall U.S. DIY paint market remained soft throughout the year. PPG’s architectural coatings performance 
in the U.S. followed market trends with solid improvement in company-owned same store sales throughout the year. The 
automotive refinish coatings business benefited from higher miles driven and more congestion on the roads due to lower 
unemployment. PPG’s packaging coatings business continued to expand well ahead of the industry end-use market growth 
driven  by  continued  strong  sales  growth  momentum  related  to  customer  adoption  of  PPG’s  new  interior  can  coatings 
technologies. Similar to 2016, PPG’s automotive OEM coatings business lagged industry demand levels due to a customer-
driven market-share shift away from PPG that was offset in other regions of the world. The U.S. and Canada region remained 
PPG’s largest, representing approximately 43% of 2017 sales, although a smaller percentage of total sales than in the prior 
year.
Europe, Middle East and Africa
European economic activity improved in 2017 despite continued regional uncertainty over the United Kingdom’s exit from 
the European Union. Overall GDP and industrial production improved in the region. Regional demand continued to be mixed 
by country and end-use market. Demand for PPG’s products in several end-use markets drove the regional growth rate, 
including above market performance in automotive OEM coatings, aerospace coatings  and specialty coatings and materials. 
PPG’s architectural coatings - EMEA business sales volumes decreased year-over-year, driven by soft market demand in 
France and more competitive pressures in Northern and Eastern Europe. 
EMEA represented approximately 30% of PPG’s 2017 sales, similar to prior year levels. Regional coatings volumes remain 
approximately 13% below their pre-recession levels in 2008. The modest volume recovery reflects the slow pace of economic 
growth in the region. PPG expects continued volume growth over time at attractive incremental margins due to significant 
cost structure improvements and available capacity to satisfy additional demand. In the second half of the year, the euro 
appreciated approximately 5% against the U.S. dollar. The British pound recovered some of its 2016 declines versus the 
U.S. dollar gaining about 10% from the start of 2017.

 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

Asia Pacific and Latin America
The emerging regional markets of Asia Pacific and Latin America represented 27% of PPG’s 2017 sales in aggregate, 200 
basis points higher than the prior year. 
Asia remained the largest emerging region, with sales of approximately $2.5 billion, led by China, which continued as PPG’s 
second largest country by revenue. Sales volume growth in Asia was led by the Industrial Coatings segment, in part due to 
strong sales volume growth in general industrial and automotive OEM. These increases were partially offset by the continued 
demand decline in the marine shipbuilding industry. 
Overall, demand in Latin America improved year-over-year, with continued above market growth in Mexico and Central 
America. Economic conditions modestly improved in South America, primarily led by Brazil. In Mexico, the PPG-Comex 
business added over 200 new concessionaire locations, and strong growth continued in the automotive industry due to the 
opening of new automotive assembly plants within the country in the past 18 months. Foreign currency translation turned 
favorable in the second half of the year, principally the Mexican peso and Chinese yuan. In Central America, the Company 
continued to grow organically following a 2015 acquisition to expand its presence in the architectural end-use market.
Regional Outlook
Looking ahead to 2018, we expect to continue to operate in a more balanced global growth environment. We anticipate the 
positive economic trends in 2017 to mostly continue. We expect economic growth rates to remain consistent with 2017 for 
the U.S. and Canada, Europe, and Asia Pacific regions, and we expect the Latin America region will increase its economic 
growth year-over-year, when compared to 2017. 
We anticipate PPG’s U.S. and Canada regional growth will be led by general industrial coatings and packaging coatings, 
with flat automotive industry builds. We expect growth in the housing and commercial construction markets to be better than 
2017. 
We expect growth rates in Europe to stay at similar levels as 2017 but will remain mixed by sub-region and country. Favorable 
end-use market trends are expected to continue, particularly in automotive OEM coatings as industry build growth rates are 
anticipated to remain positive. Market demand is expected to improve in the architectural coatings business. There is greater 
risk to the economic environment in the U.K. as their exit from the European Union progresses.
In Asia Pacific, we expect continued industrial production growth in China as well as gains in Southeast Asia and India. In 
China, we see continued above global average growth with heightened risk as the Chinese economy continues to shift and 
rely more on domestic consumption. The regional declines in marine coatings sales volumes were less severe in the second 
half of 2017, and we expect a moderate recovery in sales volumes starting in the second half of 2018. Automotive build 
growth is expected to remain modestly positive. 
In Latin America, we anticipate economic expansion will be led by Brazil and that Mexico’s economic conditions will modestly 
improve. 
Significant other factors
During 2017, PPG finalized the divestiture of its North American fiber glass business. This is a transformational milestone 
for the Company as it completed the culmination of a multi-year strategic shift in the company’s business portfolio. The pre-
tax cash proceeds from the sale were approximately $540 million. 
In December 2016, PPG initiated a $195 million global restructuring program, with anticipated annual savings of approximately 
$125 million once fully implemented. The expected cost savings are broadly spread across all regions and all business units. 
The company achieved approximately $50 million of savings in 2017 and expects to achieve the full annualized target of 
$125 million by 2019. PPG will continue to aggressively manage the company’s cost structure to ensure alignment with the 
overall demand environment and make adjustments as required to remain competitive in the marketplace.
Raw materials are a significant input cost to the process of manufacturing coatings. PPG experiences fluctuating energy and 
raw material costs driven by various factors, including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories, global industry 
activity levels, foreign currency exchange rates, and global supply and demand factors. In aggregate, average raw material 
costs  were  higher  in  2017  versus  2016,  due  to  supplier  force  majeure,  natural  disasters  and  environmental  regulation 
enforcement. PPG currently expects overall coatings raw material prices to increase a mid-single-digit percentage in the first 
half of 2018, with impacts varied by region and commodity.
In 2017, aggregate selling prices were modestly higher year-over-year, reflecting the company’s efforts to offset higher raw 
material costs. We expect to see further benefits from selling price actions taken in 2017 and other actions planned in 2018 
to recover profit contribution margins. The Company will carefully monitor raw material costs during 2018 and assess the 
need for additional increases to selling prices to compensate for increases in raw material costs.

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      31

Pension  and  postretirement  benefit  costs,  excluding  settlements,  curtailments  and  special  termination  benefits,  totaled 
approximately  $50  million  in  2017,  down  approximately  $70  million  from  2016.  In  2018,  we  expect  pension  and  other 
postretirement benefit costs to decrease by approximately $15 million to $20 million due to strong 2017 asset performance 
improving the expected return on assets component of net periodic benefit cost as well as certain U.S. plan changes made 
in 2017.
PPG contributed $54 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2017 and an additional $25 million in January 2018. 
In 2017, the Company made contributions aggregating $33 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. In 2018, 
mandatory contributions to PPG’s non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are expected to be between $20 million and $30 
million.
In 2017, unfavorable foreign currency translation experienced in the first half was completely offset by favorable foreign 
currency translation experienced in the second half of the year. Based on mid-January 2018 exchange rates, the Company 
expects year-over-year favorable foreign currency translation to increase 2018 sales by $250 million to $300 million and 
2018 income before income taxes by $25 million to $30 million. We expect the foreign currency translation impact to be more 
prevalent during the first half of 2018, due to prior year foreign exchange rate trends. The foreign currency environment 
continues to be volatile and the impact on 2018 net sales and income before income taxes could differ from the guidance 
provided above. The Company generally purchases raw materials, incurs manufacturing costs and sells finished goods in 
the same currency, so we typically incur only modest foreign currency transaction costs.
With the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company’s 2018 effective tax rate from continuing operations is 
expected to be in the range of 23.0% and 24.0%. This range represents the Company’s best estimate, including the new 
legislation, however, our estimate is subject to revision as the Company completes its assessment of the new law and as 
additional regulations and interpretations are issued. Other factors may affect the expected 2018 effective tax rate positively 
or negatively throughout the year, including changes to various statutory tax rates and regulations around the world.
Over the past four years, the Company used $3.4 billion of cash to repurchase about 33 million shares of PPG stock, including 
over $800 million in 2017. The Company ended the year with approximately $3.6 billion remaining under its current share 
repurchase authorizations. During 2017, the Company deployed approximately $325 million for acquisitions and $434 million 
for dividends. PPG increased its per-share dividend in July 2017, marking the 46th annual increase and the 118th consecutive 
year of dividend payments. The Company is committed to deploying a minimum of $2.4 billion of cash during 2018 on 
acquisitions and share repurchases as part of our previously communicated commitment to deploy $3.5 billion in 2017 and 
2018 combined. In 2017, PPG deployed $1.1 million for acquisitions and share repurchases. 
PPG ended 2017 with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. The Company expects continued strong 
cash generation in 2018.
Accounting Standards Adopted in 2017 
Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the Company’s recently 
adopted accounting pronouncements.
Accounting Standards to be Adopted in Future Years
Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes accounting pronouncements 
that have been promulgated prior to December 31, 2017 but are not effective until a future date.
Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, including Environmental Matters
PPG is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against 
others, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. See Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” and Note 13, “Commitments 
and Contingent Liabilities,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a description of certain of these lawsuits.
As discussed in Item 3 and Note 13, although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently 
unpredictable, management believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving PPG, including 
asbestos-related claims, will not have a material effect on PPG’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, any 
such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized.
It is PPG’s policy to accrue expenses for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount 
of loss can be reasonably estimated. Reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties 
and are generally not discounted. In management’s opinion, the Company operates in an environmentally sound manner 
and the outcome of the Company’s environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on PPG’s financial position 
or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, 
if any, are recognized. Management anticipates that the resolution of the Company’s environmental contingencies will occur 
over an extended period of time.

 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

The Company continues to analyze, assess and remediate the environmental issues associated with PPG’s former chromium 
manufacturing plant in Jersey City, N.J. and associated sites (“New Jersey Chrome”). Information will continue to be generated 
from the ongoing groundwater remedial investigation activities related to New Jersey Chrome and will be incorporated into 
a  final  draft  remedial  action  work  plan  for  groundwater  expected  to  be  submitted  to  the  New  Jersey  Department  of 
Environmental Protection in 2021.
There are multiple, future events yet to occur, including further remedy selection and design, remedy implementation and 
execution  and  applicable  governmental  agency  or  community  organization  approvals.  Considerable  uncertainty  exists 
regarding the timing of these future events for the New Jersey Chrome sites. Final resolution of these events is expected to 
occur over the next several years. As these events occur and to the extent that the cost estimates of the environmental 
remediation remedies change, the existing reserve for this environmental remediation matter will be adjusted.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
During the past three years, PPG has had sufficient financial resources to meet its operating requirements, to fund our capital 
spending, including acquisitions, share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to shareholders.

% Change

2017 vs. 2016
The $338 million increase in cash from operating activities - continuing operations, was primarily due to the absence of the 
prior year funding of the Pittsburgh Corning asbestos trust (the “Trust”), lower defined benefit pension contributions, lower 
restructuring payments and lower interest payments, partially offset by higher cash taxes paid in 2017 and higher working 
capital. 
2016 vs. 2015
The $541 million decrease in cash from operating activities - continuing operations, was primarily due to the after-tax funding 
of the Trust, partially offset by lower working capital and lower defined benefit pension contributions.
Operating working capital 
Operating Working Capital is a subset of total working capital and represents (1) receivables from customers, net of allowance 
for doubtful accounts, (2) inventories, and (3) trade liabilities. See Note 3, “Working Capital Detail” under Item 8 of this Form 
10-K for further information related to the components of the Company’s Operating Working Capital. We believe Operating 
Working Capital represents the key components of working capital under the operating control of our businesses.
A key metric we use to measure our working capital management is Operating Working Capital as a percentage of sales 
(fourth quarter sales annualized).

PPG contributed $54 million and $25 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans during 2017 and in January 2018, 
respectively. Some contributions to PPG’s non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2017 were required by local funding 
requirements. PPG expects to make mandatory contributions to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in the range of 
$20 million to $30 million in 2018. PPG may make voluntary contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2018 and 
beyond.
Asbestos settlement trust funding
In June 2016, PPG fully funded its portion of the trust that was established by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western 
District of Pennsylvania in May 2016. PPG’s total cash obligations to fund the Trust totaled $813 million (pre-tax). All payments 
were applied against a previously established PPG reserve for the total asbestos trust obligation. The company utilized cash 
on hand for the payments, and this funding had no impact on PPG’s previously stated cash-deployment targets. Refer to 
Note 13, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.

Credit agreements and lines of credit
In December 2015, PPG entered into a five-year credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with several banks and financial 
institutions as further discussed in Note 8, “Borrowings and Lines of Credit” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The Credit 
Agreement provides for a $1.8 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement will terminate on December 
18, 2020. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding under the existing 
or the prior Credit Agreement.
In addition to the amounts available under the lines of credit, the Company has an automatic shelf registration statement on 
file with the SEC pursuant to which it may issue, offer and sell from time to time on a continuous or delayed basis any 
combination of securities in one or more offerings.
See Note 8, “Borrowings and Lines of Credit,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding notes entered into 
and repaid as well as details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit, letters of credit, 
guarantees and debt covenants.
Contractual obligations
We continue to believe that our cash on hand and short term investments, cash from operations and the Company’s access 
to  capital  markets  will  continue  to  be  sufficient  to  fund  our  operating  activities,  capital  spending,  acquisitions,  dividend 
payments, debt service, share repurchases, contributions to pension plans, and PPG’s significant contractual obligations.

PPG is unable to estimate the pension contributions beyond 2018. 

(3)  The unconditional purchase commitments are principally take-or-pay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials, including industrial gases

Other liquidity matters
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) which, among other things lowered the U.S. 
corporate statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminated certain deductible items and added other deductible items 
for corporations, imposed a tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings and eliminated U.S. taxes on most future foreign earnings. 
In December 2017, the Company recorded a net tax charge of $134 million related to the Act. The net charge consists of the  
tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings of approximately $250 million and a charge of approximately $125 million related to 
the remeasurement of PPG’s U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new enacted statutory rate. These charges were 
partially offset by a benefit from the reversal of an existing deferred tax liability on repatriated foreign earnings of approximately 
$150 million and a benefit resulting from PPG’s decision to accelerate recognition of certain U.S. tax attributes during the 
fourth quarter. 
This net charge is $37 million higher than the net charge included in PPG’s fourth quarter earnings release and Form 8-K 
furnished on January 18, 2018, primarily due to new IRS regulations issued and refinements of management estimates. The 
net charge recorded as a provisional amount as of December 31, 2017 represents the Company’s best estimate using 
information available as of February 1, 2018. The Company anticipates U.S. regulatory agencies will issue further regulations 
during 2018, which may alter this estimate. The Company is still evaluating among other things, its position with respect to 
permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings overseas and other related outside basis difference considerations and the 
amount of tax owed on unrepatriated earnings by subsidiaries. The Company believes its remeasurement of the U.S deferred 
tax assets and liabilities is complete, except for changes in estimates that can result from finalizing the filing of our 2017 U.S.

 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

income tax return, which are not anticipated to be material, and changes that may be a direct impact of other provisional 
amounts recorded due to the enactment of the Act. The Company will refine its estimates to incorporate new or better 
information as it comes available through the filing date of its 2017 U.S. income tax returns in the fourth quarter of 2018.
The tax owed by PPG on its unrepatriated foreign earnings is payable over eight years and is subject to a prescriptive 
calculation to determine the portion payable in 2018 and beyond. PPG’s current estimate, using this prescriptive method, 
indicates its tax payable will be increased by approximately $1 million to $3 million per year through 2025.  As such, the 
portion of the tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings not payable within the next 12 months is presented within “Other liabilities” 
on the consolidated balance sheet.
The Company currently expects its 2018 on-going effective tax rate from continuing operations to be in the range of 23% to 
24%.
At December 31, 2017, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including an accrual of 
related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits, was $163 million. The timing of 
payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities. PPG does not expect a significant tax payment 
related to these obligations within the next year. The Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when 
any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase commitments 
disclosed in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and 
guarantees as discussed in Note 8, “Borrowings and Lines of Credit,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes 
presented under Item 8 of this Form 10-K and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate. We believe that the 
most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for 
contingencies, under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be 
reasonably estimated, and to accounting for pensions, other postretirement benefits, business combinations, goodwill and 
other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the 
estimates necessary to apply these policies.
Contingencies
Contingencies, by their nature, relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the 
likelihood  that  a  liability  has  been  incurred  as  well  as  in  estimating  the  amount  of  potential  loss.  The  most  important 
contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectability of accounts receivable, to environmental 
remediation, to pending, impending or overtly threatened litigation against the Company and to the resolution of matters 
related to open tax years. For more information on these matters, see Note 3, “Working Capital Detail,” Note 11, “Income 
Taxes” and Note 13, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans
Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into 
the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works. To accomplish this, we make extensive use 
of assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, turnover, medical costs and discount rates. The Company has 
established a process by which management reviews and selects these assumptions annually. See Note 12, “Employee 
Benefit Plans,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information on these plans and the assumptions used.
Business Combinations
In  accordance  with  the  accounting  guidance  for  business  combinations,  the  Company  uses  the  acquisition  method  of 
accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated 
fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed were recognized as goodwill. The valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the 
determination of future operating results. In addition to using management estimates and negotiated amounts, the Company 
uses a variety of information sources to determine the estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities including: third-
party appraisals for the estimated value and lives of identifiable intangible assets and property, plant and equipment; third-
party actuaries for the estimated obligations of defined benefit pension plans and similar benefit obligations; and legal counsel 
or other experts to assess the obligations associated with legal, environmental and other contingent liabilities. The business 
and  technical  judgment  of  management  was  used  in  determining  which  intangible  assets  have  indefinite  lives  and  in 

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      37

determining the useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other 
intangible assets.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
The Company tests indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment annually by either performing a qualitative 
evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely 
than not that the fair values of a reporting unit or asset is less than its carrying amount. Fair values under the quantitative 
test are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of 
future revenues and cash flows. For more information on these matters, see Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
We believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K related to these contingencies, 
pensions, other postretirement benefits, business combinations, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite 
lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate PPG management, although actual outcomes could 
differ from our estimates.
Currency
Comparing exchange rates from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, the U.S. dollar weakened against the currencies 
in most countries in which PPG operates, most notably the Mexican peso, British pound, Chinese yuan and euro. As a result, 
consolidated net assets at December 31, 2017 increased by approximately $231 million from December 31, 2016. 
Comparing  exchange  rates  from  December  31,  2015  to  December  31,  2016,  the  U.S.  dollar  strengthened  against  the 
currencies in most countries in which PPG operates, most notably the Mexican peso, British pound, Chinese yuan and euro. 
As a result, consolidated net assets at December 31, 2016 decreased by approximately $465 million from December 31, 
2015. 
Comparing exchange rates during 2017 to those of 2016, in the countries in which PPG operates, the U.S. dollar was stronger 
overall, which had an unfavorable impact of approximately $7 million on full year 2017 income before income taxes from the 
translation of this foreign income into U.S. dollars.
Comparing exchange rates during 2016 to those of 2015, in the countries in which PPG operates, the U.S. dollar was stronger 
overall, which had an unfavorable impact of approximately $70 million on full year 2016 income before income taxes from 
the translation of this foreign income into U.S. dollars.
Forward-Looking Statements
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on 
behalf of the Company. Management’s Discussion and Analysis and other sections of this Annual Report contain forward-
looking statements that reflect the Company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance.
You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to current or historic facts. Forward-
looking statements are identified by the use of the words “aim,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “project,” 
“outlook,” “forecast” and other expressions that indicate future events and trends. Any forward-looking statement speaks only 
as of the date on which such statement is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking 
statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any 
further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also, note the 
following cautionary statements.
Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company’s forward-looking statements. Such factors 
include the impacts of the natural disasters in Mexico, Puerto Rico and the U.S., and their length and severity, any currently 
unanticipated future impacts from the natural disasters, global economic conditions, increasing price and product competition 
by foreign and domestic competitors, fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials, the ability to increase selling price, 
the ability to recover margins, our ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, the timing of and 
the realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring initiatives, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and 
achieving expected synergies therefrom, economic and political conditions in the markets we serve, the ability to penetrate 
existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates, 
fluctuations in tax rates, the impact of future legislation, the impact of environmental regulations, unexpected business 
disruptions and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation. However, it is not possible to predict or identify 
all such factors.
Consequently, while the list of factors presented here and under Item 1A is considered representative, no such list should 
be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant 
additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements.

38 

 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

Consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could 
include, among other things, lower sales or income, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability 
to third parties, other factors set forth in Item 1A of this Form 10-K and similar risks, any of which could have a material 
adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
PPG is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and was exposed to 
changes in PPG’s stock price. The Company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage 
or reduce these market risks. A detailed description of these exposures and the Company’s risk management policies are 
provided in Note 9, “Financial Instruments, Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-
K.
The following disclosures summarize PPG’s exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of 
derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks. Quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect 
how reasonably possible, unfavorable changes in market rates can impact PPG’s consolidated results of operations, cash 
flows and financial position.
Foreign Currency Risk
We conduct operations in many countries around the world. Our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction 
and currency translation risk. Foreign currency forward contracts outstanding during 2017 and 2016 were generally designated 
as a hedge of PPG’s exposure to foreign currency transaction risk. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the fair value of 
these contracts was a net liability of $19 million and a net asset of $16 million, respectively. The potential reduction in PPG’s 
income from continuing operations resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its 
outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for European and Canadian currencies and 20% for Asian and Latin 
American currencies for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 would have been $255 million and $105 million, 
respectively.
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, PPG had U.S. dollar to Euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount 
of $560 million outstanding. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the fair value of these contracts was a net asset of $2 million 
and $65 million, respectively. A 10% increase in the value of the Euro to the U.S. dollar would have had an unfavorable effect 
on the fair value of these swap contracts by reducing the value of these instruments by $58 million and by $54 million at 
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, PPG had non-U.S. dollar denominated debt outstanding of $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion, 
respectively. A weakening of the U.S. dollar by 10% against European currencies and by 20% against Asian and South 
American currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of $314 million and $344 million as of December 31, 
2017 and 2016, respectively.
Interest Rate Risk
The Company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize 
its interest costs. A 10% increase in interest rates in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Europe and a 20% increase in interest 
rates in Asia and South America would have an insignificant effect on PPG’s variable rate debt obligations and interest 
expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would 
have increased the present value of the Company’s fixed rate debt by approximately $61 million and $65 million as of 
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively; however, such changes would not have had an effect on PPG’s annual income 
from continuing operations or cash flows.
Equity Price Risk
In prior years, PPG entered into equity forward arrangements to hedge the Company’s exposure to changes in the fair value 
of its future obligation to contribute PPG stock to the Trust (see Note 9, “Financial Instruments, Hedging Activities and Fair 
Value Measurements” and Note 13, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K). In June 2016, 
PPG  satisfied  its  funding  obligation  to  the Trust  and  the  equity  forward  arrangements  were  settled. At  settlement,  the 
aggregated fair value of the equity forward arrangements was an asset of $258 million.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PPG Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 
2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows 
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and 
qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 appearing under item 15(a)(2)(collectively 
referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting 
as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee 
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position 
of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three 
years in the period ended December 31, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting 
as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control 
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the 
accompanying Management Report on Establishing and Maintaining Adequate Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  Our 
responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control 
over financial reporting based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting 
Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with 
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the 
PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the 
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, 
whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  
Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, 
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  Our audit of internal control over financial 
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits 
also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits 
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain 
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets 
of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that 
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections 
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes 
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management Report

Responsibility for Preparation of the Financial Statements and Establishing and Maintaining Adequate 
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. The 
consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America and include amounts that are based on the best estimates and judgments of management.

We are also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in 
Rules 13a-15(f)  and  15d-15(f)  under  the  Securities  Exchange Act  of  1934,  as  amended.  Internal  control  over  financial 
reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, a system of internal control over financial 
reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, because of 
changing conditions, there is risk in projecting any evaluation of internal controls to future periods.

We  conducted  an  evaluation  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  Company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of 
December 31, 2017. In making this evaluation, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Our evaluation included reviewing 
the documentation of our controls, evaluating the design effectiveness of our controls and testing their operating effectiveness. 
Based on this evaluation we have concluded that, as of December 31, 2017, the Company’s internal controls over financial 
reporting were effective.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued their report, included on 

page 40 of this Form 10-K, regarding the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PPG Industries, Inc. (“PPG” or the “Company”) 
and all subsidiaries, both U.S. and non-U.S., that it controls. PPG owns more than 50% of the voting stock of most of the 
subsidiaries that it controls. For those consolidated subsidiaries in which the Company’s ownership is less than 100%, the 
outside shareholders’ interests are shown as noncontrolling interests. Investments in companies in which PPG owns 20%
to 50% of the voting stock and has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the 
investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. As a result, PPG’s share of income or losses from such 
equity affiliates is included in the accompanying consolidated statement of income and PPG’s share of these companies’ 
shareholders’ equity is included in “Investments” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Transactions between 
PPG and its subsidiaries are eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management 
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent 
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses during 
the reporting period. Such estimates also include the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulting from the 
allocation of the purchase price related to business combinations consummated. Actual outcomes could differ from those 
estimates. 
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete. Revenue is recognized by all operating segments 
when goods are shipped and title to inventory and risk of loss passes to the customer or when services have been rendered.
Shipping and Handling Costs
Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are reported in “Net sales” in the accompanying consolidated statement 
of income. Shipping and handling costs incurred by the Company for the delivery of goods to customers are included in “Cost 
of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization” in the accompanying consolidated statement of income.
Selling, General and Administrative Costs
Amounts presented as “Selling, general and administrative” in the accompanying consolidated statement of income are 
comprised of selling, customer service, distribution and advertising costs, as well as the costs of providing corporate-wide 
functional support in such areas as finance, law, human resources and planning. Distribution costs pertain to the movement 
and storage of finished goods inventory at company-owned and leased warehouses and other distribution facilities. 
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and totaled $313 million, $322 million and $324 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, 
respectively. 
Research and Development
Research and development costs, which consist primarily of employee related costs, are charged to expense as incurred.

Legal Costs
Legal costs, primarily include costs associated with acquisition and divestiture transactions, general litigation, environmental 
regulation compliance, patent and trademark protection and other general corporate purposes, are charged to expense as 
incurred. 
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of most significant non-U.S. operations is their local currency. Assets and liabilities of those operations 
are translated into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates; income and expenses are translated using the average 
exchange rates for the reporting period. Unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses are deferred in accumulated 
other comprehensive loss, a separate component of shareholders’ equity.

 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments (valued at cost, which approximates fair value) acquired with an original 
maturity of three months or less.
Short-term Investments
Short-term investments are highly liquid, high credit quality investments (valued at cost plus accrued interest) that have stated 
maturities of greater than three months to one year. The purchases and sales of these investments are classified as investing 
activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
Marketable Equity Securities
The Company’s investment in marketable equity securities is recorded at fair market value and reported in “Other current 
assets” and “Investments” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair market value recorded in 
income for those securities designated as trading securities and in other comprehensive income, net of tax, for those securities 
designated as available for sale.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Most U.S. inventories are stated at cost, using the last-in, 
first-out (“LIFO”) method of accounting, which does not exceed net realizable value. All other inventories are stated at cost, 
using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method of accounting, which does not exceed net realizable value. PPG determines cost 
using  either  average  or  standard  factory  costs,  which  approximate  actual  costs,  excluding  certain  fixed  costs  such  as 
depreciation and property taxes. See Note 3, “Working Capital Detail” for further information concerning the Company’s 
inventory. 
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company recognizes all derivative financial instruments (a “derivative”) as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the 
consolidated balance sheet. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the use of the instrument.
For a derivative that is considered “effective” as a hedge of an exposure to variability in expected future cash flows (cash 
flow hedge), the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and 
the ineffective portion, if any, is reported in income from continuing operations. Amounts accumulated in OCI are reclassified 
into income from continuing operations in the same period or periods during which the hedged transactions are recorded in 
income from continuing operations. 
For a derivative that is considered “effective” as a hedge of an exposure to changes in the fair value (fair value hedge) of an 
asset, a liability or a firm commitment, the change in the derivative’s fair value is reported in income from continuing operations, 
offsetting the gain or loss recognized for the change in fair value of the asset, liability, or firm commitment that is being hedged.
For a derivative, debt or other financial instrument that is considered “effective” as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign 
operation, the gain or loss associated with the financial instrument is reported as a translation gain or loss in accumulated 
other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). Gains and losses in AOCI related to hedges of the Company’s net investments in 
foreign operations are reclassified out of AOCI and recognized in income from continuing operations upon a substantial 
liquidation, sale or partial sale of such investments or upon impairment of all or a portion of such investments. The cash flow 
impact of these instruments have been and will be classified as investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash 
flows. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedges for hedge accounting purposes are recognized 
in income from continuing operations in the period of change. 
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line method based on the estimated 
useful lives of related assets. Additional depreciation expense is recorded when facilities or equipment are subject to abnormal 
economic conditions or obsolescence.
The cost of significant improvements that add to productive capacity or extend the lives of properties are capitalized. Costs 
for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. When a capitalized asset is retired or otherwise disposed 
of, the original cost and related accumulated depreciation balance are removed from the accounts and any related gain or 
loss is recorded in income from continuing operations. The amortization cost of capitalized leased assets is recorded in 
depreciation expense. Property and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances 
indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. See Note 4, “Property, Plant and Equipment” for further details. 

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      47

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of acquired identifiable tangible and intangible assets less 
liabilities assumed from acquired businesses. Identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded 
based upon their fair value at the date of acquisition.
The Company tests goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment at least annually in connection with PPG’s strategic planning 
process. The Company tests goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The 
qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors, including reporting unit specific operating results as well as industry, market 
and general economic conditions, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of a reporting unit is less 
than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company may elect to bypass this qualitative assessment for some or all 
of its reporting units and perform a quantitative test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed during the fourth 
quarter by comparing the estimated fair value of the associated reporting unit as of September 30 to its carrying value. The 
Company’s reporting units are its operating segments. (See Note 19, “Reportable Business Segment Information,” for further 
information  concerning  the  Company’s  operating  segments.)  Fair  value  is  estimated  using  discounted  cash  flow 
methodologies.
The Company has determined that certain acquired trademarks have indefinite useful lives. The Company tests the carrying 
value of these trademarks for impairment at least annually, or as needed whenever events and circumstances indicate that 
their carrying amount may not be recoverable. The annual assessment takes place in the fourth quarter of each year either 
by completing a qualitative assessment or quantitatively by comparing the estimated fair value of each trademark as of 
September 30 to its carrying value. Fair value is estimated by using the relief from royalty method (a discounted cash flow 
methodology). The qualitative assessment includes consideration of factors, including revenue relative to the asset being 
assessed, the operating results of the related business as well as industry, market and general economic conditions, to 
determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount.
Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (1 to 30
years) and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be 
recoverable.
Receivables and Allowances 
All trade receivables are reported on the balance sheet at the outstanding principal adjusted for any allowance for credit 
losses and any charge offs. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce receivables to their estimated 
net realizable value when it is probable that a loss will be incurred. Those estimates are based on historical collection 
experience, current economic and market conditions, a review of the aging of accounts receivable and the assessments of 
current creditworthiness of customers.
Product Warranties
The  Company  accrues  for  product  warranties  at  the  time  the  associated  products  are  sold  based  on  historical  claims 
experience. The reserve, pre-tax charges against income and cash outlays for product warranties were not significant to the 
consolidated financial statements of the Company for any year presented.
Asset Retirement Obligations
An asset retirement obligation represents a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that 
is incurred upon the acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of that long-lived asset. PPG recognizes 
asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The 
asset retirement obligation is subsequently adjusted for changes in fair value. The associated estimated asset retirement 
costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset and depreciated over its useful life. PPG’s asset 
retirement obligations are primarily associated with the retirement or closure of certain assets used in PPG’s manufacturing 
process. The accrued asset retirement obligation recorded on PPG’s balance sheet was $19 million and $18 million as of 
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
PPG’s only conditional asset retirement obligation relates to the possible future abatement of asbestos contained in certain 
PPG production facilities. The asbestos in PPG’s production facilities arises from the application of normal and customary 
building practices in the past when the facilities were constructed. This asbestos is encapsulated in place and, as a result, 
there is no current legal requirement to abate it. Inasmuch as there is no requirement to abate, the Company does not have 
any current plans or an intention to abate and therefore the timing, method and cost of future abatement, if any, are not 
known. The  Company  has  not  recorded  an  asset  retirement  obligation  associated  with  asbestos  abatement,  given  the 
uncertainty concerning the timing of future abatement, if any.

Reclassifications
Certain  reclassifications  of  prior  years’  data  have  been  made  to  conform  to  the  current  year  presentation.  These 
reclassifications had no impact on our previously reported net income, cash flows or shareholders’ equity. 
Accounting Standards Adopted in 2017 
PPG’s adoption of the following accounting standard updates (“ASU”) in 2017 did not have a material impact on PPG's 
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows: 

Accounting Standard Update
2017-04
2016-18
2016-09

Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment
Restricted Cash
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting

Accounting Standards to be Adopted in Future Years
In February 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2018-2, “Reclassification of Certain 
Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.” This ASU allows a reclassification from Accumulated other 
comprehensive  income  to  Retained  earnings  for  stranded  tax  effects  resulting  from  the  Tax  Cuts  and  Jobs Act.  The 
amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and for interim periods therein. 
Early adoption of this ASU is permitted. PPG does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on its consolidated financial 
position, results of operations or cash flows.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, "Derivatives and Hedging - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for 
Hedging Activities." This ASU modifies the presentation and disclosure of hedging results. Further, it provides partial relief 
on the timing of certain aspects of hedge documentation and eliminates the requirement to recognize hedge ineffectiveness 
separately in income. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and for 
interim periods therein. Early adoption of this ASU is permitted. PPG does not believe this ASU will have a material impact 
on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, "Stock Compensation - Scope of Modification Accounting." This ASU 
requires all equity award modifications to be accounted for as a modification unless the fair value, vesting conditions and 
classification of the award as equity or liability are the same as the classification of the original award immediately before 
the original award is modified. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 
and for interim periods therein. PPG does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on its consolidated financial 
position, results of operations or cash flows. 
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, "Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic 
Postretirement Benefit Cost." This ASU requires the service cost component of net benefit costs to be disaggregated from 
all other components and be reported in the same line item or items as other compensation costs. The other components of 
net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost. The amendments in 
this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and for interim periods therein. PPG does not 
believe this ASU will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operation or cash flows. Beginning 
January 1, 2018, in connection with the adoption of this new ASU, PPG will change the method by which pension costs are 
allocated to its strategic business units. Namely, only service costs will be attributed to the strategic business units and all 
other components will remain in unallocated corporate overhead. PPG will recast its statement of operations and segment 
income for this change in allocation. 
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, "Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments." This 
ASU  addresses  eight  specific  cash  flow  issues  with  the  objective  of  eliminating  the  existing  diversity  in  practice.  The 
amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and for 
interim periods therein. PPG does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, 
results of operations or cash flows.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses.” This ASU requires an organization 
to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current 
conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-
looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years 
beginning after December 15, 2019 and for interim periods therein. Entities may chose to adopt the new ASU as of its fiscal 
year beginning after December 15, 2018. PPG does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on its consolidated 
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      49

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases.” This ASU requires all lessees to recognize on the balance 
sheet right to use assets and lease liabilities for the rights and obligations created by lease arrangements with terms greater 
than 12 months. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and for interim 
periods therein. PPG is in the process of assessing the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial 
position, results of operations and cash flows. At a minimum, total assets and total liabilities will increase in the period the 
ASU is adopted. Early adoption of this ASU is permitted. At December 31, 2017, PPG’s undiscounted future minimum 
payments outstanding for lease obligations were approximately $840 million. 
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, “Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities.” 
This ASU simplifies the accounting and disclosures related to equity investments. The amendments in this ASU are effective 
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and for interim periods therein. Adoption of this ASU will not have a 
material impact on PPG’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606.” This ASU replaces 
nearly all existing U.S. GAAP guidance on revenue recognition. The standard prescribes a five-step model for recognizing 
revenue, the application of which will require significant judgment. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years 
beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods therein. The provisions of this ASU may be applied retroactively 
or on a modified retrospective (cumulative effect) basis. PPG will adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach 
in January 2018. PPG believes the preponderance of the Company’s contracts with customers are standard ship and bill 
arrangements where revenue is recognized at the time of shipment. Under the provisions of this ASU, PPG believes certain 
costs  currently  reported  in  Selling,  general  and  administrative  costs  will  be  reclassified  to  Cost  of  sales,  exclusive  of 
depreciation and amortization on the Consolidated Statement of Income, as they represent costs incurred in satisfaction of 
performance obligations. In addition, PPG expects the cost of certain customer incentives to be recorded as a reduction of 
Net sales rather than Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization or Selling, general and administrative costs. 
Adoption of this ASU will not have a significant impact on PPG’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and 
cash flows.
2. Acquisitions and Divestitures
Acquisitions
The Crown Group 
On October 2, 2017, PPG acquired The Crown Group (“Crown”), a U.S.-based coatings application services business, which 
is reported as part of PPG's Industrial Coatings reportable segment. Crown is one of the leading component and product 
finishers in North America. Crown applies coatings to customers’ manufactured parts and assembled products at 11 U.S. 
sites. Most of Crown’s facilities, which also provide assembly, warehousing and sequencing services, are located at customer 
facilities or positioned near customer manufacturing sites. The company serves manufacturers in the automotive, agriculture, 
construction, heavy truck and alternative energy industries. Crown has annual sales of approximately $125 million. 
Taiwan Chlorine Industries
Taiwan  Chlorine  Industries  (“TCI”)  was  established  in  1986  as  a  joint  venture  between  PPG  and  China  Petrochemical 
Development Corporation (“CPDC”) to produce chlorine-based products in Taiwan, at which time PPG owned 60 percent of 
the venture. In conjunction with the 2013 separation of its commodity chemicals business, PPG conveyed to Axiall Corporation 
("Axiall") its 60% ownership interest in TCI. Under PPG’s agreement with CPDC, if certain post-closing conditions were not 
met following the three year anniversary of the separation, CPDC had the option to sell its 40% ownership interest in TCI to 
Axiall for $100 million. In turn, Axiall had a right to designate PPG as its designee to purchase the 40% ownership interest 
of CPDC. In April 2016, Axiall announced that CPDC had decided to sell its ownership interest in TCI to Axiall. In June 2016, 
Axiall  formally  designated  PPG  to  purchase  the  40%  ownership  interest  in  TCI.  In August  2016,  Westlake  Chemical 
Corporation acquired Axiall, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Westlake. On April 11, 2017, PPG finalized its 
purchase of CPDC’s 40% ownership interest in TCI. The difference between the acquisition date fair value and the purchase 
price of PPG’s 40% ownership interest in TCI has been recorded as a loss in discontinued operations during the year-ended 
December 31, 2017.
MetoKote Corporation 
In July 2016, PPG completed the acquisition of MetoKote Corporation ("MetoKote"), a U.S.-based coatings application 
services business. MetoKote applies coatings to customers' manufactured parts and assembled products. It operates on-
site  coatings  services  within  several  customer  manufacturing  locations,  as  well  as  at  regional  service  centers,  located 
throughout the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Germany, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Customers ship 
parts to MetoKote service centers where they are treated to enhance paint adhesion and painted with electrocoat, powder 
or liquid coatings technologies. Coated parts are then shipped to the customer’s next stage of assembly. MetoKote coats an

(a)  The net deferred income tax liability is included in assets due to the Company's tax jurisdictional netting.
The pro-forma impact on PPG's sales and results of operations, including the pro forma effect of events that are directly 
attributable to the acquisition, was not significant. While calculating this impact, no cost savings or operating synergies that 
may result from the acquisition were included. Since the acquisition, the results of this acquired business comprise the 
coatings services operating segment, included within the Industrial Coatings reportable segment.
Other Acquisitions
In 2017, 2016, and 2015, the Company completed several smaller business acquisitions. The total consideration paid for 
these acquisitions, net of cash acquired, debt assumed and other post closing adjustments, was $74 million, $43 million and 
$371 million, respectively. 
In January 2018, PPG acquired ProCoatings, a leading architectural paint and coatings wholesaler located in The Netherlands. 
ProCoatings, established in 2001, distributes a large portfolio of well-known professional paint brands through its network 
of 23 multi-brand stores. The company employs nearly 100 people.
Divestitures
Glass Segment
In 2017, PPG completed a multi-year strategic shift in the Company's business portfolio, resulting in the exit of all glass 
operations which consisted of the global fiber glass business, PPG's ownership interest in two Asian fiber glass joint ventures 
and the flat glass business. Accordingly, the results of operations, including the gains on the divestitures, and cash flows 
have been recast as discontinued operations for all periods presented. PPG now has two reportable business segments.
The net sales and income from discontinued operations related to the former Glass segment for the three years ended 
December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were as follows:

North American Fiber Glass Business
On September 1, 2017, PPG completed the sale of its North American fiber glass business to Nippon Electric Glass Co. Ltd. 
(“NEG”). Cash proceeds from the sale were $541 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $343 million, net of certain accruals 
and contingencies established in conjunction with the divestiture. 
PPG’s fiber glass operations included manufacturing facilities in Chester, South Carolina, and Lexington and Shelby, North 
Carolina;  and  administrative  and  research-and-development  operations  in  Shelby  and  in  Harmar,  Pennsylvania,  near 
Pittsburgh. The business, which employed more than 1,000 people and had net sales of approximately $350 million in 2016, 
supplies the transportation, energy, infrastructure and consumer markets.

Flat Glass Business 
In October 2016, PPG completed the sale of its flat glass manufacturing and glass coatings operations to Vitro S.A.B. de 
C.V. PPG received approximately $740 million in cash proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain of $421 million on the sale.  
Under the terms of the agreement, PPG divested its entire flat glass manufacturing and glass coatings operations, including 
production  sites  located  in  Fresno,  California;  Salem,  Oregon;  Carlisle,  Pennsylvania;  and  Wichita  Falls,  Texas;  four 
distribution/fabrication  facilities  located  across  Canada;  and  a  research-and-development  center  located  in  Harmar, 
Pennsylvania. PPG’s flat glass business included approximately 1,200 employees. The business manufactures glass that 
is fabricated into products used primarily in commercial and residential construction. 
European Fiber Glass Business 
In October 2016, PPG completed the sale of its European fiber glass business to glass manufacturer NEG. PPG recorded 
a pre-tax loss of $42 million, consisting predominately of a $46 million pension settlement charge. The European fiber glass 
business manufactures reinforcement materials for thermoset and thermoplastic composite applications for the transportation, 
energy, infrastructure and consumer markets. Manufacturing facilities in Hoogezand, Netherlands, and Wigan, England, and 
a research and development facility in Hoogezand were included in the transaction. 
PFG Fiber Glass Joint Ventures 
In November 2016, PPG sold its 50% ownership interests in its two PFG fiber glass joint ventures to its joint venture partner 
Nan Ya Plastics Corporation (“Nan Ya”). Nan Ya is affiliated with Taiwan-based Formosa Plastics Group. The PFG fiber glass 
joint ventures supply electronic yarn fibers used in integrated electronic circuit boards and fiber glass reinforcement products 
for automotive applications. PPG recorded a net pre-tax gain of $36 million on the sale.
Other Divestitures
Plaka Business
In June 2017, PPG completed the sale of the assets of its Mexico-based Plaka plasterboard and cement-board business to 
Knauf International GmbH and recorded a $25 million pre-tax gain on the sale. The Company's consolidated balance sheet 
presents the assets and liabilities of the Plaka business as held for sale as of December 31, 2016. 
Pittsburgh Glass Works
In April 2016, PPG sold its minority ownership interest in Pittsburgh Glass Works LLC ("PGW") to LKQ Corporation concurrent 
with the majority partner’s sale of its ownership interest. PPG recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of $20 million. PPG accounted 
for its interest in PGW under the equity method of accounting. PPG’s share of net earnings from PGW are reported in “Other 
income” in the Consolidated Statement of Income for all periods presented and have not been reclassified as discontinued 
operations, as the divestiture of PGW does not represent a strategic shift in PPG’s operations and PGW did not have a major 
impact on PPG's ongoing results of operations.

Inventories valued using the LIFO method of inventory valuation comprised 34% and 38% of total gross inventory values as of December 31, 2017

as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, certain inventories accounted for on the 
LIFO method of accounting were reduced, which resulted in the liquidation of certain quantities carried at costs prevailing in prior years. The effect 
on income from continuing operations was zero and income of $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

ventures that manufacture and sell coatings. In 2017, PPG purchased a 40% ownership interest in TCI. Refer to Note 2, 
“Acquisitions and Divestitures” for additional information. 
PPG’s share of undistributed net earnings of equity affiliates was $12 million and $7 million as of December 31, 2017 and

7. Business Restructuring
The Company records restructuring liabilities that represent charges incurred in connection with consolidations of certain 
operations, including operations from acquisitions, as well as headcount reduction programs. These charges consist primarily 
of severance costs and asset write-downs.
In December 2016, PPG’s Board of Directors approved a business restructuring program which includes actions necessary 
to reduce its global cost structure. The program is focused on certain regions and end-use markets where business conditions 
are the weakest, as well as reductions in production capacity and various global functional and administrative costs. A pre-
tax restructuring charge of $195 million was recorded in December 2016, of which approximately $136 million represents 
employee severance and other cash costs and nearly $60 million is related to the write-down of certain assets held for sale 
and other non-cash costs. The restructuring actions will result in the net reduction of approximately 1,700 positions, with

(1)  PPG entered into several interest rate swaps which had the effect of converting fixed rate notes to variable rates, based on the three-month London 
Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). There were no interest rate swaps outstanding related to these instruments as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The 
impact of the derivatives on debt represents the fair value adjustment of the debt while the interest rate swaps were outstanding, which is being 
amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt. The weighted average effective interest rate for these borrowings, 
including the effects of the swaps, was 8.4% and 8.4% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Refer to Note 9, “Financial 
Instruments, Hedging Activities, and Fair Value Measurements” for additional information.

(2)  Weighted average interest rate of 3.7% and 3.8% as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
2017 Activities
In November 2017, PPG’s €500 million 3-year variable rate bank loan matured and the Company repaid this obligation using 
$587 million cash on hand.
2016 Activities
In December 2016, PPG’s $125 million 6.65% notes, due 2018, were redeemed using $133 million cash on hand. Also, the 
Company prepaid its $250 million Term Loan Credit Agreements, one with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. and the 
other with BNP Paribas, which PPG entered into during May 2016. The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. Term Loan would 
have originally terminated and all amounts outstanding would have been payable in March 2017. The BNP Paribas Term 
Loan would have originally terminated and all amounts outstanding would have been payable in May 2017.
In November 2016, PPG completed a public offering of €300 million 0.000% Notes due 2019 and €600 million 0.875% Notes 
due 2025. These notes were issued pursuant to PPG’s existing shelf registration statement and pursuant to an indenture 
between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, as supplemented. The Indenture 
governing these notes contains covenants that limit the Company’s ability to, among other things, incur certain liens securing 
indebtedness, engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions, and enter into certain consolidations, mergers, conveyances, 
transfers or leases of all or substantially all the Company’s assets. The terms of these notes also require the Company to 
make an offer to repurchase Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the Indenture) at a price equal 
to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company may issue additional debt from time to 
time pursuant to the Indenture.
The aggregate cash proceeds from the notes, net of discounts and fees, was $987 million. The notes are denominated in 
euro and have been designated as hedges of net investments in the Company’s European operations. For more information, 
refer to Note 9 “Financial Instruments, Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements.”
In January 2016, PPG’s $250 million 1.9% notes matured, and the Company repaid these obligations using cash on hand.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

2015 Activities
In December 2015, PPG entered into a five-year credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with several banks and financial 
institutions. The Credit Agreement replaced the Company's Five Year Credit Agreement dated as of September 12, 2012. 
The Credit Agreement provides for a $1.8 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. The Company has the ability to increase 
the size of the Credit Agreement by up to an additional $500 million, subject to the receipt of lender commitments and other 
conditions. The Credit Agreement will terminate on December 18, 2020. The Company has the right, subject to certain 
conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, to designate certain subsidiaries of the Company as borrowers under the Credit 
Agreement. In connection with any such designation, the Company is required to guarantee the obligations of any such 
subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement during the years 
ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The available borrowing rate on a one month, U.S. dollar denominated borrowing was 
2.56% at December 31, 2017.
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be made in U.S. dollars or in euros. The Credit Agreement provides that loans 
will bear interest at rates based, at the Company’s option, on one of two specified base rates plus a margin based on certain 
formulas defined in the Credit Agreement. Additionally, the Credit Agreement contains a Commitment Fee, as defined in the 
Credit Agreement, on the amount of unused commitments under the Credit Agreement ranging from 0.080% to 0.225% per 
annum. The average Commitment Fee in 2017 was 0.09%, and PPG is committed to pay 0.09% in 2018.
The  Credit Agreement  also  supports  the  Company’s  commercial  paper  borrowings.  There  were  no  commercial  paper 
borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.
The Credit  Agreement contains usual and customary restrictive covenants for facilities of its type, which include, with specified 
exceptions, limitations on the Company’s ability to create liens or other encumbrances, to enter into sale and leaseback 
transactions and to enter into consolidations, mergers or transfers of all or substantially all of its assets. The Credit  Agreement 
maintains the same restrictive covenant as the prior credit agreement whereby the Company must maintain a ratio of Total 
Indebtedness to Total Capitalization, as defined in the Credit Agreement, of 60% or less. As of December 31, 2017, total 
indebtedness was 41% of the Company’s total capitalization. 
The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including the failure to make timely payments when due 
under the Credit Agreement or other material indebtedness, the failure to satisfy covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, 
a change in control of the Company and specified events of bankruptcy and insolvency that would permit the lenders to 
accelerate the repayment of any loans.
In June 2015, PPG’s €300 million 3.875% notes matured and the Company repaid these obligations using $336 million of 
cash on hand.
In March 2015, PPG completed a public offering of €600 million 0.875% notes due 2022 and €600 million 1.400% Notes due 
2027, or €1.2 billion ($1.26 billion) in aggregate principal amount.  These notes were issued pursuant to PPG’s existing shelf 
registration statement and pursuant to an indenture between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, 
N.A., as trustee, as supplemented. The Indenture governing these notes contains covenants that limit the Company’s ability 
to, among other things, incur certain liens securing indebtedness, engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions, and enter 
into certain consolidations, mergers, conveyances, transfers or leases of all or substantially all the Company’s assets. The 
terms of these notes also require the Company to make an offer to repurchase notes upon a Change of Control Triggering 
Event (as defined in the Indenture) at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 
Company may issue additional debt from time to time pursuant to the Indenture.
The aggregate cash proceeds from the notes, net of discounts and fees, was $1.24 billion.  The notes are denominated in 
euro and have been designated as hedges of net investments in the Company’s European operations. For more information, 
refer to Note 9 “Financial Instruments, Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements.”
Restrictive Covenants and Cross-Default Provisions
As of December 31, 2017, PPG was in full compliance with the restrictive covenants under its various credit agreements, 
loan agreements and indentures. 
Additionally, the Company’s Credit Agreement contains customary cross-default provisions. These provisions provide that a 
default on a debt service payment of $50 million or more for longer than the grace period provided under another agreement 
may result in an event of default under this agreement. The Company’s 9% non-callable debentures also contain a customary 
cross default provision triggered by the Company’s default on a debt service payment of $10 million or more. None of the 
Company’s primary debt obligations are secured or guaranteed by the Company’s affiliates.

Lines of Credit, Letters of Credit, Surety Bonds and Guarantees
PPG’s  non-U.S.  operations  have  uncommitted  lines  of  credit  totaling  $589  million  of  which  $2  million  was  used  as  of 
December 31, 2017. These uncommitted lines of credit are subject to cancellation at any time and are generally not subject 
to any commitment fees.
The Company had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $163 million and $160 million as of December 31, 2017 
and 2016, respectively. The letters of credit secure the Company’s performance to third parties under certain self-insurance 
programs and other commitments made in the ordinary course of business. 
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, guarantees outstanding were $14 million and $12 million, respectively. The guarantees 
relate primarily to debt of certain entities in which PPG has an ownership interest and selected customers of certain PPG 
businesses. A portion of such debt is secured by the assets of the related entities. The carrying value of these guarantees 
were $1 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016 and the fair values of these guarantees were $1 million at December 31, 
2017 and 2016. The fair value of each guarantee was estimated by comparing the net present value of two hypothetical cash 
flow streams, one based on PPG’s incremental borrowing rate and the other based on the borrower’s incremental borrowing 
rate, as of the effective date of the guarantee. Both streams were discounted at a risk free rate of return. The Company does 
not believe any loss related to these letters of credit, surety bonds or guarantees is likely.
9. Financial Instruments, Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements
Financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash held in escrow, marketable equity 
securities, accounts receivable, company-owned life insurance, accounts payable, short-term and long-term debt instruments, 
and derivatives. The fair values of these financial instruments approximated their carrying values at December 31, 2017 and 
2016, in the aggregate, except for long-term debt instruments.

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      57

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Hedging Activities
The Company has exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and had 
exposure to PPG’s stock price changes. As a result, financial instruments, including derivatives, have been used to hedge 
these underlying economic exposures. Certain of these instruments qualify as cash flow, fair value and net investment hedges 
upon meeting the requisite criteria, including effectiveness of offsetting hedged or underlying exposures. Changes in the fair 
value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized in income from continuing operations in the 
period incurred. 
PPG’s  policies  do  not  permit  speculative  use  of  derivative  financial  instruments.  PPG  enters  into  derivative  financial 
instruments with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions among such counterparties in order to reduce 
its exposure to credit losses. The Company did not realize a credit loss on derivatives during the three-year period ended 
December 31, 2017.
All of PPG’s outstanding derivative instruments are subject to accelerated settlement in the event of PPG’s failure to meet 
its debt or payment obligations under the terms of the instruments’ contractual provisions. In addition, should the Company 
be acquired and its payment obligations under the derivative instruments’ contractual arrangements not be assumed by the 
acquirer, or should PPG enter into bankruptcy, receivership or reorganization proceedings, the instruments would also be 
subject to accelerated settlement.
In 2017 and 2016, there were no derivative instruments de-designated or discontinued as a hedging instrument. There were 
no gains or losses deferred in AOCI that were reclassified to income from continuing operations during the three-year period 
ended December 31, 2017 related to hedges of anticipated transactions that were no longer expected to occur.
Fair Value Hedges
In prior years, PPG designated certain foreign currency forward contracts as hedges against the Company’s exposure to 
future changes in fair value of certain firm sales commitments denominated in foreign currencies. 
Prior to June 2016, PPG entered into renewable equity forward arrangements to hedge the impact to PPG's income from 
continuing operations for changes in the fair value of 2,777,778 shares of PPG stock that were contributed to the asbestos 
settlement trust as discussed in Note 13, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.” These financial instruments were recorded 
at fair value as assets or liabilities and changes in the fair value of these financial instruments are reflected in the “Asbestos 
settlement – net” caption of the accompanying consolidated statement of income. The total principal amount paid for these 
shares was approximately $60 million. During the terms of these equity forward arrangements, PPG paid to the counterparty 
interest based on the principal amount and the counterparty paid to PPG an amount equal to the dividends paid on these 
shares which reduced the transaction price by approximately $10 million, net. The difference between the principal amount 
and any amounts related to unpaid interest or dividends and the market price for these shares, adjusted for credit risk, 
represented the fair value of these financial instruments as well as the amount that PPG received when the counterparty 
chose to settle these financial instruments. In conjunction with the funding of the asbestos settlement trust, the equity forward 
arrangements were settled. At settlement, in June 2016, the fair value of the equity forward arrangement was an asset of 
$258 million. 
The Company has used interest rate swaps from time to time to manage it’s exposure to changing interest rates. When 
outstanding, the interest rate swaps were designated as fair value hedges of certain outstanding debt obligations of the 
Company and were recorded at fair value. There were no interest rate swaps outstanding as of December 31, 2017 and 
2016. However, in prior years, PPG settled interest rate swaps and received cash. The fair value adjustment of the debt at 
the time the interest rate swaps were settled is still being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining 
term of the related debt, the impact of which is insignificant. 
Cash Flow Hedges
PPG designates certain foreign currency forward contracts as cash flow hedges of the Company’s exposure to variability in 
exchange rates on intercompany and third party transactions denominated in foreign currencies. As of December 31, 2017
and 2016, the fair value of all foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was a net asset of $3 million
and $13 million, respectively. 
Net Investment Hedges
PPG uses cross currency swaps, foreign currency forward contracts and euro-denominated debt to hedge a significant portion 
of its net investment in its European operations, as follows:  
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, U.S. dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of $560 
million were outstanding and are scheduled to expire in March 2018. On settlement of the remaining outstanding contracts, 
PPG will receive $560 million U.S. dollars and pay euros to the counterparties. During the term of these contracts, PPG  

58 

 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

receives semiannual payments in March and September of each year based on a U.S. dollar, long-term interest rate fixed 
as of the contract inception date, and PPG makes annual payments in March of each year to the counterparties based on a 
euro, long-term interest rate fixed as of the contract inception date. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the fair value of 
these contracts was an asset of $2 million and $65 million, respectively.
At  December 31,  2017  and  2016,  PPG  had  designated €2.3  billion and €2.8  billion,  respectively,  of  euro-denominated 
borrowings as hedges of a portion of its net investment in the Company’s European operations. The carrying value of these 
instruments at December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively.
During 2017, 2016 and 2015, PPG used foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in its 
European operations. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments were recorded in AOCI as gains or losses. 
As of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, none of these contracts remained outstanding. The Company paid $3 million to 
settle a foreign currency forward contract in 2017. In 2016, no cash proceeds were received from the settlement of these 
contracts and, in 2015, PPG received cash proceeds of $19 million from the settlement of these contracts.
Other Financial Instruments
PPG uses foreign currency forward contracts to manage net transaction exposures that do not qualify for hedge accounting; 
therefore, the change in the fair value of these instruments is recorded in “Other charges” in the accompanying consolidated 
statement of income in the period of change. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the fair value of these contracts were a 
liability of $20 million and an asset of $2 million, respectively. 
Gains/Losses Deferred in AOCI
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had accumulated pre-tax unrealized translation gains in AOCI related to 
the euro-denominated borrowings, foreign currency forward contracts, and the cross currency swaps of $16 million and $482 
million, respectively. 
The following tables summarize the location and amount of gains (losses) related to derivative and debt financial instruments 
for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. All dollar amounts are shown on a pre-tax basis.

Fair Value Measurements
The Company follows a fair value measurement hierarchy to measure its assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2017
and 2016, respectively, the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were cash equivalents, equity 
securities and derivatives. In addition, the Company measures its pension plan assets at fair value (see Note 12, “Employee 
Benefit Plans” for further details). The Company’s financial assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from the following 
three levels: 

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      59

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the Company has the 
ability to access at the measurement date. Level 1 inputs are considered to be the most reliable evidence of fair value as 
they are based on unadjusted quoted market prices from various financial information service providers and securities 
exchanges. 
Level 2 inputs are directly or indirectly observable prices that are not quoted on active exchanges, which include quoted 
prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 
that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and inputs that are derived 
principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. The fair values of the derivative 
instruments reflect the instruments’ contractual terms, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based 
inputs, including forward curves. 
Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs employed for measuring the fair value of assets or liabilities. The Company does not 
have any recurring financial assets or liabilities that are recorded in its consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017
and 2016 that are classified as Level 3 inputs.

The fair values of the debt instruments were based on discounted cash flows and interest rates then currently available to 
the Company for instruments of the same remaining maturities and were measured using level 2 inputs.
Assets and liabilities reported at fair value on a nonrecurring basis
There were no significant adjustments to the fair value of nonmonetary assets or liabilities during the year ended December 31, 
2017. In conjunction with the 2016 restructuring actions, certain nonmonetary assets were written down to their fair value. 
Refer to Note 7, “Business Restructuring” for further details associated with these actions.”
Call and put option on noncontrolling interest
PPG owns a majority interest in a coatings business whose financial results are included in PPG’s consolidated financial 
statements. PPG has recorded the noncontrolling interest in this consolidated affiliate as a liability instead of equity in its 
consolidated balance sheets due to call and put option provisions associated with the noncontrolling interest, which have 
similar terms. This liability was $44 million and $38 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) which, among other things lowered the U.S. 
corporate statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminated certain deductible items and added other deductible items 
for corporations, imposed a tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings and eliminated U.S. taxes on most future foreign earnings. 
In December 2017, the Company recorded a net tax charge of $134 million related to the Act. The net charge consists of the 
tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings of approximately $250 million and a charge of approximately $125 million related to 
the remeasurement of PPG’s U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new enacted statutory rate. These charges were 
partially offset by a benefit from the reversal of an existing deferred tax liability on repatriated foreign earnings of approximately 
$150 million and a benefit resulting from PPG’s decision to accelerate recognition of certain U.S. tax attributes during the 
fourth quarter. 
The net charge recorded as a provisional amount as of December 31, 2017 represents the Company’s best estimate using 
information available as of February 1, 2018. The Company anticipates U.S. regulatory agencies will issue further regulations 
during 2018, which may alter this estimate. The Company is still evaluating among other things, its position with respect to 
permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings overseas and other related outside basis difference considerations and the 
amount of tax owed on unrepatriated earnings by subsidiaries. The Company believes its remeasurement of the U.S deferred 
tax assets and liabilities is complete, except for changes in estimates that can result from finalizing the filing of our 2017 U.S. 
income tax return, which are not anticipated to be material, and changes that may be a direct impact of other provisional 
amounts recorded due to the enactment of the Act. The Company will refine its estimates to incorporate new or better 
information as it comes available through the filing date of its 2017 U.S. income tax returns in the fourth quarter of 2018.
The tax owed by PPG on its unrepatriated foreign earnings is payable over eight years and is subject to a prescriptive 
calculation to determine the portion payable in 2018 and beyond. PPG’s current estimate, using this prescriptive method, 
indicates its tax payable will be increased by approximately $1 million to $3 million per year through 2025.  As such, the 
portion of the tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings not payable within the next 12 months is presented within “Other liabilities” 
on the consolidated balance sheet.
The total tax expense for 2017 also includes a deferred tax benefit of $22 million related to the $60 million of pre-tax pension 
settlement charges discussed in Note 12, “Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits.” During 2016, the Company recorded 
a $151 million net tax charge associated with the funding of the Pittsburgh Corning (“PC”) asbestos settlement trust (the 
“Trust”) described in Note 13, "Commitments and Contingent Liabilities." Further, in conjunction with the funding of the Trust, 
PPG provided taxes on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries and recorded one-time book tax benefits for its contribution 
of the Company's ownership interest in PC's European subsidiary to the Trust and for a change in the measurement of certain 
deferred tax liabilities. 
In 2017 and 2016, U.S. deferred tax on foreign earnings includes the remeasurement of a U.S. deferred tax liability to 
repatriate foreign earnings on which PPG has not asserted permanent reinvestment in the foreign jurisdiction. 
Income (Loss) before income taxes of the Company’s U.S. operations for 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $716 million, $(204) 
million and $693 million, respectively. Income before income taxes of the Company’s foreign operations for 2017, 2016 and 
2015 was $1,292 million, $990 million and $1,052 million, respectively.

A valuation allowance of $170 million and $119 million has been established for carry-forwards at December 31, 2017 and 
2016, when the ability to utilize them is not likely.
Undistributed foreign earnings
The Company had $3.4 billion and $5.3 billion of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 
and 2016, respectively. These amounts relate to approximately 250 subsidiaries in approximately 75 taxable jurisdictions. 
The Company estimates repatriation of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 
would have resulted in a U.S. tax cost of approximately $30 million (assuming tax reform) and $350 million, respectively. 
Over  the  past  several  years,  PPG  has  established  deferred  tax  liabilities  on  certain  undistributed  earnings,  namely  in 
connection with divestitures and the funding of the Pittsburgh Corning Asbestos Trust (refer to Note 13, “Commitments and 
Contingent Liabilities”). At December 31, 2016, the expected future tax cost to repatriate these foreign earnings which were 
not permanently reinvested totaled $189 million. At December 31, 2016, no significant deferred U.S. income taxes had been 
provided on the remaining $3.5 billion of PPG’s undistributed earnings as they were considered to be reinvested for an 
indefinite period of time or will be repatriated when it is tax effective to do so. 
In 2017, in conjunction with the enactment of the Act, PPG owes U.S. tax on substantially all unrepatriated earnings. As of 
December 31, 2017, the Company has provisionally not changed its intention to reinvest foreign earnings indefinitely or 
repatriate when it is tax effective to do so, and as such has not established a liability for foreign withholding taxes or other 
costs that would be incurred if the earnings were repatriated.

Unrecognized tax benefits
The Company files federal, state and local income tax returns in numerous domestic and foreign jurisdictions. In most tax 
jurisdictions, returns are subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities for a number of years after the returns have 
been filed. The Company is no longer subject to examinations by tax authorities in any major tax jurisdiction for years before 
2006. Additionally, the Internal Revenue Service has completed its examination of the Company’s U.S. federal income tax 
returns filed for years through 2011. The examinations of the Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for 2012 through 
2013 are currently underway.
A reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits (excluding interest and penalties) as of December 31

12. Employee Benefit Plans
Defined Benefit Plans
PPG has defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees worldwide. The principal defined benefit pension plans 
are those in the U.S., Canada, the Netherlands and the U.K. These plans in the aggregate represent approximately 93% of 
the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2017, of which the U.S. defined benefit pension plans represent the largest 
component.  
U.S. defined benefit plans
As of January 1, 2006, the Company closed the salaried defined benefit plans to new entrants. The defined benefit plan of 
certain hourly employees was closed to new entrants in 2006 or thereafter. Eligible employees participate in a defined 
contribution retirement plan. In 2011, the Company approved amendments related to certain U.S. defined benefit plans so 
that depending upon the affected employee’s combined age and years of service to PPG, certain employees stopped or will 
stop accruing benefits either during 2011 or in 2020. The affected employees will participate in the Company’s defined 
contribution retirement plans from the date their benefits under their respective defined benefit plans are frozen. The Company 
has amended other defined benefit plans in other countries in a similar way and plans to continue reviewing and potentially 
changing other PPG defined benefit plans in the future.
U.S. pension annuity contracts
In June 2016, the Company entered into a Definitive Purchase Agreement by and among the Company, Massachusetts 
Mutual Life Insurance Company (“MassMutual”) and State Street Bank & Trust Company (“State Street”), as independent 
fiduciary to the Company’s United States defined benefit pension plans (the “Plans”), and a Definitive Purchase Agreement 
by and among the Company, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (“MetLife”) and State Street. In August 2016, pursuant 
to the two Definitive Purchase Agreements, the Plans purchased group annuity contracts that irrevocably transferred to the

two insurance companies certain pension benefit obligations for approximately 13,200 of the Company’s retirees in the United 
States who started receiving their monthly retirement benefit payments on or before April 1, 2016. The value of the benefit 
obligation of each affected former salaried employee’s retirement benefit obligation is irrevocably guaranteed by, and split 
equally between, MassMutual and MetLife. Pursuant to these Definitive Purchase Agreements, MassMutual serves as the 
lead administrator. The value of each affected former hourly employee’s retirement benefit obligation is irrevocably guaranteed 
by MetLife, and MetLife will serve as the administrator. The amount of each affected retiree’s annuity payment is equal to 
the amount of such individual’s pension benefit. The purchase of group annuity contracts was funded directly by the assets 
of the Plans. By irrevocably transferring the obligations and assets to MassMutual and MetLife, the Company reduced its 
overall pension projected benefit obligation by approximately $1.6 billion and recognized a non-cash pension settlement 
charge of approximately $535 million after-tax ($857 million pre-tax).
Following the transfer of the aforementioned U.S. retiree obligations and assets to third party insurers, PPG contributed $29 
million and $146 million to its U.S. plans in 2017 and 2016, respectively. These contributions were funded using cash on 
hand. 
During 2016, as a result of the purchase of group annuity contracts, PPG merged two of its qualified defined benefit pension 
plans that contained retired plan participants into one surviving plan. In conjunction with the merger and purchase of group 
annuity contracts, PPG remeasured its qualified pension plan benefit obligations using prevailing discount rates as of July 
31, 2016 which averaged 3.6% as compared to a 4.5% discount rate as of December 31, 2015. The remeasurement increased 
the Company's cumulative pension benefit obligation of its remaining plans by $306 million and increased the Company's 
full year 2016 qualified defined benefit pension expense by approximately $10 million.
Canadian pension annuity contracts
In 2016, the Company purchased group annuity contracts that transferred pension benefit obligations for certain of the 
Company’s retirees and terminated vested participants in Canada who started receiving their monthly retirement benefit 
payments on or before April 1, 2016 to Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (“Sun Life”) and The Canada Life Assurance 
Company (“Canada Life”). The amount of each affected retiree’s annuity payment is equal to the amount of such individual’s 
pension benefit. The purchase of group annuity contracts was funded directly by the assets of the Canadian plans. By 
transferring the obligations and assets to Sun Life and Canada Life, the Company reduced its overall pension projected 
benefit obligation by approximately $200 million and recognized a non-cash pension settlement charge of $47 million after-
tax ($64 million pre-tax). The Company made voluntary contributions aggregating $7 million to the Canadian plans in 2016 
related to the pension annuity contracts. These contributions were funded using cash on hand. 
Sale of the flat glass business
In 2016, PPG completed the sale of its flat glass business as discussed in Note 2, “Acquisitions and Divestitures.” PPG 
transferred to Vitro certain defined benefit pension liabilities resulting in a settlement charge of $11 million which is included 
in the net gain on the sale of the flat glass business. This transaction lowered the projected benefit obligation of PPG’s defined 
benefit pension plan by approximately $100 million. PPG transferred pension assets of $55 million in 2016 in connection 
with the sale and expects to transfer an additional $5 million to $10 million of pension assets in 2018. 
Sale of the European fiber glass business
In 2016, PPG completed the sale of its European fiber glass business as discussed in Note 2, “Acquisitions and Divestitures.” 
PPG transferred to NEG certain defined benefit pension liabilities resulting in a net settlement charge of $46 million. This 
amount is included in Income from discontinued operations, net of tax in 2016.This transaction lowered the projected benefit 
obligation  of  PPG’s  defined  benefit  pension  plans  by  approximately  $340  million.  PPG  transferred  pension  assets  of 
approximately $250 million in connection with the sale. 
Postretirement medical 
PPG sponsors welfare benefit plans that provide postretirement medical and life insurance benefits for certain U.S. and 
Canadian employees and their dependents of which the U.S. welfare benefit plans represent approximately 85% of the 
projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2017. Salaried and certain hourly employees in the U.S. hired on or after October 
1, 2004, or rehired on or after October 1, 2012 are not eligible for postretirement medical benefits. 
The U.S. welfare benefit plans include an Employee Group Waiver Plan (“EGWP”) for certain Medicare-eligible retirees and 
their dependents which includes a fully-insured Medicare Part D prescription drug plan. As such, PPG is not eligible to receive 
the federal subsidy provided under the Medicare Act of 2003 for these retirees and their dependents. 
These plans in the U.S. and Canada require retiree contributions based on retiree-selected coverage levels for certain retirees 
and their dependents and provide for sharing of future benefit cost increases between PPG and participants based on 
management discretion. The Company has the right to modify, amend or terminate certain of these benefit plans in the future.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

In 2016, the Company communicated plan design changes to certain Medicare-eligible retiree plan participants. Effective 
January 1, 2017, the Company-sponsored Medicare-eligible plans were replaced by a Medicare private exchange. By offering 
retiree health coverage through a private Medicare exchange, PPG is able to provide Medicare-eligible participants with 
more choice of plans and plan designs, greater flexibility, and different price points for coverage.  Beginning January 1, 2017, 
PPG’s contribution for health care coverage related to Medicare-eligible retirees is in the form of a tax-free account known 
as a Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA). The HRA can be used to pay for health care and prescription drug plan 
premiums and certain out-of-pocket medical costs; unused funds can be carried over to future years. 
The announcement of these plan design changes triggered a remeasurement of PPG’s retiree medical benefit obligation 
using prevailing interest rates. The plan design change resulted in a $306 million reduction in the Company's postretirement 
benefit obligation. PPG accounted for the plan design change prospectively, and the plan design change will be amortized 
to periodic postretirement benefit cost over a 5.6 year period.
The following table sets forth the changes in projected benefit obligations (“PBO”) (as calculated as of December 31), plan

The PBO is the actuarial present value of benefits attributable to employee service rendered to date, including the effects of 
estimated  future  pay  increases.  The  accumulated  benefit  obligation  (“ABO”)  is  the  actuarial  present  value  of  benefits 
attributable to employee service rendered to date, but does not include the effects of estimated future pay increases. The 
ABO  for  all  defined  benefit  pension  plans  as  of  December 31,  2017  and  2016  was  $3,382  million  and  $3,171  million, 
respectively.

The accumulated net actuarial losses for pensions and other postretirement benefits relate primarily to historical declines in 
the discount rate as well as updated mortality assumptions. The accumulated net actuarial losses exceed 10% of the higher 
of the market value of plan assets or the PBO at the beginning of the year, therefore, amortization of such excess has been 
included in net periodic benefit costs for pension and other postretirement benefits in each of the last three years. The 
amortization period is the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits unless a plan 
is mostly inactive in which case the amortization period is the average remaining life expectancy of the plan participants. 
Accumulated prior service cost (credit) is amortized over the future service periods of those employees who are active at 
the dates of the plan amendments and who are expected to receive benefits.
The net decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss (pre-tax) in 2017 relating to defined benefit pension and other 
postretirement benefits is primarily attributable to pension settlement charges and other postretirement plan design changes,
as follows:

The 2017 net actuarial loss related to the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans of $3 million was primarily 
due to a decrease in the weighted average discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation at December 31, 2017, 
partially offset by asset performance gains in excess of the expected return on plan assets for the year. 
The estimated amount of accumulated net actuarial loss for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from 
accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost in 2018 is $68 million. The estimated amounts of 
accumulated net actuarial loss and prior service (credit) for the other postretirement benefit plans that will be amortized from 
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic benefit cost in 2018 are $17 million and $(60) million, 
respectively.

consolidated statements of income. 
Key assumptions
The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the benefit obligation for the Company’s defined benefit 
pension and other postretirement plans as of December 31, 2017 and 2016:

Discount rate(1)
Rate of compensation increase

2017
3.2%
1.3%

2016
3.7%
1.6%

(1)  The discount rate for U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans was 3.7% and 4.3% as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for the Company’s defined 
benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017:

Discount rate
Expected return on assets
Rate of compensation increase

2017
3.6%
5.4%
1.3%

2016
3.6%
6.1%
1.6%

2015
3.8%
6.1%
2.0%

These  assumptions  for  each  plan  are  reviewed  on  an  annual  basis.  In  determining  the  expected  return  on  plan  asset 
assumption, the Company evaluates the mix of investments that comprise each plan’s assets and external forecasts of future 
long-term investment returns. The Company compares the expected return on plan assets assumption to actual historic 
returns to ensure reasonability. For 2017, the return on plan assets assumption for PPG’s U.S. defined benefit pension plans 
was 7.5%. A change in the rate of return of 1 percentage point, with other assumptions held constant, would impact 2017 
net periodic pension expense by $11 million. The global expected return on plan assets assumption to be used in determining 
2018 net periodic pension expense will be 5.30% (7.40% for the U.S. plans only).
The discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined by reference to a current 
yield curve and by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments. In 2016, the Company changed 
the method it uses to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other 
postretirement  benefit  costs  for  substantially  all  of  its  U.S.  and  foreign  plans.  Historically,  the  service  and  interest  cost 
components were estimated using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure 
the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. The Company has elected to use a full yield curve approach 
(“Split-rate” method) in the estimation of these components of benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield 
curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. The Company made this change 
to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide 
a more precise measurement of service and interest costs. This change does not affect the measurement of the Company’s 
total benefit obligations. The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate and, accordingly, began recognizing 
its effect in fiscal year 2016. A change in the discount rate of 1 percentage point, with all other assumptions held constant, 
would impact 2018 net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by 
$22 million and $26 million, respectively.
In 2017, the Company updated mortality tables used to calculate its U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement 
benefit liabilities. The Company considered the available mortality tables released by the Society of Actuaries’ Retirement 

68 

 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Plans Experience Committee and performed a review of its own mortality history, as well the industry in which the Company 
operates to assess future improvements in mortality rates based on its U.S. population.  The Company chose to value its 
U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement  benefit liabilities using a slightly modified assumption of future mortality 
which better approximates our plan participant population. 
The weighted-average healthcare cost trend rate (inflation) used for 2017 was 6.1% declining to a projected 4.5% in the year 
2024. For 2018, the assumed weighted-average healthcare cost trend rate used will be 5.8% declining to a projected 4.5%
between 2019 and 2039 for medical and prescription drug costs, respectively. These assumptions are reviewed on an annual 
basis. In selecting rates for current and long-term health care cost assumptions, the Company takes into consideration a 
number of factors, including the Company’s actual health care cost increases, the design of the Company’s benefit programs, 
the demographics of the Company’s active and retiree populations and external expectations of future medical cost inflation 
rates. If these 2018 health care cost trend rates were increased or decreased by one percentage point per year, such increase 
or decrease would have the following effects:

($ in millions)
Increase (decrease) in the aggregate of service and interest cost components of annual expense
Increase (decrease) in the benefit obligation

(a)   During 2016 and 2015, U.S. contributions totaling $12 million and $26 million associated with the former glass segment were recast as cash flows 

from operations - discontinued operations and are excluded from the table above.

(b)    During 2016 non-U.S. contributions totaling $4 million associated with the former European fiberglass business were recast as cash flows from 

operations - discontinued operations and are excluded from the table above.

Substantially all contributions made to PPG’s non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2017 and 2016 were required by 
local funding requirements. PPG expects to make mandatory contributions to its non-U.S. plans in the range of $20 million
to $30 million in 2018. PPG contributed $25 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans in January 2018. PPG may make 
voluntary contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2018 and beyond.

U.S. Qualified Pension 
Beginning in 2012, the Company initiated a lump sum payout program that gave certain terminated vested participants in 
certain U.S. defined benefit pension plans the option to take a one-time lump sum cash payment in lieu of receiving a future 
monthly annuity.  During 2017, PPG paid $87 million in lump sum benefits to terminated vested participants who elected to 
participate in the program.  As the lump-sum payments were in excess of the expected 2017 service and interest costs for 
the qualified pension plans, PPG remeasured the periodic benefit obligation of the qualified plans and recorded a settlement 
charge totaling $35 million ($22 million after-tax).
U.S. Non-qualified Pension 
In the first quarter 2017, PPG made lump-sum payments to certain retirees who had participated in PPG's U.S. non-qualified 
pension plan (the "Nonqualified Plan") totaling approximately $40 million. As the lump-sum payments were in excess of the 

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      69

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

expected 2017 service and interest costs for the Nonqualified Plan, PPG remeasured the periodic benefit obligation of the 
Nonqualified Plan as of March 1, 2017 and recorded a settlement charge totaling $22 million ($14 million after-tax).
Plan assets
Each PPG sponsored defined benefit pension plan is managed in accordance with the requirements of local laws and 
regulations governing defined benefit pension plans for the exclusive purpose of providing pension benefits to participants 
and their beneficiaries. Investment committees comprised of PPG managers have fiduciary responsibility to oversee the 
management of pension plan assets by third party asset managers. Pension plan assets are held in trust by financial institutions 
and managed on a day-to-day basis by the asset managers. The asset managers receive a mandate from each investment 
committee that is aligned with the asset allocation targets established by each investment committee to achieve the plan’s 
investment strategies. The performance of the asset managers is monitored and evaluated by the investment committees 
throughout the year. 
Pension plan assets are invested to generate investment earnings over an extended time horizon to help fund the cost of 
benefits promised under the plans while mitigating investment risk. The asset allocation targets established for each pension 
plan are intended to diversify the investments among a variety of asset categories and among a variety of individual securities 
within each asset category to mitigate investment risk and provide each plan with sufficient liquidity to fund the payment of 
pension benefits to retirees.
The following summarizes the weighted average target pension plan asset allocation as of December 31, 2017 and 2016

Other debt securities consist of insurance contracts, which are externally valued by insurance companies based on the 
present value of the expected future cash flows. 
Hedge funds consist of a wide range of investments which target a relatively stable investment return. The underlying funds 
are valued at different frequencies, some monthly and some quarterly, based on the value of the underlying investments. 
Other assets consist primarily of small investments in private equity funds and senior secured debt obligations of non-
investment grade borrowers.
Retained liabilities and legacy settlement charges
PPG has retained certain liabilities for defined benefit pension and postretirement benefits earned for service up to the date 
of sale of its former automotive glass and service business for employees who were active as of the divestiture date and for 
individuals who were retirees of the business as of the divestiture date, totaling $369 million and $342 million at December 31, 
2017 and 2016, respectively, for employees who were active as of the divestiture date and for individuals who were retirees 
of the business as of the divestiture date. PPG recognized expense of $2 million, $20 million and $17 million related to these 
obligations in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. 
There have been multiple PPG facility closures in Canada related to the former automotive glass and services business as 
well as other PPG businesses. These various plant closures have resulted in partial and full windups, and related settlement 
charges, of pension plans for various hourly and salary employees employed by these locations. The charges are recorded 
for the individual plans when a particular windup is approved by the Canadian pension authorities. The Company has made 
all contributions to the individual plan and has discharged the liability through either lump sum payments to participants or 
purchasing annuities.
During 2016, PPG completed the wind-up of two legacy Canadian plans and recorded after-tax wind-up charges totaling $34 
million ($47 million pre-tax). Cash contributions made in conjunction with these windups were approximately $1 million. The 
Company recorded a settlement charge of $7 million in 2015 related to legacy plant closures. We expect limited additional 
settlement charges related to these legacy plant closures; although the Company retains the right to continue to review and 
potentially change other PPG defined benefit plans in the future.
Other Plans
Defined contribution plans
The Company has defined contribution plans for certain employees in the U.S., China, United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, and 
other countries. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, the Company recognized expense for its defined 
contribution retirement plans of $57 million, $70 million and $60 million, respectively. The Company’s annual cash contributions 
to its defined contribution retirement plans approximated the expense recognized in each year. As of December 31, 2017
and 2016, the Company’s obligation for contributions to be made to its defined contribution retirement plans was $15 million
and $11 million, respectively.
Employee savings plan
PPG’s Employee Savings Plan (“Savings Plan”) covers substantially all employees in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada. 
The Company makes matching contributions to the Savings Plan, at management’s discretion, based upon participants’ 
savings, subject to certain limitations. For most participants not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, Company-
matching contributions are established each year at the discretion of the Company and are applied to participant savings up 
to a maximum of 6% of eligible participant compensation. For those participants whose employment is covered by a collective 
bargaining agreement, the level of Company-matching contribution, if any, is determined by the relevant collective bargaining 
agreement. The Company-matching contribution remained at 100% for 2017.
In 2016, the Company terminated its U.S. defined contribution plan and subsequently merged the plan into the Savings Plan. 
Under the combined plan, eligible employees will continue to receive a contribution equal to between 2% and 5% of annual 
compensation, based on age and years of service.
Compensation expense and cash contributions related to the Company match of participant contributions to the Savings 
Plan for 2017, 2016, and 2015 totaled $46 million, $48 million and $44 million, respectively. A portion of the Savings Plan 
qualifies under the Internal Revenue Code as an Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Accordingly, dividends received on PPG 
shares held in that portion of the Savings Plan totaling $14 million, $14 million and $13 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, 
respectively, are deductible for U.S. Federal tax purposes.
Deferred compensation plan
The Company has a deferred compensation plan for certain key managers which allows them to defer a portion of their 
compensation in a phantom PPG stock account or other phantom investment accounts. The amount deferred earns a return 
based on the investment options selected by the participant. The amount owed to participants is an unfunded and unsecured 

72 

 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

general obligation of the Company. Upon retirement, death, disability, termination of employment, scheduled payment or 
unforeseen emergency, the compensation deferred and related accumulated earnings are distributed in accordance with the 
participant’s election in cash or in PPG stock, based on the accounts selected by the participant.
The plan provides participants with investment alternatives and the ability to transfer amounts between the phantom non-
PPG stock investment accounts. To mitigate the impact on compensation expense of changes in the market value of the 
liability, the Company has purchased a portfolio of marketable securities that mirror the phantom non-PPG stock investment 
accounts selected by the participants, except the money market accounts. These investments are carried by PPG at fair 
market value, and the changes in market value of these securities are also included in income from continuing operations. 
Trading occurs in this portfolio to align the securities held with the participant’s phantom non-PPG stock investment accounts, 
except the money market accounts.
The cost of the deferred compensation plan, comprised of dividend equivalents accrued on the phantom PPG stock account, 
investment income and the change in market value of the liability, was $19 million, $7 million and $5 million in 2017, 2016
and 2015, respectively. These amounts are included in “Selling, general and administrative” in the accompanying consolidated 
statements of income. The change in market value of the investment portfolio was income of $18 million, $5 million, and $3 
million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and is also included in “Selling, general and administrative.”
The Company’s obligations under this plan, which are included in “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities” and “Other 
liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, totaled $121 million and $124 million as of December 31, 2017
and 2016, respectively, and the investments in marketable securities, which are included in “Investments” and “Other current 
assets” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, were $83 million and $82 million as of December 31, 2017 and 
2016, respectively.
13. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities
PPG is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against 
others,  in  which  substantial  monetary  damages  are  sought. These  lawsuits  and  claims  may  relate  to  contract,  patent, 
environmental, product liability, antitrust, employment and other matters arising out of the conduct of PPG’s current and past 
business activities. To the extent that these lawsuits and claims involve personal injury and property damage, PPG believes 
it has adequate insurance; however, certain of PPG’s insurers are contesting coverage with respect to some of these claims, 
and other insurers, as they had prior to the asbestos settlement described below, may contest coverage with respect to some 
of the asbestos claims if the settlement is not implemented. PPG’s lawsuits and claims against others include claims against 
insurers and other third parties with respect to actual and contingent losses related to environmental, asbestos and other 
matters. 
The results of any current or future litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable. However, management believes that, 
in the aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving PPG will not have a material effect on PPG’s consolidated 
financial position or liquidity; however, such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in 
which costs, if any, are recognized.
Asbestos matters 
Prior to 2000, the Company had been named as a defendant in numerous claims alleging bodily injury from (i) exposure to 
asbestos-containing products allegedly manufactured, sold or distributed by the Company, its subsidiaries, or for which they 
are otherwise alleged to be liable; (ii) exposure to asbestos allegedly present at a facility owned or leased by the Company; 
or (iii) exposure to asbestos-containing products of Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (“PC”) for which the Company was alleged 
to be liable under a variety of legal theories (the Company and Corning Incorporated were each 50% shareholders in PC). 
Pittsburgh Corning Corporation asbestos bankruptcy 
In 2000, PC filed for Chapter 11 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania in an effort to permanently 
and comprehensively resolve all of its pending and future asbestos-related liability claims. At the time of the bankruptcy filing, 
the Company had been named as one of many defendants in approximately 114,000 open claims. The Bankruptcy Court 
subsequently entered a series of orders preliminarily enjoining the prosecution of asbestos litigation against PPG until after 
the effective date of a confirmed PC plan of reorganization. During the pendency of this preliminary injunction staying asbestos 
litigation against PPG, PPG and certain of its historical liability insurers negotiated a settlement with representatives of present 
and future asbestos claimants. That settlement was incorporated into a PC plan of reorganization that was confirmed by the 
Bankruptcy Court on May 24, 2013 and ultimately became effective on April 27, 2016. With the effectiveness of the plan, the 
preliminary injunction staying the prosecution of asbestos litigation against PPG expired by its own terms on May 27, 2016. 
In accordance with the settlement, the Bankruptcy Court issued a permanent channeling injunction under Section 524(g) of 
the Bankruptcy Code that prohibits present and future claimants from asserting claims against PPG that arise, in whole or 
in part, out of exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products manufactured, sold and/or distributed by PC or asbestos 
on or emanating from any PC premises. The channeling injunction, by its terms, also prohibits codefendants in cases that 

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      73

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

are subject to the channeling injunction from asserting claims against PPG for contribution, indemnification or other recovery. 
The channeling injunction also precludes the prosecution of claims against PPG arising from alleged exposure to asbestos 
or asbestos-containing products to the extent that a claimant is alleging or seeking to impose liability, directly or indirectly, 
for the conduct of, claims against, or demands on PC by reason of PPG’s: (i) ownership of a financial interest in PC; (ii) 
involvement in the management of PC, or service as an officer, director or employee of PC or a related party; (iii) provision 
of insurance to PC or a related party; or (iv) involvement in a financial transaction affecting the financial condition of PC or 
a related party. The foregoing PC related claims are referred to as “PC Relationship Claims.” 
The channeling injunction channels the Company’s liability for PC Relationship Claims to a trust funded in part by PPG and 
its participating insurers for the benefit of current and future PC asbestos claimants (the “Trust”). The Trust is the sole recourse 
for holders of PC Relationship Claims. PPG and its affiliates have no further liability or responsibility for, and will be permanently 
protected from, pending and future PC Relationship Claims. The channeling injunction does not extend to present and future 
claims against PPG that arise out of alleged exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products historically manufactured, 
sold and/or distributed by PPG or its subsidiaries or for which they are alleged to be liable that are not PC Relationship 
Claims, and does not extend to claims against PPG alleging personal injury allegedly caused by asbestos on premises 
presently or formerly owned, leased or occupied by PPG. These claims are referred to as non-PC Relationship Claims.
In accordance with the PC plan of reorganization, PPG's equity interest in PC was canceled. PPG satisfied its funding 
obligations to the Trust on June 9, 2016, when it conveyed to the Trust the stock it owned in Pittsburgh Corning Europe and 
2,777,778 shares of PPG’s common stock and made a cash payment to the Trust in the amount of $764 million. PPG’s 
historical insurance carriers participating in the PC plan of reorganization are required to make cash payments to the Trust 
of approximately $1.7 billion, subject to a right of prepayment at a 5.5% discount rate.
On October 13, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order entering a final decree and closing the Chapter 11 case. That 
order provided that the Bankruptcy Court retained jurisdiction to enforce any order issued in the case and any agreements 
approved by the court, enforce the terms and conditions or the modified third amended Plan, and consider any requests to 
reopen the case.
The following table outlines the impact on PPG's financial statements for the year-ended December 31, 2016, including the 
change in fair value of the PPG stock contributed to the Trust, the equity forward instrument and the increase in the net 
present value of the payments made to the trust.

Non-PC relationship asbestos claims 
At the time PC filed for bankruptcy, PPG had been named as one of many defendants in one or more of the categories of 
asbestos-related claims identified above. Over the course of the 16 years during which the PC bankruptcy proceedings, and 
corresponding preliminary injunction staying the prosecution of asbestos-related claims against PPG, were pending, certain 
plaintiffs alleging premises claims filed motions seeking to lift the stay with respect to more than 1,000 individually-identified 
premises. The Bankruptcy Court granted motions to lift the stay in respect to certain of these premises claims and directed 
PPG to engage in a process to address any additional premises claims that were the subject of pending or anticipated lift-
stay motions. As a result of the overall process as directed by the Bankruptcy Court involving more than 1,000 premises 
claims between 2006 and May 27, 2016, hundreds of these claims were withdrawn or dismissed without payment and 
approximately 650 premises claims were dismissed upon agreements by PPG and its insurers to resolve such claims in 
exchange for monetary payments.

 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

With respect to the remaining claims not identified above and still reportable within the inventory of 114,000 asbestos-related 
claims at the time PC filed for bankruptcy, the Company considers such claims to fall within one or more of the following 
categories: (1) claims that have been closed or dismissed as a result of processes undertaken during the bankruptcy; (2) 
claims that may have been previously filed on the dockets of state and federal courts in various jurisdictions, but are inactive 
as to the Company; and (3) claims that are subject, in whole or in part, to the channeling injunction and thus will be resolved, 
in whole or in part, in accordance with the Trust procedures established under the PC bankruptcy reorganization plan. As a 
result of the foregoing, the Company does not consider these three categories of claims to be open or active litigation against 
it, although the Company cannot now determine whether, or the extent to which, any of these claims may in the future be 
reinstituted, reinstated, or revived such that they may become open and active asbestos-related claims against it.
Current open and active claims post-Pittsburgh Corning bankruptcy
The Company is aware of approximately 625 open and active asbestos-related claims pending against the Company and 
certain of its subsidiaries. These claims consist primarily of non-PC Relationship Claims and claims against a subsidiary of 
PPG. The Company is defending the remaining open and active claims vigorously.
Since April 1, 2013, a subsidiary of PPG has been implicated in claims alleging death or injury caused by asbestos-containing 
products manufactured, distributed or sold by a North American architectural coatings business or its predecessors which 
was acquired by PPG. All such claims have been either served upon or tendered to the seller for defense and indemnity 
pursuant to obligations undertaken by the seller in connection with the Company’s purchase of the North American architectural 
coatings business. The seller has accepted the defense of these claims subject to the terms of various agreements between 
the Company and the seller. The seller’s defense and indemnity obligations in connection with newly filed claims will cease 
with respect to claims filed after April 1, 2018.
PPG has established reserves totaling approximately $180 million for asbestos-related claims that would not be channeled 
to the Trust which, based on presently available information, we believe will be sufficient to encompass all of PPG’s current 
and potential future asbestos liabilities.  These reserves include a $162 million reserve established in 2009 in connection 
with an amendment to the PC plan of reorganization.  These reserves, which are included within "Other liabilities" on the 
accompanying consolidated balance sheets, represent PPG’s best estimate of its liability for these claims. PPG does not 
have sufficient current claim information or settlement history on which to base a better estimate of this liability in light of the 
fact that the Bankruptcy Court’s injunction staying most asbestos claims against the Company was in effect from April 2000 
through May 2016. PPG will monitor the activity associated with its remaining asbestos claims and evaluate, on a periodic 
basis, its estimated liability for such claims, its insurance assets then available, and all underlying assumptions to determine 
whether any adjustment to the reserves for these claims is required. 
The amount reserved for asbestos-related claims by its nature is subject to many uncertainties that may change over time, 
including (i) the ultimate number of claims filed; (ii) the amounts required to resolve both currently known and future unknown 
claims; (iii) the amount of insurance, if any, available to cover such claims; (iv) the unpredictable aspects of the litigation 
process, including a changing trial docket and the jurisdictions in which trials are scheduled; (v) the outcome of any trials, 
including potential judgments or jury verdicts; (vi) the lack of specific information in many cases concerning exposure for 
which PPG is allegedly responsible, and the claimants’ alleged diseases resulting from such exposure; and (vii) potential 
changes in applicable federal and/or state tort liability law. All of these factors may have a material effect upon future asbestos-
related liability estimates. As a potential offset to any future asbestos financial exposure, under the PC plan of reorganization 
PPG retained, for its own account, the right to pursue insurance coverage from certain of its historical insurers that did not 
participate in the PC plan of reorganization. While the ultimate outcome of PPG’s asbestos litigation cannot be predicted 
with certainty, PPG believes that any financial exposure resulting from its asbestos-related claims will not have a material 
adverse effect on PPG’s consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. 
Environmental matters
It is PPG’s policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred 
and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims 
against third parties and are generally not discounted. In management’s opinion, the Company operates in an environmentally 
sound manner and the outcome of the Company’s environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on PPG’s 
financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period 
in  which  costs,  if  any,  are  recognized.  Management  anticipates  that  the  resolution  of  the  Company’s  environmental 
contingencies will occur over an extended period of time.
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, PPG had reserves for environmental contingencies associated with PPG’s former 
chromium manufacturing plant in Jersey City, N.J. (“New Jersey Chrome”) and for other environmental contingencies, including 
National Priority List sites and legacy glass and chemical manufacturing sites. These reserves are reported as “Accounts 
payable and accrued liabilities” and “Other liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

The Company continues to analyze, assess and remediate the environmental issues associated with New Jersey Chrome 
as  further  discussed  below.  During  the  past  three  years,  charges  for  estimated  environmental  remediation  costs  were 
significantly higher than PPG’s historical range. Excluding the charges related to New Jersey Chrome, pre-tax charges against 
income for environmental remediation have ranged between approximately $5 million and $35 million per year for the past 
10 years. 
Management expects cash outlays for environmental remediation costs to range from $25 million to $75 million annually 
from 2018 through 2022.
It is possible that technological, regulatory and enforcement developments, the results of environmental studies and other 
factors could alter the Company’s expectations with respect to future charges against income and future cash outlays. 
Specifically, the level of expected future remediation costs and cash outlays is highly dependent upon activity related to 
New Jersey Chrome as discussed below.
Remediation: New Jersey Chrome
In June 2009, PPG entered into a settlement agreement with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection 
(“NJDEP”) and Jersey City, New Jersey (which had asserted claims against PPG for lost tax revenue) which was in the form 
of a Judicial Consent Order (the "JCO"). Under the JCO, PPG accepted sole responsibility for the remediation activities at 
its former chromium manufacturing location in Jersey City and 19 additional sites. The principal contaminant of concern is 
hexavalent chromium. The JCO also provided for the appointment of a court-approved Site Administrator who is responsible 
for establishing a master schedule for the remediation of the 20 PPG sites which existed at that time. One site was subsequently 
removed from the JCO process during 2014 and will be remediated separately at a future date. A total of 19 sites remain 
subject to the JCO process.
The most significant assumptions underlying the estimate of remediation costs for all New Jersey Chrome sites are those 
related to the extent and concentration of chromium impacts in the soil, as these determine the quantity of soil that must be 
treated in place, the quantity that will have to be excavated and transported for offsite disposal, and the nature of disposal 
required. During 2016, PPG completed updated assessments of costs incurred to date versus current progress and the 
potential cost impacts of the most recent information, including the extent of impacted soils, percentage of hazardous versus 
non-hazardous soils, daily soil excavation rates, and engineering, administrative and other associated costs. Based on these 
assessments, a reserve adjustment of $60 million was recorded during 2016. Principal factors affecting costs included 
refinements in the estimate of the mix of hazardous to non-hazardous soils to be excavated, an overall increase in soil 
volumes to be excavated, enhanced water management requirements, decreased daily soil excavation rates due to site 
conditions, initial estimates for remedial actions related to groundwater, and increased oversight and management costs. 
The reserve adjustments for the estimated costs to remediate all New Jersey Chrome sites are exclusive of any third party 
indemnification, as the recovery of any such amounts is uncertain. In 2017, the cost of remediation activities reduced the 
reserve by $27 million.
Groundwater remediation at the former Garfield Avenue chromium-manufacturing site and five adjacent sites is expected to 
occur over several years after NJDEP’s approval of the work plan. Ongoing groundwater monitoring will be utilized to develop 
a final groundwater remedial action work plan which is currently expected to be submitted to NJDEP in 2021. 

76 

 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

PPG’s financial reserve for remediation of all New Jersey Chrome sites is $136 million at December 31, 2017. The major 
cost components of this liability continue to be related to excavation, transportation and disposal of impacted soil, as well as 
construction services. These components each account for approximately 29%, 27% and 23% of the accrued amount, 
respectively. 
There are multiple, future events yet to occur, including further remedy selection and design, remedy implementation and 
execution  and  applicable  governmental  agency  or  community  organization  approvals.  Considerable  uncertainty  exists 
regarding the timing of these future events for the New Jersey Chrome sites. Final resolution of these events is expected to 
occur over the next several years. As these events occur and to the extent that the cost estimates of the environmental 
remediation remedies change, the existing reserve for this environmental remediation matter will be adjusted.
Remediation: other sites
Among other sites at which PPG is managing environmental liabilities, remedial actions are occurring at a legacy chemical 
manufacturing site in Barberton, Ohio, where PPG has completed a Facility Investigation and Corrective Measure Study 
under  USEPA’s  Resource  Conservation  and  Recovery Act  (“RCRA”)  Corrective Action  Program.  PPG  has  also  been 
addressing the impacts from a legacy plate glass manufacturing site in Kokomo, Indiana under the Voluntary Remediation 
Program of the Indiana Department of Environmental Management. PPG is currently performing additional investigation 
activities at this location. 
With respect to certain waste sites, the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties also contributes to the 
uncertainty of estimating PPG’s final costs. Although contributors of waste to sites involving other potentially responsible 
parties may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability, in general, final allocations of costs are made 
based on the relative contributions of wastes to such sites. PPG is generally not a major contributor to such sites.
Separation and merger of the commodity chemicals business
As  a  result  of  the  commodity  chemicals  business  separation  transaction,  PPG  has  retained  responsibility  for  potential 
environmental liabilities that may result from future Natural Resource Damage claims and any potential tort claims at the 
Calcasieu River Estuary associated with activities and historical operations of the Lake Charles, La. facility. In the fourth 
quarter of 2017, PPG signed a consent decree prepared by the US Department of Justice for settlement of potential natural 
resource damage claims at the Calcasieu River Estuary. Payment of PPG’s previously accrued for share of costs into an 
escrow account will be required within 30 days of lodging of the agreement with the court. Lodging is expected to occur in 
the first quarter of 2018.
PPG retained additional responsibility for all liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from sediment contamination in 
the Ohio River resulting from historical activities and operations at the Natrium, W.Va. facility, exclusive of remedial activities, 
if any, that would have been required to have been performed on-site at the Natrium facility. PPG’s obligations with respect 
to the Ohio River sediment contamination terminated because PPG received no notice of any requirements to further assess 
or to remediate sediment contamination in the Ohio River, caused by PPG’s operation of the Natrium facility prior to the 
separation of the commodity chemicals business, during an indemnification period established in the agreement transferring 
the business to Axiall that ended on December 30, 2017.
Remediation: reasonably possible matters
In  addition  to  the  amounts  currently  reserved  for  environmental  remediation,  the  Company  may  be  subject  to  loss 
contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as $100 million to $200 million. Such unreserved 
losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence. These reasonably possible 
unreserved losses relate to environmental matters at a number of sites, none of which are individually significant. The loss 
contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at 
these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them.
The impact of evolving programs, such as natural resource damage claims, industrial site re-use initiatives and domestic 
and international remediation programs, also adds to the present uncertainties with regard to the ultimate resolution of this 
unreserved exposure to future loss. The Company’s assessment of the potential impact of these environmental contingencies 
is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex, ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation, if 
necessary, of such environmental contingencies, and the potential for technological and regulatory developments. 
14. Shareholders’ Equity

(a)  Unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments related to translation of foreign denominated balance sheets are not presented net of tax given that 
no deferred U.S. income taxes have been provided on undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries because they are deemed to be reinvested for 
an indefinite period of time. 

(b)  The tax benefit (cost) related to unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments on tax inter-branch transactions and net investment hedges for the 
years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $141 million, $(34) million and $(84) million, respectively. In 2015, the balance includes a 
remeasurement of the tax cost on the foreign proceeds from the sale of the Company’s interest in Transitions Optical which have not been permanently 
reinvested. Refer to Note 2, “Acquisitions and Divestitures” for additional information.

(c)  The tax cost related to the adjustment for pension and other postretirement benefits for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $(33) 
million, $(403) million and $(51) million, respectively. Reclassifications from AOCI are included in the computation of net periodic benefit costs (See 
Note 12, “Employee Benefit Plans”). The cumulative tax benefit related to the adjustment for pension and other postretirement benefits at December 31, 
2017 and 2016 was $243 million and $276 million, respectively. 

(d)  The tax cost (benefit) related to the change in the unrealized gain on derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $5 million, 
$2 million and $(2) million, respectively. Reclassifications from AOCI are included in the gain or loss recognized on cash flow hedges (See Note 9 
“Financial Instruments, Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements”).

17. Stock-Based Compensation
The Company’s stock-based compensation includes stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and grants of contingent 
shares that are earned based on achieving targeted levels of total shareholder return. All current grants of stock options, 
RSUs and contingent shares are made under the PPG Industries, Inc. Amended and Restated Omnibus Incentive Plan (“PPG 
Amended Omnibus Plan”), which was amended and restated effective April 21, 2016. Shares available for future grants under 
the PPG Amended Omnibus Plan were 8.0 million as of December 31, 2017.

Stock Options
PPG has outstanding stock option awards that have been granted under the PPG Amended Omnibus Plan. Under the PPG 
Amended Omnibus Plan, certain employees of the Company have been granted options to purchase shares of common 
stock at prices equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date the options were granted. The options are generally 
exercisable 36 months after being granted and have a maximum term of 10 years. Upon exercise of a stock option, shares 
of Company stock are issued from treasury stock. 
The fair value of stock options issued to employees is measured on the date of grant and is recognized as expense over the 
requisite service period. PPG estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The 
risk-free interest rate is determined by using the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the date of the grant and using a maturity equal 
to the expected life of the option. The expected life of options is calculated using the average of the vesting term and the 
maximum term, as prescribed by accounting guidance on the use of the simplified method for determining the expected term 
of an employee share option. The expected dividend yield and volatility are based on historical stock prices and dividend 
amounts over past time periods equal in length to the expected life of the options.
The following weighted average assumptions were used to calculate the fair values of stock option grants in each year:

Weighted average exercise price
Risk free interest rate
Expected life of option in years
Expected dividend yield
Expected volatility

Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”)
Long-term incentive value is delivered to selected key management employees by granting RSUs, which have either time 
or performance-based vesting features. The fair value of an RSU is equal to the market value of a share of PPG stock on 
the date of grant. Time-based RSUs vest over the three-year period following the date of grant, unless forfeited, and will be 
paid out in the form of stock, cash or a combination of both at the Company’s discretion at the end of the three year vesting 
period. Performance-based RSUs vest based on achieving specific annual performance targets for earnings per share growth 
and cash flow return on capital over the three calendar year-end periods following the date of grant. Unless forfeited, the 
performance-based RSUs will be paid out in the form of stock, cash or a combination of both at the Company’s discretion at 
the end of the three-year performance period if PPG meets the performance targets. The amount paid for performance-
based awards may range from 0% to 180% of the original grant, based upon the frequency with which the annual earnings 
per share growth and cash flow return on capital performance targets are met over the three calendar year periods comprising 
the vesting period. For the purposes of expense recognition, PPG has assumed that performance-based RSUs granted in 
2015 will vest at the 150% level and those granted in 2016 and 2017 will vest at the 100% level. As of December 31, 2017, 
four of the six possible performance targets had been met for the 2015 grant, two of the four possible performance targets 
had been met for the 2016 grant, and one of two possible performance targets had been met for the 2017 grant.

Contingent Share Grants 
The Company also provides grants of contingent shares to selected key executives that may be earned based on PPG total 
shareholder return (“TSR”) over the three-year period following the date of grant. Contingent share grants (referred to as 
“TSR awards”) are made annually and are paid out at the end of each three-year period based on the Company’s performance. 
Performance is measured by determining the percentile rank of the total shareholder return of PPG common stock in relation 
to the total shareholder return of the S&P 500 for the three-year period following the date of grant. This comparison group 
represents the entire S&P 500 Index as it existed at the beginning of the performance period, excluding any companies that 
have been removed from the index because they ceased to be publicly traded. The payment of awards following the three-
year award period will be based on performance achieved in accordance with the scale set forth in the plan agreement and 
may range from 0% to 220% of the initial grant. A payout of 100% is earned if the target performance is achieved. Contingent 
share awards for the 2015-2017, 2016-2018, and 2017-2019 periods earn dividend equivalents for the award period, which 
will be paid to participants or credited to the participants’ deferred compensation plan accounts with the award payout at the 
end of the period based on the actual number of contingent shares that are earned. Any payments made at the end of the 
award period may be in the form of stock, cash or a combination of both. The TSR awards qualify as liability awards, and 
compensation  expense  is  recognized  over  the  three-year  award  period  based  on  the  fair  value  of  the  awards  (giving 
consideration  to  the  Company’s  percentile  rank  of  total  shareholder  return)  remeasured  in  each  reporting  period  until 
settlement of the awards.
As of December 31, 2017, there was $3 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding TSR awards 
based on the current estimate of fair value. This cost is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average 
period of 1.7 years.

19. Reportable Business Segment Information
Segment Organization and Products
PPG is a multinational manufacturer with 10 operating segments (which the Company refers to as “strategic business units”) 
that are organized based on the Company’s major products lines. These operating segments are also the Company’s reporting 
units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment (see Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”). 
The Company’s reportable business segments include the following two segments: Performance Coatings and Industrial 
Coatings. The operating segments have been aggregated based on economic similarities, the nature of their products, 
production processes, end-use markets and methods of distribution. 
The Performance Coatings reportable segment is comprised of the refinish, aerospace, architectural coatings – Americas 
and Asia-Pacific, architectural coatings - EMEA, and protective and marine coatings operating segments. This reportable 
segment primarily supplies a variety of protective and decorative coatings, sealants and finishes along with paint strippers, 
stains and related chemicals, as well as transparencies and transparent armor. 

82 

 2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

The Industrial Coatings reportable segment is comprised of the automotive original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) coatings, 
industrial coatings, packaging coatings, coatings services and the specialty coatings and materials operating segments. This 
reportable segment primarily supplies a variety of protective and decorative coatings and finishes along with adhesives, 
sealants, metal pretreatment products, optical monomers and coatings, precipitated silicas and other specialty materials. 
Effective January 1, 2018, the coating services operating segment has been merged into the industrial coatings operating 
segment and the Company will have 9 operating segments. Management teams and operations will be realigned to better 
deliver our total value proposition and provide optimal solutions to our customers, as well as to achieve operational efficiencies.
Production facilities and markets for Performance Coatings and Industrial Coatings are global. PPG’s reportable segments 
continue to pursue opportunities to further develop their global markets, including efforts in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin 
America. Each of the reportable segments in which PPG is engaged is highly competitive. The diversification of our product 
lines and the worldwide markets served tend to minimize the impact on PPG’s total sales and income from continuing 
operations of changes in demand in a particular market or in a particular geographic area.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting 
policies (See Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”). The Company allocates resources to operating segments 
and evaluates the performance of operating segments based upon segment income, which is income before interest expense 
– net, income taxes, and noncontrolling interests and excludes certain charges which are considered to be unusual or non-
recurring. The Company also evaluates performance of operating segments based on working capital reduction, margin 
growth, and sales volume growth. Legacy items include current costs related to former operations of the Company, including 
certain environmental remediation, pension and other postretirement benefit costs, and certain charges for legal and other 
matters which are considered to be unusual or non-recurring. These legacy costs are excluded from the segment income 
that is used to evaluate the performance of the operating segments. 
Corporate unallocated costs include the costs of corporate staff functions not directly associated with the operating segments, 
the cost of corporate legal cases, net of related insurance recoveries and the cost of certain insurance and stock-based 
compensation programs. Net periodic pension expense is allocated to the operating segments and the portion of net periodic 
pension expense related to the corporate staff functions is included in the Corporate unallocated costs.
Product movement between Performance Coatings and Industrial Coatings is limited, is accounted for as an inventory transfer, 
and is recorded at cost plus a mark-up, the impact of which is not significant to the segment income of the reportable segments.

(1)  Corporate intersegment net sales represent intersegment net sales eliminations. Corporate unallocated costs include the costs of corporate staff 

functions not directly associated with the operating segments, certain legal and insurance costs and stock-based compensation expense.

(2)  Legacy items include current costs related to former operations of the Company, including certain environmental remediation, pension and other 
postretirement benefit costs, legal costs and certain charges which are considered to be non-recurring. Until April 2016, legacy items also include 
equity earnings from PPG’s minority investment in Pittsburgh Glass Works, LLC. The Legacy items for 2016 include an environmental remediation 
pre-tax charge of $82 million. These charges relate to continued environmental remediation activities at legacy chemicals sites, primarily at PPG’s 
former Jersey City, N.J. chromium manufacturing plant and associated sites (Refer to Note 13, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities”).

(3)  Segment assets are the total assets used in the operation of each segment. Corporate assets are principally cash and cash equivalents, cash held 
in escrow, short term investments, deferred tax assets and, until April 2016, PPG’s equity investment in it’s former automotive glass and services 
business. Non-segment items also includes the assets of businesses which have been reclassified as discontinued operations in the Consolidated

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K

A Message from Our Chairman

Our Valued Shareholders, 

Thanks to our employees and customers, PPG delivered  
a solid performance in 2017. As I travel to PPG facilities 
around the world, I am always impressed by our 
people and their focus on strengthening our 
company, serving our customers’ needs, and 
bringing life to our purpose and promise:

We protect and beautify the world.

with more than $1.2 billion returned 
in 2017 through share repurchases 
and dividends. We take great pride 
in having paid annual dividends for 
118 consecutive years, including a  
13 percent per-share increase last 
July that marked 46 consecutive 
years of increased per share 
payouts.

PPG maintained excellent financial 
flexibility with cash and short-term 
investments of about $1.5 billion  
at year-end.

We have committed to deploy a 
minimum of $2.4 billion of cash 
in 2018 on acquisitions and 
share repurchases as part of our 
previously communicated target 
to deploy $3.5 billion in 2017 and 
2018 combined. 

(continued next page)

This focus, which begins with the 
performance of our business, 
was a key to our success in 2017. 
With the dedication of our 47,000 
employees and the trust of our 
customers, we have continued  
to strengthen our position as a 
global leader in the paint and 
coatings industry. 

PPG in 2017 delivered adjusted 
earnings diluted per share 
growth; we continued to 
aggressively manage costs; and 
we completed the multi-year 
strategic transformation of our 
business portfolio by divesting 
our North American fiber glass 
business. Today, PPG is entirely 
focused on innovating paints, 
coatings and specialty materials 
to deliver growth and value in our 
business. We further strengthened 
our portfolio by completing four 
acquisitions during the year.

We have also continued our legacy 
of returning cash to shareholders, 

Michael H. McGarry 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
