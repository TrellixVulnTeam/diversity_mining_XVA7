Q&A with President and CEO 
Richard L. Bond

Tyson is ﬁ nding innovative ways to 
convert non-prime products into 
fuel, pet food products and other 
high-margin commercial products.

Tyson has made signiﬁ cant 
progress toward building a 
multinational enterprise by 
moving into Brazil and India and 
expanding operations in China.

To Our Shareholders 

“I believe we are in a good position, because 
we have the right strategy, a solid management 
team and a strong balance sheet. I don’t think 
there is another protein company better 
positioned than Tyson Foods.”

Tyson Foods, Inc.’s multi-protein business model proved to 
be a strategic advantage in the 2008 ﬁ scal year. A record-
setting year from our pork business and an improved 
performance by beef supported our chicken business 
as it struggled with high input costs and low prices. Our 
chicken segment incurred $600 million in additional grain 
costs this year, while total inputs were $900 million more 
than in 2007. We couldn’t raise prices enough to keep pace 
with these extraordinary input costs.

Despite the challenges in our chicken segment, we made 
signiﬁ cant progress in other areas. We continued to 
manage the Company for the long term by focusing on 
our four strategies:

1.  Create innovative and insight-driven food solutions
2. Optimize commodity businesses and manage margins
3. Build a multinational enterprise
4.  Revolutionize the conversion of raw materials and 

by-products into high-margin initiatives

This annual report will focus on the third and fourth 
strategies, because there have been several new 
developments this year. In our efforts to build a 
multinational enterprise, we acquired three poultry 
operations in Brazil, entered into majority ownership 

joint ventures in India and China and are awaiting 
government approval of our third joint venture in China. 
In the past when times were tough, we deferred our 
international expansion plans, but this time we are 
determined to keep moving forward.

We’re also moving ahead with our fourth strategy, which 
emphasizes renewable products, including the Dynamic 
Fuels joint venture to produce renewable diesel from 
by-products such as animal fat, cooking oil and grease. 
We’re just beginning this endeavor, but the potential is 
very exciting.

We will face more challenges early in the 2009 ﬁ scal 
year, but we will handle market conditions as effectively 
as possible. I believe we are in a good position, because 
we have the right strategy, a solid management team 
and a strong balance sheet. I don’t think there is another 
protein company better positioned than Tyson Foods.

THE STRATEGIC DIFFERENCE
Q&A with the CEO

Q:   Why did you raise capital in September?

A:   We raised more than $740 million in capital by issuing 

22.4 million shares and $457.5 million in convertible 
debt. We had (and still have) a strong balance sheet, 
so it wasn’t something we had to do, but we believed 
it was in the Company’s long-term best interest. 
It enabled us to be comfortable in making several 
international acquisitions, which is where much of the 
Company’s growth will occur. As for the timing, we 
thought credit markets would tighten and that it would 
be a long time before we could generate this amount 
of capital; however, we thought things would tighten 
up in the next few months or weeks, not the next few 
days, as was the case.

Q:  How has the U.S. economy affected your business?

A:   We have a diversiﬁ ed business model, and that 
means diversity in the proteins we sell and the 
channels in which we sell them. The economic 
downturn has caused many people to re-evaluate 
how they spend their food dollars. Our research 
indicates many consumers are opting for the value 
offered by quick service restaurants (QSRs) rather 
than mid-scale or family restaurant chains. QSRs 
are actually doing well, and we are a large supplier 
to the major national chains. They are promoting 
chicken on their menus – including their breakfast 
menus – and putting advertising dollars behind 
those promotions. Also, there are many consumers 
who are eating at home more often and taking 
their lunches to work to save money. We serve that 
segment as well through our fresh chicken, beef 
and pork, our value-added chicken products and 

our deli meats sold at retail. Wherever consumers 
choose to eat, and no matter what the current 
economic conditions are, Tyson is there to meet 
consumers’ needs.

Q:   The world economy isn’t doing well either. With 
the stronger U.S. dollar, how concerned are you 
about exports in 2009?

A:   We beneﬁ ted tremendously from exports in 2008, 

especially pork. As we begin the 2009 ﬁ scal year, 
liquidity is a problem for some importers of our 
products. We think this is a short-term problem, and 
underlying demand will remain strong in the long 
term. We’re not immune from the overall economic 
conditions, but countries import protein because they 
can’t produce enough to feed their own people, and 
that hasn’t changed.

Q:   What can you tell us about your expectations 

for 2009?

A:   We anticipate sales to be $28-$29 billion. 
Capital spending should be approximately 
$600-$650 million, with $425-$450 million going 
to our core business, $100-$120 million on post-
acquisition spending related to our Brazil and 
China operations and $75-$80 million for the 
Dynamic Fuels plant. It will be a transition year 
for us as we integrate our international 
acquisitions, get our renewable products 
initiatives rolling and turn our chicken 
segment around.

Q:   What is the Tyson Discovery Center, and how is it 

Q:   If you have the Discovery Center to grow your 

contributing to the bottom line?

A:   The Discovery Center is our state-of-the-art research 

and development facility, and it plays a vital role in our 
strategy to create innovative and insight-driven food 
solutions. It is the place where our team members 
develop and test new product ideas and where we 
collaborate with our customers to create products, 
menu ideas and strategies to build their businesses and 
ours. We must be doing something right, because for 
the sixth consecutive year, Tyson won the Cannondale 
and Cognitio awards. Cannondale identiﬁ es the elite 
manufacturers and operators as evaluated by their 
trading partners. Cognitio identiﬁ es the manufacturer 
that did the best job of bringing new products to 
foodservice operators. As for contributing to the 
bottom line, since the Discovery Center opened in 
March 2007, cumulative sales from new products 
were $963 million.

value-added business, what are you doing for your 
commodity businesses?

A:   Our commodity beef and pork businesses performed 

very well in 2008. Pork had its best year ever, with a 
7.8% operating margin. Beef has made a tremendous 
turnaround. It went from a loss of $254 million in 2006 
to a $106 million proﬁ t in 2008. We accomplished 
this by keeping costs down as much as possible 
and driving inefﬁ ciencies out of our operations – in 
other words, hard work and diligence. We’re making 
similar improvements in our chicken business and 
have invested capital in several of our plants to make 
them more efﬁ cient and ﬂ exible. We’re reducing 
the amount of chicken we move between plants for 
further processing, and we’re identifying and reﬁ ning 
processes to reduce our cost of goods.

Jaime Barrenechea (left), Renewable Products 
Group, and Tim Ray, Research & Development, 
are researching new ideas for pet treats.

THE CREATIVE DIFFERENCE

Tyson is ﬁ nding innovative ways to convert non-prime products into 
fuel, pet food products and other high-margin commercial products.

Tyson Renewable Products is leading Tyson Foods’ 
strategy to turn non-prime products into high-margin 
initiatives through a variety of creative endeavors 
across four platforms – renewable energy, pet products, 
nutraceuticals and biotech.

Renewable Energy
In October 2008, Dynamic Fuels, a joint venture 
between Tyson Foods and Syntroleum Corporation, 
broke ground on a plant that will produce renewable 
diesel. The facility is currently scheduled to begin 
production in 2010, with a total capacity of 75 million 
gallons per year. Unlike the ethanol and biodiesel 
industries, which use food ingredients such as corn 
and soybean oil to produce fuel, the Dynamic Fuels 
project primarily will use non-food grade animal 
fats produced or procured by Tyson, such as beef 
tallow, pork lard, chicken fat and cooking grease. 
The fuel produced by the venture will offer the 
same beneﬁ ts of synthetic fuels derived from coal or 
natural gas while providing substantial performance 
and environmental advantages over petroleum-
based fuels.

Pet Products
Americans love their pets, and it matters where their 
protein comes from, especially following the serious 
problems caused by imported ingredients in 2007. In 
January 2008, we announced a strategic alliance with 
Kemin Industries, Inc. to develop, manufacture and 
market pet food ﬂ avor-enhancers, known as palatants, 

to the North American pet food market. We are 
researching a variety of different super premium dog 
treats made from chicken breasts, which we plan to 
test market in 2009. We hope to unlock additional 
opportunities in other high-end pet products as well, 
with non-prime products such as bones and pig ears 
having a great deal of potential.

Nutraceuticals
Foods containing nutritional supplements are growing 
in popularity as Baby Boomers age. With our bone and 
cartilage by-products, we are uniquely positioned to 
supply proprietary chondroitin and collagen products 
through our partnership with BioCell Technology, LLC. 
Finished products made with these ingredients are 
marketed by major nutritional supplement and food 
manufacturers. Additional opportunities are being 
explored to further expand this business platform 
during 2009 through other raw materials and value-
added partnerships.

Biotech
There is a wide range of opportunities for biotech product 
development including keratin protein-based products 
for shampoo, skin care, nail care and lotions. Additionally, 
Tyson is exploring bioplastics, bio-adhesives and non-woven 
materials made from feathers. Disposable diapers made 
with keratin from the feathers of Tyson chickens could be a 
reality in the future. All of these products will bring added 
value to Tyson while supporting our sustainability efforts.

The growing middle class in China and 
other countries represents growth 
opportunities for Tyson Foods.

THE GLOBAL DIFFERENCE

Tyson Foods has made signiﬁ cant progress toward building a multinational 
enterprise by moving into Brazil and India and expanding operations in China.

In 2008, Tyson Foods exported chicken, beef, pork and 
prepared foods to more than 90 countries. Increasing 
exports, diversifying our export markets and building 
in-country production are essential to the Company’s 
long-term growth. We made several acquisitions and 
joint ventures in key locations that offer the right climate 
for poultry production, a large population, ample labor 
force, access to corn and soybean meal and a cost of 
production advantage. Another important feature of 
these markets is their emerging middle class. As their 
incomes rise, one of the ﬁ rst lifestyle changes people 
make is to add protein to their diets.

Since 2001, Tyson has had a presence in China with Tyson 
Da Long, a small chicken further processing joint venture. 
With a population of 1.3 billion and chain restaurants 
opening at a rate of one every 18 hours, the Chinese 
market needs more poultry production. Annual per 
capita meat consumption in China is about 20 pounds 
per person, compared to 89 pounds in the United States. 
If consumption increased by only 10 pounds per person, 
it would be equivalent to all of Tyson’s annual U.S. 
production. To serve this growing market, Tyson entered 

into a joint venture to create Jiangsu Tyson Foods, which 
will produce fresh chicken sold under the Tyson brand for 
the Shanghai retail market. As of December 2008, we are 
awaiting government approval for a third joint venture, 
Shandong Tyson Xinchang Foods, a fully integrated 
chicken and duck operation. Tyson Xinchang will have 
a production capacity of more than 400,000 birds per 
day and further processing operations with export 
certiﬁ cations for Japan, Southeast Asia and Europe.

At the end of ﬁ scal 2008, Tyson announced the 
acquisition of three poultry companies in southern Brazil. 
Each is vertically integrated and can supply domestic 
growth in addition to serving as an export platform 
to Europe and other markets closed to U.S. chicken 
imports. Two of the facilities are brand new locations 
built with modern technology, and the third is a high-
quality operation with more than 30 years of experience 
that will provide much of the human capital to our 
new combined operations in Brazil. When these three 
facilities are at our intended capacity, they will produce 
approximately 800,000 chickens per day, making us one 
of the top producers in Brazil.

7  2008 Annual Report

 

Diversifying exports: With chicken production in Brazil, Tyson can access 
European markets closed to the United States, and by selling to the 
Middle East and Africa, we lessen our dependency on Russian markets.

The third key location for Tyson’s international growth is 
India, which has a population of more than one billion 
people. While per capita chicken consumption is less than 
ﬁ ve pounds a year, its annual growth rate of more than 
10% is among the highest in the world. In June 2008, Tyson 
acquired majority ownership of one of India’s leading 
branded chicken companies. In addition to serving the 
foodservice market, Godrej Tyson Foods produces retail 
fresh chicken under the Real Good Chicken brand and 
further processed chicken under the Yummiez brand. The 
combined production of the two plants in Mumbai and 
Bangalore is approximately 60,000 chickens per day. We 
plan to expand the production capacity of the existing 
operations and build additional processing facilities to 
better reach consumers in the northern and eastern 
regions of the country.

Tyson has had a presence in Mexico for 20 years and 
currently holds the #3 market share position. We are #1 
in value-added chicken production and have reached 

full capacity in our plants in a market that continues to 
grow. Our longer-term strategy could include acquiring 
or building more assets to solidify our market position 
in northern Mexico and expand our business into the 
central part of the country.

Chicken isn’t the only protein Tyson produces outside the 
United States. In 2007, we entered into a joint venture 
to create the ﬁ rst vertically integrated beef operation 
in Argentina. The South American country is the world’s 
ﬁ fth leading beef producer and the second leading beef 
exporter. Argentina is known for its low beef production 
costs and high-quality breeds of cattle.

Although the state of the world economy and our domestic 
chicken business could cause us to be more conservative in 
ﬁ scal 2009, Tyson Foods will continue with our strategy to 
build a multinational enterprise by integrating our recent 
acquisitions and maximizing those assets.

DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY
We are the world’s largest meat company and the second-largest 
food production company in the Fortune 500 with one of the most 
recognized brand names in the food industry. We produce, distribute 
and market chicken, beef, pork, prepared foods and related allied 
products. Our operations are conducted in four segments: Chicken, 
Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods. Some of the key factors that inﬂ uence 
our business are customer demand for our products, ability to main-
tain and grow relationships with customers and introduce new and 
innovative products to the marketplace, accessibility of international 
markets, market prices for our chicken, beef and pork products, cost 
of live cattle and hogs, raw materials and grain and operating efﬁ cien-
cies of our facilities.

OVERVIEW
•  Chicken Segment – Fiscal 2008 operating results declined as 
compared to ﬁ scal 2007 due largely to increased input costs of 
approximately $900 million, including increased grain costs, other 
feed ingredient costs and cooking ingredients. These increases were 
partially offset by increased average sales prices, as well as increased 
net gains of $127 million from our commodity risk management 
activities related to grain purchases, which exclude the impact from 
related physical purchase transactions that will impact future period 
operating results.

•  Beef Segment – Fiscal 2008 operating results improved com-
pared to ﬁ scal 2007 as operating margins signiﬁ cantly improved 
in the latter half of the year, with an operating margin of 2.8% in 
the last six months of ﬁ scal 2008. While sales volume was down 
with the closure of our Emporia, Kansas, slaughter operation, 
operating margins improved due to improved average sales prices 
and operational efﬁ ciencies.

•  Pork Segment – We achieved record operating income of 
$280 million, an increase of $135 million as compared to ﬁ scal 
2007, due to adequate hog supplies and strong domestic and 
export demand.

•  Prepared Foods Segment – Declines in operating income for ﬁ scal 
2008 compared to ﬁ scal 2007 for our Prepared Foods segment were 
primarily due to increased raw material costs, partially offset by 
increased average sales prices.

•  Acquisitions – In ﬁ scal 2008, we announced the following transactions:

•  In December 2007, Cobb-Vantress, Inc. (Cobb), our wholly-owned 
poultry breeding subsidiary, formed an alliance with Hendrix Genetics 
B.V. (Hendrix). This alliance will strengthen Cobb’s position in the 
broiler breeding industry, Hendrix’ position in egg layer, turkey and 
swine genetics, and enable Cobb and Hendrix to explore other 
joint venture opportunities. In July 2008, Cobb acquired the Hybro 

poultry breeding and genetics business from Hendrix. The acquisi-
tion included genetic lines and facilities. At the same time, Cobb 
and Hendrix signed a Joint Development Agreement involving their 
respective Research & Development in livestock genetics.

•  In February 2008, we signed an agreement with the Jiangsu 
Jinghai Poultry Industry Group Co., Ltd., a Chinese poultry breeding 
company, to build a fully integrated poultry operation in Haimen 
City near Shanghai. The joint venture, Jiangsu Tyson Foods, will 
produce fresh, packaged chicken products that will be sold under 
the Tyson name. Jiangsu Tyson will become the ﬁ rst producer to 
deliver brand name, high quality fresh chicken to consumers in 
the eastern China market. We own 70 percent of the business and 
production is expected to begin in 2009.

•  In June 2008, we announced the acquisition of 51% ownership 
of Godrej Foods, Ltd., a poultry processing business in India. The 
joint venture is called Godrej Tyson Foods. We anticipate annual 
sales of approximately $50 million initially, and expect operations 
will expand later. Godrej Foods currently sells retail fresh and 
further processed chicken.

•  In September 2008, we announced a joint venture agreement 
was ﬁ nalized with Shandong Xinchang Group, a vertically inte-
grated poultry operation in eastern China. Once the agreement 
receives the necessary government approvals, which is expected 
in ﬁ scal 2009, Tyson will have a 60% ownership. The joint venture 
will be called Shandong Tyson Xinchang Foods Company.

•  In September 2008, we signed purchase agreements with three 
poultry companies in southern Brazil, each vertically integrated. 
These companies include Macedo Agroindustrial, Avicola Itaiopolis 
and Frangobras. We closed on each of these transactions subse-
quent to ﬁ scal 2008.

•  In June 2008, we executed a letter of intent to sell Lakeside Farm 
Industries (Lakeside), our Canadian beef operation, to XL Foods, Inc., 
a Canadian-owned beef processing business. Under the terms of the 
letter of intent, Tyson will sell Lakeside for $104 million and retain 
the ﬁ nished product inventory, accounts receivable and accounts 
payable of Lakeside as of the closing date. XL Foods will pay an 
additional amount for cattle inventory, fertilizer inventory and 
packaging assets, estimated to approximate $82 million. The trans-
action remains subject to government approvals and execution of 
a deﬁ nitive agreement by the parties. The results of Lakeside are 
reported as a discontinued operation.

•  See Liquidity and Capital Resources for a summary of the impact of 
recent deterioration of credit and capital markets on our business.

OUTLOOK
The following elements comprise our long-term strategic plan:

•  Create innovative and insight-driven food solutions: Discover and 
sell market-leading products and services to grow Tyson’s brand 
equity and help our customers succeed through our commitment 
to joint value creation.

•  Optimize commodity business models: Emphasize cost focus in 
operations, manage margins and maximize revenue by capitalizing 
on scale, yield, pricing, product mix and services.

•  Build a multi-national enterprise: Accelerate expansion in cost 
competitive regions and markets with the greatest growth potential 
as well as increase and diversify United States exports.

•  Revolutionize conversion of raw materials and by-products into 
high-margin initiatives: Commercialize opportunities outside the core 
business, such as renewable energy from fat and developing other 
technologically-advanced platforms from materials such as feathers, 
viscera, blood and animal waste.

•  $18 million non-operating gain related to sale of an investment.

Our outlook for segments in ﬁ scal 2009 includes:

2007
Net income includes the following item:

•  $17 million of tax expense related to a ﬁ xed asset tax cost correc-
tion, primarily related to a ﬁ xed asset system conversion in 1999.

2006
Net loss includes the following items:

•  $63 million of costs related to beef, prepared foods and poultry 
plant closings;

•  $19 million of charges related to our Cost Management Initiative 
and other business consolidation efforts which included severance 
expense, product rationalization costs and related intangible asset 
impairment expenses;

•  $15 million tax expense resulting from a review of our tax account 
balances; and

•  $5 million charge related to the cumulative effect of a change 
in accounting principle due to adoption of Financial Accounting 
Standards Board Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional 
Asset Retirement Obligations,” an interpretation of FASB Statement 
No. 143 (FIN 47).

•  Chicken – Export markets, credit availability and the recent 
strengthening dollar have negatively impacted leg quarter pricing. 
International leg quarter sales will be difﬁ cult at least through the 
beginning of ﬁ scal 2009. We have seen grain prices drop signiﬁ cantly 
from all-time highs this past summer that if sustained, will beneﬁ t us 
in the long run. However, we have some grain positions that could 
negatively impact us depending on corn and soybean meal closing 
prices at the end of the ﬁ rst quarter ﬁ scal 2009.

•  Beef – We expect cattle supplies will be down 1 – 2% in ﬁ scal 
2009, but there should be ample supply to run our plants efﬁ ciently. 
We will continue to focus on the operational efﬁ ciencies from ﬁ scal 
2008 and expect a successful ﬁ scal 2009.

•  Pork – While we anticipate fewer hog supplies in ﬁ scal 2009, we 
expect we will have an adequate supply to achieve good operating 
results. This segment should continue to do well in ﬁ scal 2009, but 
likely not at the record amounts we had in ﬁ scal 2008.

•  Prepared Foods – High input costs will likely continue in ﬁ scal 
2009. Demand for our products remains strong, which should provide 
for sales volume growth in ﬁ scal 2009.

•  The improvement in sales was largely due to improved average 
sales prices, which accounted for an increase of approximately 
$1.5 billion. While all segments had improved average sales prices, 
the majority of the increase was driven by increases in the Chicken 
and Beef segments.

•  Sales were negatively impacted by a decrease in sales volume, 
which accounted for a decrease of approximately $318 million. This 
was primarily due to a decrease in Beef volume and the sale of two 
poultry production facilities in ﬁ scal 2007, partially offset by an 
increase in Pork volume.

2007 vs. 2006
•  The improvement in sales was largely due to improved average sales 
prices, which accounted for an increase of approximately $1.4 billion 
in sales. The improvement was due to better market conditions in 
all segments, with the majority of the increase attributable to the 
Chicken and Beef segments.

•  Sales were negatively impacted by a slight decrease in sales volume, 
which accounted for a decrease of approximately $226 million. The 
decrease was driven by decreases in the Chicken and Prepared Foods 
segments, offset by improvements in the Beef and Pork segments. 
The decrease included planned production cuts and the closure of 
production facilities, offset by improvements in the beef and pork 
export markets and improved domestic pork demand.

•  Cost of sales increased $1.3 billion. Cost per pound contributed to 
a $1.6 billion increase, offset partially by a decrease in sales volume 
reducing cost of sales $323 million.

•  Increase of over $1.0 billion in costs in the Chicken segment, 
which included increased input costs of approximately $900 mil-
lion, including grain costs, other feed ingredient costs and cooking 
ingredients. Plant costs, including labor and logistics, increased by 
approximately $200 million. These increases were partially offset 
by increased net gains of $127 million from our commodity risk 
management activities related to grain purchases, which exclude 
the impact from related physical purchase transactions that will 
impact future period operating results.

•  Increase in average domestic live cattle costs of approximately 
$271 million.

•  Increase in operating costs in the Beef and Pork segments of 
approximately $180 million.

•  Decrease due to sales volume included lower Beef and Chicken 
sales volume, partially offset by higher Pork sales volume.

•  Decrease due to net gains of $173 million from our commodity 
risk management activities related to forward futures contracts 
for live cattle and hog purchases as compared to the same period 
of ﬁ scal 2007. These amounts exclude the impact from related 
physical purchase transactions, which will impact future period 
operating results.

•  Decrease in average live hog costs of approximately $117 million.

2007 – Operating income included a $10 million gain on the sale of 
two poultry plants and related support facilities.

2006 – Operating income included $9 million of charges related to 
our Cost Management Initiative, other business consolidation efforts 
and plant closing costs.

2008 vs. 2007
•  Sales and Operating Income (Loss) – Sales increased as a result of 
an increase in average sales prices, partially offset by a decrease in 
sales volume due to the sale of two poultry plants in ﬁ scal 2007. 
Operating results were adversely impacted by increased input costs 
of approximately $900 million, including grain costs, other feed 
ingredient costs and cooking ingredients. Plant costs, including labor 
and logistics, increased by approximately $200 million. This was 
partially offset by increased net gains of $127 million from our 

commodity trading risk management activities related to grain 
purchases, which exclude the impact from related physical pur-
chase transactions that will impact future period operating results. 
Operating results were also negatively impacted by increased selling, 
general and administrative expenses of $43 million.

2007 vs. 2006
•  Sales and Operating Income – Sales and operating income increased 
due to an increase in average sales prices, partially offset by a decrease 
in sales volume. The decrease in sales volume was due to planned 
production cuts, the sale of two poultry plants and the closure of a 
poultry plant in ﬁ scal 2006 due to a ﬁ re. The increase in average sales 
prices contributed to improved operating income, partially offset 
by an increase in net grain costs of $256 million. The increase of net 
grain costs includes $334 million of increased grain costs, partially 
offset by increased net gains of $78 million from our commodity 
risk management activities related to grain purchases. Additionally, 
operating income improved due to a decrease in selling, general and 
administrative expenses.

2008 vs. 2007
•  Sales and Operating Income – Sales and operating income were 
impacted positively by higher average sales prices and improved 
operational efﬁ ciencies, partially offset by decreased sales volume 
due primarily to closure of the Emporia, Kansas, slaughter operation. 
Operating results were also negatively impacted by higher operating 
costs. Fiscal 2008 operating results include realized and unrealized

ities related to forward futures contracts for live cattle, excluding the 

related impact from the physical sale and purchase transactions, 
compared to realized and unrealized net losses of $2 million recorded

in average sales prices exceeding the increase in average live prices.

2007 vs. 2006
•  Sales and Operating Income (Loss) – Sales and operating income 
increased due to higher average sales prices, as well as higher sales 
volume. Operating results improved due to operating cost efﬁ ciencies 
and yield improvements, partially offset by an increase in average live 
prices. Also, operating results improved signiﬁ cantly from a decrease

•  In ﬁ scal 2007, we used proceeds from sale of the short-term 
investment to repay our outstanding $750 million 7.25% Notes 
due October 1, 2006. In addition, we used cash from operations 
to reduce the amount outstanding under the Lakeside term loan 
by $320 million, repay the outstanding $125 million 7.45% Notes 
due June 1, 2007, and reduce other borrowings.

•  In ﬁ scal 2006, we repaid the $87 million 6.125% Senior Notes due 
February 1, 2006, and reduced other borrowings.

•  In ﬁ scal 2006, we issued $1.0 billion of 2016 Notes. We used 
proceeds to purchase a short-term investment, as well as for other 
general corporate purposes. The short-term investment was later 
sold and used in ﬁ scal 2007 to repay our outstanding $750 million 
7.25% Notes due October 1, 2006.

•  The revolving credit facility supports our short-term funding needs 
and letters of credit. Letters of credit are issued primarily in support 
of workers’ compensation insurance programs and derivative activities.

•  The accounts receivable securitization facility is with three 
co-purchasers and allows us to sell up to $750 million of trade 
receivables, consisting of $375 million expiring in August 2009 and 
a $375 million 364-day facility with an additional one-year option, 
which commits funding through August 2010. At September 27, 
2008, we had access to the full $750 million borrowing capacity. 
Our borrowing capacity could be reduced in the future if our 
eligible receivables balance falls below $750 million.

•  In conjunction with the $100 million of Gulf Opportunity Zone tax-
exempt bond issuance in October 2008, we agreed to issue a guarantee 
for the full amount of the bond issuance, which was issued in the form 
of a letter of credit, in exchange for eight million Syntroleum stock 
warrants valued at $0.01 each. Both the issuance of the letter of 
credit and the receipt of Syntroleum warrants occurred subsequent 
to ﬁ scal 2008. The letter of credit will reduce the unused borrowing 
capacity available under the revolving credit facility.

•  In October 2008, we completed the acquisition of three vertically 
integrated poultry companies in southern Brazil. The purchase price 
was $80 million, as well as up to an additional $15 million of contin-
gent purchase price based on production volumes payable through 
ﬁ scal 2010. Additionally, once the joint venture agreement with 
Shandong Xinchang Group receives the necessary government 
approvals, we expect to spend $110 – $115 million to acquire a 
60% ownership. We expect this to be ﬁ nalized during ﬁ scal 2009.

•  Subject to receipt of applicable government approvals, we anticipate 
being ready to complete the sale of Lakeside by the end of the ﬁ rst 
quarter ﬁ scal 2009, with plans to use available proceeds to pay down 
debt and other general corporate purposes. Inclusive of working capital 
of Lakeside initially retained by us at closing, as well as consideration 
received from XL Foods, we expect the following future cash ﬂ ows 
based on the September 27, 2008, currency exchange rate: $55 million 
received at closing; approximately $136 million in calendar 2009; 
$49 million in notes receivable, plus interest, to be paid over two years 
by XL Foods; and $29 million of XL Foods preferred stock redeemable 
over ﬁ ve years. The discontinuance of Lakeside’s operation will not 
have a material effect on our future operating cash ﬂ ows.

•  Our current ratio at September 27, 2008, and September 29, 2007, 
was 2.07 to 1 and 1.74 to 1, respectively.

Deterioration of Credit and Capital Markets
Credit market conditions deteriorated rapidly during our fourth 
quarter of ﬁ scal 2008 and continue into our ﬁ rst quarter of ﬁ scal 
2009. Several major banks and ﬁ nancial institutions failed or were 
forced to seek assistance through distressed sales or emergency 
government measures. While not all-inclusive, the following 
summarizes some of the impacts to our business:

Credit Facilities  Cash ﬂ ows from operating activities are our primary 
source of liquidity for funding debt service and capital expenditures. 
However, we rely on our revolving credit and accounts receivable 
securitization facilities to provide additional liquidity for work-
ing capital needs, letters of credit, and as a source of ﬁ nancing for 
international growth. Our revolving credit facility has total com-
mitted capacity of $1.0 billion. As of September 27, 2008, we had 
outstanding letters of credit totaling $291 million, none of which 
were drawn upon, which left $709 million available for borrowing. 
Our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of 35 banks, 
with commitments ranging from $5 million to $78 million per bank. 
If any of the banks in the syndicate were unable to perform on their 
commitments to fund the facility, our liquidity could be impaired, 
which could reduce our ability to fund working capital needs or 
ﬁ nance our international growth strategy.

Our accounts receivable securitization facility has $750 million of 
committed funding, of which the entire amount was available for 
borrowing as of September 27, 2008. Our accounts receivable 
securitization facility is funded by a syndicate of three banks, with 
a commitment of $250 million per bank. To date, all of the banks in 
the syndicate have continued to meet their commitments despite 
the recent market turmoil. If any of the banks in the syndicate were 
unable to perform on their commitments to fund the facility, our 
liquidity could be impaired, which could reduce our ability to fund 
working capital needs or ﬁ nance our international growth strategy. 
We have borrowed against this facility subsequent to ﬁ scal 2008 
and all of the banks in the syndicate performed their obligations 
to fund these borrowings.

Current market conditions have also resulted in higher credit spreads 
on long-term borrowings and signiﬁ cantly reduced demand for new 
corporate debt issuances.

Equity – Class A Common Stock  Equity prices, including our own 
Class A Common Stock, have fallen and experienced abnormally 
high volatility during the current period. If these conditions persist, 
our cost of capital will increase signiﬁ cantly.

Customers/Suppliers  The ﬁ nancial condition of some of our 
customers and suppliers could also be impaired by current market 
conditions. Although we have not experienced a material increase in 
customer bad debts or non-performance by suppliers, current market 

conditions increase the probability that we could experience losses 
from customer or supplier defaults. Should current credit and capital 
market conditions result in a prolonged economic downturn in the 
United States and abroad, demand for protein products could be 
reduced, which could result in a reduction of sales, operating 
income and cash ﬂ ows.

Investments  The value of our investments in equity and debt securi-
ties, including our marketable debt securities, company-owned life 
insurance and pension and other postretirement plan assets, has 
been negatively impacted by the recent market declines. These 
instruments were recorded at fair value as of September 27, 2008; 
however, subsequent to September 27, 2008, through November 1, 
2008, we have seen an additional reduction in fair value of approxi-
mately $32 million. While we believe this reduction in fair value 
is temporary, if current market conditions continue, we could be 
required to recognize $10 million of expense in the ﬁ rst quarter 
of ﬁ scal 2009. The remaining change in fair value would be deferred 
in other comprehensive income unless determined to be perma-
nently impaired.

We currently oversee two domestic and one foreign subsidiary 
non-contributory qualiﬁ ed deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension plans. All three 
pension plans are frozen to new participants and no additional 
beneﬁ ts will accrue for participants. Based on our 2008 actuarial 
valuation, we anticipate contributions of approximately $1 million 
to these plans for ﬁ scal 2009. We also have one domestic unfunded 
deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan. Based on our 2008 actuarial valuation, we 
anticipate contributions of approximately $1 million to this plan 
in ﬁ scal 2009.

Financial Instruments  As part of our commodity risk management 
activities, we use derivative ﬁ nancial instruments, primarily futures 
and options, to reduce our exposure to various market risks related 
to commodity purchases. Similar to the capital markets, the com-
modities markets have seen a similar decline over the past several 
months. Grain prices reached an all-time high during our fourth 
quarter of ﬁ scal 2008 before falling sharply to the current levels. 
While the reduction in grain prices beneﬁ t us long-term, we may be 
required to record additional losses related to these ﬁ nancial instru-
ments in the ﬁ rst quarter of ﬁ scal 2009 if grain prices remain lower 
than prices at the end of ﬁ scal 2008.

Insurance  We rely on insurers as a protection against liability claims, 
property damage and various other risks. Our primary insurers main-
tain an A.M. Best Financial Strength Rating of A+ or better. Never-
theless, we continue to monitor this situation as insurers have been 
and are expected to continue to be impacted by the current capital 
market environment.

•  In ﬁ scal 2008, we issued $458 million of 3.25% Convertible Senior 
Notes due October 15, 2013. Net proceeds were used for the net cost 
of the Convertible Note Hedge and Warrant Transactions, toward the 
repayment of our borrowings under the accounts receivable securiti-
zation facility, and for other general corporate purposes.

•  In ﬁ scal 2008, we issued 22.4 million shares of Class A stock in a 
public offering. Net proceeds were used toward repayment of our 
borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization facility and 
for other general corporate purposes.

•  At September 30, 2006, we had $750 million in a short-term invest-
ment held on deposit with a trustee. Proceeds from sale of short-
term investment were used to repay the $750 million 7.25% Notes 
due October 1, 2006. This repayment was made in ﬁ scal 2007. When 
adjusted for the $750 million short-term investment held on deposit, 
total debt would have been $3.2 billion, with a debt to capitalization 
ratio of 42.1%.

Credit Ratings
2016 Notes  On July 24, 2006, Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. 
(Moody’s) downgraded the credit rating from “Baa3” to “Ba1.” This 
downgrade increased the interest rate on the 2016 Notes from 
6.60% to 6.85%, effective on the ﬁ rst day of the interest period 
during which the rating change required an adjustment to the 
interest rate (i.e., the issuance of the 2016 Notes). Additionally, on 
July 31, 2006, Standard & Poor’s (S&P) downgraded the credit rating 
from “BBB” to “BBB–.” This downgrade did not change the interest 
rate on the 2016 Notes.

On September 4, 2008, S&P downgraded the credit rating from 
“BBB–” to “BB.” This downgrade increased the interest rate on the 
2016 Notes from 6.85% to 7.35%, effective beginning with the six 
month interest payment due October 1, 2008.

On November 13, 2008, Moody’s downgraded the credit rating from 
“Ba1” to “Ba3.” This downgrade increased the interest rate on the 2016 
Notes from 7.35% to 7.85%, effective beginning with the six month 
interest payment due April 1, 2009.

S&P currently rates the 2016 Notes “BB.” Moody’s currently rates this 
debt “Ba3.” A further one-notch downgrade by either ratings agency 
would increase the interest rates on the 2016 Notes by an additional 
0.25% per ratings agency.

Revolving Credit Facility Rating  After an upgrade on October 1, 2008, 
S&P’s credit rating for the revolving credit facility is “BBB–.” After a 
downgrade on November 13, 2008, Moody’s credit rating is “Ba2.” 
The pretax impact to earnings of another downgrade would not be 
material to annual interest expense. However, if Moody’s were to 
downgrade this facility to “Ba3” or below, or if S&P were to down-
grade this facility to “BB–” or below, then the banks participating in 
our accounts receivable securitization facility could refuse to pur-
chase any additional receivables from us and the accounts receivable 
securitization facility could unwind with any amounts outstand-
ing under the facility repaid as the receivables owned by Tyson 
Receivables Company, our wholly-owned consolidated special 
purpose entity, are collected.

Debt Covenants
Our debt agreements contain various covenants, the most restrictive 
of which contain maximum allowed leverage ratios and a minimum 
required interest coverage ratio. On September 10, 2008, we amended 
our revolving credit facility agreement to provide a less restrictive 
maximum allowed leverage ratio, which takes effect in ﬁ rst quarter 
of ﬁ scal 2009. All trademarks of our domestic subsidiaries are 
pledged as collateral under the revolving credit facility. Additionally, 
certain domestic subsidiaries guaranteed this facility and pledged 
inventory as collateral. We were in compliance with all covenants 
at September 27, 2008.

Based on the current industry outlook and our internal forecasts, 
we anticipate we will be in compliance with our debt covenants 
throughout ﬁ scal 2009. However, our Chicken segment in the ﬁ rst 
part of ﬁ scal 2009 will be negatively impacted by difﬁ cult export 
markets and long grain positions that could negatively impact our 
covenant compliance.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements material to 
our ﬁ nancial position or results of operations. The off-balance sheet 
arrangements we have are guarantees of debt of outside third parties, 
including a lease and grower loans, and residual value guarantees 
covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. 
See Note 9, “Commitments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements for further discussion.

(1)  In the event of a default on payment or violation of debt covenants, acceleration of 
the principal payments could occur. At September 27, 2008, we were in compliance 
with all of our debt covenants.

(2)  Interest payments included interest on all outstanding debt. Payments are estimated 

for variable rate and variable term debt based on effective rates at September 27, 2008, 
and expected payment dates.

(3)  Amounts included guarantees of debt of outside third parties, which consist of a 

lease and grower loans, all of which are substantially collateralized by the underlying 
assets, as well as residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various 
types of equipment. The amounts included are the maximum potential amount of 
future payments.

(4)  Amounts included in operating lease obligations are minimum lease payments under 

lease agreements.

(5)  Amounts included in purchase obligations are agreements to purchase goods or 
services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all signiﬁ cant terms, 
including: ﬁ xed or minimum quantities to be purchased; ﬁ xed, minimum or variable 
price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obliga-
tions amount included items, such as future purchase commitments for grains, live-
stock contracts and ﬁ xed grower fees that provide terms that meet the above criteria. 
We have excluded future purchase commitments for contracts that do not meet these 
criteria. Purchase orders have not been included in the table, as a purchase order is an 
authorization to purchase and may not be considered an enforceable and legally bind-
ing contract. Contracts for goods or services that contain termination clauses without 
penalty have also been excluded.

(6)  Amounts included in capital expenditures are estimated amounts to complete build-
ings and equipment under construction as of September 27, 2008, as well as costs to 
construct Dynamic’s facility.

(7)  Amounts included in other long-term liabilities are items that meet the deﬁ nition of 

a purchase obligation and are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In addition to the amounts shown above in the table, we have unrec-
ognized tax beneﬁ ts of $220 million and related interest and penal-
ties of $67 million at September 27, 2008, recorded as liabilities in 
accordance with Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty 
in Income Taxes,” an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 
(FIN 48). During ﬁ scal 2009, tax audit resolutions could potentially 

reduce these amounts by approximately $38 million, either because 
tax positions are sustained on audit or because we agree to their dis-
allowance. For the remaining liability, due to the uncertainties related 
to these income tax matters, we are unable to make a reasonably 
reliable estimate of the amounts or timing of potential reductions.

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition 
threshold and measurement attribute for the ﬁ nancial statement 
recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected 
to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecog-
nition, classiﬁ cation, interest and penalties, accounting in interim 
periods, disclosure and transition. We adopted FIN 48 at the begin-
ning of ﬁ scal 2008. The adoption of FIN 48 resulted in a change 
to the opening Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows: $32 million 
increase to Other Current Assets, $17 million decrease to Other 
Current Liabilities, $106 million increase to Other Liabilities, $40 mil-
lion decrease to Deferred Income Taxes and $17 million decrease 
to Retained Earnings. Included in these changes we recognized a 
$120 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax beneﬁ ts 
and a $21 million increase in the related liability for interest and 
penalties for a total of $141 million.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Deﬁ ned 
Beneﬁ t Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment 
of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)” (SFAS No. 158). 
SFAS No. 158 requires companies to recognize the funded status 
of a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t postretirement plan as an asset or liability in 
its consolidated balance sheet and to recognize changes in funded 
status in the year in which the changes occur through other com-
prehensive income. We adopted SFAS No. 158 at the end of ﬁ scal 
2007 except for the requirement to measure the funded status of 
a plan as of the date of its annual consolidated balance sheet, 
which we adopted in ﬁ scal 2008 and which had an immaterial 
impact. See Note 13, “Pensions and Other Postretirement Beneﬁ ts” 
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact 
of the adoption of SFAS No. 158.

In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47. Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement 
Obligations” (SFAS No. 143), was issued in June 2001 and requires an 
entity to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement 
obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate 
of fair value can be made. SFAS No. 143 applies to legal obligations 
associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that 
resulted from the acquisition, construction, development and/or 
the normal operation of a long-lived asset. The associated asset costs 
are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. 
FIN 47 clariﬁ es the term “conditional asset retirement obligation” as 
used in SFAS No. 143, which refers to a legal obligation to perform 
an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of 
settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not 

22  Tyson Foods, Inc.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (continued)

be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 requires an entity to 
recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retire-
ment obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably 
estimated. Uncertainty about the timing and/or method of settlement 
of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into 
the measurement of the liability when sufﬁ cient information exists. 
We adopted FIN 47 as of September 30, 2006. See Note 2, “Change 
in Accounting Principle” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial State-
ments for the impact of the adoption of FIN 47.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 
provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. 
This standard also responds to investors’ requests for expanded 
information about the extent to which companies measure assets 
and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value 
and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS No. 157 
applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabil-
ities to be measured at fair value. Beginning September 28, 2008, 
we partially applied SFAS No. 157 as allowed by FASB Staff Position 
(FSP) 157-2, which delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for 
nonﬁ nancial assets and liabilities. As of September 28, 2008, we have 
applied the provisions of SFAS No. 157 to our ﬁ nancial instruments 
and the impact was not material. Under FSP 157-2, we will be required 
to apply SFAS No. 157 to our nonﬁ nancial assets and liabilities at the 
beginning of ﬁ scal 2010. We are currently reviewing the applicability 
of SFAS No. 157 to our nonﬁ nancial assets and liabilities as well as the 
potential impact on our consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and 
Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statement 
No. 115” (SFAS No. 159). This statement provides companies with an 
option to report selected ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities ﬁ rm commit-
ments, and nonﬁ nancial warranty and insurance contracts at fair value 
on a contract-by-contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized 
in earnings each reporting period. At September 28, 2008, we did not 
elect the fair value option under SFAS No. 159 and therefore there 
was no impact to our consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Finan-
cial Statements” (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 amends Accounting 
Research Bulletin No. 51, “Consolidated Financial Statements” to 
establish accounting and reporting standards for a noncontrolling 
interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. 
This statement clariﬁ es that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is 
an ownership interest in the consolidated entity and should be 
reported as equity in the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements, rather 
than in the liability or mezzanine section between liabilities and 
equity. SFAS No. 160 also requires consolidated net income be 
reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to 
both the parent and the noncontrolling interest. The impact of 

SFAS No. 160 will not have a material impact on our current 
Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS No. 160 is effective for 
ﬁ scal years, and interim periods within those ﬁ scal years, beginning 
on or after December 15, 2008; therefore, we expect to adopt SFAS 
No. 160 at the beginning of ﬁ scal 2010.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Account-
ing Standards No. 141R, “Business Combinations” (SFAS No. 141R). SFAS 
No. 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer 
in a business combination: 1) recognizes and measures in its ﬁ nancial 
statements identiﬁ able assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any 
noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; 2) recognizes and measures 
goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain 
purchase; and 3) determines what information to disclose to enable 
users of the ﬁ nancial statements to evaluate the nature and ﬁ nancial 
effects of a business combination. SFAS No. 141R is effective for busi-
ness combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the 
beginning of the ﬁ rst annual reporting period beginning on or after 
December 15, 2008; therefore, we expect to adopt SFAS No. 141R for 
any business combinations entered into beginning in ﬁ scal 2010.

In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and 
Hedging Activities – an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (SFAS 
No. 161). SFAS No. 161 establishes enhanced disclosure requirements 
about: 1) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; 2) how 
derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted 
for under Statement 133 and its related interpretations; and 3) how 
derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s 
ﬁ nancial position, ﬁ nancial performance and cash ﬂ ows. SFAS No. 161 
is effective for ﬁ nancial statements issued for ﬁ scal years and interim 
periods beginning after November 15, 2008; therefore, we expect to 
adopt SFAS No. 161 in the second quarter of ﬁ scal 2009.

In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, 
“Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled 
in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)” (FSP 
APB 14-1). FSP APB 14-1 speciﬁ es that issuers of convertible debt 
instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including 
partial cash settlement) should separately account for the liability 
and equity components in a manner that will reﬂ ect the entity’s non-
convertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in 
subsequent periods. The amount allocated to the equity component 
represents a discount to the debt, which is amortized into interest 
expense using the effective interest method over the life of the debt. 
FSP APB 14-1 is effective for ﬁ nancial statements issued for ﬁ scal years 
beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those 
ﬁ scal years. Early adoption is not permitted. Therefore, we expect to 
adopt the provisions of FSP APB 14-1 beginning in the ﬁ rst quarter of 
ﬁ scal 2010. The provisions of FSP APB 14-1 are required to be applied 
retrospectively to all periods presented. Upon retrospective adoption, 
we anticipate our effective interest rate on our 3.25% Convertible

Senior Notes due 2013 will range from 8.0% to 8.50%, which would 
result in the recognition of an approximate $90 million to $100 mil-
lion discount to these notes with the offsetting after tax amount 
recorded to capital in excess of par value. This discount will be 
accreted until the maturity date at the effective interest rate, which 
will not materially impact ﬁ scal 2008 interest expense, but will result 
in an estimated $15 million to $20 million increase to our ﬁ scal 2009 
interest expense.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of consolidated ﬁ nancial statements requires us to 
make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure 
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated 
ﬁ nancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and 
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ 
from those estimates. The following is a summary of certain 
accounting estimates we consider critical.

Description

Judgments and Uncertainties

Our contingent liabilities contain uncertain-
ties because the eventual outcome will 
result from future events, and determination 
of current reserves requires estimates and 
judgments related to future changes in facts 
and circumstances, differing interpretations 
of the law and assessments of the amount of 
damages, and the effectiveness of strategies 
or other factors beyond our control.

Recognition of the costs related to these 
programs contains uncertainties due to
judgment required in estimating the 
potential performance and redemption 
of each program.

These estimates are based on many 
factors, including experience of similar 
promotional programs.

Contingent liabilities
We are subject to lawsuits, investigations 
and other claims related to wage and hour/
labor, livestock procurement, securities, envi-
ronmental, product, taxing authorities and 
other matters, and are required to assess the 
likelihood of any adverse judgments or out-
comes to these matters, as well as potential 
ranges of probable losses.

A determination of the amount of reserves 
and disclosures required, if any, for these 
contingencies are made after considerable 
analysis of each individual issue. We accrue 
for contingent liabilities when an assessment 
of the risk of loss is probable and can be rea-
sonably estimated. We disclose contingent 
liabilities when the risk of loss is reasonably 
possible or probable.

Marketing and advertising costs
We incur advertising, retailer incentive 
and consumer incentive costs to promote 
products through marketing programs. These 
programs include cooperative advertising, 
volume discounts, in-store display incentives, 
coupons and other programs.

Marketing and advertising costs are charged 
in the period incurred. We accrue costs based 
on the estimated performance, historical 
utilization and redemption of each program.

Cash consideration given to customers is 
considered a reduction in the price of our 
products, thus recorded as a reduction to 
sales. The remainder of marketing and adver-
tising costs is recorded as a selling, general 
and administrative expense.

Effect if Actual Results Differ

from Assumptions

We have not made any material changes in 
the accounting methodology used to estab-
lish our contingent liabilities during the past 
three ﬁ scal years.

We do not believe there is a reasonable like-
lihood there will be a material change in the 
estimates or assumptions used to calculate 
our contingent liabilities. However, if actual 
results are not consistent with our estimates 
or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains 
or losses that could be material.

A 10% change in our marketing accruals at 
September 27, 2008, would impact pretax 
earnings by approximately $10 million.

Description

Judgments and Uncertainties

Our self-insurance liability contains uncer-
tainties due to assumptions required and 
judgment used.

Costs to settle our obligations, including 
legal and healthcare costs, could increase 
or decrease causing estimates of our self-
insurance liability to change.

Incident rates, including frequency and 
severity, could increase or decrease causing 
estimates in our self-insurance liability 
to change.

Our impairment analysis contains uncertain-
ties due to judgment in assumptions and 
estimates surrounding undiscounted future 
cash ﬂ ows of the long-lived asset, including 
forecasting useful lives of assets and select-
ing the discount rate that reﬂ ects the risk 
inherent in future cash ﬂ ows to determine 
fair value.

Accrued self insurance
We are self insured for certain losses related 
to health and welfare, workers’ compensa-
tion, auto liability and general liability claims.

We use an independent third-party actuary 
to assist in determining our self-insurance 
liability. We and the actuary consider a 
number of factors when estimating our 
self-insurance liability, including claims 
experience, demographic factors, severity 
factors and other actuarial assumptions.

We periodically review our estimates and 
assumptions with our third-party actuary 
to assist us in determining the adequacy of 
our self-insurance liability. Our policy is to 
maintain an accrual within the central to 
high point of the actuarial range.

Impairment of long-lived assets
Long-lived assets are evaluated for 
impairment whenever events or changes 
in circumstances indicate the carrying value 
may not be recoverable. Examples include a 
signiﬁ cant adverse change in the extent or 
manner in which we use a long-lived asset 
or a change in its physical condition.

When evaluating long-lived assets for 
impairment, we compare the carrying value 
of the asset to the asset’s estimated undis-
counted future cash ﬂ ows. An impairment 
is indicated if the estimated future cash 
ﬂ ows are less than the carrying value of the 
asset. The impairment is the excess of the 
carrying value over the fair value of the 
long-lived asset.

We recorded impairment charges related to 
long-lived assets of $52 million, $6 million 
and $67 million, respectively, in ﬁ scal years 
2008, 2007 and 2006.

We have not made any material changes 
in the accounting methodology used to

the past three ﬁ scal years.

We do not believe there is a reasonable like-

estimates or assumptions used to calculate 
our self-insurance liability. However, if actual 
results are not consistent with our estimates 
or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains 
or losses that could be material.

A 10% increase in the actuarial range at 
September 27, 2008, would not impact the 
amount we recorded for our self-insurance 
liability. A 10% decrease in the actuarial 
range at September 27, 2008, would result 
in a gain in the amount we recorded for 
our self-insurance liability of approximately 
$23 million.

We have not made any material changes 
in the accounting methodology used to 
evaluate the impairment of long-lived 
assets during the last three ﬁ scal years.

We do not believe there is a reasonable like-
lihood there will be a material change in the 
estimates or assumptions used to calculate 
impairments of long-lived assets. However, 
if actual results are not consistent with our 
estimates and assumptions used to calcu-
late estimated future cash ﬂ ows, we may be 
exposed to impairment losses that could 
be material.

Judgments and Uncertainties

Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill impairment is determined using a 
two-step process. The ﬁ rst step is to identify 
if a potential impairment exists by compar-
ing the fair value of a reporting unit with its 
carrying amount, including goodwill. If the 
fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its 
carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting 
unit is not considered to have a potential 
impairment and the second step of the 
impairment test is not necessary. However, 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit 
exceeds its fair value, the second step is per-
formed to determine if goodwill is impaired 
and to measure the amount of impairment 
loss to recognize, if any.

We estimate the fair value of our report-
ing units, generally our operating segments, 
using various valuation techniques, with 
the primary technique being a discounted 
cash ﬂ ow analysis. A discounted cash ﬂ ow 
analysis requires us to make various judg-
mental assumptions about sales, operating 
margins, growth rates and discount rates. 
Assumptions about sales, operating margins 
and growth rates are based on our budgets, 
business plans, economic projections, 
anticipated future cash ﬂ ows and market-
place data. Assumptions are also made for 
varying perpetual growth rates for periods 
beyond the long-term business plan period.

The second step compares the implied fair 
value of goodwill with the carrying amount 
of goodwill. If the implied fair value of 
goodwill exceeds the carrying amount, 
then goodwill is not considered impaired. 
However, if the carrying amount of goodwill 
exceeds the implied fair value, an impair-
ment loss is recognized in an amount equal 
to that excess.

The implied fair value of goodwill is deter-
mined in the same manner as the amount of 
goodwill recognized in a business combina-
tion (i.e., the fair value of the reporting unit 
is allocated to all the assets and liabilities, 
including any unrecognized intangible assets, 
as if the reporting unit had been acquired 
in a business combination and the fair value 
of the reporting unit was the purchase price 
paid to acquire the reporting unit).

For our other intangible assets, if the carry-
ing value of the intangible asset exceeds its 
fair value, an impairment loss is recognized 
in an amount equal to that excess.

We have elected to make the ﬁ rst day of the 
fourth quarter the annual impairment assess-
ment date for goodwill and other intangible 
assets. However, we could be required to 
evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and 
other intangible assets prior to the required 
annual assessment if we experience disrup-
tions to the business, unexpected signiﬁ cant 
declines in operating results, divestiture of a 
signiﬁ cant component of the business or a 
sustained decline in market capitalization.

While estimating the fair value of our Beef 
and Chicken reporting units, we assumed 
operating margins in future years in excess 
of the margins realized in the most cur-
rent year. The fair value estimates for these 
reporting units assume normalized operating 
margin assumptions and improved operating 
efﬁ ciencies based on long-term expectations 
and margins historically realized in the beef 
and chicken industries. We estimate the fair 
value of our Beef reporting unit would be 
in excess of its carrying amount, including 
goodwill, by sustaining long-term operating 
margins of approximately 2.3%. We estimate 
the fair value of our Chicken reporting units 
would be in excess of its carrying amount, 
including goodwill, by sustaining long-term 
operating margins of approximately 5.1%.

Other intangible asset fair values have been 
calculated for trademarks using a royalty 
rate method and using the present value of 
future cash ﬂ ows for patents and in-process 
technology. Assumptions about royalty 
rates are based on the rates at which similar 
brands and trademarks are licensed in the 
marketplace.

Our impairment analysis contains uncer-
tainties due to uncontrollable events that 
could positively or negatively impact the 
anticipated future economic and operating 
conditions.

Effect if Actual Results Differ

from Assumptions

We have not made any material changes 
in the accounting methodology used to 
evaluate impairment of goodwill and other 
intangible assets during the last three years.

As a result of the ﬁ rst step of the 2008 
goodwill impairment analysis, the fair value 
of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying 
value. Therefore, the second step was not 
necessary. However, a 6% decline in fair value 
of our Beef reporting unit or an 11% decline 
in fair value of our Chicken reporting unit 
would have caused the carrying values for 
these reporting units to be in excess of fair 
values which would require the second step 
to be performed. The second step could 
have resulted in an impairment loss for 
goodwill.

While we believe we have made reasonable 
estimates and assumptions to calculate the 
fair value of the reporting units and other 
intangible assets, it is possible a material 
change could occur. If our actual results 
are not consistent with our estimates and 
assumptions used to calculate fair value, we 
may be required to perform the second step 
which could result in a material impairment 
of our goodwill.

During the latter part of the fourth quarter 
of ﬁ scal 2008 and continuing into November 
2008, our market capitalization was below 
book value. While we considered the market 
capitalization decline in our evaluation of 
fair value of goodwill, we determined it did 
not impact the overall goodwill impairment 
analysis as we believe the decline to be 
primarily attributed to the negative market 
conditions as a result of the credit crisis, 
indications of a possible recession and cur-
rent issues within the poultry industry. We 
will continue to monitor our market capital-
ization as a potential impairment indicator 
considering overall market conditions and 
poultry industry events.

Our ﬁ scal 2008 other intangible asset 
impairment analysis did not result in a mate-
rial impairment charge. A hypothetical 10% 
decrease in the fair value of intangible assets 
would not result in a material impairment.

Description

Judgments and Uncertainties

Changes in tax laws and rates could affect 
recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in the future.

Changes in projected future earnings could 
affect the recorded valuation allowances in 
the future.

Our calculations related to income taxes 
contain uncertainties due to judgment used 
to calculate tax liabilities in the application 
of complex tax regulations across the tax 
jurisdictions where we operate.

Our analysis of unrecognized tax beneﬁ ts 
contain uncertainties based on judgment 
used to apply the more likely than not 
recognition and measurement thresholds 
of FIN 48.

Income taxes
We estimate total income tax expense 
based on statutory tax rates and tax plan-
ning opportunities available to us in various 
jurisdictions in which we earn income.

Federal income taxes include an estimate 
for taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiar-
ies expected to be remitted to the United 
States and be taxable, but not for earnings 
considered indeﬁ nitely invested in the for-
eign subsidiary.

Deferred income taxes are recognized for 
the future tax effects of temporary differ-
ences between ﬁ nancial and income tax 
reporting using tax rates in effect for the 
years in which the differences are expected 
to reverse.

Valuation allowances are recorded when it is 
likely a tax beneﬁ t will not be realized for a 
deferred tax asset.

We record unrecognized tax beneﬁ t liabili-
ties for known or anticipated tax issues 
based on our analysis of whether, and the 
extent to which, additional taxes will be due. 
This analysis is performed in accordance 
with the requirements of FIN 48, which we 
adopted at the beginning of ﬁ scal year 2008.

Effect if Actual Results Differ

from Assumptions

We do not believe there is a reasonable like-
lihood there will be a material change in the 
tax related balances or valuation allowances. 
However, due to the complexity of some of 
these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution 
may result in a payment that is materially 
different from the current estimate of the 
tax liabilities.

To the extent we prevail in matters for which 
FIN 48 liabilities have been established, or 
are required to pay amounts in excess of our 
recorded FIN 48 liabilities, our effective tax 
rate in a given ﬁ nancial statement period 
could be materially affected. An unfavorable 
tax settlement would require use of our cash 
and result in an increase in our effective tax 
rate in the period of resolution. A favor-
able tax settlement would be recognized as 
a reduction in our effective tax rate in the 
period of resolution.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE 
ABOUT MARKET RISK

MARKET RISK
Market risk relating to our operations results primarily from changes 
in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, as 
well as credit risk concentrations. To address certain of these risks, 
we enter into various derivative transactions as described below. If 
a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge, as deﬁ ned by 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting 
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (SFAS No. 133), 

as amended, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the 
fair value of the instrument either will be offset against the change 
in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or ﬁ rm commitments 
through earnings, or be recognized in other comprehensive income 
(loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective 
portion of an instrument’s change in fair value, as deﬁ ned by SFAS 
No. 133, is recognized immediately. Additionally, we hold certain 
positions, primarily in grain and livestock futures that either do 
not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or are not designated as 
hedges. These positions are marked to market, and the unrealized 
gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date. 

27  2008 Annual Report

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (continued)

Changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management 
activities relating to forward sales contracts are recorded in sales. 
Changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management 
activities surrounding inventories on hand or anticipated purchases 
of inventories are recorded in cost of sales.

The sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of poten-
tial losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market 
prices related to commodities. Sensitivity analyses do not consider 
the actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to changes, nor 
do they consider the effects such hypothetical adverse changes may 
have on overall economic activity. Actual changes in market prices 
may differ from hypothetical changes.

Commodities Risk: We purchase certain commodities, such as grains 
and livestock, in the course of normal operations. As part of our 
commodity risk management activities, we use derivative ﬁ nancial 
instruments, primarily futures and options, to reduce the effect 
of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying 
commodity. However, as the commodities underlying our derivative 
ﬁ nancial instruments can experience signiﬁ cant price ﬂ uctuations, 
any requirement to mark-to-market the positions that have not been 
designated or do not qualify as hedges under SFAS No. 133 could 
result in volatility in our results of operations. Contract terms of a 
hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing 
a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts designated 
and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation 
criteria are recorded using hedge accounting. The following table 
presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change 
of 10% in market prices as of September 27, 2008, and September 29, 
2007, on the fair value of open positions. The fair value of such posi-
tions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commod-
ity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. The market 
risk exposure analysis includes hedge and non-hedge derivative 
ﬁ nancial instruments.

Interest Rate Risk: At September 27, 2008, we had ﬁ xed-rate debt of 
$2.9 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 7.0%. We have 
exposure to changes in interest rates on this ﬁ xed-rate debt. Market 
risk for ﬁ xed-rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair 
value, resulting from a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates. 
A hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates would have increased 
the fair value of our ﬁ xed-rate debt by approximately $45 million at 
September 27, 2008, and $58 million at September 29, 2007. The fair 
values of our debt were estimated based on quoted market prices 
and/or published interest rates.

At September 27, 2008, we had variable rate debt of $19 million with 
a weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. A hypothetical 10% increase 
in interest rates effective at September 27, 2008, and September 29, 
2007, would have a minimal effect on interest expense.

Foreign Currency Risk: We have foreign exchange gain/loss exposure 
from ﬂ uctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a 
result of certain receivable and payable balances. The primary cur-
rency exchanges we have exposure to are the Canadian dollar, the 
Mexican peso, the European euro, the British pound sterling and 
the Brazilian real. We periodically enter into foreign exchange 
forward contracts to hedge some portion of our foreign currency 
exposure. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates 
effective at September 27, 2008, and September 29, 2007, related 
to the foreign exchange forward contracts would have an $11 million 
and $3 million, respectively, impact on pretax income. In the future, 
we may enter into more foreign exchange forward contracts as a 
result of our international growth strategy.

Concentrations of Credit Risk: Our ﬁ nancial instruments exposed to 
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and 
trade receivables. Our cash equivalents are in high quality securities 
placed with major banks and ﬁ nancial institutions. Concentrations 
of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large 
number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. 
We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ ﬁ nancial 
condition and generally do not require collateral. At September 27, 
2008, and September 29, 2007, 12.2% and 12.1%, respectively, of our 
net accounts receivable balance was due from Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. 
No other single customer or customer group represents greater than 
10% of net accounts receivable.

to, current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, 
industry conditions in domestic and international markets, our 
performance and ﬁ nancial results, including, without limitation, 
debt-levels, return on invested capital, value-added product growth, 
capital expenditures, tax rates, access to foreign markets and 
dividend policy. These forward-looking statements are subject to 
a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause our actual

cost and availability of inputs and raw materials, such as live cattle, 
live swine, feed grains (including corn and soybean meal) and energy; 
(ii) market conditions for ﬁ nished products, including competition 
from other global and domestic food processors, supply and pricing 
of competing products and alternative proteins and demand for 
alternative proteins; (iii) successful rationalization of existing facilities 
and operating efﬁ ciencies of the facilities; (iv) risks associated with

our commodity trading risk management activities; (v) access to 
foreign markets together with foreign economic conditions, including 
currency ﬂ uctuations, import/export restrictions and foreign politics; 
(vi) outbreak of a livestock disease (such as avian inﬂ uenza (AI) or 
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)), which could have an 
effect on livestock we own, the availability of livestock we purchase, 
consumer perception of certain protein products or our ability to 
access certain domestic and foreign markets; (vii) changes in avail-
ability and relative costs of labor and contract growers and our 
ability to maintain good relationships with employees, labor unions, 
contract growers and independent producers providing us live-
stock; (viii) issues related to food safety, including costs resulting 
from product recalls, regulatory compliance and any related claims 
or litigation; (ix) changes in consumer preference and diets and our 
ability to identify and react to consumer trends; (x) signiﬁ cant mar-
keting plan changes by large customers or loss of one or more large 
customers; (xi) adverse results from litigation; (xii) risks associated 
with leverage, including cost increases due to rising interest rates or 
changes in debt ratings or outlook; (xiii) compliance with and changes 
to regulations and laws (both domestic and foreign), including 
changes in accounting standards, tax laws, environmental laws and 
occupational, health and safety laws; (xiv) our ability to make effec-
tive acquisitions or joint ventures and successfully integrate newly 
acquired businesses into existing operations; (xv) effectiveness of

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Description of Business: Tyson Foods, Inc. (collectively, “Company,” 
“we,” “us” or “our”), founded in 1935 with world headquarters in 
Springdale, Arkansas, is the world’s largest processor and marketer 
of chicken, beef and pork and the second-largest food production 
company in the Fortune 500. We produce a wide variety of brand 
name protein-based and prepared food products marketed in the 
United States and more than 90 countries around the world. We 
are a recognized market leader in the retail and foodservice markets 
we serve. We have approximately 107,000 employees and more than 
300 facilities and ofﬁ ces in 28 states and 22 countries.

Consolidation: The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements include the 
accounts of all wholly-owned subsidiaries, as well as majority-
owned subsidiaries for which we have a controlling interest. All 
signiﬁ cant intercompany accounts and transactions have been 
eliminated in consolidation.

and several “zero-balance” disbursement accounts for funding payroll, 
accounts payable, livestock procurement, grower payments, etc. 
As a result of our cash management system, checks issued, but not 
presented to the banks for payment, may result in negative book cash 
balances. These negative book cash balances are included in trade 
accounts payable and other current liabilities. Checks outstanding in 
excess of related book cash balances totaled approximately $322 mil-
lion at September 27, 2008, and $255 million at September 29, 2007.

Accounts Receivable: We record trade accounts receivable at net 
realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for 
estimated uncollectible accounts to reﬂ ect any loss anticipated on 
the trade accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision 
for doubtful accounts. We calculate this allowance based on our 
history of write-offs, level of past due accounts and relationships 
with and economic status of our customers. We generally do not 
have collateral for our receivables, but we do periodically evaluate 
the credit worthiness of our customers.

We have an investment in a joint venture, Dynamic Fuels LLC (Dynamic), 
in which we have a 50 percent ownership interest. Dynamic qualiﬁ es 
as a variable interest entity under Financial Accounting Standards 
Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R) “Consolidation of Variable 
Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51” (FIN 46(R)). Effective 
June 30, 2008, we began consolidating Dynamic since we are the 
primary beneﬁ ciary as deﬁ ned by FIN 46(R).

Inventories: Processed products, livestock and supplies and other 
are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost includes purchased 
raw materials, live purchase costs, growout costs (primarily feed, 
contract grower pay and catch and haul costs), labor and manufac-
turing and production overhead, which are related to the purchase 
and production of inventories.

2007

Fiscal Year: We utilize a 52- or 53-week accounting period ending on 
the Saturday closest to September 30.

Reclassiﬁ cation: In the fourth quarter ﬁ scal 2008, we began to man-
age and report the operating results and identiﬁ able assets of our 
logistics operations in the segment in which the product being 
moved relates. As a result, our operating segments now reﬂ ect 
logistics operations which were previously included in Other. All 
prior periods have been restated to reﬂ ect this change.

Discontinued Operation: On June 25, 2008, we executed a letter of 
intent with XL Foods Inc. to sell the beef processing, cattle feed yard 
and fertilizer assets of Lakeside Farm Industries Ltd. (Lakeside), our 
wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary. The ﬁ nancial statements report 
Lakeside as a discontinued operation. See Note 3: Discontinued 
Operation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for 
further information. Accordingly, all prior periods have been restated.

Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash equivalents consist of investments 
in short-term, highly liquid securities having original maturities of 
three months or less, which are made as part of our cash manage-
ment activity. The carrying values of these assets approximate their 
fair market values. We primarily utilize a cash management system 
with a series of separate accounts consisting of lockbox accounts for 
receiving cash, concentration accounts where funds are moved to,

Depreciation: We primarily use the straight-line method to calculate 
depreciation, using estimated lives for buildings and leasehold improve-
ments of 10 to 33 years, machinery and equipment of three to 12 years 
and land improvements and other of three to 20 years.

Long-Lived Assets: We review the carrying value of long-lived 
assets at each balance sheet date if indication of impairment exists. 
Recoverability is assessed using undiscounted cash ﬂ ows based on 
historical results and current projections of earnings before interest 
and taxes. We measure impairment as the excess of carrying cost 
over the fair value of an asset. The fair value of an asset is measured 
using discounted cash ﬂ ows of future operating results based on a 
discount rate that corresponds to our cost of capital.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: Goodwill and indeﬁ nite life 
intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, 
but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently 
if impairment indicators arise. Our goodwill is allocated by report-
ing unit, and we follow a two-step process to evaluate if a potential 
impairment exists. We have estimated the fair value of our reporting 
units using a discounted cash ﬂ ow analysis. This analysis requires 
us to make various judgmental estimates and assumptions about 
sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount factors. While 
estimating the fair value of our Beef and Chicken reporting units, we 
assumed operating margins in future years in excess of the margins 
realized in the most recent year. The fair value estimates for these 
reporting units assume normalized operating margin assumptions and 
improved operating efﬁ ciencies based on long-term expectations 
and operating margins historically realized in the beef and chicken 
industries. As a result of the ﬁ rst step of our goodwill impairment 
review, a potential impairment did not exist; therefore, the second 
step was not considered necessary. While we believe we have made 
reasonable estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of 
our reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. If our 
actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions 
used to calculate the fair value of our reporting units, we may be 
required to perform the second step which could result in a material 
impairment of our goodwill.

During the latter part of the fourth quarter of ﬁ scal 2008 and con-
tinuing into November 2008, our market capitalization was below 
book value. While we considered the market capitalization decline 
in our evaluation of fair value of goodwill, we determined it did not 
impact the overall goodwill impairment analysis as we believe the 
decline to be primarily attributed to the negative market conditions 
as a result of the credit crisis, indications of a possible recession 
and current issues within the poultry industry. We will continue to 
monitor our market capitalization as a potential impairment indicator 
considering overall market conditions and poultry industry events.

The fair value of trademarks is determined using a royalty rate method 
based on expected revenues by trademark, and the fair value of our 
in-process patents is determined using the present value of estimated 
future cash ﬂ ows.

Investments: We have investments in joint ventures and other entities. 
We use the cost method of accounting where our voting interests 
are less than 20 percent and the equity method of accounting where 
our voting interests are in excess of 20 percent, but we do not have 
a controlling interest or a variable interest in which we are the pri-
mary beneﬁ ciary. Investments in joint ventures and other entities 
are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other Assets.

We have investments in marketable debt securities. As of 
September 27, 2008, and September 29, 2007, $94 million, were 
classiﬁ ed in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, 
with maturities ranging up to 48 years. We have determined all 
our marketable debt securities are available-for-sale investments. 

These investments are reported at fair value based on quoted 
market prices as of the balance sheet date, with unrealized gains 
and losses, net of tax, recorded in other comprehensive income. 
The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of 
premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization 
is recorded in interest income. The cost of securities sold is based on 
the speciﬁ c identiﬁ cation method. Realized gains and losses on the 
sale of debt securities and declines in value judged to be other than 
temporary are recorded on a net basis in other income. Interest and 
dividends on securities classiﬁ ed as available-for-sale are recorded 
in interest income.

Accrued Self Insurance: We use a combination of insurance and 
self-insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities 
for health and welfare, workers’ compensation, auto liability and 
general liability risks. Liabilities associated with our risks retained are 
estimated, in part, by considering claims experience, demographic 
factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions.

Capital Stock: We have two classes of capital stock, Class A Common 
Stock, $0.10 par value (Class A stock) and Class B Common Stock, 
$0.10 par value (Class B stock). Holders of Class B stock may convert 
such stock into Class A stock on a share-for-share basis. Holders of 
Class B stock are entitled to 10 votes per share, while holders of 
Class A stock are entitled to one vote per share on matters sub-
mitted to shareholders for approval. As of September 27, 2008, 
members of the Tyson family beneﬁ cially own, in the aggregate, 
99.97% of the outstanding shares of Class B stock and 2.31% of the 
outstanding shares of Class A stock, giving the Tyson family control 
of approximately 70% of the total voting power of the outstanding 
voting stock. Cash dividends cannot be paid to holders of Class B 
stock unless they are simultaneously paid to holders of Class A stock. 
The per share amount of the cash dividend paid to holders of Class B 
stock cannot exceed 90% of the cash dividend simultaneously paid 
to holders of Class A stock. We pay quarterly cash dividends to Class A 
and Class B shareholders. We paid Class A dividends per share of 
$0.16 and Class B dividends per share of $0.144 in each of ﬁ scal years 
2008, 2007 and 2006.

The Class B stock is considered a participating security requiring the 
use of the two-class method for the computation of basic earnings 
per share. The two-class computation method for each period reﬂ ects 
the cash dividends paid for each class of stock, plus the amount of 
allocated undistributed earnings (losses) computed using the partici-
pation percentage, which reﬂ ects the dividend rights of each class 
of stock. Basic earnings per share were computed using the two-
class method for all periods presented. The shares of Class B stock 
are considered to be participating convertible securities since the 
shares of Class B stock are convertible on a share-for-share basis into 
shares of Class A stock. Diluted earnings per share were computed 
assuming the conversion of the Class B shares into Class A shares as 
of the beginning of each period.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Financial Instruments: We purchase certain commodities, such as 
grains and livestock in the course of normal operations. As part of 
our commodity risk management activities, we use derivative ﬁ nan-
cial instruments, primarily futures and options, to reduce our exposure 
to various market risks related to these purchases, as well as to changes 
in foreign currency exchange rates. Contract terms of a ﬁ nancial 
instrument qualifying as a hedge instrument closely mirror those of 
the hedged item, providing a high degree of risk reduction and cor-
relation. Contracts designated and highly effective at meeting risk 
reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge account-
ing. If a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge, changes 
in the fair value of the instrument will be offset either against the 
change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or ﬁ rm commit-
ments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income 
(loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective 
portion of an instrument’s change in fair value is immediately recog-
nized in earnings as a component of cost of sales. Instruments we 
hold as part of our risk management activities that do not meet the 
criteria for hedge accounting are marked to fair value with unreal-
ized gains or losses reported currently in earnings. Changes in market 
value of derivatives used in our risk management activities relating to 
forward sales contracts are recorded in sales. Changes in market value 
of derivatives used in our risk management activities surrounding 
inventories on hand or anticipated purchases of inventories or 
supplies are recorded in cost of sales. We generally do not hedge 
anticipated transactions beyond 12 months.

Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenue when title and risk of 
loss are transferred to customers, which is generally on delivery 
based on terms of sale. Revenue is recognized as the net amount 
estimated to be received after deducting estimated amounts for 
discounts, trade allowances and product terms.

Litigation Reserves: There are a variety of legal proceedings pending 
or threatened against us. Accruals are recorded when it is probable 
a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be 
reasonably estimated based on current law, progress of each case, 
opinions and views of legal counsel and other advisers, our experi-
ence in similar matters and intended response to the litigation. These 
amounts, which are not discounted and are exclusive of claims against 
third parties, are adjusted periodically as assessment efforts progress 
or additional information becomes available. We expense amounts 
for administering or litigating claims as incurred. Accruals for legal 
proceedings are included in Other current liabilities in the Consoli-
dated Balance Sheets.

Freight Expense: Freight expense associated with products shipped to 
customers is recognized in cost of sales.

Advertising and Promotion Expenses: Advertising and promotion 
expenses are charged to operations in the period incurred. Customer 
incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction 
to sales based on amounts estimated as being due to customers, 
based primarily on historical utilization and redemption rates, while 

other advertising and promotional activities are recorded as selling, 
general and administrative expenses. Advertising and promotion 
expenses for ﬁ scal years 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $495 million, 
$467 million and $493 million, respectively.

Use of Estimates: The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements are prepared 
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated ﬁ nancial state-
ments and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from 
those estimates.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements: In September 2006, 
the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, 
“Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 provides 
guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. This 
standard also responds to investors’ requests for expanded infor-
mation about the extent to which companies measure assets and 
liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value and 
the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS No. 157 applies 
whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to 
be measured at fair value. Beginning September 28, 2008, we partially 
applied SFAS No. 157 as allowed by FASB Staff Position (FSP) 157-2, 
which delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for nonﬁ nancial 
assets and liabilities. As of September 28, 2008, we have applied 
the provisions of SFAS No. 157 to our ﬁ nancial instruments and the 
impact was not material. Under FSP 157-2, we will be required to 
apply SFAS No. 157 to our nonﬁ nancial assets and liabilities at the 
beginning of ﬁ scal 2010. We are currently reviewing the applicability 
of SFAS No. 157 to our nonﬁ nancial assets and liabilities as well as 
the potential impact on our consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and 
Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statement 
No. 115” (SFAS No. 159). This statement provides companies with an 
option to report selected ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities ﬁ rm commit-
ments, and nonﬁ nancial warranty and insurance contracts at fair value 
on a contract-by-contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized 
in earnings each reporting period. At September 28, 2008, we did not 
elect the fair value option under SFAS No. 159 and therefore there 
was no impact to our consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Finan-
cial Statements” (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 amends Accounting 
Research Bulletin No. 51, “Consolidated Financial Statements” to 
establish accounting and reporting standards for a noncontrolling 
interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. 
This statement clariﬁ es that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary 
is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity and should be 
reported as equity in the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements, rather

than in the liability or mezzanine section between liabilities and 
equity. SFAS No. 160 also requires consolidated net income be reported 
at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent 
and the noncontrolling interest. The impact of SFAS No. 160 will not 
have a material impact on our current Consolidated Financial State-
ments. SFAS No. 160 is effective for ﬁ scal years, and interim periods 
within those ﬁ scal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008; 
therefore, we expect to adopt SFAS No. 160 at the beginning 
of ﬁ scal 2010.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Account-
ing Standards No. 141R, “Business Combinations” (SFAS No. 141R). SFAS 
No. 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer 
in a business combination: 1) recognizes and measures in its ﬁ nancial 
statements identiﬁ able assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any 
noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; 2) recognizes and measures 
goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain 
purchase; and 3) determines what information to disclose to enable 
users of the ﬁ nancial statements to evaluate the nature and ﬁ nancial 
effects of a business combination. SFAS No. 141R is effective for busi-
ness combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the 
beginning of the ﬁ rst annual reporting period beginning on or after 
December 15, 2008; therefore, we expect to adopt SFAS No. 141R for 
any business combinations entered into beginning in ﬁ scal 2010.

In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and 
Hedging Activities – an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (SFAS 
No. 161). SFAS No. 161 establishes enhanced disclosure requirements 
about: 1) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; 2) how 
derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for 
under Statement 133 and its related interpretations; and 3) how deriva-
tive instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s ﬁ nancial 
position, ﬁ nancial performance and cash ﬂ ows. SFAS No. 161 is effec-
tive for ﬁ nancial statements issued for ﬁ scal years and interim periods 
beginning after November 15, 2008; therefore, we expect to adopt 
SFAS No. 161 in the second quarter of ﬁ scal 2009.

In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, 
“Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled 
in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)” (FSP 
APB 14-1). FSP APB 14-1 speciﬁ es that issuers of convertible debt 
instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including 
partial cash settlement) should separately account for the liability 
and equity components in a manner that will reﬂ ect the entity’s non-
convertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in 
subsequent periods. The amount allocated to the equity component 
represents a discount to the debt, which is amortized into interest 
expense using the effective interest method over the life of the debt. 
FSP APB 14-1 is effective for ﬁ nancial statements issued for ﬁ scal 
years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within 
those ﬁ scal years. Early adoption is not permitted. Therefore, we 
expect to adopt the provisions of FSP APB 14-1 beginning in the ﬁ rst 

quarter of ﬁ scal 2010. The provisions of FSP APB 14-1 are required to 
be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. Upon retrospec-
tive adoption, we anticipate our effective interest rate on our 3.25% 
Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 will range from 8.0% to 8.50%, 
which would result in the recognition of an approximate $90 million 
to $100 million discount to these notes with the offsetting after tax 
amount recorded to capital in excess of par value. This discount will 
be accreted until the maturity date at the effective interest rate, which 
will not materially impact ﬁ scal 2008 interest expense, but will result 
in an estimated $15 million to $20 million increase to our ﬁ scal 2009 
interest expense.

NOTE 2: CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued 
Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” 
an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 pre-
scribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the 
ﬁ nancial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position 
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides 
guidance on derecognition, classiﬁ cation, interest and penalties, 
accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We adopted 
FIN 48 at the beginning of ﬁ scal 2008. The adoption of FIN 48 
resulted in a change to the opening Consolidated Balance Sheet as 
follows: $32 million increase to Other Current Assets, $17 million 
decrease to Other Current Liabilities, $106 million increase to Other 
Liabilities, $40 million decrease to Deferred Income Taxes and $17 mil-
lion decrease to Retained Earnings. Included in these changes we 
recognized a $120 million increase in the liability for unrecognized 
tax beneﬁ ts and a $21 million increase in the related liability for 
interest and penalties for a total of $141 million.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Account-
ing Standards No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Deﬁ ned Beneﬁ t 
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB 
Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)” (SFAS No. 158). SFAS No. 158 
requires companies to recognize the funded status of a deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its consolidated 
balance sheet and to recognize changes in funded status in the year 
in which the changes occur through other comprehensive income. 
We adopted SFAS No. 158 at the end of ﬁ scal 2007 except for the 
requirement to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date 
of its annual consolidated balance sheet, which we adopted in ﬁ scal 
2008 and which had an immaterial impact. See Note 13, “Pensions and 
Other Postretirement Beneﬁ ts” in the Notes to Consolidated Finan-
cial Statements for the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158.

In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47, an interpretation of SFAS 
No. 143. SFAS No. 143 was issued in June 2001 and requires an entity 
to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obliga-
tion in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of 
fair value can be made. SFAS No. 143 applies to legal obligations 

37  2008 Annual Report

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that 
resulted from the acquisition, construction, development and/or 
the normal operation of a long-lived asset. The associated asset costs 
are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. 
FIN 47 clariﬁ es the term “conditional asset retirement obligation” as 
used in SFAS No. 143, which refers to a legal obligation to perform 
an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of 
settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be 
within the control of the entity. FIN 47 requires an entity to recog-
nize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement 
obligation if the fair value of the liability can be estimated reason-
ably. Uncertainty about the timing and/or method of settlement of 
a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into 
the measurement of the liability when sufﬁ cient information exists. 
SFAS No. 143 acknowledges in some cases, sufﬁ cient information 
may not be available to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset 
retirement obligation (ARO). We adopted FIN 47 in the fourth quarter 
of ﬁ scal 2006. In connection with the adoption, an ARO liability of 
$12 million, a related ARO asset of $3 million and a cumulative adjust-
ment due to change in accounting principle, net of tax of $5 million 
were recorded. The ARO liability is included in Other Liabilities and 
the ARO asset is included in Property, Plant and Equipment on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The principal conditional asset retire-
ment obligations relate to the potential future closure, sale or other 
disposal of certain production facilities. In connection with any such 
activity, we are legally obligated under various federal, state and local 
laws to properly retire the related wastewater treatment facility.

NOTE 3: DISCONTINUED OPERATION
On June 25, 2008, we executed a letter of intent with XL Foods Inc. 
to sell the beef processing, cattle feed yard and fertilizer assets of 
Lakeside for $104 million. Lakeside was part of our Beef segment. 
XL Foods will pay an additional amount for cattle inventory, fertilizer 
inventory and packaging assets, estimated to approximate $82 mil-
lion. This transaction is denominated in Canadian Dollars, thus 
conversion at the closing date to US Dollars could result in amounts 
in US Dollars different than noted. We will retain certain working 
capital items, including ﬁ nished product inventory, accounts receiv-
able and accounts payable, of the Lakeside operation as of the 
closing date, which totaled $89 million at September 27, 2008. 
Once the transaction is complete, we expect retained working 
capital, including inventory, at Lakeside will be liquidated and 
settled over a two-month period.

Approximately $60 million of Beef segment goodwill relates to 
Lakeside. In addition, at September 27, 2008, we had $60 million of 
currency translation adjustment gain in accumulated comprehensive 
income related to the Lakeside Canadian dollar translation. Subse-
quent to September 27, 2008, the Canadian dollar weakened versus 
the US dollar, which may result in a decrease in the currency trans-
lation adjustment gain.

The transaction remains subject to government approvals and execu-
tion of a deﬁ nitive agreement between Tyson and XL Foods. Subject 
to receipt of such approvals, we anticipate being ready to complete 
the sale by the end of the ﬁ rst quarter ﬁ scal 2009 and are reporting 
the Lakeside results as a discontinued operation.

NOTE 4: DISPOSITIONS AND OTHER CHARGES
In ﬁ scal 2008, we recorded charges of $10 million related to intan-
gible asset impairments. Of this amount, $8 million is reﬂ ected in 
the Beef segment’s Operating Income and $2 million in the Prepared 
Foods segment’s Operating Income, and both are recorded in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations in Cost of Sales. We recorded 
estimated charges of $7 million related to ﬂ ood damage at our 
Jefferson, Wisconsin, plant. This amount is reﬂ ected in the Prepared 
Foods segment’s Operating Income and included in the Consolidated 
Statements of Operations in Cost of Sales. We also recorded a charge 
of $6 million related to the impairment of unimproved real property 
in Memphis, Tennessee. This amount is reﬂ ected in the Chicken seg-
ment’s Operating Income (Loss) and included in the Consolidated 
Statements of Operations in Cost of Sales. Additionally, we recorded 
an $18 million non-operating gain as the result of a private equity 
ﬁ rm’s purchase of a technology company in which we held a minority 
interest. This gain was recorded in Other Income in the Consolidated 
Statements of Operations.

In February 2008, we announced discontinuation of an existing prod-
uct line and closing of one of our three poultry plants in Wilkesboro, 
North Carolina. The Wilkesboro Cooked Products plant ceased oper-
ations during the second quarter of ﬁ scal 2008. The closure resulted 
in elimination of approximately 400 jobs. In ﬁ scal 2008, we recorded 
charges of $13 million for estimated impairment charges. This amount 
is reﬂ ected in the Chicken segment’s Operating Income (Loss) and 
included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in Other 
Charges. No material adjustments to the accrual are anticipated.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

In January 2008, we announced the decision to restructure opera-
tions at our Emporia, Kansas, beef plant. Beef slaughter operations 
ceased during the second quarter of ﬁ scal 2008. However, the facility 
will still be used to process certain commodity, specialty cuts and 
ground beef, as well as a cold storage and distribution warehouse. 
This restructuring resulted in elimination of approximately 1,700 jobs 
at the Emporia plant. In ﬁ scal 2008, we recorded charges of $10 mil-
lion for estimated impairment charges and $7 million of other closing 
costs, consisting of $6 million for employee termination beneﬁ ts and 
$1 million in other plant-closing related liabilities. These amounts 
were reﬂ ected in the Beef segment’s Operating Income (Loss) and 
included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in Other 
Charges. We have fully paid the employee termination beneﬁ ts and 
other plant-closing related liabilities. No material adjustments to the 
accrual are anticipated.

In ﬁ scal 2008, management approved plans for implementation of 
certain recommendations resulting from the previously announced 
FAST initiative, which was focused on process improvement and 
efﬁ ciency creation. As a result, in ﬁ scal 2008, we recorded charges 
of $6 million related to employee termination beneﬁ ts resulting 
from termination of approximately 200 employees. Of these charges, 
$2 million, $2 million, $1 million and $1 million, respectively, were 
recorded in the Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods segments’ 
Operating Income (Loss) and included in the Consolidated State-
ments of Operations in Other Charges. We have fully paid the 
employee termination beneﬁ ts. No material adjustments to 
the accrual are anticipated.

In May 2007, we announced the completion of the sale of two of 
our Alabama poultry plants and related support facilities. As part 
of strategic efforts to reduce the production of commodity chicken, 
we sold our processing plants in Ashland and Gadsden, which also 
included a nearby feed mill and two hatcheries. These facilities 
employed approximately 1,200 employees, of which approximately 
800 were hired by the acquiring company, while the remaining 
employees were offered the opportunity to transfer to our other 
operations in Alabama. We recorded a gain of $10 million on the 
sale in ﬁ scal 2007. The gain was recorded in the Chicken segment’s 
Operating Income (Loss) and included in the Consolidated State-
ments of Operations in Cost of Sales.

In July 2006, we announced our decision to implement a Cost Man-
agement Initiative as part of a strategy to return to proﬁ tability. The 
cost reductions include stafﬁ ng costs, consulting and professional 
fees, sales and marketing costs and other expenses. In ﬁ scal 2006, we 
recorded charges of approximately $9 million for employee termina-
tion beneﬁ ts resulting from the termination of approximately 400 
employees. Of these charges, $4 million, $3 million, $1 million and 
$1 million, respectively, were included in the Chicken, Beef, Pork and 
Prepared Foods segments’ Operating Income (Loss) and included in 
the Consolidated Statements of Operations in Other charges in 

the period ending September 30, 2006. In ﬁ scal 2007, there were no 
material adjustments to amounts accrued. We have fully paid the 
estimated employee termination beneﬁ ts. No material adjustments 
to the accrual are anticipated.

In August 2006, we announced our decision to close the Boise, Idaho, 
beef slaughter plant and to scale back processing operations at our 
Pasco, Washington, complex. This decision resulted in the elimination 
of approximately 770 positions. The closure and processing change 
occurred in October 2006 and did not result in a signiﬁ cant charge.

In February 2006, we announced our decision to close the Norfolk, 
Nebraska, beef processing plant and the West Point, Nebraska, beef 
slaughter plant. These facilities closed in February 2006. Production 
from these facilities was shifted primarily to our beef complex in 
Dakota City, Nebraska. Combined, these two facilities employed 
approximately 1,665 employees. We sold the West Point plant in ﬁ scal 
2007, while the Norfolk plant and related property are currently 
offered for sale. In ﬁ scal 2006, we recorded charges of $38 million 
for estimated impairment charges and $9 million of other closing 
costs, consisting of $5 million for employee termination beneﬁ ts and 
$4 million in other plant closing related liabilities. These amounts 
were reﬂ ected in the Beef segment’s Operating Income (Loss) and 
included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in Other 
charges. We have fully paid the estimated employee termination 
beneﬁ ts and other plant closing related liabilities. No material 
adjustments to the accrual are anticipated.

In January 2006, we announced our decision to close two processed 
meats facilities in northeast Iowa. The Independence and Oelwein 
plants, which produced chopped ham and sliced luncheon meats, 
closed in March 2006. Combined, these two facilities employed 
approximately 400 employees. Equipment from these facilities was 
removed and either sold or transferred to our other locations, while 
the plants and related property are currently offered for sale. In ﬁ scal 
2006, we recorded charges of $12 million for estimated impairment 
charges and $1 million for employee termination beneﬁ ts. These 
amounts were reﬂ ected in the Prepared Foods segment’s Operat-
ing Income (Loss) and included in the Consolidated Statements 
of Operations in Other charges. We have fully paid the estimated 
employee termination beneﬁ ts. No material adjustments to the 
accrual are anticipated.

NOTE 5: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
We had derivative related balances of $29 million and $16 million 
recorded in other current assets at September 27, 2008, and 
September 29, 2007, respectively, and $45 million and $48 million in 
other current liabilities at September 27, 2008, and September 29, 
2007, respectively.

39  2008 Annual Report

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Cash ﬂ ow hedges: Derivative products, such as futures and options, 
are designated as hedges against changes in the amount of future 
cash ﬂ ows related to commodities procurement. We do not purchase 
derivative products related to grain procurement in excess of our 
physical grain consumption requirements. Related to our grain hedges, 
there were $5 million of net losses recorded in accumulated other 
comprehensive income at September 27, 2008. These losses will be 
recognized within the next 12 months. Of these losses, the portion 
resulting from our open hedge positions was a net loss of $4 million 
as of September 27, 2008. Ineffectiveness related to our cash ﬂ ow 
hedges was not signiﬁ cant during ﬁ scal 2008, 2007 or 2006.

Fair value hedges: We designate certain futures contracts as fair value 
hedges of ﬁ rm commitments to purchase livestock for slaughter. 
Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and quali-
ﬁ es as a fair value hedge, along with changes in fair value of the 
hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk (including 
gains or losses on ﬁ rm commitments), are recorded in current period 
earnings. Ineffectiveness results when the change in the fair value 
of the hedge instrument differs from the change in fair value of the 
hedged item. Ineffectiveness related to fair value hedges was not 
signiﬁ cant during ﬁ scal 2008, 2007 and 2006.

During ﬁ scal 2006, we discontinued the use of hedge accounting 
for certain ﬁ nancial instruments to hedge forward cattle purchases. 
Hedge accounting was discontinued to provide a natural offset to the 
gains and losses resulting from our derivatives tied to forward ﬁ xed 
price sales of boxed beef, as this activity does not qualify for hedge 
accounting. The contracts for which hedge accounting was discontin-
ued had a fair value of approximately $28 million at the discontinued 
date, and was primarily recognized as a component of cost of sales 
in ﬁ scal 2006. However, due to changes in our beef market strategies 
and business conditions, we now have more forward cattle purchase 
derivatives relative to ﬁ xed forward boxed beef sales derivatives which 
can and have caused mark-to-market earnings volatility. Accordingly, 
effective in the fourth quarter ﬁ scal 2008, we began designating 
certain futures contracts as fair value hedges of forward cattle 
purchases. We anticipate this change will help reduce volatility 
of quarterly reported beef earnings.

Undesignated positions: We hold positions as part of our risk 
management activities, primarily futures and options for grains 
and livestock, for which we do not apply hedge accounting, but 
instead mark these positions to fair value through earnings at each 
reporting date. We generally do not enter into undesignated posi-
tions beyond 18 months. Related to grain positions for which we 
did not apply hedge accounting, we recognized pretax net gains of 
approximately $169 million, $50 million and $8 million, respectively, 
in cost of sales for ﬁ scal 2008, 2007 and 2006, which included an 
unrealized pretax loss on open mark-to-market futures positions 
of $4 million as of September 27, 2008.

We enter into certain forward sales of boxed beef and boxed pork 
and forward purchases of cattle at ﬁ xed prices. The ﬁ xed price sales 
contracts lock in the proceeds from a sale in the future and the ﬁ xed 
cattle purchases lock in the cost. However, the cost of the livestock 
and the related boxed beef and boxed pork market prices at the time 
of the sale or purchase could vary from this ﬁ xed price. As we enter 
into ﬁ xed forward sales of boxed beef and boxed pork and forward 
purchases of cattle, we also enter into the appropriate number of 
livestock futures positions to mitigate a portion of this risk. Changes 
in market value of the open livestock futures positions are marked to 
market and reported in earnings at each reporting date, even though 
the economic impact of our ﬁ xed prices being above or below the 
market price is only realized at the time of sale or purchase. In con-
nection with these livestock futures, we recorded realized and 
unrealized net gains of $83 million in ﬁ scal 2008, which included 
an unrealized pretax gain on open mark-to-market futures positions 
of approximately $3 million as of September 27, 2008. We recorded 
realized and unrealized net gains of $14 million and realized and 
unrealized net losses of $39 million in ﬁ scal 2007 and 2006, respec-
tively, related to livestock futures positions.

Additionally, we enter into grain derivatives to manage the risk of 
costs associated with forward sales to certain customers for which 
sales prices are determined under cost-plus arrangements. These 
unrealized positions, which do not qualify for hedge treatment, 
totaled a loss of $24 million and a gain of $9 million at September 27, 
2008, and September 29, 2007, respectively. When these positions 
are liquidated, we expect any realized gains or losses will be reﬂ ected 
in the prices of the poultry products sold. Since these derivative 
positions do not qualify for hedge treatment, they initially create 
volatility in our income statement associated with mark-to-market 
changes. However, once the positions are liquidated and included 
in the sales price to the customer, there is ultimately no income 
statement impact as any previous mark-to-market gains or losses 
are included in the prices of the poultry products.

Foreign currency positions: We enter into foreign currency forward 
contracts to manage the risk from changes in the fair value or future 
cash ﬂ ows of receivables, payables and purchase commitments arising 
from changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies. We have 
not applied hedge accounting to these contracts. The fair value 
of the foreign exchange contracts was not signiﬁ cant as of 
September 27, 2008, and September 29, 2007.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Fair values are based on quoted market prices or published forward 
interest rate curves. Carrying values for derivative positions equal 
the fair values as of September 27, 2008, and September 29, 2007, 
and the carrying value of total debt was $2.9 billion and $2.8 billion, 
respectively. All other ﬁ nancial instruments’ fair values approximate 
recorded values at September 27, 2008, and September 29, 2007.

Concentrations of Credit Risk: Our ﬁ nancial instruments exposed to 
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents 
and trade receivables. Cash equivalents are in high quality securities 
placed with major banks and ﬁ nancial institutions. Concentrations 
of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large 
number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. 
We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ ﬁ nancial 
condition and generally do not require collateral. At September 27, 
2008, and September 29, 2007, 12.2% and 12.1%, respectively, of our 
net accounts receivable balance was due from Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. 
No other single customer or customer group represents greater than 
10% of net accounts receivable.

Amortization expense on patents and intellectual property of 
$3 million was recognized during each of ﬁ scal years 2008, 2007 
and 2006. We estimate amortization expense on intangible assets 
will be $5 million in each of the next ﬁ ve years. Patents and intellec-
tual property are amortized using the straight-line method over their 
estimated period of beneﬁ t of ﬁ ve to 15 years and 30 years, respectively, 
beginning with the date beneﬁ ts from intangible items are realized.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

We guarantee debt of outside third parties, which consist of a lease 
and grower loans, all of which are substantially collateralized by the 
underlying assets. Terms of the underlying debt cover periods up to 
nine years, and the maximum potential amount of future payments as 
of September 27, 2008, was $66 million. We also maintain operating 
leases for various types of equipment, some of which contain residual 
value guarantees for the market value of assets at the end of the term 
of the lease. The terms of the lease maturities cover periods up to 
seven years. The maximum potential amount of the residual value 
guarantees is approximately $55 million, of which approximately 
$21 million would be recoverable through various recourse provisions 
and an undeterminable recoverable amount based on the fair market 
value of the underlying leased assets. The likelihood of material 
payments under these guarantees is not considered probable. At 
September 27, 2008, and September 29, 2007, no material liabilities 
for guarantees were recorded.

Additionally, we enter into future purchase commitments for various 
items, such as grains, livestock contracts and ﬁ xed grower fees. At 
September 27, 2008, these commitments totaled:

Annual maturities of long-term debt for the ﬁ ve ﬁ scal years subse-
quent to September 27, 2008, are: 2009 – $8 million; 2010 – $240 mil-
lion; 2011 – $1.0 billion; 2012 – $3 million; 2013 – $2 million.

Revolving Credit Facility  We have a revolving credit facility totaling 
$1.0 billion that supports short-term funding needs and letters of 
credit. The facility expires in September 2010. At September 27, 2008, 
we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $291 mil-
lion, none of which were drawn upon, issued primarily in support 
of workers’ compensation insurance programs and derivative activ-
ities. The amount available for borrowings under this facility as of 
September 27, 2008, was $709 million. All trademarks of our domestic 
subsidiaries are pledged as collateral under this facility. Additionally, 
certain domestic subsidiaries guaranteed this facility and pledged 
their inventory as collateral, which had a book value of $2.0 billion 
at September 27, 2008.

Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility  We have a receivables 
purchase agreement with three co-purchasers to sell up to $750 million 
of trade receivables. The agreement includes a $375 million 364-day 
facility expiring in August 2009 and a $375 million 364-day facility 
with an additional one-year option, which commits funding through 
August 2010. The receivables purchase agreement has been accounted 
for as a borrowing and has an interest rate based on commercial 
paper issued by the co-purchasers. Under this agreement, substan-
tially all of our accounts receivable may be sold to a special purpose 
entity, Tyson Receivables Corporation (TRC), which is a wholly-owned 
consolidated subsidiary of the Company. TRC has its own creditors 
who are entitled to be satisﬁ ed out of all of the assets of TRC prior 
to any value becoming available to the Company as TRC’s equity 
holder. At September 27, 2008, there were no amounts borrowed 
under the receivables purchase agreement.

3.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013  In September 2008, 
we issued $458 million principal amount 3.25% convertible senior 
unsecured notes due October 15, 2013 (Convertible Notes), with 
interest paid semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15. 
The conversion rate initially is 59.1935 shares of Class A stock per 
$1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to an initial 
conversion price of $16.89 per share of Class A stock. The Convertible 
Notes may be converted before the close of business on July 12, 2013, 
only under the following circumstances:

•  during any ﬁ scal quarter after December 27, 2008, if the last 
reported sale price of our Class A stock for at least 20 trading days 
during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last 
trading day of the preceding ﬁ scal quarter is at least 130% of the 
applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day (which 
would currently require our shares to trade at or above $21.96); or

42  Tyson Foods, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

•  during the ﬁ ve business days after any 10 consecutive trading 
days (measurement period) in which the trading price per $1,000 
principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measure-
ment period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported 
sale price of our Class A stock and the applicable conversion rate 
on each such day; or

We sold warrants in private transactions for total proceeds of 
$44 million. The warrants permit the purchasers to acquire up to 
approximately 27 million shares of our Class A stock at an initial 
exercise price of $22.31 per share, subject to adjustment. The war-
rants are exercisable on various dates from January 2014 through 
March 2014.

•  upon the occurrence of speciﬁ ed corporate events as deﬁ ned in 
the supplemental indenture.

On and after July 15, 2013, until the close of business on the second 
scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, 
holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the fore-
going circumstances. Upon conversion, we will deliver cash up to 
the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be con-
verted and shares of our Class A stock in respect of the remainder, if 
any, of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal 
amount of the Convertible Notes being converted.

The Convertible Notes were accounted for as a combined instrument 
pursuant to EITF Issue 90-19, “Convertible Bonds with Issuer Option 
to Settle for Cash upon Conversion.” Accordingly, we accounted for 
the entire agreement as one debt instrument because the conver-
sion feature does not meet the requirements to be accounted for 
separately as a derivative ﬁ nancial instrument.

Convertible Note Hedge and Warrant Transactions  In connection 
with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into separate 
convertible note hedge transactions with respect to our common 
stock to minimize the potential economic dilution upon conversion 
of the Convertible Notes. We also entered into separate warrant 
transactions. We recorded the purchase of the note hedge trans-
actions as a reduction to capital in excess of par value, net of $36 mil-
lion pertaining to the related deferred tax asset, and we recorded 
the proceeds of the warrant transactions as an increase to capital in 
excess of par value. Subsequent changes in fair value of these instru-
ments are not recognized in the ﬁ nancial statements as long as the 
instruments continue to meet the criteria for equity classiﬁ cation.

We purchased call options in private transactions for $94 million 
that permit us to acquire up to approximately 27 million shares of 
our Class A stock at an initial strike price of $16.89 per share, subject 
to adjustment. The call options allow us to acquire a number of shares 
of our Class A stock initially equal to the number of shares of Class A 
stock issuable to the holders of the Convertible Notes upon conver-
sion. These call options will terminate upon the maturity of the 
Convertible Notes.

These transactions, in effect, increase the initial conversion price 
of the Convertible Notes from $16.89 per share to $22.31 per share, 
thus reducing the potential future economic dilution associated 
with conversion of the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes 
and the warrants could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per 
share to the extent the price of our Class A stock during a given 
measurement period exceeds the respective exercise prices of those 
instruments. The call options are excluded from the calculation of 
diluted earnings per share as their impact is anti-dilutive.

Credit Ratings  On September 4, 2008, S&P downgraded the credit 
rating applicable to the senior notes due April 1, 2016 (2016 Notes) 
from “BBB–” to “BB.” This downgrade increased the interest rate on 
the 2016 Notes from 6.85% to 7.35%, effective beginning with the 
six month interest payment due October 1, 2008.

On November 13, 2008, Moody’s downgraded the credit rating from 
“Ba1” to “Ba3.” This downgrade increased the interest rate on the 2016 
Notes from 7.35% to 7.85%, effective beginning with the six month 
interest payment due April 1, 2009.

Debt Covenants  Our debt agreements contain various covenants, the 
most restrictive of which contain maximum allowed leverage ratios and 
a minimum required interest coverage ratio. On September 10, 2008, 
we amended our revolving credit facility agreement to provide a less 
restrictive maximum allowed leverage ratio, which takes effect in ﬁ rst 
quarter of ﬁ scal 2009. We were in compliance with all covenants at 
September 27, 2008.

Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc. (TFM), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the

NOTE 12: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
We issue shares under our stock-based compensation plans by issuing Class A stock from treasury. The total number of shares available for 
future grant under the Tyson Foods, Inc. 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (Incentive Plan) was 24,823,940 at September 27, 2008.

STOCK OPTIONS
Shareholders approved the Incentive Plan in January 2001. The Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board 
of Directors (Compensation Committee). The Incentive Plan includes provisions for granting incentive stock options for shares of Class A stock 
at a price not less than the fair market value at the date of grant. Nonqualiﬁ ed stock options may be granted at a price equal to, less than or 
more than the fair market value of Class A stock on the date the option is granted. Stock options under the Incentive Plan generally become 
exercisable ratably over two to ﬁ ve years from the date of grant and must be exercised within 10 years from the date of grant. Our policy is 
to recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during 
ﬁ scal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, was $5.22, $5.85 and 
$6.86. The fair value of each option grant is established on the date 
of grant using a binomial lattice method for grants awarded after 
October 1, 2005, and the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for 
grants awarded before October 1, 2005. The change to the binomial 
lattice method was made to better reﬂ ect the exercise behavior of 
top management. We use historical volatility for a period of time 
comparable to the expected life of the option to determine volatility 
assumptions. Expected life is calculated based on the contractual 
term of each grant and takes into account the historical exercise and 
termination behavior of participants. Risk-free interest rates are based 
on the ﬁ ve-year Treasury bond rate. Weighted average assumptions 
used in the fair value calculation are outlined in the following table.

We recognized stock-based compensation expense related to 
stock options, net of income taxes, of $12 million, $11 million and 
$9 million, respectively, during ﬁ scal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, 
with a $7 million, $6 million and $5 million related tax beneﬁ t. We 
had 2.5 million, 1.9 million and 3.3 million options vest in ﬁ scal years 
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, with a fair value of $15 million, 
$9 million and $16 million, respectively.

In ﬁ scal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, we received cash of $9 million, 
$59 million and $28 million, respectively, for the exercise of stock 
options. Shares are issued from treasury for stock option exercises. 
The related tax beneﬁ t realized from stock options exercised dur-
ing ﬁ scal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, was $1 million, $12 million and 
$4 million. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in ﬁ scal years 
2008, 2007 and 2006, was $3 million, $31 million and $10 million, 
respectively. SFAS No. 123R requires the cash ﬂ ows resulting from 
tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost of those options 
(excess tax deductions) to be classiﬁ ed as ﬁ nancing cash ﬂ ows. 
We realized $0, $9 million and $4 million, respectively, in excess 
tax deductions during ﬁ scal years 2008, 2007 and 2006. As of 
September 27, 2008, we had $40 million of total unrecognized 
compensation cost related to stock option plans that will be recog-
nized over a weighted average period of 2.7 years.

RESTRICTED STOCK
We issue restricted stock at the market value as of the date of grant, with restrictions expiring over periods through July 1, 2020. Unearned 
compensation is recognized over the vesting period for the particular grant using a straight-line method.

We recognized stock-based compensation expense related to 
restricted stock, net of income taxes, of $11 million, $14 million 
and $15 million for years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The 

related tax beneﬁ t for ﬁ scal years 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $6 million, 
$9 million and $9 million, respectively. We had 2.0 million, 3.4 mil-
lion and 0.4 million, respectively, restricted stock awards vest in ﬁ scal 
years 2008, 2007 and 2006, with a grant date fair value of $24 million, 
$37 million and $5 million.

49  2008 Annual Report

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

At September 27, 2008, we had four noncontributory deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
pension plans consisting of three funded qualiﬁ ed plans and one 
unfunded non-qualiﬁ ed plan. All three of our qualiﬁ ed plans are 
frozen and provide beneﬁ ts based on a formula using years of ser-
vice and a speciﬁ ed beneﬁ t rate. Effective January 1, 2004, we imple-
mented a non-qualiﬁ ed deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan for certain contracted 
ofﬁ cers that uses a formula based on years of service and ﬁ nal average 
salary. We also have other postretirement beneﬁ t plans for which 
substantially all of our employees may receive beneﬁ ts if they satisfy 
applicable eligibility criteria. The postretirement healthcare plans 
are contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted when 
deemed necessary.

We have deﬁ ned contribution retirement and incentive beneﬁ t 
programs for various groups of employees. We recognized expenses 
of $48 million, $46 million and $55 million in ﬁ scal 2008, 2007 and 
2006, respectively.

We use a ﬁ scal year end measurement date for our deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
plans and other postretirement plans. We generally recognize the 
effect of actuarial gains and losses into earnings immediately for 
other postretirement plans rather than amortizing the effect over 
future periods.

Other postretirement beneﬁ ts include postretirement medical costs 
and life insurance.

PERFORMANCE-BASED SHARES
In July 2003, our Compensation Committee authorized us to award 
performance-based shares of our Class A stock to certain senior 
executive ofﬁ cers on the ﬁ rst business day of each of the Company’s 
2004, 2005 and 2006 ﬁ scal years. The Compensation Committee later 
authorized the expansion of the awards to include additional senior 
ofﬁ cers and to extend out to ﬁ scal year 2008. The vesting of the 
performance-based shares for the 2006 award is over two and one-
half to three years and the vesting for the 2007 and 2008 awards is 
over three years (the Vesting Period), each award being subject to the 
attainment of goals determined by the Compensation Committee 
prior to the date of the award. We review progress toward the attain-
ment of goals each quarter during the Vesting Period. However, the 
attainment of goals can be determined only at the end of the Vest-
ing Period. If the shares vest, the ultimate cost will be equal to the 
Class A stock price on the date the shares vest times the number of 
shares awarded for all performance grants with other than market 
criteria. For grants with market performance criteria, the ultimate cost 
will be the fair value of the probable shares to vest regardless if the 
shares actually vest. Total expense recorded related to performance-
based shares was not material for ﬁ scal years 2008, 2007 and 2006.

NOTE 13: PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
Effective September 29, 2007, we adopted SFAS No. 158, which 
requires the recognition in pension obligations and accumulated 
other comprehensive income of actuarial gains or losses, prior 
service costs or credits and transition assets or obligations previ-
ously deferred under the reporting requirements of SFAS No. 87, 
SFAS No. 106 and SFAS No. 132(R). The following table reﬂ ects the

To determine the rate-of-return on assets assumption, we ﬁ rst 
examined historical rates of return for the various asset classes. 
We then determined a long-term projected rate-of-return based 
on expected returns over the next ﬁ ve to 10 years.

We have three postretirement health plans. Two of these consist 
of ﬁ xed, annual payments and account for $33 million of the post-
retirement medical obligation at September 27, 2008. A healthcare 
cost trend is not required to determine this obligation. The remain-
ing plan accounts for $14 million of the postretirement medical 
obligation at September 27, 2008. The plan covers retirees who do 
not yet qualify for Medicare and uses a healthcare cost trend of 10% 
in the current year, grading down to 6% in ﬁ scal 2012. The decision 
was made in the fourth quarter of ﬁ scal 2007 to outsource a Post-
age 65 plan to a third party insurer. This decision effectively settled 
the plan in ﬁ scal 2007. We recognized a gain of approximately 
$27 million related to this plan change. A one-percentage point 

change in assumed healthcare cost trend rate would have an 
immaterial impact on the postretirement beneﬁ t obligation and 
total service and interest cost.

PLAN ASSETS
The fair value of plan assets for domestic pension beneﬁ t plans 
was $64 million and $80 million as of September 27, 2008, and 
September 29, 2007, respectively. The following table sets forth

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

A foreign subsidiary pension plan had $15 million and $17 million in plan 
assets at September 27, 2008, and September 29, 2007, respectively. 
All of this plan’s assets are held in annuity contracts consistent with 
its target asset allocation.

The Plan Trustees have established a set of investment objectives 
related to the assets of the pension plans and regularly monitor the 
performance of the funds and portfolio managers. Objectives for 
the pension assets are (1) to provide growth of capital and income, 
(2) to achieve a target weighted average annual rate of return com-
petitive with other funds with similar investment objectives and 
(3) to diversify to reduce risk. The investment objectives and target 
asset allocation were adopted in January 2004 and amended in 
January 2008.

CONTRIBUTIONS
Our policy is to fund at least the minimum contribution required 
to meet applicable federal employee beneﬁ t and local tax laws. 
In our sole discretion, we may from time to time fund additional 
amounts. Expected contributions to pension plans for ﬁ scal 2009 
are approximately $2 million. For ﬁ scal 2008, 2007 and 2006, we 
funded $2 million, $5 million and $0, respectively, to deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t plans.

ESTIMATED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS
The following beneﬁ t payments are expected to be paid:

NOTE 15: TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES
We have operating leases for farms, equipment and other facilities 
with Don Tyson, a director of the Company, John Tyson, Chairman of 
the Company, certain members of their families and the Randal W. 
Tyson Testamentary Trust. Total payments of $3 million in ﬁ scal 2008, 
$5 million in ﬁ scal 2007, and $8 million in ﬁ scal 2006, were paid to 
entities in which these parties had an ownership interest.

In 2008, a lawsuit captioned In re Tyson Foods, Inc. Consolidated 
Shareholder’s Litigation was settled. Pursuant to the settlement, 
Don Tyson and the Tyson Limited Partnership paid us $4.5 million.

53  2008 Annual Report

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

An increase in the state valuation allowance increased the ﬁ scal 2008 
tax expense by $8 million, while non-deductible activity relating to 
company-owned life insurance increased the ﬁ scal 2008 tax expense 
by $6 million. The addition of FIN 48 unrecognized tax beneﬁ ts in 
ﬁ scal 2008 caused a net increase to income tax expense of approxi-
mately $7 million. Additionally, estimated general business credits 
decreased ﬁ scal 2008 tax expense by $6 million.

During ﬁ scal 2007, we discovered a certain population of our tax cost 
and accumulated depreciation values were not accurately recorded, 
primarily related to a property, plant and equipment system conver-
sion in 1999. This system conversion did not impact the recorded 
book value of the property, plant and equipment. As a result, the net 
tax basis of property, plant and equipment was overstated, which 
caused the deferred tax liability in our ﬁ nancial statements to be 
understated. In ﬁ scal 2007, we increased our deferred tax liabilities 
$17 million and recognized additional tax expense of $17 million.

The ﬁ scal 2007 effective tax rate was reduced by 4.6% due to the 
reduction of income tax reserves management deemed were no 
longer required. The net reduction to current income tax expense 
of approximately $20 million related to Internal Revenue Service 
examinations, appeals and United States Tax Court settlement activ-
ity, as well as state income tax examination settlements. Additional 
related adjustments resulted in a $28 million reduction of goodwill.

During ﬁ scal 2006, we completed a review of our tax account bal-
ances, and as a result, reduced our income tax beneﬁ t by $15 million. 
This included $12 million related to additional tax reserves for our 
foreign operations and $3 million related to a cumulative adjustment 
to our recorded tax balances attributable to book to tax differences 
associated with property, plant and equipment (including synthetic 
leases) and certain acquired deferred tax liabilities. Additional adjust-
ments resulted in an increase to goodwill of $12 million, deferred tax 
liabilities of $3 million and a reduction of property, plant and equip-
ment of $9 million.

Deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences 
attributable to differences between the ﬁ nancial statement carrying 
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax 
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates 
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those 
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

liabilities are:

Net deferred tax liabilities are included in Other Current Assets, 
Other Current Liabilities and Deferred Income Taxes on the Consoli-
dated Balance Sheets.

The deferred tax liability for suspended taxes from conversion to 
accrual method represents the 1987 change from the cash to accrual 
method of accounting and will be recognized by 2027.

We have accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidi-
aries aggregating approximately $219 million and $215 million at 
September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, respectively. These 
earnings are expected to be indeﬁ nitely reinvested outside of the 
United States. If those earnings were distributed in the form of 
dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to federal income taxes 
(subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income 
taxes and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. 
It is not currently practicable to estimate the tax liability that might 
be payable on the repatriation of these foreign earnings.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

The tax effected valuation allowance of $49 million consists of 
$30 million for state tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards, 
$3 million for federal net operating loss carryforwards and $16 million 
for international net operating loss carryforwards. The state tax credit 
and net operating loss carryforwards expire in ﬁ scal years 2009 through 
2027. At September 27, 2008, after considering utilization restrictions, 
our gross federal tax net operating loss carryforwards approximated 
$165 million. Gross federal net operating loss carryforwards of $8 mil-
lion are subject to utilization limitations due to ownership changes 
and may be utilized to offset future taxable income subject to limita-
tions. These carryforwards expire during ﬁ scal years 2009 through 
2024. The $49 million valuation allowance described above includes 
$3 million that if subsequently recognized, will be allocated to reduce 
goodwill, which was recorded at the time of acquisition of TFM.

We classify interest and penalties on unrecognized tax beneﬁ ts as 
income tax expense. At September 27, 2008, and at the adoption of 
FIN 48 at the beginning of ﬁ scal 2008, before tax beneﬁ ts, we had 
$67 million and $70 million, respectively, of accrued interest and 
penalties on unrecognized tax beneﬁ ts.

As of September 27, 2008, we are subject to income tax examina-
tions for U.S. federal income taxes for ﬁ scal years 1998 through 2007, 
and for foreign, state and local income taxes for ﬁ scal years 2001 
through 2007. During ﬁ scal 2009, tax audit resolutions could poten-
tially reduce unrecognized tax beneﬁ ts by approximately $26 million, 
either because tax positions are sustained on audit or because we 
agree to their disallowance.

Approximately 10 million, 4 million and 28 million, respectively, in ﬁ scal 
years 2008, 2007 and 2006, of our option shares were antidilutive 
and were not included in the dilutive earnings per share calculation.

We have two classes of capital stock, Class A stock and Class B stock. 
Cash dividends cannot be paid to holders of Class B stock unless they 
are simultaneously paid to holders of Class A stock. The per share 
amount of cash dividends paid to holders of Class B stock cannot 
exceed 90% of the cash dividend paid to holders of Class A stock.

We allocate undistributed earnings (losses) based upon a 1 to 0.9 
ratio per share of Class A stock and Class B stock, respectively. We 
allocate undistributed earnings (losses) based on this ratio due to 
historical dividend patterns, voting control of Class B shareholders 
and contractual limitations of dividends to Class B stock.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

In the fourth quarter ﬁ scal 2008, we began to manage and report the 
operating results and identiﬁ able assets of our logistics operations in 
the segment in which the product being moved relates. As a result, 
our operating segments now reﬂ ect logistics operations which were 
previously included in Other. All prior periods have been restated to 
reﬂ ect this change.

We allocate expenses related to corporate activities to the segments, 
while the related assets and additions to property, plant and equip-
ment remain in Other.

The Pork segment had sales of $517 million, $515 million and $467 million 
for ﬁ scal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, from transactions 
with other operating segments. The Beef segment had sales of 
$142 million, $111 million and $104 million for ﬁ scal years 2008, 2007 
and 2006, respectively, from transactions with other operating seg-
ments. These sales from intersegment transactions, which are sold 
at market prices, were excluded from the segment sales in the 
above table.

Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for 13.3%, 
13.4% and 13.0% of consolidated sales in ﬁ scal years 2008, 2007 and 
2006, respectively. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. were included in 
the Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods segments. Any extended 
discontinuance of sales to this customer could, if not replaced, have 
a material impact on our operations.

The majority of our operations are domiciled in the United States. 
Approximately 98% of sales to external customers for each of ﬁ scal 
years 2008, 2007 and 2006 were sourced from the United States. 
Approximately $3.4 billion, $3.5 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively, 
of property, plant and equipment were located in the United States 
at September 27, 2008, September 29, 2007, and September 30, 2006. 
Approximately $139 million, $125 million and $116 million of property, 
plant and equipment were located in foreign countries, primarily 
Mexico, at ﬁ scal years ended 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

We sell certain products in foreign markets, primarily Canada, Central 
America, China, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, the Middle East, 
Russia, South Korea, and Taiwan. Our export sales totaled $3.2 billion, 
$2.5 billion and $2.0 billion for ﬁ scal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 
Substantially all of our export sales are facilitated through unafﬁ li-
ated brokers, marketing associations and foreign sales staffs. Foreign 
sales, which are sales of products produced in a country other than 
the United States, were less than 10% of consolidated sales for each 
of ﬁ scal years 2008, 2007 and 2006. Approximately 22% and 10% of 
income from continuing operations before income taxes for ﬁ scal 2008 
and 2007, respectively, was from foreign operations. In ﬁ scal 2006, we 
had income from continuing operations before income taxes related 
to foreign operations of $13 million.

57  2008 Annual Report

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

In June 2008, we executed a letter of intent to sell the beef process-
ing, cattle feed yard and fertilizer assets of Lakeside Farm Industries 
Ltd. We are reporting Lakeside as a discontinued operation and have 
restated the quarterly ﬁ nancial data accordingly.

First quarter ﬁ scal 2008 income from continuing operations before 
income taxes includes an $18 million non-operating gain related to 
sale of an investment and a $6 million severance charge related to the 
FAST initiative. Second quarter ﬁ scal 2008 income from continuing 
operations before income taxes includes $47 million in charges related 
to restructuring a beef plant operation, closing a poultry plant, impair-
ment of packaging equipment and software impairments. Third 
quarter ﬁ scal 2008 loss from continuing operations before income 
taxes includes $13 million in charges related to ﬂ ood damage and 
impairment of unimproved real property. Fourth quarter ﬁ scal 2008 
income from continuing operations before income taxes includes a 
$10 million charge related to intangible asset impairments.

Fourth quarter ﬁ scal 2007 income from continuing operations includes 
tax expense of $17 million related to a ﬁ xed asset tax cost correction.

NOTE 20: CAPITAL STRUCTURE
In September 2008, we issued 22.4 million shares of Class A stock 
as part of a public offering. The shares were offered at $12.75. Net 
proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions, of approxi-
mately $274 million were used toward the repayment of our borrow-
ings under the accounts receivable securitization facility and for 
other general corporate purposes. An entity controlled by Don Tyson 
purchased three million shares of Class A stock in this offering.

During ﬁ scal 2007, Tyson Limited Partnership converted 15.9 million 
shares of Class B stock to Class A stock on a one-for-one basis.

During ﬁ scal 2006, Tyson Limited Partnership converted 15 million 
shares of Class B stock to Class A stock on a one-for-one basis. 
Additionally, Don Tyson, a director, converted 750,000 shares of 
Class B stock to Class A stock on a one-for-one basis.

NOTE 21: CONTINGENCIES
Listed below are certain claims made against the Company and our 
subsidiaries. In our opinion, we have made appropriate and adequate 
reserves, accruals and disclosures where necessary, and believe the 
probability of a material loss beyond the amounts accrued to be 
remote; however, the ultimate liability for these matters is uncertain, 
and if accruals and reserves are not adequate, an adverse outcome 
could have a material effect on the consolidated ﬁ nancial condition 
or results of operations. We believe we have substantial defenses to 
the claims made and intend to vigorously defend these cases.

In 2000, the Wage and Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor 
(DOL) conducted an industry-wide investigation of poultry producers, 
including us, to ascertain compliance with various wage and hour 
issues. As part of this investigation, the DOL inspected 14 of our 
processing facilities. On May 9, 2002, the DOL ﬁ led a civil complaint 
styled Elaine L. Chao, Secretary of Labor, United States Department 
of Labor v. Tyson Foods, Inc. against us in the U.S. District Court for 
the Northern District of Alabama. The plaintiffs allege in the com-
plaint that we violated the overtime provisions of the federal Fair 
Labor Standards Act at our chicken-processing facility in Blountsville, 
Alabama. The complaint does not contain a deﬁ nite statement of 
what acts constituted alleged violations of the statute, although the 
Secretary of Labor indicated in discovery the case seeks to require 
us to compensate all hourly chicken processing workers for pre- and 
post-shift clothes changing, washing and related activities and for 
one of two unpaid 30-minute meal periods. The Secretary of Labor 
seeks unspeciﬁ ed back wages for all employees at the Blountsville 
facility for a period of two years prior to the date of the ﬁ ling of the 
complaint, and an additional amount in unspeciﬁ ed liquidated dam-
ages and an injunction against future violations at that facility and 
all other chicken processing facilities we operate. The District Court 
granted the Company’s motion for partial summary judgment in part, 
ruling that the second meal period is appropriately characterized as 
non-compensable, and reserving the remaining issues for trial. The 
trial is presently set for January 5, 2009.

Several private lawsuits are pending against us alleging that we failed 
to compensate poultry plant employees for all hours worked, includ-
ing overtime compensation, in violation of the Fair Labor Standards 
Act. These lawsuits include M.H. Fox, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc. (Fox), 
ﬁ led on June 22, 1999, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern 
District of Alabama, and DeAsencio v. Tyson Foods, Inc. (DeAsencio), 
ﬁ led on August 22, 2000, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern 
District of Pennsylvania. Each of these matters involves similar allega-
tions that employees should be paid for the time it takes to engage 
in pre- and post-shift activities such as changing into and out of 
protective and sanitary clothing, obtaining clothing and walking to 
and from the changing area, work areas and break areas. The plaintiffs 
in these lawsuits seek or have sought to act as class representatives 
on behalf of all current and former employees who were allegedly 
not paid for time worked and seek back wages, liquidated damages, 
pre- and post-judgment interest, and attorneys’ fees. In Fox, the 
District Court denied class certiﬁ cation on November 16, 2006, and 
ordered the cases of the 10 named plaintiffs in the matter to proceed 
individually in the home jurisdictions of the named plaintiffs. Two 
of these cases (Brothers and Hatchett) were tried in November 2007 
in Alabama with jury verdicts in favor of the plaintiffs. The District 
Court recently entered judgment in the ﬁ nal of these cases (Fox) after 
the Company made an offer of judgment to Fox, thereby avoiding 
trial. However, the District Court must now determine the amount of 

58  Tyson Foods, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

attorneys’ fees and costs to be awarded to the plaintiffs. In DeAsencio, 
plaintiffs appealed a jury verdict and ﬁ nal judgment entered in our 
favor on June 22, 2006, in the District Court. On September 7, 2007, 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the jury verdict 
and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings. 
We sought rehearing en banc, which was denied by the Court of 
Appeals on October 5, 2007. The United States Supreme Court 
denied our petition for a writ of certiorari on June 9, 2008.

In addition to Fox and DeAsencio, additional private lawsuits were 
ﬁ led against us since the beginning of ﬁ scal 2007 which allege we 
failed to compensate poultry plant employees for all hours worked, 
including overtime compensation, in violation of the Fair Labor 
Standards Act. These lawsuits are Sheila Ackles, et al. v. Tyson Foods, 
Inc. (N. Dist. Alabama, October 23, 2006); McCluster, et al. v. Tyson 
Foods, Inc. (M. Dist. Georgia, December 11, 2006); Dobbins, et al. v. 
Tyson Chicken, Inc., et al. (N. Dist. Alabama, December 21, 2006); 
Buchanan, et al. v. Tyson Chicken, Inc., et al. and Potter, et al. v. Tyson 
Chicken, Inc., et al. (N. Dist. Alabama, December 22, 2006); Jones, et 
al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., et al., Walton, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., et 
al. and Williams, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., et al. (S. Dist. Mississippi, 
February 9, 2007); Balch, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc. (E. Dist. Oklahoma, 
March 1, 2007); Adams, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc. (W. Dist. Arkansas, 
March 2, 2007); Atkins, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc. (M. Dist. Georgia, 
March 5, 2007); and Laney, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc. and Williams, et 
al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc. (M. Dist. Georgia, May 23, 2007). Similar to Fox 
and DeAsencio, each of these matters involves allegations employees 
should be paid for the time it takes to engage in pre- and post-shift 
activities such as changing into and out of protective and sanitary 
clothing, obtaining clothing and walking to and from the chang-
ing area, work areas and break areas. The plaintiffs in each of these 
lawsuits seek or have sought to act as class representatives on behalf 
of all current and former employees who were allegedly not paid for 
time worked and seek back wages, liquidated damages, pre- and post-
judgment interest, and attorneys’ fees. On April 6, 2007, we ﬁ led a 
motion for transfer of the above named actions for coordinated pre-
trial proceedings before the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. 
The motion for transfer was granted on August 17, 2007. The cases 
listed above and ﬁ ve other cases subsequently ﬁ led involving the 
same allegations, including Armstrong, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc. (W. 
Dist. Tennessee, January 30, 2008); Maldonado, et al. v. Tyson Foods, 
Inc. (E. Dist. Tennessee, January 31, 2008); White, et al. v. Tyson Foods, 
Inc. (E. Dist. Texas, February 1, 2008); Meyer, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc. 
(W. Dist. Missouri, February 2, 2008); and Leak, et al. v. Tyson Foods, 
Inc. (W. Dist. North Carolina, February 6, 2008), were transferred to 
the U.S. District Court in the Middle District of Georgia, In re: Tyson 
Foods, Inc., Fair Labor Standards Act Litigation (“MDL Proceedings”). 
On January 2, 2008, the Judge in the MDL Proceedings issued a 
Joint Scheduling and Case Management Order. The Order granted 
Conditional Class Certiﬁ cation and called for notice to be given to 
potential putative class members via a third party administrator. The 

potential class members had until April 18, 2008, to “opt-in” to the 
class. Approximately 13,800 employees and former employees ﬁ led 
their consents to “opt-in” to the class. As of April 18, 2008, the 
parties began conducting discovery for a period of 240 days at 
eight of our facilities and our corporate headquarters in Springdale, 
Arkansas. Discovery may be conducted at additional facilities in 
the future. On October 15, 2008, the Judge in the MDL Proceedings 
denied the plaintiffs’ motion for equitable tolling, which reduces the 
time period for which the plaintiffs may seek damages.

On June 19, 2005, the Attorney General and the Secretary of the 
Environment of the State of Oklahoma ﬁ led a complaint in the U.S. 
District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma against us, three 
of our subsidiaries and six other poultry integrators. This complaint 
was subsequently amended. As amended, the complaint asserts 
a number of state and federal causes of action including, but not 
limited to, counts under Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), Resource Conservation 
and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and state-law public nuisance theories. 
The amended complaint asserts that defendants and certain contract 
growers who are not named in the complaint polluted the surface 
waters, groundwater and associated drinking water supplies of the 
Illinois River Watershed (“IRW”) through the land application of 
poultry litter. Oklahoma asserts that this alleged pollution has also 
caused extensive injury to the environment (including soils and 
sediments) of the IRW and that the defendants have been unjustly 
enriched. Oklahoma’s claims cover the entire IRW, which encom-
passes more than one million acres of land and the natural resources 
(including lakes and waterways) contained therein. Oklahoma seeks 
wide-ranging relief, including injunctive relief, compensatory and 
punitive damages, attorneys fees and disgorgement. We and the 
other defendants have denied liability, asserted various defenses, 
and ﬁ led a third-party complaint that asserts claims against other 
persons and entities whose activities may have contributed to the 
pollution alleged in the amended complaint. The district court has 
stayed proceedings on the third party complaint pending resolu-
tion of Oklahoma’s claims against the defendants. On November 14, 
2007, Oklahoma ﬁ led a motion under RCRA requesting a preliminary 
injunction to halt the land application of poultry litter in the IRW. 
Oklahoma’s motion for a preliminary injunction asserted that bacteria 
from poultry litter are causing an imminent and substantial endan-
germent to human health and the environment throughout the IRW. 
A multi-week evidentiary hearing on the preliminary injunction was 
completed on March 6, 2008. On September 29, 2008, the court 
entered an order denying the preliminary injunction. On October 17, 
2008, Oklahoma ﬁ led a notice of appeal of the district court’s denial 
of the preliminary injunction in the United States Court of Appeals 
for the Tenth Circuit. Discovery in Oklahoma’s case against defen-
dants is ongoing. Trial is currently scheduled for September 2009.

59  2008 Annual Report

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

We currently have pending eleven separate wage and hour actions 
involving TFM’s plants located in Lexington, Nebraska (Lopez, et al. 
v. Tyson Foods, Inc., District of Nebraska, June 30, 2006), Garden City 
and Emporia, Kansas (Garcia, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., Tyson Fresh 
Meats, Inc., District of Kansas, May 15, 2006), Storm Lake, Iowa (Sharp, 
et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., N.D. Iowa, February 6, 2007), Columbus 
Junction, Iowa (Robinson, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., d/b/a Tyson Fresh 
Meats, Inc., S.D. Iowa, September 12, 2007), Joslin, Illinois (Murray, 
et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., C.D. Illinois, January 2, 2008), Dakota City, 
Nebraska (Gomez, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., District of Nebraska, 
January 16, 2008), Madison, Nebraska (Acosta, et al. v Tyson Foods, Inc. 
d.b.a. Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc., District of Nebraska, February 29, 2008), 
Perry and Waterloo, Iowa (Edwards, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc. d.b.a. 
Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc., S.D. Iowa, March 20, 2008); Council Bluffs, 
Iowa (Salazar, et al. v. Tyson Foods, Inc. d.b.a. Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc., 
S.D. Iowa, April 29, 2008); and Logansport, Indiana (Carter, et al. v. 
Tyson Foods, Inc. and Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc., N.D. Indiana, April 29, 
2008); and Goodlettsville, Tennessee (Cunningham v. Tyson Fresh 
Meats, Inc., M.D. Tennessee, May 22, 2008). With the exception of 
Cunningham, the actions allege TFM failed to pay employees for 
all hours worked, including overtime compensation for the time it 
takes to change into protective work uniforms, safety equipment and 
other sanitary and protective clothing worn by employees, and for 
walking to and from the changing area, work areas and break areas in 
violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act and analogous state laws. 
The plaintiffs seek back wages, liquidated damages, pre- and post-
judgment interest, attorneys’ fees and costs. Cunningham alleges TFM 
failed to pay quality assurance technicians overtime compensation 
for all hours worked in excess of forty hours in each work week. TFM 
ﬁ led a motion for partial summary judgment in Garcia, based upon 
an injunction entered in Reich v. IBP, which outlined the types of 
activities at issue here that are compensable. The District Court of 
Kansas denied the motion, and TFM appealed to the Tenth Circuit 
Court of Appeals, arguing that the District Court’s ruling had the 
effect of improperly modifying the injunction. On July 23, 2008, 
Tyson ﬁ led a motion to transfer the eleven actions to the District of 
Kansas for consolidated pretrial proceedings. On October 9, 2008, 
the motion to transfer was denied by the Judicial Panel on Multi-
district Litigation. The effect of this order will be that the stays 
previously entered in the individual actions will be lifted and each 
case will resume.

On November 21, 2002, 10 current and former hourly employees of 
a TFM case-ready facility in Goodlettsville, Tennessee, ﬁ led a puta-
tive class action lawsuit styled Emily D. Jordan, et al. v. IBP, inc. and 
Tyson Foods, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of 

Tennessee against us claiming violations of the overtime provisions 
of the Fair Labor Standards Act by failing to pay employees for all 
hours worked. The suit further alleges employees should be paid for 
the time it takes to collect, assemble and put on, take off and wash 
their health, safety and production gear at the beginning and end of 
their shifts and during their meal period. Finally, the suit alleges we 
deduct 30 minutes per day from employees’ paychecks regardless of 
whether employees use a full 30-minute period for their meal. The 
plaintiffs seek a declaration that the defendants did not comply with 
the Fair Labor Standards Act, and an award for an unspeciﬁ ed amount 
of back pay compensation and beneﬁ ts, unpaid entitlements, liqui-
dated damages, prejudgment and post-judgment interest, attorney 
fees and costs. On November 17, 2003, the District Court condition-
ally certiﬁ ed a collective action based on clothes changing and 
washing activities and unpaid production work during meal periods, 
since the plant operations began in April 2001. Approximately 650 
current and former employees have opted into the class. On 
August 20, 2007, both parties ﬁ led motions for summary judgment. 
The court granted in part and denied in part the parties’ motions 
for partial summary judgment on March 13, 2008. A jury trial was set 
to begin on September 16, 2008, but the parties resolved the litiga-
tion. On September 25, 2008, the court entered an agreed order of 
dismissal with prejudice and approved the conﬁ dential settlement 
agreement of the parties.

NOTE 22: SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
In October 2008, Dynamic Fuels received $100 million in Gulf 
Opportunity Zone tax-exempt bonds made available by the Federal 
government to the regions affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita 
in 2005. These ﬂ oating rate bonds are due October 1, 2033, and have 
an initial interest rate of 1.3%. We issued a letter of credit as a guar-
antee for the entire bond issuance. In exchange for our guarantee, 
Syntroleum Corporation, the other 50 percent investor in Dynamic 
Fuels, issued to us eight million Syntroleum stock warrants with an 
exercise price of $0.01 per share.

In October 2008, we completed the acquisition of three vertically 
integrated poultry companies in southern Brazil. The purchase price 
was $80 million, as well as up to an additional $15 million of contin-
gent purchase price based on production volumes payable through 
ﬁ scal 2010. These transactions include the acquisitions of Macedo 
Agroindustrial, Avicola Itaiopolis and Frangobras. Combined, we 
expect these companies will have sales of $150 – $175 million in 
ﬁ scal 2009.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS 
OF TYSON FOODS, INC.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of 
Tyson Foods, Inc. as of September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, 
and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ 
equity, and cash ﬂ ows for each of the three years in the period ended 
September 27, 2008. These ﬁ nancial statements are the responsibility 
of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an 
opinion on these ﬁ nancial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the 
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those 
standards require we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the ﬁ nancial statements are free of material 
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁ nancial statements. 
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
signiﬁ cant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating 
the overall ﬁ nancial statement presentation. We believe our audits 
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the ﬁ nancial statements referred to above present 
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated ﬁ nancial position of 
Tyson Foods, Inc. at September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, and 
the consolidated results of its operations and its cash ﬂ ows for each 
of the three years in the period ended September 27, 2008, in confor-
mity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As described in Note 2 to the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements, 
the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 
Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” 
in 2008.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Tyson Foods, 
Inc.’s internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting as of September 27, 
2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated 
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of 
the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 17, 2008, 
expressed an unqualiﬁ ed opinion thereon.

61  2008 Annual Report

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over ﬁ nancial 
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projec-
tions of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject 
to the risk controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or proce-
dures may deteriorate.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS 
OF TYSON FOODS, INC.
We have audited Tyson Foods, Inc.’s internal control over ﬁ nancial 
reporting as of September 27, 2008, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO 
criteria). Tyson Foods, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintain-
ing effective internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting, and for its 
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over ﬁ nancial 
reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management 
under the caption “Management’s Report on Internal Control over 
Financial Reporting”. Our responsibility is to express an opinion 
on the Company’s internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting based 
on our audit. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the 
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those 
standards require we plan and perform the audit to obtain reason-
able assurance about whether effective internal control over ﬁ nancial 
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included 
obtaining an understanding of internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting, 
assessing the risk a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating 
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we 
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe our audit 
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting is a process 
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of ﬁ nancial reporting and the preparation of ﬁ nancial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over ﬁ nancial 
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain 
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately 
and fairly reﬂ ect the transactions and dispositions of the assets 
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of ﬁ nancial statements 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the 
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition 
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the 
ﬁ nancial statements.

Report of Management

The management of Tyson Foods, Inc., (the Company) has the respon-
sibility of preparing the accompanying ﬁ nancial statements and is 
responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The statements 
were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States applied on a consistent basis. Such 
ﬁ nancial statements are necessarily based, in part, on best estimates 
and judgments.

The Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls, 
and a program of internal auditing designed to provide reasonable 
assurance that the Company’s assets are protected and that trans-
actions are executed in accordance with proper authorization, and 
are properly recorded. This system of internal accounting controls is 
continually reviewed and modiﬁ ed in response to changing business 
conditions and operations and to recommendations made by the 
independent auditors and the internal auditors. The Company has 
a code of conduct and an experienced full-time compliance ofﬁ cer. 
The management of the Company believes that the accounting and 
control systems provide reasonable assurance that assets are safe-
guarded and ﬁ nancial information is reliable.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors meets regularly 
with the Company’s ﬁ nancial management and counsel, with the 
Company’s internal auditors and with the independent auditors 
engaged by the Company. These meetings include discussions of 
internal accounting controls and the quality of ﬁ nancial reporting. 
The Audit Committee has discussed with the independent auditors 
matters required to be discussed by Statement of Auditing Standards 
No. 61 (Communication with Audit Committees). In addition, the 
Committee has discussed with the independent auditors, the auditors’ 
independence from the Company and its management, including 
the matters in the written disclosures required by the Independence 
Standards Board Standard No. 1 (Independence Discussions with 
Audit Committees). The independent auditors and the Internal Audit 
Department have free and independent access to the Audit Commit-
tee to discuss the results of their audits or any other matters relating 
to the Company’s ﬁ nancial affairs.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL 
OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate 
internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting, as deﬁ ned in Rules 13a-15(f) 
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control system 
was designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and 
the board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation 
of published ﬁ nancial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, 
internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting may not prevent or detect 
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness 
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of com-
pliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Manage-
ment conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal 
control over ﬁ nancial reporting as of September 27, 2008. In making 
this assessment, we used criteria set forth by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) 
in Internal Control – Integrated Framework.

Based on this evaluation under the framework in Internal Control – 
Integrated Framework issued by COSO, Management concluded that 
the Company’s internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting was effective 
as of September 27, 2008. 

The Company’s independent registered public accounting ﬁ rm, Ernst 
& Young LLP, has audited the accompanying consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements and has issued an attestation report on the Company’s 
internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting. The attestation report 
on the Company’s internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting appears 
on page 62.

Notes to Five-Year Financial Summary
a.   Fiscal 2008 includes $76 million of pretax charges related to: restructuring a beef operation; closing a poultry plant; asset impairments for packaging equipment, intangible 
assets, unimproved real property and software; ﬂ ood damage; and severance charges. Additionally, ﬁ scal 2008 includes an $18 million non-operating gain related to the sale 
of an investment.

b.  Fiscal 2007 includes tax expense of $17 million related to a ﬁ xed asset tax cost correction, primarily related to a ﬁ xed asset system conversion in 1999.
c.  Fiscal 2006 includes $63 million of pretax charges primarily related to closing one poultry plant, two beef plants and two prepared foods plants.
d.   Fiscal 2005 includes $33 million of pretax charges related to a legal settlement involving our live swine operations, a non-recurring income tax net beneﬁ t of $15 million including 
beneﬁ t from the reversal of certain income tax reserves, partially offset by an income tax charge related to the one-time repatriation of foreign income under the American Jobs 
Creation Act and $14 million of pretax charges primarily related to closing two poultry plants and one prepared foods plant. Additionally, the effective tax rate was affected by 
the federal income tax effect of the Medicare Part D subsidy in ﬁ scal 2005 of $55 million because this amount was not subject to federal income tax.

e.   Fiscal 2004 includes $61 million of pretax BSE-related charges, $40 million of pretax charges primarily related to closing one poultry and three prepared foods operations, 

$25 million of pretax charges related to the impairment of intangible assets and $21 million of pretax charges related to ﬁ xed asset write-downs.

f.  Fiscal 2004 was a 53-week year, while the other years presented were 52-week years.
g.  Return on invested capital is calculated by dividing operating income (loss) by the sum of the average of beginning and ending total debt and shareholders’ equity.
h.   The 2006 total debt to capitalization ratio is not adjusted for the $750 million short-term investment we had on deposit at September 30, 2006. When adjusted for the 

i. 

$750 million short-term investment, the debt to capitalization ratio was 42.1%.
 In June 2008, we executed a letter of intent to sell the beef processing, cattle feed yard and fertilizer assets of Lakeside Farm Industries Ltd. We are reporting Lakeside as a 
discontinued operation for all periods presented.
