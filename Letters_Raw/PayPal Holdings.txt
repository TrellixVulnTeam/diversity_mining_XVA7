MESSAGE FROM OUR CHAIRMAN OF THE
BOARD AND LEAD INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR

April 12, 2018

Dear PayPal Stockholder:

We are pleased to invite you to attend the annual meeting of stockholders of PayPal Holdings, Inc. on Wednesday, May 23, 2018 at
8:00 a.m. Pacific Time. Our annual meeting will be conducted exclusively online via live webcast. We have conducted an exclusively
virtual annual meeting of stockholders every year since we became a public company in 2015. We believe that hosting virtual
meetings enables greater stockholder attendance and participation from any location around the world.

You will be able to attend the virtual annual meeting of stockholders online and submit your questions during the meeting by
visiting pypl.onlineshareholdermeeting.com. You also will be able to vote your shares electronically at the virtual annual meeting.
Details regarding how to attend the meeting online, how to submit your questions before and during the meeting, and the
business to be conducted at the annual meeting are more fully described in the accompanying proxy statement.

We will be providing access to our proxy materials over the Internet under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s “notice
and access” rules. As a result, beginning on or about April 12, 2018, we are mailing to many of our stockholders a notice instead of a
paper copy of this proxy statement and our 2017 Annual Report. This approach conserves natural resources and reduces our
printing and distribution costs, while providing a timely and convenient method of accessing the materials and voting. The notice
contains instructions on how to access those documents over the Internet. The notice also contains instructions on how to receive
a paper copy of our proxy materials, including this proxy statement, our 2017 Annual Report, and a form of proxy card or voting
instruction card. All stockholders who do not receive a notice, including stockholders who have previously requested to receive
paper copies of proxy materials, will receive a paper copy of the proxy materials by mail.

Your vote is important. Regardless of whether you plan to participate in the annual meeting, we hope you will vote as soon as
possible. You may vote by proxy over the Internet, by telephone, or by mail (if you received paper copies of the proxy materials) by
following the instructions on the proxy card or voting instruction card. Voting will ensure your representation at the virtual annual
meeting regardless of whether you attend the meeting online. You may also vote your shares electronically during the virtual
meeting.

Ensuring the Board of Directors of PayPal (the “Board” or the “PayPal Board”) is composed of directors who possess a wide variety
of relevant skills, professional experience and backgrounds, bring diverse viewpoints and perspectives, and effectively represent
the long-term interests of stockholders, is a top priority of the Board and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee.

Proxy Statement Summary

Corporate Governance
Corporate governance at PayPal is designed to promote the long-term interests of our stockholders, strengthen Board and
management accountability, foster responsible decision-making, and engender public trust. We believe that strong corporate
governance practices that provide meaningful rights to our stockholders and ensure Board and management accountability are
essential to our relationship with our stockholders.

The following are the key governance provisions that demonstrate PayPal’s commitment to transparency and accountability:

Strong Board independence (nine of 11 director
nominees are independent)
Independent Chairman or Lead Independent Director
with robust responsibilities
Majority vote standard for uncontested director
elections
Stockholder right to call a special meeting

Separate Chairman and CEO roles

All directors stand for annual election

Strong stockholder engagement practices

Proxy access for qualifying stockholders

Simple majority vote standard for charter/bylaw
amendments and mergers/business combinations

Robust stock ownership requirements for our
executive officers and directors

Executive Compensation
OUR COMPENSATION PROGRAM
We completed our second year as an independent company in 2017 following our separation from eBay Inc. (“eBay”) in July 2015
(the “Separation”), continuing our transformative journey while delivering strong results. For 2017, the Compensation Committee
of the Board approved an executive compensation program based on our “pay for performance” philosophy that is designed to
align our executive officers’ compensation with the key drivers of profitable short-term and long-term growth with the goals of
properly incentivizing and rewarding our executives for performance that exceeds expectations, providing transparency for both
our executives and our stockholders, and positioning us competitively to enable us to attract and retain our executives. As such,
the Compensation Committee prioritized the following compensation philosophy and goals in 2017:

• Simplicity, Transparency and Clarity of our program – enable executives to directly link Company and individual performance to

their pay, and enable stockholders to directly link returns on their investment to Company performance;

• One Team – maintain unified goals and objectives for the entire executive leadership team to drive operational decisions and

Company performance;

• Winning the War for Talent – recognize the unique financial technology (“FinTech”) space in which we compete, and prioritize

•

nimble and aggressive compensation strategies to attract and retain key talent; and
Individual Performance – ensure compensation is commensurate with results, both on the upside and downside, and that
leaders are held accountable for their performance.

OUR 2017 NEO PAY
We believe that our executive compensation program was effective at incentivizing results in 2017 by appropriately aligning pay
and performance. The following charts show the 2017 Target Total Direct Compensation mix for our Chief Executive Officer,
Mr. Schulman (our “CEO”), and the average Target Total Direct Compensation mix for our other named executive officers
(“NEOs”). Target Total Direct Compensation is the sum of (i) 2017 base salary, (ii) target 2017 annual incentive award (based on
the grant date fair value for the portion of the award delivered as PBRSUs) and (iii) target annual long-term incentive award (based
on grant date fair values).

OUR PAY PRACTICES
We are committed to maintaining strong governance standards with respect to our executive compensation program, policies, and
practices. Consistent with this focus, we maintain the following policies and practices that we believe demonstrate our
commitment to executive compensation best practices.

Pay for Performance

Adherence to Rigorous Goals

Clawback Policy

Robust Stock Ownership Guidelines

What We Do

A substantial percentage of our NEOs’ 2017 Target Total Direct Compensation
was performance-based and tied to pre-established performance goals aligned
with our short-term and long-term objectives.
We use objective performance-based company goals in our annual and long-
term incentive plans that we believe are rigorous and designed to incentivize
and motivate NEO performance.
Our NEOs are subject to a clawback policy, which permits the Compensation
Committee to require forfeiture or reimbursement of incentive compensation,
including any cash incentive award, equity award, or equity-based award paid or
awarded to the NEO during the period in which he or she is subject to the policy,
if (i) an action or omission by the NEO constitutes a material violation of our
Code of Business Conduct; (ii) an action or omission by the NEO results in
material financial or reputational harm to the Company; or (iii) a material
restatement of all or a portion of our financial statements is the result of a
supervisory or other failure by the NEO.
Our stock ownership guidelines are designed to align the long-term interests of
our NEOs and non-employee directors with those of our stockholders and
discourage excessive risk-taking. Our guidelines require stock ownership levels
as a value of our common stock equal to a multiple of base salary (6x for CEO
and 3x for executive vice presidents (“EVPs”)) or annual retainer (5x for
non-employee directors), and include stock retention requirements for
executive officers until the required ownership levels are reached.

What We Do

Our insider trading policy prohibits members of our Board and NEOs from
(i) entering into any hedging or monetization transactions relating to our
securities or otherwise trading in any instrument relating to the future price of
our securities, or (ii) pledging our common stock as collateral for any loans.
The Compensation Committee engages its own independent compensation
consultant to advise on executive and non-employee director compensation
matters.
Based on our annual risk assessment, we have concluded that our compensation
program does not present any risk that is reasonably likely to have a material
adverse effect on PayPal.
The Compensation Committee, with the assistance of its compensation
consultant, reviews the composition of our comparator peer groups annually and
makes adjustments to the composition of the peer group as it deems
appropriate.
We conduct an annual advisory (non-binding) vote on the compensation of the
NEOs (a “say-on-pay” vote). At our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders (the
“2017 Annual Meeting”), more than 96% of the votes cast on the say-on-pay
proposal were voted in support of the 2016 compensation of the NEOs.
In addition to the annual say-on-pay vote, we are committed to ongoing
engagement with our investors on executive compensation and governance
matters. These engagement efforts take place through teleconferences,
in-person meetings and correspondence with our investors.

What We Don’t Do

We do not provide our NEOs with any gross-ups or other payment or
reimbursement of excise taxes on severance or other payments in connection
with a change in control of PayPal.
We do not make “single-trigger” change-in-control payments or maintain any
plans that require single-trigger change-in-control acceleration of equity awards
to our NEOs upon a change in control of PayPal.
We do not provide our NEOs with tax gross-ups on perquisites, other than in
limited circumstances for business-related relocations and international
business travel-related benefits that are under our control, at our direction and
deemed to benefit our business operations.
We expressly prohibit the discounting of stock options and the repricing of
underwater stock options without stockholder approval under our equity
compensation plan.
Our annual incentive plan is performance-based and our NEOs are not
guaranteed any minimum levels of payment.

SUPPORTING OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM
The Compensation Committee believes that the goals of our executive compensation program are appropriate and that our
executive compensation program supports PayPal’s growth strategy and is well aligned with creating long-term stockholder value.

2017 Annual Report / 2018 Proxy Statement

Proposal 1

Proposal 1 — Election of Directors

The eleven directors listed below have been nominated by our Board for election at the Annual Meeting to serve until our 2019
Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until their successors are elected and qualified. All of the nominees are currently members of
the Board. All of the director nominees are independent under the listing standards of The NASDAQ Stock Market (“NASDAQ”),
except for Mr. Schulman and Mr. Donahoe.

Except for Ms. Sarnoff and Mr. Adkins, each of our current directors has been previously elected by our stockholders. Based upon
the recommendations of our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee (the “Governance Committee”), the Board
appointed Ms. Sarnoff as a director in June 2017, and Mr. Adkins as a director in September 2017. Both Ms. Sarnoff and Mr. Adkins
were initially identified as potential candidates by our CEO from recommendations he received from third parties.

We expect that each director nominee will be able to serve if elected. If any director nominee is not able to serve, proxies may be
voted for substitute nominees, unless the Board chooses to reduce the number of directors serving on the Board.

MAJORITY VOTE STANDARD
Under our Amended and Restated Bylaws (“Bylaws”), directors must be elected by a majority of the votes cast in uncontested
elections, such as the election of directors at the Annual Meeting. This means that the number of votes cast “FOR” a director
nominee must exceed the number of votes cast “AGAINST” that nominee. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not counted as
votes “FOR” or “AGAINST” a director nominee. As a result, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the vote for
this proposal. If a director nominee who currently serves as a director is not re-elected, Delaware law provides that the director
would continue to serve on the Board as a “holdover director.” Under our Bylaws and the Governance Guidelines of the Board (the
“Corporate Governance Guidelines”), each director submits an advance, contingent, irrevocable resignation that the Board may
accept if stockholders do not re-elect that director. Within 90 days of the certification of the stockholder vote (subject to an
additional 90-day period in certain circumstances), the Governance Committee or another committee of the Board would make a
recommendation to the Board about whether to accept the resignation, and the Board would be required to decide whether to
accept the resignation and to publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it.

In a contested election, the required vote would be a plurality of votes cast.

DIRECTOR NOMINEES
The Governance Committee and the Board have evaluated each of the director nominees against the factors and principles used
to select director nominees. Based on this evaluation, the Governance Committee and the Board have concluded that it is in the
best interests of the Company and its stockholders for each of the proposed director nominees listed below to continue to serve
as a director of the Company. The Board believes that each of the director nominees has a strong track record of being a
responsible steward of stockholders’ interests and brings extraordinarily valuable insight, perspective and expertise to the Board.

The Board Recommends a Vote FOR each of the Named Director Nominees.

CONSIDERATION OF DIRECTOR NOMINEES
Stockholder Recommendations and Nominations
The Governance Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board a slate of nominees for election at each annual meeting
of stockholders for PayPal. Nominees may be suggested by directors, members of management, stockholders, or by a third-party
firm. In evaluating potential director nominees, the Governance Committee considers a wide range of factors, including the criteria
described below under “Director Selection Process and Qualifications.”

Stockholders who would like the Governance Committee to consider their recommendations for director nominees should submit
their recommendations in writing by mail to the Governance Committee in care of our Corporate Secretary at PayPal Holdings,
Inc., 2211 North First Street, San Jose, California 95131, stating the candidate’s name and qualifications for Board membership.
Recommendations by stockholders that are made in accordance with these procedures will receive the same consideration by the
Governance Committee as other suggested nominees.

In addition, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation (“Certificate of Incorporation”) and Bylaws provide proxy access rights that
permit eligible stockholders to nominate candidates for election to the Board in the Company’s proxy statement. These proxy
access rights permit a stockholder, or group of up to 20 stockholders, owning 3% or more of the Company’s outstanding common
stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company’s proxy materials director nominees
constituting up to 20% of the Board, provided that the stockholder(s) and nominee(s) satisfy the requirements and procedures
described in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.

Director Selection Process and Qualifications
The Governance Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board the qualifications for Board membership and for
identifying, assessing and recommending qualified director candidates for the Board’s consideration. The Board’s membership
qualifications and nomination procedures are set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines.

2017 Annual Report / 2018 Proxy Statement

Proposal 1

The Board and Governance Committee consider the following factors and principles in evaluating and selecting director nominees:

• Directors should have high-level managerial experience in a relatively complex organization or be accustomed to dealing with

complex problems;

• Directors should represent the balanced, best interests of the stockholders as a whole rather than special interest groups or

constituencies;

• Directors should be individuals of the highest character and integrity, with the ability to work well with others and with

•

sufficient time available to devote to the affairs of the Company in order to carry out their responsibilities;
In addressing the overall composition of the Board, diversity (including gender, race and ethnicity), age, international
background, and expertise should be considered in evaluating potential Board members;

• The interplay of a candidate’s background and expertise with that of other Board members, and the extent to which a

candidate may be a desirable addition to any Board committee should be considered;
• The Board should include individuals with highly relevant professional experience; and
• The Board should be composed of directors who are highly engaged with our business.

In particular, the Governance Committee values diversity as a factor in selecting nominees. When searching for new directors, the
Governance Committee actively seeks out qualified women and individuals from underrepresented ethnic groups to include in the
pool from which Board nominees are chosen.

From time to time, the Governance Committee may retain an executive search firm to assist in identifying, screening and
evaluating potential candidates.

Director Compensation
The Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations to the Board regarding compensation
paid to non-employee directors for their Board and committee services. On an annual basis, the Compensation Committee reviews
the non-employee director compensation program, receiving input from the Compensation Committee’s independent consultant
regarding market practices and the competiveness of the non-employee director compensation program in relation to the general
market and the Company’s peer group.

2017 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
For 2017, each non-employee director of the Company received the following annual retainers on the first trading day after
January 1, 2017, other than Mr. Omidyar, who did not receive any compensation for his services as a Board member and did not
stand for re-election at PayPal’s 2017 Annual Meeting:

2017 Equity Awards:
In addition to the annual retainers, all non-employee directors of PayPal received the following fully vested stock awards of PayPal
common stock following PayPal’s annual meeting of stockholders:

All Non-Employee Directors
Board Chair1

$250,000 in PayPal common stock
$100,000 in PayPal common stock

1 The Board Chair receives $100,000 in PayPal common stock in addition to the $250,000 in PayPal common stock that he/she receives for services as a non-employee
director.

The number of shares of PayPal common stock subject to the stock award is determined by dividing the amount of the annual
equity award by the per share fair market value (i.e., the closing price of our common stock) on the date of the annual stockholders
meeting, rounded up to the nearest whole share.

Effective June 2017, if a non-employee director is appointed or elected at any time other than at an annual stockholders meeting,
such director will be eligible to receive a prorated annual equity award, as of the date of his or her appointment or election, for the
period prior to the first annual stockholders meeting following his or her appointment or election, determined by (i) multiplying
the amount of the annual equity award (i.e., $250,000 and, with respect to the additional equity award to the Board Chair,
$100,000) by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days from the date of appointment or election to the first
anniversary of the most recent annual stockholders meeting, and the denominator of which is 365, and (ii) dividing such amount
by the per share fair market value on the date of appointment or election, rounded up to the nearest whole share.

2018 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
Effective January 1, 2018, each non-employee director of the Company will receive the following annual retainer on the first trading

Corporate Governance

Corporate Governance

Corporate governance at PayPal is designed to promote the long-term interests of our stockholders, strengthen Board and
management accountability, foster responsible decision-making, and engender public trust. We believe that strong corporate
governance practices that provide meaningful rights to our stockholders and ensure Board and management accountability are
essential to our relationship with our stockholders. We strive to have regular, constructive conversations with our stockholders to
better understand their priorities and perspectives, and to provide us with useful input concerning our corporate governance and
compensation practices.

To help our stockholders understand our commitment to this relationship and our governance practices, the Board has adopted
the Corporate Governance Guidelines of the Board of Directors (“Governance Guidelines”) to serve as a framework within which
the Board conducts its business. Our Governance Guidelines, charters of our principal Board committees, our Code of Business
Conduct and Ethics (“Code of Business Conduct”), and other key corporate governance documents and materials are available on
our investor relations website at https://investor.paypal-corp.com/corporate-governance.cfm.

The following sections provide an overview of PayPal’s corporate governance practices.

The Board’s Role and Responsibilities
The Board is responsible for providing advice and oversight of the strategic and operational direction of the Company and
overseeing its executive management to support the long-term interests of the Company and its stockholders.

RISK OVERSIGHT
Management is responsible for assessing and managing risk, subject to oversight by the Board. The Board executes its oversight
responsibility for risk assessment and risk management directly and through its committees.

In January 2017, the Audit Committee of the Board was renamed the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee (the “ARC
Committee”) to more accurately reflect the scope of the committee’s role with respect to oversight of risk and compliance
matters. The Board has delegated to the ARC Committee primary responsibility for the oversight of the risk framework and risk
appetite framework at PayPal. In accordance with its charter, the ARC Committee oversees and assesses the Company’s overall
risk management framework, including policies and practices established by management to identify, assess, measure and manage
key current and emerging risks facing the Company. The ARC Committee reviews with our Chief Business Affairs and Legal Officer
and Chief Risk, Compliance and Security Officer, as applicable, significant legal, regulatory or compliance matters that could have a
material impact on our financial statements, business, or compliance policies, including material notices to or inquiries received
from governmental agencies.

To oversee and manage risk, we have established an Enterprise Risk and Compliance Management Program (“ERCMP”). The
ERCMP sets forth the Company’s programmatic approach to identifying, measuring, managing, monitoring, and reporting key risks
facing our Company, including financial crime compliance risk, regulatory compliance risk, technology risk, operational risk, credit
risk, capital structure risk, and strategic risk. The ERCMP is designed to enable the ARC Committee to have effective oversight
over the Company’s risk framework, including the Company’s risk management practices and capabilities. The ARC Committee
periodically reviews the Company’s Enterprise Risk and Compliance Management Policy and other key risk management policies.
The ARC Committee also regularly reviews and discusses with management the overall effectiveness of, and ongoing
enhancements to, the ERCMP. In addition, the ARC Committee discusses key risk areas with management throughout the year.
The ARC Committee reports to the entire Board on a regular basis.

The other principal Board committees are responsible for oversight of risks associated with their respective areas of responsibility.
For example, the Compensation Committee reviews the risks associated with our compensation policies and practices.
Management has assessed the Company’s compensation policies and practices and concluded that they do not create risks that
are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company, and the Compensation Committee agreed with this
conclusion. The Governance Committee reviews the risks associated with our overall corporate governance.

BOARD AND COMMITTEE EVALUATIONS
The Board and its principal committees perform an annual self-assessment to assess their performance and effectiveness and to
identify opportunities to improve Board and committee performance. As part of this annual self-assessment, directors are able to
provide feedback on the performance of other directors. The Chairman and Lead Independent Director then follows up on this
feedback and takes such further action with directors receiving comments and other directors as needed.

DIRECTOR ORIENTATION AND CONTINUING EDUCATION
Our director orientation program familiarizes new directors with the Company’s businesses, strategies, and policies, and assists
them in developing the skills and knowledge required for their service on the Board and any committees on which they serve. All
other directors are also invited to attend the orientation programs. From time to time, management provides, or invites outside

Corporate Governance

19

experts to attend Board meetings to provide, educational briefings to the Board on business, corporate governance, regulatory and
other matters. In addition, Board members may attend, at the Company’s expense, accredited director education programs.

SUCCESSION PLANNING
The Board recognizes the importance of effective executive leadership to PayPal’s success and annually reviews executive
succession planning. As part of this process, the Board reviews and discusses the capabilities of our senior leadership, as well as
succession planning and potential successors for the CEO and our other executive officers. The process includes consideration of
organizational and operational needs, competitive challenges, leadership/management potential and development, and emergency
situations.

CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT
We expect our directors, officers, and employees to conduct themselves with the highest degree of integrity, ethics, and honesty.
Our credibility and reputation depend upon the good judgment, ethical standards, and personal integrity of each director, officer,
and employee. PayPal’s Code of Business Conduct requires that its directors, executive officers, and other employees disclose
actual or potential conflicts of interest and recuse themselves from related decisions. We regularly review the Code of Business
Conduct and related policies to ensure that they provide clear guidance to our directors, executive officers, and employees. The
Code of Business Conduct is available at https://investor.paypal-corp.com/corporate-governance.cfm. Concerns about accounting
or auditing matters or possible violations of our Code of Business Conduct should be reported under the procedures outlined in
the Code of Business Conduct.

OUTSIDE ADVISORS
The Board may retain outside legal, accounting, or other advisors as it deems necessary or appropriate at the Company’s expense
and without obtaining management’s consent. Each principal committee of the Board may also retain outside legal, accounting or
other advisors as it deems necessary or appropriate at the Company’s expense and without obtaining the Board’s or
management’s consent.

Director Independence
Under the listing standards of NASDAQ and our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board must consist of a majority of
independent directors. Annually, each director completes a questionnaire designed to provide information to assist the Board in
determining whether the director is independent under the listing standards of NASDAQ and our Corporate Governance
Guidelines, and whether members of the ARC Committee and Compensation Committee satisfy additional Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and NASDAQ independence requirements. The Board has adopted guidelines setting forth certain
categories of transactions, relationships, and arrangements that it has deemed immaterial for purposes of making determinations
regarding a director’s independence, and the Board does not consider any of those transactions, relationships, and arrangements
in determining director independence.

Based on its review, the Board has determined that each of the following directors is independent under the listing standards of
NASDAQ and our Corporate Governance Guidelines, and is free of any relationship that would interfere with his or her individual
exercise of independent judgment:

Rodney C. Adkins
Wences Casares
Jonathan Christodoro
David W. Dorman

Gail J. McGovern
David M. Moffett
Pierre M. Omidyar1
Ann M. Sarnoff
Frank D. Yeary

1 Mr. Omidyar did not stand for re-election at PayPal’s 2017 Annual Meeting.

The Board limits membership on its ARC Committee, Compensation Committee, and Governance Committee to independent
directors. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines prohibit directors from serving on the board of directors, or as an officer, of
another company that may cause a significant conflict of interest. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines also provide that any
director who has previously been determined to be independent must inform the Lead Independent Director and our Corporate
Secretary of any significant change in personal circumstances, including a change in principal occupation, change in professional
roles and responsibilities or status as a member of the board of another public company, including retirement, as well as any
change in circumstance that may cause his or her status as an independent director to change.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION
None of the members of the Compensation Committee is or has been an employee of PayPal. None of our executive officers
served on the board of directors or compensation committee of another entity which has an executive officer serving on the Board
or the Compensation Committee.

Corporate Governance

Board Leadership and Lead Independent Director
In accordance with our Bylaws, our Board elects our Chairman of the Board and our CEO. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines
provide that the Chairman and CEO roles should be held by separate individuals as an aid in the Board’s oversight of management
and to allow the CEO to focus primarily on management responsibilities. Mr. Donahoe currently serves as our Chairman.

In March 2017, Mr. Moffett was appointed by the Board to serve an additional two-year term as Lead Independent Director,
effective upon the conclusion of our 2017 Annual Meeting, subject to his continuing reelection and status as an independent
director. The Lead Independent Director’s responsibilities are detailed in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, and include:

• Providing the Chairman with input as to an appropriate schedule of Board meetings;
• Providing the Chairman with input as to the preparation of agendas for Board meetings;
• Providing the Chairman with input as to the quality, quantity, and timeliness of the flow of information from the Company’s

management that is necessary for the independent directors to effectively and responsibly perform their duties;

• Making recommendations to the Chairman regarding the retention of consultants who report directly to the Board (other than

consultants who are selected by the various committees of the Board);

• Presiding over executive sessions of the Board;
• Acting as a liaison between the Independent Directors and the Chairman and CEO on sensitive issues;
• Together with the Chairman, leading the Board in its review of the results of the annual self-assessment process, including

acting on director feedback as needed; and

• Together with the Chairman, conducting interviews to confirm the continued qualification and willingness to serve of each

director whose term is expiring at an annual meeting prior to the time at which directors are nominated for re-election.

Board Committees
The Board has three principal standing committees: the ARC Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Governance
Committee. Each committee has a written charter, available on the corporate governance section of our investor relations website
at https://investor.paypal-corp.com/corporate-governance.cfm, which describes in more detail its specific responsibilities and
functions. The table below provides the current membership for each principal Board committee.

Members:
David W. Dorman

Committee Meetings in 2017: 3

Charter:
The Governance Committee Charter,
as adopted by the Board, is available on
our website at https://investor.paypal-
corp.com/corporate-governance.cfm

Primary Responsibilities
• Make recommendations to the Board as to the appropriate size of the Board

or any Board committee;
Identify individuals believed to be qualified to become Board members;

•
• Make recommendations to the Board on potential Board and Board

election cycle, taking into consideration the criteria set forth in the
“Composition of the Board” section of the Governance Guidelines;

• Review our Governance Guidelines at least annually;
• Establish procedures to exercise oversight of the evaluation of the Board and

•
• Consider any other corporate governance issues that may arise from time to

Independence
The Board has determined that each member of the Governance Committee
meets the independence requirements of NASDAQ.

Board and Committee Meetings and Attendance
Our Board holds eight regularly scheduled meetings in additional to special meetings scheduled as appropriate. At each regularly
scheduled quarterly, in-person Board meeting, a member of each principal Board committee reports on any significant matters
addressed by the committee since the last quarterly, in-person Board meeting. In addition, the outside directors have the
opportunity to meet without our management or the other directors as part of each regularly scheduled Board meeting. The Lead
Independent Director leads these discussions. The Board expects that its members rigorously prepare for, attend and participate
in all Board and applicable Board committee meetings.

Our Board met eight times during 2017. Each director nominee who served in 2017 attended at least 75% of all of our Board
meetings and committee meetings for committees on which he or she served for the period during which he or she served in 2017.

All directors are encouraged to attend the Annual Meeting. Last year, six of the ten directors serving on our Board at the time of
our 2017 Annual Meeting attended that meeting.

Related Person Transactions
RELATED-PERSON TRANSACTION POLICY
Our Board has adopted a written related-person transaction policy governing the review and approval of related person
transactions that is administered by the ARC Committee. The policy applies to any transaction or series of transactions in which
the Company or a consolidated subsidiary is a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and a related person under the
policy has a direct or indirect material interest. The policy defines a “related person” to include directors, director nominees,
executive officers, beneficial owners of more than 5% of PayPal’s outstanding common stock and or an immediate family member
of any of these persons.

Under the policy, transactions requiring review are referred to the ARC Committee for pre-approval, ratification or other action.
Management will provide the ARC Committee with a description of any related-person transaction proposed to be approved or
ratified. This description will include the terms of the transaction, the business purpose of the transaction, and the benefits to
PayPal and to the relevant related person. In determining whether to approve or ratify a related-person transaction, the ARC
Committee will consider the following factors:

• Whether the terms of the transaction are fair to the Company, and at least as favorable to the Company as would apply if the

transaction did not involve a related person;

• Whether there are demonstrable business reasons for the Company to enter into the transaction;
• Whether the transaction would impair the independence of an outside director under the Company’s director independence

standards; and

• Whether the transaction would present an improper conflict of interest for any director or executive officer, taking into account

the size of the transaction, the overall financial position of the related person, the direct or indirect nature of the related
person’s interest in the transaction and the ongoing nature of any proposed relationship, and any other factors the committee
deems relevant.

Corporate Governance

23

The Company also has practices that address potential conflicts in circumstances where a non-employee director is a control
person of an investment fund that desires to make an investment in or acquire a company that may compete with one of the
Company’s businesses. Under those circumstances, the director is required to notify the Company’s CEO and Chief Business
Affairs and Legal Officer of the proposed transaction, and the Company’s CEO and Chief Business Affairs and Legal Officer then
assess the nature and degree to which the investee company is competitive with one of the Company’s businesses, as well as the
potential overlaps between the Company and the investee company. If the Company’s CEO and Chief Business Affairs and Legal
Officer determines that the competitive situation and potential overlaps between PayPal and the investee company are
acceptable, approval of the transaction by the Company would be conditioned upon the director agreeing to certain limitations
(including refraining from joining the board of directors of, serving as an advisor to, or being directly involved in the business of the
investee company or conveying any confidential or proprietary information regarding the investee company to the Company or
regarding the Company’s line of business with which the investee competes to the investee company, abstaining from being the
primary decision-maker for the investment fund with respect to the investee company, recusing himself/herself from portions of
investee company meetings that cover confidential competitive information reasonably pertinent to the Company’s lines of
business with which the investee company competes and agreeing to any additional limitations deemed to be reasonably
necessary or appropriate by the Company’s CEO or Chief Business Affairs and Legal Officer as circumstances change). All
transactions by investment funds in which a non-employee director is a control person also remain subject in all respects to the
Board’s written policy for the review of related person transactions, discussed above.

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS
An immediate family member of Gary Marino, our Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer, is employed by the
Company. Gary’s Marino’s son, Steve Marino, is a project manager in credit technology, and received total compensation of
approximately $197,896 in 2017 and standard benefits applicable to similarly situated employees. This related person transaction
was approved by the ARC Committee.

The charter of the ARC Committee requires it to review and approve all related person transactions that are required to be
disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. There were no transactions required to be reported in this Proxy Statement since
the beginning of fiscal 2017 where our written related-person transaction policy did not require review, approval or ratification or
where this policy was not followed.

Communication with the Board
Stockholders are invited to contact the Board or any individual director by writing to the Corporate Secretary at our principal

Proposal 2

Proposal 2 — Advisory Vote to Approve Named Executive
Officer Compensation

In accordance with the requirements of Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking our stockholders to vote on an advisory
basis to approve the compensation paid to our NEOs (“say-on-pay”), as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis
and the compensation table sections of this proxy statement.

As discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Compensation Committee is committed to an executive
compensation program that creates transparent and simple programs that appropriately incentivize our executives, align with
stockholder interests and external expectations, and enable us to effectively compete for and win top talent and to build the
strongest possible leadership team for PayPal. The Compensation Committee believes that the goals of our executive
compensation program are appropriate and that the program is properly structured to achieve those goals. In deciding how to vote
on this proposal, the Board encourages you to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the compensation table
sections of this proxy statement.

The Board recommends that stockholders vote “FOR” the following resolution:

“RESOLVED, that the Company’s stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive
officers, as disclosed in the Company’s Proxy Statement for the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the
compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and
Analysis, the 2017 Summary Compensation Table, and the other related tables and disclosures.”

This “say-on-pay” vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company, the Board, or the Compensation Committee.
However, the Board and the Compensation Committee value the opinions of our stockholders and will take into account the
outcome of this vote in considering future compensation arrangements. We hold our advisory “say-on-pay” vote every year and
expect that the next “say-on-pay” vote will occur at PayPal’s 2019 annual meeting of stockholders.

The Board Recommends a Vote FOR Proposal 2.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis

Dear PayPal Stockholder:

2017 was an extraordinary year for PayPal. We continued to pursue our mission and vision as part of the multi-year strategic
plan that dramatically expanded our customer value proposition, transformed our business model to support customer choice,
and strengthened strategic partnerships across the ecosystem. In 2017, we succeeded in growing our core through expanding
our global capabilities, in expanding our value proposition for customers by focusing on trust and simplicity, and in
strengthening strategic partnerships by building new strategic partnerships to provide better experiences for our customers and
seeking new areas of growth through new international markets around the world.

Our executive compensation program takes into consideration the unique nature of the financial technology (“FinTech”)
competitive landscape, and is designed to create transparent and simple programs that appropriately incentivize our executives,
align with stockholder interests and external expectations, and enable us to effectively compete for and win top talent and to
build the strongest possible leadership team for PayPal. The discussion that follows provides an overview of our compensation
program for our named executive officers and their compensation for 2017. We encourage you to review this discussion and
analysis of our program carefully, and we hope you agree that our executive compensation program supports PayPal’s growth
strategy and is well aligned with creating long-term stockholder value.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis

Introduction
We completed our second year as an independent company in 2017, continuing our transformative journey while delivering strong
results. For 2017, the Committee approved an executive compensation program based on our “pay for performance” philosophy
that is designed to align our executive officers’ compensation with the key drivers of profitable short-term and long-term growth
and the goals of properly incentivizing and rewarding our executives for performance that exceeds expectations, providing
transparency for both our executives and our stockholders, and positioning us competitively to enable us to attract and retain our
executives.

This Compensation Discussion and Analysis (“CD&A”) describes the compensation for each of PayPal’s named executive
officers (“NEOs”). For 2017, our NEOs were:

Daniel H. Schulman
John D. Rainey
Gary J. Marino
A. Louise Pentland
William J. Ready

President and Chief Executive Officer (our “CEO”)
Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Global Customer Operations
Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer

The Committee believes that long-term equity incentives should comprise the majority of the target total direct compensation
opportunity for our NEOs. Other than the annual long-term incentive awards, the Committee may also grant other equity awards
from time to time in recognition of an NEO’s promotion or special achievement. In 2017, a special equity grant of RSUs was made
to Mr. Ready with a grant date value equal to $16 million (the “Promotion RSU Award”) in recognition of his promotion to Chief
Operating Officer in late 2016. The vesting schedule of this Promotion RSU Award is intended to enhance our long-term retention
objective, due to its back-loaded vesting schedule, as 50% of the Promotion RSU Award will vest on the second anniversary of the
date of grant and 25% will vest on each of the third and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant, subject to Mr. Ready’s continued
service through the applicable vesting date. The Promotion RSU Award was granted after considering the input of the
Committee’s independent compensation consultant, the level deemed necessary to retain Mr. Ready’s continued service to the
Company in this key operational role over the four-year vesting period given the highly competitive labor market in the Bay Area,
Mr. Ready’s expanded scope of responsibilities, and his performance in that role since his promotion.

KEY CONSIDERATIONS IN SETTING PAY
Objectives of Executive Compensation Program
In 2017, the Committee prioritized the following compensation philosophy and goals:

• Simplicity, Transparency and Clarity of our Program – enable executives to directly link Company and individual performance to

their pay, and enable stockholders to directly link returns on their investment to Company performance;

• One Team – maintain unified goals and objectives for the entire executive leadership team to drive operational decisions and

Company performance;

• Winning the War for Talent – recognize the unique FinTech space in which we compete and prioritize nimble and aggressive

•

compensation strategies to attract and retain key talent; and
Individual Performance – ensure compensation is commensurate with results, both on the upside and downside, and that
leaders are held accountable for their performance.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis

Investor Feedback and 2017 Say-On-Pay Advisory Vote on Named Executive Officer Compensation
At our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders (the “2017 Annual Meeting”), we received more than 96% support of the votes cast on
our say-on-pay proposal. Following our 2017 Annual Meeting, we engaged in proactive outreach efforts with major institutional
investors holding approximately 55% of our common stock focused on various corporate governance and executive compensation-
related issues.

After considering our 2017 say-on-pay voting results as well as the positive feedback received during our stockholder engagement
efforts, the Committee determined that it was appropriate to maintain the core design of our 2017 executive compensation
program and did not make any changes to our executive compensation program in response to those voting results or stockholder
engagement feedback. The Committee will continue to consider future say-on-pay votes and investor feedback when considering
and making decisions relating to our executive compensation program, policies, and practices.

Pay for Performance
Our key executive compensation guiding principle continues to be closely aligning the compensation of our executives with the
creation of long-term value for our stockholders by tying a significant portion of their target total direct compensation opportunity
to the Company’s performance.

2017 Performance Highlights
In 2017, led by significantly higher revenue growth and improved operating performance, our business delivered greater
profitability and higher earnings per share on a reported and adjusted basis. We continued to focus on the long-term growth of our
business by executing a broad transformation of our culture and business model to support customer choice and strengthening
strategic partnerships across the ecosystem.

The following summarizes our key financial and operational performance results for 2017. We use certain of these key metrics as
the performance measures in our incentive compensation program and believe these measures help to align the interests of our
executives with those of our stockholders.

1 Non-GAAP operating margin and free cash flow are two of the performance metrics used in our incentive compensation program. Non-GAAP operating margin and
free cash flow are not financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). For information on how we compute these
non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, please refer to the
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section beginning on page 47 of our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed
with the SEC on February 7, 2018.
2 Free Cash Flow for 2017 reflects the impact of held for sale accounting treatment in connection with the potential sale of the Company’s U.S. consumer credit
receivables portfolio, which reduced free cash flow for 2017 by approximately $1.3 billion. Normalizing for this impact, free cash flow for 2017 would have been
approximately $3.16 billion.

In addition to our strong financial and operational results, we also achieved the following in 2017:

• Our total stockholder return for 2017 (measured from December 30, 2016 to December 29, 2017) was 87%.
• We signed a new long-term strategic partnership with Synchrony Financial that extends our existing co-branded consumer
credit card program agreement. Under this partnership, Synchrony will also become the exclusive issuer of the PayPal credit
online consumer financing program in the U.S. for the next ten years and acquire the assets of PayPal’s U.S. consumer credit
receivables portfolio.

• As part of our vision of being a true Customer Champion and supporting customer choice, we continued to forge a series of
strategic partnerships with networks, financial institutions, technology companies, and mobile carriers, and entered into 16
major strategic partnerships in 2017.

• Continued strength in mobile, as mobile represented approximately 34% of overall payment volume on our platform for the full

year 2017 with total mobile payment volume growing 52% to approximately $155 billion for the year.

Linking 2017 NEO Compensation to Performance
We believe that our executive compensation program was effective at incentivizing results in 2017 by appropriately aligning pay
and performance. The following charts show the 2017 Target Total Direct Compensation mix for our CEO, Mr. Schulman, and the
average Target Total Direct Compensation mix for our other NEOs. Target Total Direct Compensation is the sum of (i) 2017 base
salary, (ii) target 2017 annual incentive award (based on the grant date fair value for the portion of the award delivered as PBRSUs)
and (iii) target annual long-term incentive award (based on grant date fair values).

Compensation Discussion and Analysis

The following chart demonstrates the alignment between Revenue, a key metric of our financial performance, and our Indexed
TSR, to our CEO Pay (as shown in the “2017 Summary Compensation Table”) during 2017, 2016 and 2015. Indexed TSR is defined as
the total shareholder return on our common stock during the period from December 31, 2015 through December 29, 2017,
assuming $100 was invested on December 31, 2015.

2017 Incentive Pay Outcomes Are Aligned with Performance—Annual Incentive Award Program
Our NEOs earned annual incentive awards (bonuses) under the 2017 annual incentive award program (the “2017 AIP”), which is our
annual bonus program for eligible employees adopted pursuant to the PayPal Employee Incentive Plan.

Under the 2017 AIP, Revenue served as the “gate” or the funding performance target (the “2017 AIP Funding Threshold”), and if
achieved, payouts were determined based on a Company performance component and an individual performance component,
weighted 75% and 25%, respectively. Assuming the 2017 AIP Funding Threshold was achieved, Revenue and Non-GAAP Operating
Margin served as equally weighted Company performance measures and represented the primary determinants of the payout with
respect to the financial component, with “Net New Actives” (as defined below in “Compensation Framework – Incentive
(Performance-Based) Compensation for 2017 – Annual Incentive Award Program – Company Performance Measures) serving as a
financial performance measure modifier.

In addition, the Committee approved a revised annual incentive award program design by granting the Company performance
component of the 2017 AIP in the form of PBRSUs, with a one-year performance period (calendar year 2017), pursuant to the
terms of the PayPal Employee Incentive Plan and the 2015 PayPal Holdings, Inc. Equity Incentive Award Plan, as amended and
restated. The awards were granted in mid-February 2017 and vested on the one-year anniversary of the grant date, based on
Company performance and continued employment through the vesting date. The Committee believes that delivering the
Company performance portion of the 2017 AIP in equity further reinforces and strengthens the pay for performance design of our
executive compensation program, and provides a further linkage between our NEOs and stockholders, without increasing the
target short-term incentive of our NEOs.

In early 2018, the Committee approved funding 2017 annual incentives under the 2017 AIP based upon our exceeding the 2017 AIP
Funding Threshold. The Committee then approved specific awards of these annual incentives based upon Company performance
with regard to Revenue and Non-GAAP Operating Margin, “Net New Actives” performance and each executive’s individual
performance, as further discussed under “Compensation Framework – Incentive (Performance-Based) Compensation for 2017 –
Annual Incentive Award Program.” Based on these results, the Committee determined that the achievement level of the Company
performance component under the 2017 AIP was 185% of target.

The Committee set the 2017 Revenue and Non-GAAP Operating Margin target levels in consideration of anticipated performance
and within the guidance range provided to the market in early 2017. We experienced significant growth during the year and,
accordingly, the 2017 AIP payments were higher than the 2016 annual incentive payments, primarily due to our strong financial
and operational performance.

Key Compensation Policies and Practices
We are committed to maintaining strong governance standards with respect to our executive compensation program, policies, and
practices. Consistent with this focus, we maintain the following policies and practices that we believe demonstrate our
commitment to executive compensation best practices.

What We Do

A substantial percentage of our NEOs’ 2017 Target Total Direct Compensation was performance-
based and tied to pre-established performance goals aligned with our short-term and long-term
objectives.
We use objective performance-based company goals in our annual and long-term incentive plans
that we believe are rigorous and designed to incentivize and motivate NEO performance.
Our NEOs are subject to a clawback policy, which permits the Committee to require forfeiture or
reimbursement of incentive compensation, including any cash incentive award, equity award, or
equity-based award paid or awarded to the NEO during the period in which he or she is subject
to the policy, if (i) an action or omission by the NEO constitutes a material violation of our Code
of Business Conduct; (ii) an action or omission by the NEO results in material financial or
reputational harm to the Company; or (iii) a material restatement of all or a portion of our
financial statements is the result of a supervisory or other failure by the NEO.
Our stock ownership guidelines are designed to align the long-term interests of our NEOs and
non-employee directors with those of our stockholders and discourage excessive risk-taking. Our
guidelines require stock ownership levels as a value of our common stock equal to a multiple of
base salary (6x for CEO and 3x for EVPs) or annual retainer (5x for non-employee directors), and
include stock retention requirements for executive officers until the required ownership levels
are reached.
Our insider trading policy prohibits members of our Board and NEOs from (i) entering into any
hedging or monetization transactions relating to our securities or otherwise trading in any
instrument relating to the future price of our securities or (ii) pledging our common stock as
collateral for any loans.

What We Do

The Committee engages its own independent compensation consultant to advise on executive
and non-employee director compensation matters.

Based on our annual risk assessment, we have concluded that our compensation program does
not present any risk that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on PayPal.
The Committee, with the assistance of its compensation consultant, reviews the composition of
our comparator peer group annually and makes adjustments to the composition of the peer
group as it deems appropriate.

We conduct an annual advisory (non-binding) vote on the compensation of the NEOs (a
“say-on-pay” vote). At our 2017 Annual Meeting, more than 96% of the votes cast on the
say-on-pay proposal were voted in support of the 2016 compensation of the NEOs.
In addition to the annual say-on-pay vote, we are committed to ongoing engagement with our
investors on executive compensation and governance matters. These engagement efforts take
place through teleconferences, in-person meetings and correspondence with our investors.

What We Don’t Do

We do not provide our NEOs with any gross-ups or other payment or reimbursement of excise
taxes on severance or other payments in connection with a change in control of PayPal.

We do not make “single-trigger” change-in-control payments or maintain any plans that require
single-trigger change-in-control acceleration of equity awards to our NEOs upon a change in
control of PayPal.

We do not provide our NEOs with tax gross-ups on perquisites, other than in limited
circumstances for business-related relocations and international business travel-related benefits
that are under our control, at our direction and deemed to benefit our business operations.
We expressly prohibit the discounting of stock options and the repricing of underwater stock
options without stockholder approval under our equity compensation plan.

Our annual incentive plan is performance-based and our NEOs are not guaranteed any minimum
levels of payment.

Compensation Framework
INCENTIVE (PERFORMANCE-BASED) COMPENSATION FOR 2017
When deciding the target amount and form of each element of compensation for each of our NEOs, the Committee took into
account the size and complexity of the NEO’s position and business unit or function, as well as the following factors (the “Incentive
Compensation Factors”):

• performance against financial performance measures;
• defining business unit or function strategy and roadmaps, and executing against them;
• organizational development, including hiring, development and retention for each business unit or function;
•
•
• negotiating, closing and integrating or implementing acquisitions and strategic partnerships; and
• achievement of strategic and operational objectives, and executing against budgets.

leadership;
improving and supporting innovation and execution for the business unit or function;

No specific weightings were assigned to these Incentive Compensation Factors; instead, individual performance was evaluated
based on a holistic and subjective assessment of each individual NEO’s performance against these factors.

Annual Incentive Award Program
The 2017 AIP provides our NEOs with the opportunity to earn annual incentive compensation based on Company performance
and each executive’s individual performance.

2017 Annual Report / 2018 Proxy Statement

Compensation Discussion and Analysis

37

The Committee believes that it is important to have our executives’ annual incentives tied primarily to our overall performance,
with individual compensation differentiated based on individual performance.

Target Incentive Amounts
The 2017 annual incentive target (expressed as a percentage of base salary) for each NEO was determined (i) with reference to the
Committee’s assessment of data from public filings of our peer group companies and general industry data for comparable
technology companies that were included in proprietary third-party compensation surveys (the specific identity of respondents of
which are not provided to the Committee or the Company), (ii) based on each NEO’s position within the Company and (iii) taking
into account the Incentive Compensation Factors. For 2017, the Committee did not adjust the target annual incentive opportunity
percentages from the percentages set in 2016 for each of the NEOs.

The following table sets forth the 2017 AIP target annual cash incentive opportunities (the “Target Incentive Amount”) for each of
our NEOs, expressed as a percentage of 2017 base salary and in dollars.

with a one-year performance period (calendar year 2017). The PBRSUs were granted on February 15, 2017. The following table sets

were granted on February 15, 2017.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis

Company Performance Measures
In early 2017, the Committee set the Company performance measures under the 2017 AIP for our NEOs to create a strong link
between Company performance and incentive payouts, as described in the following table:

Measure
Revenue
(50% Weighting)

Definition
Revenue, as reported in our Annual Report on
our Form 10-K.

Non-GAAP Operating Margin
(50% Weighting)

“Non-GAAP Operating Margin,” as reported in
our Annual Report on our Form 10-K.

Net New Actives (“NNAs”)
(“Modifier”)

Measures the net change in the number of
organic active customer accounts compared to
the prior period, in this case 2017 compared to
2016. NNAs excludes the impact of any
mergers and acquisitions.

Purpose
The Committee believes that a Revenue
threshold (or “gate”) should be included to
ensure that no cash incentive is paid if future
income may be impaired by insufficient
revenue growth.

In 2017, the Committee also included Revenue
as one of the equally-weighted Company
performance measures to establish the
payment with respect to the Company
performance component because the
Committee believes that top-line growth is an
important factor in stockholder value creation.
Revenue is also a key financial metric that the
Company uses internally to measure its
ongoing financial performance.
The Committee believes that Non-GAAP
Operating Margin is a key measure of our
short-term and intermediate-term
performance because it measures profitability
and reflects the degree of Revenue growth and
expense management discipline of the
Company and is a widely followed measure of
core financial performance and business
activities for our industry. Non-GAAP
Operating Margin is also a key financial metric
that the Company uses internally to measure
its ongoing financial performance.
The Committee believes that measuring NNAs
reinforces the critical importance of growing our
customer base to build for the future.

The Committee determined that the 2017 AIP should contain a minimum Revenue threshold (the “2017 AIP Funding Threshold”)
to permit the funding of the plan and minimum Revenue and Non-GAAP Operating Margin thresholds to govern the performance
necessary to trigger any payments. If the 2017 AIP Funding Threshold was met, Revenue and Non-GAAP Operating Margin were
applied as equally weighted Company performance measures as the primary determinants of the Company performance portion of
the payment for the 2017 AIP, with the Company performance payment level ranging from a minimum level of 25% to a maximum
level of 200%. The NNAs operational performance measure served as a modifier to adjust the Company performance payout one
percentage point for every 2.5 million increase of NNAs above the target. The Company performance payment level could not
exceed 200% of target. If the 2017 AIP Funding Threshold was met, 75% of the Target Incentive Amount was determined based on
our Revenue and Non-GAAP Operating Margin financial performance as measured against the pre-established performance levels
and the NNA modifier, and the remaining 25% of the Target Incentive Amount was determined based on individual performance.

The table below shows the following for the 2017 AIP:

• The threshold, target and maximum performance levels established by the Committee for the 2017 AIP. These performance

levels were set in the first quarter of 2017 based primarily on our approved budget and operating plan for the year, and the
target levels were in-line with full year guidance provided to the investment community in January 2017;

• The actual performance levels achieved in 2017; and
• The resulting Company Performance Score, defined as a payout percentage based on our performance as measured against

these pre-established performance levels.

1 Revenue numbers are shown in billions and NNAs shown in millions.
2 After the end of each year, our actual performance is compared to the performance measures to determine the payment level of the Company performance portion of
the 2017 AIP, subject to Committee–approved variations due to material events not contemplated at the time the target levels were established (such as major
acquisitions and divestitures) and the Committee’s negative discretion. For 2017, the Committee adjusted 2017 Actual Revenue and Non-GAAP Operating Margin
downward for the impact of the Company’s agreement to sell the U.S. consumer credit portfolio to Synchrony Financial and adjusted NNAs to exclude certain NNAs not
contemplated when company targets were set.
3 The 2017 AIP Funding Threshold was $11.77M.

Individual Performance Measures
To facilitate differentiation based on individual performance, 25% of the Target Incentive Amount for our NEOs was based on
individual performance (the “Individual Performance Score”). To determine each NEO’s Individual Performance Score, which can
range from 0% to 200%, Mr. Schulman presented to the Committee his assessment of each NEO’s individual performance
following the end of 2017, and the Committee assessed Mr. Schulman’s individual performance, in each case, with respect to one or
more individual performance factors (collectively, the “Performance Factors”).

The Performance Factors related specifically to each NEO’s job function and generally encompassed the following items for each
NEO:

In determining the Individual Performance Score for each NEO, Mr. Schulman and the Committee did not place specific weightings
on the Performance Factors, but performed a holistic and subjective assessment of each individual NEO’s Performance Factors,
taking into account the relative importance to us of each Performance Factor. Mr. Schulman recommended to the Committee
each NEO’s Individual Performance Score other than his own.

The Committee then made a final determination, in its sole discretion, as to the Individual Performance Score for each NEO after
considering Mr. Schulman’s recommendations (other than with respect to himself), reviewing each individual’s performance with
respect to the Performance Factors, and considering its own observations and assessments of each NEO’s and the Company’s
performance. The Committee approved the Individual Performance Scores as recommended by Mr. Schulman for Messrs. Rainey,
Marino and Ready and Ms. Pentland of 200%, 175%, 200% and 200%, respectively. For Mr. Schulman, the Committee approved an
Individual Performance Score of 200%.

Long-Term Incentive Components
Long-Term Incentive Award Type and Annual Target Value
In making its determination on the long-term incentive (“LTI”) annual target value for 2017, the Committee set equity award
guidelines and target levels of individual awards by position based on the following:

• equity compensation practices of technology companies in our peer group, as disclosed in their public filings (see “Other

Compensation Practices and Policies – Use of Peer Group Comparisons” below for our 2017 peer group) and in proprietary
third-party compensation surveys (the specific identity of respondents of which are not provided to the Committee or the
Company);
individual performance and potential;
Incentive Compensation Factors; and

•
•
• need for individual retention incentives.

Based on these guidelines, the Committee approved the following annual target values for the 2017 LTI awards for the NEOs:

leadership of the Company and resulting Company performance.
2. Mr. Rainey’s LTI annual target value increased from 2016 due to his execution of financial plans that were designed to meet or exceed expectations for growth,
operating margin and cash flow targets and the resulting Company performance and his pay relative to internal and external peers.
3. Mr. Marino’s LTI annual target value increased from 2016 due to his expanding role and responsibilities and his pay relative to internal and external peers.
4. Ms. Pentland’s LTI annual target value increased from 2016 due to her expanding role and responsibilities and her pay relative to internal and external peers.

The following describes the two components of our 2017 LTI program: PBRSUs and RSUs.

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units (PBRSUs)
In January 2017, the Committee approved the structure for the PBRSUs granted in 2017. To emphasize the importance of long-
term, sustained strategic growth, the Committee approved a three-year performance period with each award to be settled for the
number of shares of our common stock earned pursuant to the award following the end of the performance period, subject to the
Committee’s approval of the level of achievement against the pre-established target levels for the selected performance measures
(the “2017-2019 PBRSUs”).

PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND RATIONALES
The Committee approved the 2017-2019 PBRSU performance measures, which are the compound annual growth rates (“CAGR”) of
FX-Neutral Revenue and Free Cash Flow over the three-year performance period from 2017-2019, as equally-weighted measures.
The Committee believes that measuring CAGR over the three-year performance period is an appropriate performance measure as
it is consistent with our long-term goal of growing our revenue and free cash flow.

2017 Annual Report / 2018 Proxy Statement

The following table summarizes the performance measures for the 2017-2019 PBRSUs and the Committee’s rationale for their
selection:

Compensation Discussion and Analysis

43

Measure/Weighting
FX-Neutral Revenue CAGR
(50% weighting)

Definition
Calculated on a fixed foreign exchange basis
(referred to as “FX-Neutral”).

Free Cash Flow CAGR
(50% weighting)

“Free Cash Flow” is defined as “Net cash
provided by operating activities” less “Property
and equipment, net” as reported in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for each year during the
performance period.

Purpose
The Committee believes that the
FX-Neutral Revenue measure should be
used to help ensure that our executive
officers are accountable for driving profitable
growth, and making appropriate tradeoffs
between investments that increase
operating expense and future growth in
revenue.

The Committee believes that the Free Cash
Flow measure should be used to emphasize
the cash generation capability of the
business necessary to finance its continued
growth and investment requirements, while
positioning us to take advantage of inorganic
growth opportunities.

PBRSU MECHANICS AND TARGETS
The targets established for the three-year performance period were set at a level consistent with the medium term outlook
provided to the investment community. When the Committee set the target levels for the 2017-2019 PBRSUs, they were intended
to be challenging but attainable based on anticipated market growth over the performance period, and to provide appropriate
incentives for our executive officers to continue to grow our business. The Committee believes that achievement of maximum
performance against the target levels would require sustained exceptional corporate performance over the performance period.

To earn any of the shares of our common stock subject to the 2017-2019 PBRSUs, at least one of the FX-Neutral Revenue CAGR or
Free Cash Flow CAGR performance thresholds must be met. Each of the performance thresholds for FX-Neutral Revenue CAGR
and Free Cash Flow CAGR is independent, and if either threshold is met, the award is earnable with respect to that performance
measure based on the percentages shown in the table below. If the performance threshold for either FX-Neutral Revenue CAGR or
Free Cash Flow CAGR is not met, there is no payment attributable to that performance measure.

NO PERFORMANCE DETERMINATIONS RELATED TO PREVIOUSLY AWARDED PBRSUs IN 2017
2015 was the last year in which PBRSUs with a two-year performance period were granted based on performance criteria set by the
eBay Compensation Committee. The amount and value of the award depended on our performance relative to the target levels
approved by the eBay Compensation Committee in early 2015.

In 2016, the Committee approved a revised structure for future PBRSUs. To emphasize the importance of long-term, sustained
strategic growth to the Company, the Committee approved extending the performance period from a two-year performance cycle
to a three-year performance cycle with “cliff” vesting following the end of the performance period, subject to the Committee’s
approval of the level of achievement against the pre-established performance criteria.

Due to the change in our PBRSU performance cycles, from two years to three years, the Committee was not required to approve
any performance determinations relating to 2017 for previously awarded PBRSUs.

Restricted Stock Units
Our 2017 LTI awards also included service-based RSUs with a three-year annual vesting schedule, which aligns the vesting period of
the RSUs with the three-year performance period of the PBRSUs granted in 2017. Service-based RSUs have value regardless of
whether our stock price increases or decreases and therefore help to secure and retain executive officers and provide an
appropriate incentive to remain with us during the vesting period.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis

OTHER COMPENSATION ELEMENTS
Base Salary
At the beginning of each year, the Committee meets to review and approve each executive officer’s base salary for the year after
considering competitive market data and the individual factors described below. For 2017, the Committee assessed competitive
market data on base salaries from public filings of our peer group companies and general industry data for comparable technology
and financial companies that are included in proprietary third-party compensation surveys (the specific identity of respondents of
which are not provided to the Committee or the Company). The Committee also considered individual factors such as individual
performance, levels of responsibility, breadth of knowledge, and prior experience in its evaluation of base salary adjustments.

In accordance with our emphasis on performance-based compensation, the Committee determined that none of the NEOs would
receive an increase in base salary and in lieu of any base salary increase, the Committee delivered an increase in target total direct
compensation through its decisions with respect to long-term incentive compensation, as discussed above.

Promotion Equity Award
Mr. Ready
The Committee believes that long-term equity incentives should comprise the majority of the target total direct compensation
opportunity for our NEOs. In addition to the LTI awards described above, the Committee may also grant other equity awards from
time to time in recognition of an NEO’s promotion or special achievement. In 2017, a special equity grant of RSUs was made to Mr.
Ready with a grant date value equal to $16 million (the “Promotion RSU Award”) in recognition of his promotion to Chief Operating
Officer in late 2016. The vesting schedule of this Promotion RSU Award is intended to enhance our long-term retention objective,
due to its back-loaded vesting schedule, as 50% of the Promotion RSU Award will vest on the second anniversary of the date of
grant and 25% will vest on each of the third and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant, subject to Mr. Ready’s continued service
through the applicable vesting date. The Promotion RSU Award was granted after considering the input of the Committee’s
independent compensation consultant, the level deemed necessary to retain Mr. Ready’s continued service to the Company in this
key operational role over the four-year vesting period given the highly competitive labor market in the Bay Area, Mr. Ready’s
expanded scope of responsibilities, and his performance in that role since his promotion.

“Make Whole” Payments
Mr. Rainey
Mr. Rainey commenced employment with us in August 2015 as our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. Pursuant to the
terms of his offer letter, in recognition of his forfeited equity awards with his former employer, Mr. Rainey received the last “make-
whole” payment in the amount of $2 million in February 2017. This “make-whole” payment was subject to a clawback should
Mr. Rainey’s employment be terminated for cause or should he resign without good reason prior to the second anniversary of his
commencement of employment.

Deferred Compensation
The PayPal Holdings, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (“DCP”), our non-qualified deferred compensation plan, provides our U.S.-
based executive officers a mechanism to defer compensation in excess of the amounts that are legally permitted to be deferred
under our tax-qualified 401(k) savings plan (the “401(k) Plan”). Together, the 401(k) Plan and the DCP allow participants to set
aside tax-deferred amounts. The Committee believes the opportunity to defer compensation is a competitive benefit that
enhances our ability to attract and retain talented executives while building plan participants’ long-term commitment to the
Company. The investment return on the deferred amounts is linked to the performance of a range of market-based investment
choices made available pursuant to the plan. None of our NEOs participated in or had a balance in the DCP during 2017.

Other Benefits
Perquisites
We provide certain executive officers with perquisites and other personal benefits that the Committee believes are reasonable and
consistent with our overall executive compensation program and philosophy. These benefits are provided to help us attract and
retain these executive officers. The Committee periodically reviews the levels of these benefits provided to our executive officers.
In 2017, we offered the following perquisites to our NEOs:

Compensation Discussion and Analysis

45

CEO Security Program

We maintain a comprehensive security policy, and as a component of this policy, we may
determine that in certain circumstances, certain executives should be required to have personal
security protection. In June 2017, because of the high visibility of the Company, the Committee
has authorized a CEO Security Program for Mr. Schulman to address safety concerns due to
specific threats to his safety arising directly as a result of his position as our President and CEO.
We paid for the initial procurement, installation and maintenance of personal residential security
measures for Mr. Schulman and for the costs of security personnel during personal travel in a
location in which he may be a particular target of criminal activity. In addition, the Committee
approved Mr. Schulman’s use of our corporate aircraft for personal travel in connection with his
overall security program.

We require that the executive accept such personal security protection because we believe it is in
the best interests of the Company and its stockholders that the executive not be vulnerable to
security threats to the executive or members of his or her family. We also believe that the costs
of this overall security program are appropriate and necessary. Although we do not consider
Mr. Schulman’s overall security program to be a perquisite for his benefit for the reasons
described above, the costs related to personal security for Mr. Schulman at his residence and
during personal travel, as well as the costs of private aircraft for personal travel pursuant to his
overall security program are reported in the “All Other Compensation” column in the 2017
Summary Compensation Table below.

Prior to the Committee authorizing this change to the overall security program, Mr. Schulman
was permitted to make limited personal use of our corporate aircraft for up to 50 hours per year,
but was required to reimburse us for any personal use of the aircraft pursuant to the terms of a
lease arrangement for all trip related expenses and hourly direct operating costs, as permitted
under federal aviation regulations. As a result of this reimbursement arrangement,
Mr. Schulman’s personal use of the aircraft prior to the authorization of this change to the overall
security program resulted in no additional cost to us in 2017.

Severance and Change in Control Provisions
Each of the NEOs is eligible to receive payments and benefits in the event of a termination of employment, including a
termination of employment in connection with a change in control of the Company (the “Executive Severance Provisions”), either
through specific provisions included in individual agreements with the Company or substantially similar provisions provided under
our SVP and Above Standard Severance Plan and Change in Control Severance Plan for Key Employees. Under the Executive
Severance Provisions, an NEO is eligible to receive payments and benefits in certain terminations of employment, including
without limitation, a termination of employment by the Company without cause or by the executive for good reason. No
payments or benefits are provided under the Executive Severance Provisions if there is a change in control of the Company
without an accompanying qualifying termination of employment (i.e., no “single-trigger” payments). We do not provide any of the
NEOs with excise tax “gross-ups” or other similar payments.

The Committee believes that these Executive Severance Provisions are essential to fulfill our objective to recruit, retain, and
develop key, high-quality management talent in the competitive market because these arrangements provide reasonable
protection to the executive officer in the event that he or she is not retained under specific circumstances. Further, the Executive
Severance Provisions are intended to facilitate changes in the leadership team by setting terms for the termination of an NEO in
advance, thus allowing a smooth transition of responsibilities when it is deemed to be in the best interest of the Company. The
change in control provisions in the Executive Severance Provisions are intended to allow executives to focus their attention on our
business operations in the face of the potentially disruptive impact of a proposed change-in-control transaction, to assess
takeover bids objectively without regard to the potential impact on their individual job security, and to allow for a smooth
transition in the event of a change in control of the Company. These factors are especially important in light of the executives’ key
leadership roles.

See “Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control” below for a description of these arrangements and the
estimated payments and benefits payable under the Executive Severance Provisions.

Other Compensation Practices and Policies
ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Compensation Committee
Our executive compensation program is designed and administered under the direction and control of the Committee. The
Committee is comprised solely of independent directors, who review and approve our overall executive compensation program,
policies and practices and set the compensation of our senior executives.

Compensation Consultant
The Committee’s independent compensation consultant provides it with advice and resources to help it assess the effectiveness
of our executive compensation strategy and program. This compensation consultant reports directly to the Committee, and the
Committee has the sole power to terminate or replace the consultant at any time. In 2017, Compensia served as the Committee’s
compensation consultant.

As part of its engagement, the Committee directed Compensia to work with our Senior Vice President, People and other members
of management to obtain information necessary to formulate recommendations and evaluate management’s recommendations to
the Committee. Compensia also meets with the Committee during its regular meetings, in executive session (where no members
of management are present), and with the Committee chair and other Committee members outside of its regular meetings.

As part of its engagement in 2017, Compensia provided an environmental scan of executive compensation, evaluated our peer
group composition, evaluated cash and equity compensation levels at the peer group companies for our executive officers,
reviewed proposed compensation adjustments, advised on the framework for our annual and long-term incentive awards, assessed
executive perquisites relative to peer and broader market practices, and reviewed the compensation of the non-employee
directors. Compensia did not provide any other services to us in 2017.

The Committee recognizes that it is essential to receive objective advice from its compensation consultant. To that end, the
Committee closely examines the procedures and safeguards that its compensation consultant takes to ensure that its services are
objective. The Committee has assessed the independence of Compensia pursuant to SEC rules and concluded that its work for the
Committee did not raise any conflict of interest.

CEO and the Human Resources (“People”) Department
The Committee works with members of our management team, including our CEO, our EVP, Chief Business Affairs and Legal
Officer, our Senior Vice President, People, and our Vice President, Global Rewards to formulate the specific plan and award designs,
including performance measures and performance levels, necessary to align our executive compensation program with our
business objectives and strategies.

Generally, our CEO reviews with the Committee his performance evaluations of each of our other NEOs and his recommendations
regarding base salary adjustments, annual incentive awards and long-term incentives to ensure that the Committee’s decisions
consider our corporate financial and operational results as well as individual performance. The Committee makes all final decisions
regarding the compensation of our NEOs.

While certain members of management attended the meetings of the Committee in 2017 upon invitation, they did not attend
executive sessions of the meetings nor do they attend the portion of Committee meetings at which their own compensation was
discussed.

USE OF PEER GROUP COMPARISONS
In deciding whether a company should be included in our peer group, the Committee generally considered the following screening
criteria:

revenue;

•
• market capitalization;
• historical growth rates;
• primary line of business;
• whether the company has a recognizable and well-regarded brand; and
• whether we compete with the company for talent, particularly in the competitive Bay Area labor market.

For each member of the peer group, one or more of the factors listed above was relevant for inclusion in the group, and, similarly,
one or more of these factors may not have been relevant for inclusion in the group. In addition, although some of our peer group
members may be larger than the Company in terms of revenue or market capitalization, the Committee has determined to include
such companies as peer group members where such peer companies compete with the Company for talent, particularly in the
competitive Bay Area labor market.

2017 Annual Report / 2018 Proxy Statement

Compensation Discussion and Analysis

47

In considering our executive compensation program for 2017 and going forward, the Committee considered the peer group used in
measuring performance plans, as well as its goals of rewarding performance and retaining core top talent. Traditionally, companies
compare their performance against the performance of a group of companies whose business models are relatively similar to those
of the company. Executive compensation programs are generally designed to reward performance that is relatively stronger than
that of its peers. Executive compensation programs are also generally designed to roughly parallel the programs of members of the
performance peer group because employees have historically been recruited by these competitors and we compete against them
for talent.

Our peer group consists generally of “technology” companies and “financial” companies. This is intended to provide the Committee
with insight into the differences across these two sectors in which we generally compete for executive talent. Our peer group for
2017 is composed of 12 technology companies, which generally reflect the companies with which we directly compete for talent,
and eight financial companies, which generally reflect the companies with which we not only compete for talent but also to which
we more closely compare our financial performance. This is the same peer group that was used for evaluating 2016 compensation
decisions except for the removal of LinkedIn, Inc. because it was acquired by Microsoft. These companies are as follows:

Compensation Discussion and Analysis

STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES
Our Board has adopted robust stock ownership guidelines to better align the interests of our non-employee directors and
executive officers with the interests of our stockholders and further promote our commitment to sound corporate governance. In
January 2017, our Board approved revised stock ownership guidelines to align with changes to our executive leadership structure
and to further emphasize the alignment of the interests of the newly promoted executive vice presidents with the interests of our
stockholders. Under these guidelines, our executive officers are required to achieve ownership of our common stock valued at a
multiple of their annual base salary:

• CEO — six times base salary
• EVPs — three times base salary

It is expected that each executive officer will meet his or her applicable guideline level within five years of his or her appointment
to his or her position. Our stock ownership guidelines are available on our investor relations website at https://investor.paypal-
corp.com/corporate-governance.cfm.

Prior to our executive officers satisfying their applicable guideline level, they are required to retain an amount equal to 25% of the
net shares of our common stock received as the result of the exercise, vesting or payment of any equity awards granted to them.

Our non-employee directors are also subject to our stock ownership guidelines. The guideline level for each non-employee director
is five times his or her annual retainer (excluding any additional retainer paid as a result of service as a Board chair, lead
independent director, committee chair or committee member). Our non-employee directors are required to satisfy their guideline
level within five years of joining the Board, and are expected to continuously own sufficient shares to satisfy the guideline once it is
attained for as long as they remain a Board member.

Shares that count towards satisfaction of the stock ownership guidelines for our non-employee directors and executive officers
include the following:

•

shares owned outright by the director or executive officer, or his or her immediate family members residing in the same
household;
shares held in trust for the benefit of the director or executive officer, or his or her immediate family members; and

•
• vested deferred stock units, deferred restricted stock units or deferred performance stock units that may only be settled in

shares of our common stock.

HEDGING AND PLEDGING POLICY
Our insider trading policy prohibits members of our Board and executive officers from entering into any hedging or monetization
transactions relating to our securities or otherwise trading in any instrument relating to the future price of our securities, such as a
put or call option, futures contract, short sale, collar, or other derivative security. Our policy also prohibits the members of our
Board and executive officers from pledging our common stock as collateral for any loans.

CLAWBACK POLICY
The Committee has adopted a clawback policy that covers each officer employed as a vice president or in a more senior position
(who we refer to as “covered employees”), and applies to incentive compensation, which includes any cash incentive award, equity-
based award, or other incentive compensation award paid or awarded to any covered employee during the period in which he or
she is designated as a covered employee. For all covered employees, the occurrence of either of the following events will trigger the
policy: (a) an action or omission by the covered employee that constitutes a material violation of our Code of Business Conduct, or
(b) an action or omission by the covered employee that results in material financial or reputational harm to the Company. In
addition, for covered employees that are employed as a senior vice president (or in a more senior position) or as a vice president
who is a member of the finance function, the following event will also trigger the policy: a material restatement of all or a portion of
our financial statements that is the result of a supervisory or other failure by the covered employee.

Under the clawback policy, the Committee has the authority and discretion to determine whether an event covered by the policy
has occurred and, depending on the facts and circumstances, may require the full or partial forfeiture and/or repayment of any
incentive compensation covered by the policy that was paid or awarded to a covered employee. The forfeiture and/or repayment
may include all or any portion of the following:

• any incentive compensation that is greater than the amount that would have been paid to the covered employee had the

covered event been known;

• any outstanding or unpaid incentive compensation, whether vested or unvested, that was awarded to the covered employee;

and

2017 Annual Report / 2018 Proxy Statement

Compensation Discussion and Analysis

49

• any incentive compensation that was paid to or received by the covered employee (including gains realized through the

exercise of stock options) during the 12-month period preceding the date on which we had actual knowledge of the covered
event or the full impact of the covered event was known, or such longer period of time as may be required by any applicable
statute or government regulation.

TAX AND ACCOUNTING CONSIDERATIONS
As a publicly traded company, we are limited by Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code to a deduction for federal income tax
purposes of up to $1 million of compensation paid to our CEO and certain of our other most highly compensated executive officers
in a taxable year. Historically, compensation above $1 million could be deducted only if, by meeting certain technical requirements,
it can be classified as “performance-based compensation.” Although the Committee has historically used the requirements of
Section 162(m) as a guideline, deductibility is not the sole factor it considers in assessing the appropriate levels and types of
executive compensation. The Committee expressly retains the full discretion to forgo deductibility when it believes doing so is in
our and our stockholders’ best interests.

We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, which requires us to recognize compensation
expense for share-based payments (including stock options, restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units and
other forms of equity compensation). The impact of FASB ASC Topic 718 has been taken into account by the Committee in
determining to use a portfolio approach to our equity awards.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT
The Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K
with management. Based on its review and discussions, the Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation
Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and incorporated by reference into the Company’s 2017 Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

FASB ASC Topic 718. The grant date fair value of RSUs is determined using the fair value of the underlying common stock on the grant date. The assumptions used by
the Company in calculating the grant date fair value of the stock awards are incorporated herein by reference to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements
contained in the Company’s 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The estimated fair value of PBRSUs is calculated based on the probable outcome of the performance
measures for the applicable performance period as of the date on which the awards are granted for accounting purposes. Assuming the highest level of performance is
achieved under the applicable performance measures for the 2017-2019 PBRSUs and the 2017 AIP PBRSUs, the maximum possible value of the awards using the fair
value of the underlying common stock on the date that the awards were granted for accounting purposes is presented below:

incremental cost of providing the perquisite or other benefit to our NEOs, net of any amounts reimbursed by our NEOs, and are valued based on the amounts accrued for
payment or paid to the service provider or NEO, as applicable. See “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Compensation Framework—Other Compensation Elements” for

1 The amounts shown represent potential non-equity incentive plan awards under the individual performance portion of the 2017 AIP. Maximum amounts represent
200% of the NEO’s target bonus opportunity under the 2017 AIP. For a more complete description of the 2017 AIP, see “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—
Compensation Framework—Incentive (Performance-Based Compensation) for 2017.”
2 The amounts shown in the 2017 AIP – PBRSU row represent the AIP PBRSUs granted in 2017 under the PayPal Holdings, Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Award Plan (the “2015
Plan”) for the Company performance portion of the 2017 AIP. Amounts shown in the “threshold” column represent 25% of the target number of shares, which represents
the threshold performance of one of the two performance metrics. Awards are capped at the maximum of 200% of the target number of shares. The 2017 AIP PBRSUs
vested on February 15, 2018 based on continued service through such date and performance from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017. For a more complete
description of the 2017 AIP, see “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Compensation Framework—Incentive (Performance-Based Compensation) for 2017.”
The amounts shown in the 2017-2019 PBRSUs row represent the 2017-2019 PBRSUs granted in 2017 under the 2015 Plan. Amounts shown in the “threshold” column
represent 25% of the target number of shares, which represents the threshold performance of one of the two performance metrics. Awards are capped at the maximum
of 200% of the target number of shares. The 2017-2019 PBRSUs will vest based on performance over the 2017-2019 performance period. See “Compensation Discussion
and Analysis—Compensation Framework—Incentive (Performance-Based) Compensation for 2017—Long-Term Incentive Components—Performance-Based
Restricted Stock Units (PBRSUs)” for more information.

Compensation Tables

3 The amounts shown represent service-based RSUs granted in 2017 under the 2015 Plan. Other than Mr. Ready’s grant of 388,140 RSUs, these RSUs become fully
vested over three years, with 33 1/3% vesting on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. Mr. Ready’s grant of 388,140 RSUs becomes fully vested
after four years, with 50% vesting on the second anniversary of the date of grant and 25% vesting on each of the third and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant. See
“Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Compensation Framework—No Performance Determinations Related to Previously Awarded PBRSUs in 2017—Restricted
Stock Units” for more information.
4 Represents the grant date fair value determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. For stock awards, the grant date was calculated by multiplying the closing
price of the underlying common stock on the date of grant by the number of stock awards granted. For the 2017 AIP PBRSUs and the 2017-2019 PBRSUs, the grant date
fair value assumes the probable outcome of the performance conditions applicable thereto. See footnote 1 to the “2017 Summary Compensation Table” for more
information. The assumptions used by the Company in calculating the grant date fair value of the stock awards are incorporated herein by reference to Note 16 to the
consolidated financial statements contained in the Company’s 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

2017 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation
All NEOs are eligible to participate in the PayPal Holdings, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the “DCP”); however, none of our
NEOs participated in the DCP in 2017.

The DCP is a non-qualified voluntary deferred compensation plan that allows participants to defer certain amounts of
compensation. The DCP provides a supplement to our 401(k) Plan and permits personal savings beyond the IRS contribution
limits on qualified plans. All amounts deferred under the DCP are reflected in book-keeping accounts. Each participant is
permitted to elect to defer annually, in any whole percentages: (i) from 5% to 50% of base salary; (ii) from 5% to 100% of the
incentive award earned by the participant under the AIP; and (iii) from 5% to 100% of RSUs, subject to certain limitations pursuant
to the terms of the DCP and rounded to the nearest whole share. All amounts deferred under the DCP are fully vested. The DCP
has been designed so that federal and state income taxes on the monies deferred are not due until such time as the account
balance is paid to a participant. Participants can elect distribution of their account balances from a given year to be paid to them
while they are still working or they can elect to have payments made to them in the event of their separation from service with us.
Payments can be made in a lump sum payment or as annual installments over a period of greater than two years and less than
fifteen years.

The return on the deferred amounts is linked to the performance of market-based investment choices made available to
participants under the DCP. While the deferred dollars are not actually invested in the investment fund(s), earnings or losses of
the tracking fund are applied to the participant’s deferral dollars as if they were invested in the fund(s). Participants may make
changes to their investment choices daily.

2017 Annual Report / 2018 Proxy Statement

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control
The following table, footnotes, and narrative set forth our payment obligations pursuant to the compensation arrangements for
each of our NEOs, under the circumstances described below, assuming that his or her employment was terminated or a change in
control occurred on December 31, 2017. Because our executive compensation program is heavily weighted towards equity-based
compensation, a significant percentage of the compensation to be received by our NEOs upon a termination of employment under
the circumstances described below relates to the settlement of outstanding equity awards. Please see the 2017 Outstanding
Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End table for further information regarding outstanding equity awards granted to the NEOs in 2017
and in prior years.

1 For Mr. Marino, the amount reflects his retirement-eligibility with respect to the RSUs, as discussed below. Further, pursuant to the PBRSU award agreement
provisions, the PBRSUs will vest on a prorated basis based on the number of full months of service during the performance period and actual performance during the
entire performance period. The estimated value for outstanding PBRSUs, assuming a December 31, 2017 termination and target performance, was $3,807,356.
2 Amounts do not take into account potential reductions due to “best net pay” provisions in respective agreements and the CIC Severance Plan, as more fully discussed
below.
3 Amounts assume cash payments equal to the value of equity awards (and for purposes of column (c) for all NEOs and column (d) for Mr. Marino, target performance
of outstanding PBRSUs), as more fully discussed below.
4 For Mr. Marino, amount reflects the death and disability provisions under the terms of the CIC Severance Plan, as more fully discussed below.

Retirement Benefits for Mr. Marino
Mr. Marino is retirement-eligible under the 2016-2018 PBRSU and 2017-2019 PBRSU award agreements. Pursuant to the PBRSU
award agreement provisions, in the event Mr. Marino voluntarily resigns at a time when he has attained at least 60 years of age
and completed at least five years of service (“Retires”), the PBRSUs will vest on a prorated basis based on the number of full
months of service during the performance period and actual performance during the entire performance period, and settled
following the performance period. Mr. Marino is also eligible for prorated vesting of RSUs. In the event he Retires, Mr. Marino would
receive prorated vesting of the next tranche of RSUs that would have vested following his Retirement.

respective agreements); and
for Mr. Ready, if terminated without “cause,” a cash amount equal to the value of any other equity awards that are outstanding
and unvested as of the date of termination which otherwise would have become vested pursuant to their vesting schedules

Assumptions, as defined in his agreement).

Severance Arrangements for Involuntary Termination Other than for Cause for Participants in the PayPal Holdings, Inc. SVP and
Above Standard Severance Plan
As of the end of fiscal 2017, Mr. Marino was eligible to participate in the PayPal Holdings, Inc. SVP and Above Standard Severance
Plan (the “Severance Plan”).

The Severance Plan provides eligible employees with severance payments and benefits in the event that an eligible employee’s
employment with us or one of our subsidiaries, affiliates or a successor company is involuntarily terminated without “cause” (as
defined in the Severance Plan) by us outside of the “change in control period” (as defined above), subject to the employee’s
execution of a release of claims, as follows:

• a cash payment equal to one times the sum of (a) annual base salary and (b) target bonus amount;
• a Prorated Cash Incentive Award;
•

if the NEO is employed by the Company in the U.S., participates in the Company’s health insurance plan and is eligible to
continue to participate in the plan under COBRA, such NEO will receive a lump sum cash payment equal to the product of
(i) the monthly premium payable by the NEO for himself (and his eligible dependents) under the Company’s health insurance
plan in which he participates immediately prior to the employment termination date and (ii) 24;

• accelerated vesting of time-based equity awards that would have otherwise become vested pursuant to their ordinary vesting

•

•

schedule within the 12 months following the employment termination date, settled in a lump sum, through vesting of stock,
payment of cash in lieu of vesting shares of stock, or a combination thereof;
for performance-based equity awards, any such award will remain outstanding and eligible to vest, based solely on the
achievement of the Company performance targets upon which the awards are subject for any performance period that ends
within the first anniversary of the NEO’s employment termination date; and to the extent such performance targets are
determined to have been achieved following the completion of the performance period, the NEO will be treated as though
immediately vested in that percentage of the resulting amount of such equity award that would, on or prior to such first
anniversary, have otherwise become vested pursuant to the existing vesting schedule that would have applied to such equity
awards, to be settled in lump sum, through vesting of stock, payment of cash in lieu of vesting shares of stock, or a combination
thereof; and
in the event the Company elects to settle any such equity awards through the payment of cash in lieu of vesting shares of
stock, the Company will pay the NEO a lump sum cash amount equal to the value of all of the equity awards that are treated as
though vested in accordance with the foregoing bullet points (where value is determined using the Average Closing Price).

CHANGE IN CONTROL (COLUMN (c))
Severance Arrangements for an Involuntary Termination in Connection with a Change in Control for Messrs. Schulman, Rainey and
Ready and Ms. Pentland
Each of Messrs. Schulman, Rainey, and Ready and Ms. Pentland would be entitled to receive the following under their respective
agreements if a “change in control” (as defined in the 2015 Plan) occurred as of December 31, 2017 and his or her employment with
us was terminated within the “change in control period,” either (a) by us for any reason other than “cause,” “disability” or death or
(b) by the executive for “good reason” (as each term is defined in the respective agreements), subject to the executive’s execution
of a release of claims:

• Agreement Severance Payment; provided, however, that Ms. Pentland and Mr. Ready would be eligible to receive a cash

payment equal to two times the sum of (a) annual base salary, and (b) target bonus amount;

• Prorated Cash Incentive Award; and
• a cash payment equal to the value of all unvested equity awards outstanding (where value is determined using the Average

Closing Price and the Valuation Assumptions).

Under each respective agreement, in the event any payments or benefits constitute “golden parachute payments” within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) and would be subject to the excise tax imposed by IRC
Section 4999, such payments or benefits will be reduced to the maximum amount that does not result in the imposition of such
excise tax, but only if such reduction results in the executive receiving a higher net-after tax amount than such executive would
have received absent such reduction (the “best net pay” provision).

Severance Arrangements for an Involuntary Termination in Connection with a Change in Control for Participants in the PayPal
Holdings, Inc. Change in Control Severance Plan for Key Employees
As of the end of fiscal 2017, Mr. Marino was eligible to participate in the PayPal Holdings, Inc. Change in Control Severance Plan for
Key Employees (the “CIC Severance Plan”). Under the terms of the CIC Severance Plan, Mr. Marino would have been entitled to
receive the following if a “change in control” (as defined in the 2015 Plan) occurred as of December 31, 2017 and his employment
with us is terminated within the “change in control period,” either (a) by us for any reason other than “cause,” “disability” or death
or (b) by the executive for “good reason” (as each of those terms is defined in the CIC Severance Plan), subject to the executive’s
execution of a release of claims:

• a lump sum cash payment of the annual cash bonus that the executive would have earned assuming achievement of target

performance, as applicable in respect of the fiscal year in which the termination occurs; except, if the employee’s bonus is
intended to constitute performance-based compensation within the meaning of IRC Section 162(m), the bonus will be paid
based on actual company performance through the date of termination;

• a lump sum cash payment equal to the product of (a) the sum of the executive’s base salary (in effect upon the occurrence of

•

•

the termination event) and target bonus (for the bonus year in which the separation occurs), and (b) two;
if the employee is employed by the Company in the U.S., participates in the Company’s health insurance plan and is eligible to
continue to participate in the plan under COBRA, such NEO will receive a lump sum cash payment equal to the product of
(i) the monthly premium payable by the NEO for himself (and his eligible dependents) under the Company’s health insurance
plan in which he participates immediately prior to the employment termination date and (ii) 48; and
the eligible employee’s unvested time-vested equity awards will be treated as fully vested. If the termination occurs during a
performance period with respect to an award of PBRSUs, such award will be deemed earned assuming achievement of target
performance for purposes of determining the number of awards that will be treated as becoming immediately vested; however, if
the employee’s awards are intended to constitute performance-based compensation subject to IRC Section 162(m), such awards
will remain outstanding and only be treated as becoming fully vested if and to the extent that they otherwise would have
become earned based on actual company performance through the end of the applicable performance period. Settlement of the
awards will be through either the vesting of common stock under the award or, in lieu thereof, payment in cash or a combination
thereof, at our discretion. In general, if a cash payment is made in lieu of vesting an award, the value of the unvested award is
determined using the average closing price of our common stock for the 10 consecutive trading days ending on and including the
trading day immediately prior to the date of separation or at the end of the performance period, as applicable.

The payment of all of the benefits described above will be within 90 days following the termination of employment, except as
noted above.

Under the CIC Severance Plan, in the event any payments or benefits constitute “golden parachute payments” within the meaning
of IRC Section 280G and would be subject to the excise tax imposed by IRC Section 4999, such payments or benefits will be reduced
to the maximum amount that does not result in the imposition of such excise tax, but only if such reduction results in the officer
receiving a higher net-after tax amount than such officer would have received absent such reduction (the “best net pay” provision).

Change in Control—Equity Awards
PayPal has not entered into any arrangements with any of its NEOs to provide “single trigger” change in control payments. The
2015 Plan generally provides for the acceleration of vesting of awards granted under the plans upon a change in control (as defined
in the applicable plan) only if the acquiring entity does not agree to assume or continue the awards. Under the terms of the 2015
Plan, for purposes of determining payouts in connection with or following a change in control, PBRSU performance will be based on
applicable performance metrics through the date of change in control. These provisions generally apply to all holders of awards
under the equity incentive plans.

DEATH OR DISABILITY (COLUMN (d))
Severance Arrangements in the Event of Death or Disability
Under the terms of the respective agreements of Messrs. Schulman, Rainey and Ready and Ms. Pentland, if such executive’s
employment terminates due to his or her death or disability, he or she will be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the value
of any unvested equity awards that would have otherwise vested within 24 months of his or her termination date (where value is
determined using the Average Closing Price and the Valuation Assumptions).

Under the terms of the Severance Plan, Mr. Marino will be entitled to accelerated vesting of any unvested equity awards that
would have otherwise vested within 24 months of the termination date. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, if the termination
date occurs during the performance period of a performance-based equity award, then such award will be deemed to be fully
earned assuming achievement at target. In the event the Company elects to settle any such awards through the payment of cash
in lieu of vesting shares of stock, the Company will pay a lump sum cash amount equal to the value of all of the equity awards that
are treated as though vested in accordance with the foregoing (where value is determined using the Average Closing Price).

Under the terms of the CIC Severance Plan, if Mr. Marino dies or becomes disabled at any time during the change in control period,
his unvested equity awards will be treated as fully vested and be settled in the same manner as described above in “Severance
Arrangements for an Involuntary Termination in Connection with a Change in Control for Participants in the PayPal Holdings, Inc.
Change in Control Severance Plan for Key Employees.”

CEO Pay Ratio Disclosure

CEO Pay Ratio Disclosure

We are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of Mr. Schulman, our CEO, to
the median of the annual total compensation of our employees, which we refer to as the “pay ratio.” We believe that the pay ratio
disclosed below is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. SEC rules for
identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to apply various methodologies and assumptions
and, as a result, the pay ratio reported by us may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies.

For 2017, our last completed fiscal year, the median of the annual total compensation of the Company’s employees (other than our
CEO) was $70,228, and the annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the “Total” column of the “2017 Summary
Compensation Table” elsewhere in this Proxy Statement, was $19,218,634.

Based on this information, for 2017, we estimate that the pay ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of
the annual total compensation of our employees is 274:1.

Methodology for Determining Our Median Employee
We selected December 31, 2017 (the last day of our fiscal year) as the date for identifying our median employee. As of that date, we
compiled compensation information for all of our employees worldwide, except that we excluded employees of Swift Financial
(representing approximately 230 employees), which we acquired in September 2017. For purposes of identifying the median
employee from our global employee population, we compared the amount of base salary, allowances, short-term incentives and
other bonuses paid during 2017 and the intended grant value related to any long-term incentive equity awards granted during
2017, as reflected in our global human resource and equity management systems. The elements in this compensation measure are
representative of the principal forms of compensation delivered to our employees. We identified our median employee using this
compensation measure, which was consistently applied to all employees included in the calculation.

Once we identified our median employee, we identified and calculated the elements of that employee’s compensation for 2017 in
accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in annual total compensation of $70,228. For
the annual total compensation of our CEO, we used the amount reported in the “Total” column of our “2017 Summary
Compensation Table” elsewhere in this Proxy Statement.

Proposal 3

Proposal 3 — Approval of the Amended and Restated
2015 Equity Incentive Award Plan

We are seeking stockholder approval to amend and restate our 2015 Equity Incentive Award Plan (the “2015 Plan”) to increase the
number of shares of Common Stock of the Company (the “Shares”) reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan by an additional
37 million Shares. We believe that our continuing ability to offer equity incentive awards under the 2015 Plan is critical to our ability
to attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel, particularly as we grow and in light of the highly competitive market for
employee talent in which we operate. The proposed amendments to the 2015 Plan also:

•
•

•
•
•

take into account the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the impact on Section 162(m);
revise the minimum vesting provision to reflect that no portion of any awards granted under the 2015 Plan following the Annual
Meeting shall vest before the one-year anniversary of the date of grant, with certain limited exceptions (the previous minimum
vesting provision applied only to full value awards and allowed awards to become vested on one or more vesting dates over a
period of not less than three years, or in the case of vesting based on attainment of performance based objectives, over a period
of not less than one year measured from the commencement of the period over which performance is evaluated);
revise to provide that dividend payments may not be made prior to vesting for all award types;
revise the definition of “Effective Date” under the 2015 Plan to be the date the Plan was last approved by our stockholders; and
revise various other provisions related to the administration and interpretation of the 2015 Plan.

The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to approve this proposal. The Board,
upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, has approved the amended and restated 2015 Plan, including the
increase of Shares reserved for issuance, subject to stockholder approval, and recommends that stockholders vote in favor of this
proposal at the Annual Meeting.

If our stockholders approve this proposal, the amended and restated 2015 Plan, including the increase of Shares reserved for
issuance, will become effective as of the date of stockholder approval. If our stockholders do not approve this proposal, the
amended and restated 2015 Plan and Share increase will not take effect, and our 2015 Plan will continue to be administered in its
current form. Our executive officers and directors have an interest in this proposal by virtue of their being eligible to receive equity
awards under the 2015 Plan. References to the 2015 Plan in the remainder of this discussion refer to the amended and restated
2015 Plan as if this proposal is approved by our stockholders, unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise references the
2015 Plan prior to it being amended and restated.

Increasing the Number of Shares Reserved for Issuance under the 2015 Plan
BACKGROUND
The 2015 Plan was initially adopted by the Board in June 2015 and approved by the Company’s sole stockholder (eBay Inc.) prior to
the Separation. In March 2016, the Board approved an amendment and restatement of the 2015 Plan, which among other items,
modified the plan terms with respect to minimum vesting, revised the “fungible share” ratio, and added a director limit on annual
equity awards, but did not increase the number of Shares available under the 2015 Plan. At our 2016 annual meeting held in May
2016, our stockholders approved the amendment and restatement of the 2015 Plan.

As described in more detail below, the initial Share reserve under the 2015 Plan was 108 million Shares.

SHARES AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE AWARDS
As of April 3, 2018, approximately 34,172,172 Shares remained available for grant under the 2015 Plan. The Board believes that
additional Shares are necessary to meet the Company’s anticipated equity compensation needs. Following the proposed Share
increase, we expect that Shares under the 2015 Plan will last approximately three to four years. This estimate is based on a forecast
that takes into account our anticipated hiring needs and an estimated range of our stock price over time.

REASONS FOR VOTING FOR THE PROPOSAL
Long-Term Equity is a Key Component of our Compensation Objective
Our comprehensive equity incentive program is designed to enable the Company to attract, retain and reward our employees,
non-employee directors and other persons providing services to the Company and its subsidiaries. The Board also believes that
equity compensation is essential to link executive compensation with long-term stockholder value creation. Equity compensation
represents a significant portion of the compensation package for our key employees. Since our equity awards generally vest over
several years, the value ultimately realized from these awards depends on the value of our Shares at the time of vesting. We
strongly believe that granting equity awards motivates employees to think and act like owners, rewarding them when value is
created for stockholders.

2017 Annual Report / 2018 Proxy Statement

Proposal 3

61

We Manage Our Equity Incentive Program Thoughtfully
We manage our long-term stockholder dilution by closely managing the number of equity awards granted annually. We grant what
we believe is an appropriate amount of equity necessary to attract, reward and retain employees. Our three-year average burn
rate, which we define as the number of Shares subject to equity awards granted under the 2015 Plan in a fiscal year divided by the
weighted average Shares outstanding for that fiscal year, was 1.45% for fiscal years 2015 through 2017.

As of April 3, 2018, equity awards outstanding under our equity plans were approximately: 1,469,694 stock options, 0 restricted
shares, 25,706,529 restricted stock units and 4,322,547 performance-based restricted stock units (at target). An additional 426,922
stock options, 164,053 restricted stock units, and 46 unvested restricted shares were outstanding under equity awards that had
been assumed in connection with mergers and other corporate transactions as of April 3, 2018. As of April 3, 2018, we had
1,187,180,992 Shares outstanding. Accordingly, excluding our employee stock purchase plan, our approximately 32,074,690
outstanding shares underlying awards (not including awards under our employee stock purchase plan) plus approximately
34,172,172 Shares available for future grant under our equity plans as of April 3, 2018 represented approximately 6% of our Shares
outstanding (commonly referred to as the “overhang”).

As of April 3, 2018, the average weighted per share exercise price of all outstanding stock options (whether granted under our
equity plans or assumed in connection with corporate transactions) was $29.4110 and the weighted average remaining contractual
term was 4.06 years.

The 2015 Plan Incorporates Good Compensation and Governance Practices

• Administration. The 2015 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board, which is comprised entirely of

independent non-employee directors.

• Minimum vesting for equity awards. The 2015 Plan provides that no portion of any award granted under the 2015 Plan

following the Annual Meeting may vest before the one-year anniversary of the date of grant. The foregoing is subject to a 5%
carve-out, as discussed in further detail below.

• Stockholder approval is required for additional Shares. The 2015 Plan does not contain an annual “evergreen” provision but
instead reserves a fixed maximum number of Shares for issuance. Stockholder approval is required to increase that number.

• Explicit prohibition on repricing without stockholder approval. The 2015 Plan prohibits the repricing, cash-out or other

exchange of underwater stock options and stock appreciation rights without prior stockholder approval.

• No discounted stock options or stock appreciation rights. The 2015 Plan requires that stock options and stock appreciation

rights issued under it must have an exercise price equal to at least the fair market value of a Share on the date the award is
granted, except in certain situations in which we are assuming or replacing options granted by another company that we are
acquiring.

• No dividends paid on awards prior to vest and no dividend equivalents on options or stock appreciation rights. The 2015

Plan provides that dividends credited or payable or dividend equivalents in connection with any award granted under the 2015
Plan are subject to the same restrictions as the underlying award and will not be paid until the underlying award vests. Further,
no dividend equivalents are payable with respect to options or stock appreciation rights.

• Share counting provisions. In general, when awards granted under the 2015 Plan expire or are canceled without having been

fully exercised, or are settled in cash, the Shares reserved for those awards are returned to the Share reserve and become
available for future awards. If Shares are tendered to us or withheld by us to satisfy an award’s tax withholding obligations or
pay a stock option’s or stock appreciation right’s exercise price, those Shares do not become available for future awards.

• Full-value awards count more heavily in reducing the 2015 Plan share reserve. The 2015 Plan uses a “fungible share” concept,

under which stock options and stock appreciation rights reduce the Share reserve on a 0.5 for 1 basis, and full-value awards,
such as restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units, and performance shares reduce the Share reserve on a one
for one basis.

• Limited transferability. In general, awards may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered, either

voluntarily or by operation of law, unless otherwise approved by the Board or a committee of the Board administering the 2015
Plan.

• Annual limits on non-employee director awards. The 2015 Plan limits the value of equity that may be granted under

non-employee director awards each fiscal year.

• No tax gross-ups. The 2015 Plan does not provide for any tax gross-ups.

Summary of the 2015 Plan
The following is a summary of the operation and principal features of the 2015 Plan. The summary is qualified in its entirety by the
2015 Plan as set forth in Appendix A.

PURPOSE
The Compensation Committee and the Board believe that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to
provide, through the 2015 Plan, a comprehensive equity incentive program designed to enable the Company to attract, retain and
reward employees, non-employee directors and other persons providing services to the Company. The Board also believes that
equity compensation is essential to link executive compensation with long-term stockholder value creation. Equity compensation

Proposal 3

represents a significant portion of the compensation package for our key employees. We strongly believe that granting equity
awards motivates employees to think and act like owners, rewarding them when value is created for stockholders.

AUTHORIZED SHARES
Under the 2015 Plan, 108 million Shares are authorized for issuance. We are asking our stockholders to approve an additional
37 million Shares to be available for issuance under the 2015 Plan, which will increase the aggregate authorized number of Shares
authorized under the 2015 Plan to 145 million. As of April 3, 2018, we had approximately 34,172,172 Shares available for issuance
under the 2015 Plan. The closing price of a Share on NASDAQ on April 3, 2018 was $74.56 per share.

SHARE RESERVE REDUCTION AND SHARE RECYCLING
Any Shares subject to stock options or stock appreciation rights are counted against the 2015 Plan Share reserve as 0.5 Share for
every one Share subject to the award. Any Shares subject to awards granted under the 2015 Plan other than options or stock
appreciation rights (i.e., full value awards, including restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units, and performance
shares) are counted against the 2015 Plan Share reserve as one Share for every one Share subject thereto.

If any award granted under the 2015 Plan expires or becomes unexercisable without having been exercised in full, is surrendered, or
is forfeited to or repurchased by the Company due to failure to vest, the unpurchased or forfeited or repurchased Shares subject to
such award become available for future grant or sale under the 2015 Plan.

Shares used to satisfy tax withholding obligations relating to an award or pay the exercise price or purchase price of an option or
stock appreciation right do not become available for future issuance under the 2015 Plan.

ADJUSTMENTS TO SHARES SUBJECT TO THE 2015 PLAN
Certain transactions with our stockholders not involving our receipt of consideration, such as a stock split, spin-off, stock dividend,
or certain recapitalizations, may affect the price of our Shares (these transactions are referred to collectively as “equity
restructurings”). In the event that an equity restructuring occurs, the Compensation Committee or the Board will equitably adjust
the class of shares issuable and the maximum number of shares of our stock subject to the 2015 Plan, as well as the maximum
number of shares that may be issued to an employee during any calendar year, and will equitably adjust outstanding awards as to
the class, number of shares, and price per share of our stock. Other types of transactions may also affect our Shares, such as a
dividend or other distribution, reorganization, merger, or other changes in corporate structure. In the event that there is such a
transaction, which is not an equity restructuring, and the Compensation Committee or the Board determines that an adjustment
to the plan and any outstanding awards would be appropriate to prevent any dilution or enlargement of benefits under the 2015
Plan, the Compensation Committee or the Board will equitably adjust the 2015 Plan as to the class of shares issuable and the
maximum number of shares of our stock subject to the 2015 Plan, as well as the maximum number of shares that may be issued to
an employee during any calendar year, and will adjust any outstanding awards as to the class, number of shares, and price per
share of our stock in such manner as it may deem equitable.

ADMINISTRATION
The Compensation Committee has the exclusive authority to administer the 2015 Plan, including the power to determine
eligibility, the types and sizes of awards, the price and timing of awards, the acceleration or waiver of any vesting restriction, and
the authority to delegate such administrative responsibilities.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Compensation Committee may delegate to a committee of one or more of our
directors or one or more of our officers the authority to grant or amend awards to participants other than our senior executives
who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Pursuant to this provision, our Compensation Committee’s current practice is
to delegate to our Chief Executive Officer, as a member of the Board, the authority to determine and make individual grants to our
employees who are not subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Unless otherwise determined by the Board, the Compensation
Committee shall consist solely of two or more members of the Board, each of whom is a non-employee director under the
Exchange Act, and an “independent director” under the rules of NASDAQ (or other principal securities market on which shares of
our common stock are traded).

ELIGIBILITY
Awards may be granted to employees, directors and consultants of the Company and employees and consultants of any subsidiary
of the Company. Incentive stock options may be granted only to employees who, as of the time of grant, are employees of the
Company or any subsidiary corporation of the Company. As of April 3, 2018, there were approximately 19,000 employees, including
seven executive officers and ten non-employee directors eligible to be granted awards under the 2015 Plan. While consultants to
the Company are eligible to participate in the 2015 Plan, the Company’s current practice is to not grant equity awards to
consultants, except in certain limited cases.

Proposal 3

STOCK OPTIONS
Stock options, including incentive stock options as defined under IRC Section 422 and non-qualified stock options, may be granted
pursuant to the 2015 Plan. The option exercise price of all stock options granted pursuant to the 2015 Plan will not be less than
100% of the fair market value of a Share on the date of grant. Stock options may be exercised as determined by the Compensation
Committee, but in no event may a stock option have a term extending beyond ten years from the date of grant.

Incentive stock options granted to any person who owns, as of the date of grant, stock possessing more than ten percent of the
total combined voting power of all classes of our stock, however, will have an exercise price that is not less than 110% of the fair
market value of a Share on the date of grant and may not have a term extending beyond the fifth anniversary of the date of grant.
The aggregate fair market value of a Share with respect to which options intended to be incentive stock options are exercisable for
the first time by an employee in any calendar year may not exceed $100,000 or such other amount as the IRC provides.

The Compensation Committee determines the methods by which an option holder may pay the exercise price of an option or the
related taxes, including, without limitation: (1) cash, (2) Shares (including, in the case of payment of the exercise price of an award,
Shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of the award) having a fair market value on the date of delivery equal to the aggregate
payments required, or (3) other property acceptable to the Compensation Committee (including through the delivery of a notice
that the award holder has placed a market sell order with a broker with respect to Shares then issuable upon exercise or vesting of
an award, and that the broker has been directed to pay a sufficient portion of the net proceeds of the sale to us in satisfaction of
the aggregate payments required; provided that payment of such proceeds is then made to us upon settlement of that sale).
However, no participant who is a member of the Board or an “executive officer” of the Company within the meaning of
Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act will be permitted to pay the exercise price of an option in any method which would violate the
prohibitions on loans made or arranged by us as set forth in Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act.

RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS
Restricted stock may be granted pursuant to the 2015 Plan. A restricted stock award is the grant of Shares at a price determined
by the Compensation Committee, that is nontransferable and may be subject to substantial risk of forfeiture until specific
conditions are met. Conditions may be based on continuing employment or achieving performance goals. During the period of
restriction, participants holding shares of restricted stock may have full voting and dividend rights with respect to such shares;
provided, however, that any dividends will be subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying shares of restricted stock.
The restrictions will lapse in accordance with a schedule or other conditions determined by the Compensation Committee.

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS
Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) may be granted pursuant to the 2015 Plan. An RSU award provides for the issuance of common
stock at a future date upon the satisfaction of specific performance conditions as set forth in the applicable award agreement and/
or subject to continuing employment as set forth in the applicable award agreement. The vesting and maturity dates will be
established at the time of grant and may provide for the deferral of receipt of the common stock beyond the vesting date. On or
following the maturity date, we will transfer to the participant one unrestricted, fully transferable share of common stock for each
RSU scheduled to be paid out and not previously forfeited (subject to applicable tax withholding requirements).

STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
Stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) may be granted pursuant to the 2015 Plan. The exercise price of all SARs granted pursuant to
the 2015 Plan will not be less than 100% of the fair market value of a Share on the date of grant. SARs may be exercised as
determined by the Compensation Committee, but in no event may an SAR have a term extending beyond ten years from the date
of grant.

ADDITIONAL AWARDS
The other types of equity awards that may be granted under the 2015 Plan include performance share units, performance shares,
deferred stock units, dividend equivalents, and other stock-based awards. Notwithstanding anything in the 2015 Plan to the
contrary, dividend equivalents will be subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying awards to which the dividend
equivalents relate. No dividend equivalents may be payable with respect to stock options or SARs.

PERFORMANCE BONUS AWARDS
Performance bonus awards may be granted pursuant to the 2015 Plan. Performance bonus awards are cash bonuses payable upon
the attainment of pre-established performance goals based on established performance criteria. The goals are established and
evaluated by the Compensation Committee and may relate to performance over any periods as determined by the Compensation
Committee.

PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS
The Compensation Committee may grant performance-based awards under the 2015 Plan. Under the 2015 Plan, these
performance-based awards may be either equity awards or performance bonus awards. Participants are entitled to receive
payment for a performance-based award for any given performance period only to the extent that pre-established performance
goals set by the Compensation Committee for the period are satisfied.

Proposal 3

Pre-established performance goals may include, without limitation, any one or more of the following types of performance criteria:

trading volume;

•
• users;
• customers;
•
•
• operating income;
• EBITDA and/or net earnings (either before or after interest,

total payment volume;
revenue;

taxes, depreciation and amortization);

return on net assets;
return on gross assets;
return on equity;
return on invested capital;
stock price;

• net income (either before or after taxes);
• earnings per share;
• earnings as determined other than pursuant to GAAP;
• multiples of price to earnings;
• multiples of price/earnings to growth;
•
•
•
•
•
• cash flow (including operating cash flow and free cash flow);
• net or operating margins;
• economic profit;
•
•
• employee productivity;
• market share;
• volume;
• customer satisfaction metrics;
• net sales;
• expense levels;
•

stock price appreciation;
total stockholder returns;

regulatory achievements (including submitting or filing
applications or other documents with regulatory authorities
or receiving approval of any such applications or other
documents, passing pre-approval inspections (whether of the
Company or third parties));

•

•

•

sales or licenses of the Company’s assets, including its
intellectual property, whether in a particular jurisdiction or
territory or globally, or through partnering transactions;
implementation, completion or attainment of objectives
with respect to research, development, commercialization,
products or projects, production volume levels,
acquisitions and divestitures and recruiting and
maintaining personnel;
financing and other capital raising transactions (including
sales of the Company’s equity or debt securities, factoring
transactions);

• product revenue growth;
• gross profit;
•

•

financial ratios, including those measuring liquidity,
activity, profitability or leverage, cost of capital or assets
under management;
strategic partnerships or transactions (including
in-licensing and out-licensing of intellectual property,
establishing relationships with commercial entities with
respect to the marketing, distribution and sale of the
Company’s products (including with group purchasing
organizations, distributors and other vendors);

• co-development, co-marketing, profit sharing, joint

venture or other similar arrangements;

• economic value-added models or equivalent metrics;
• debt reduction;
•
• year-end cash;
• working capital levels, including cash, inventory and

reductions in costs;

accounts receivable;
research and development achievements;

•
• operating efficiencies; and
• employee engagement/satisfaction metrics.

• gross or cash margins;

Any of the above criteria may be measured with respect to us, or any subsidiary, affiliate, or other business unit of ours, either in
absolute terms, terms of growth, or as compared to any incremental increase and as compared to results of a peer group, and may
be calculated on a pro forma basis or in accordance with GAAP. The Compensation Committee defines the manner of calculating
the performance criteria it selects to use for such awards. With regard to a particular performance period, the Compensation
Committee will have the discretion to select the length of the performance period, the type of performance-based awards to be
granted, and the goals that will be used to measure the performance for the period. Unless otherwise provided in an award
agreement, a participant will have to be employed by or providing services to the Company on the date the performance-based
award is paid to be eligible for a performance-based award for any period.

LIMITATIONS ON AWARDS TO INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPANTS
The maximum number of Shares that may be subject to one or more awards granted to any one participant pursuant to the 2015
Plan during any calendar year is 2,000,000 Shares, and the maximum amount that may be paid in cash to any employee during
any calendar year with respect to any performance-based award is $3 million. The maximum value of awards granted to
non-employee directors pursuant to the 2015 Plan during any fiscal year is $600,000; provided, however, that the limit set forth in
this sentence is increased to $1,200,000 in the fiscal year in which a non-employee director commences service on the Board and
the limit does not apply to awards made pursuant to a non-employee director’s election to receive an award in lieu of all or a
portion of a cash retainer for service on the Board or any committee thereunder or pursuant to a conversion of an eBay award to a
Company award.

PROHIBITION ON REPRICING
Except for adjustments described in “Adjustments to Shares Subject to the 2015 Plan” above, the Compensation Committee will
not, without stockholder approval, authorize the amendment of any outstanding award to reduce its purchase price per share, the
replacement or substitution of any award for an award having a lesser purchase price per share, or an offer to purchase any
previously granted option or stock appreciation right for a payment in cash when the per share exercise price exceeds the Fair
Market Value of the underlying share.

MINIMUM VESTING
Subject to the acceleration of vesting as permitted under the terms of the 2015 Plan, effective as of the Annual Meeting, no
portion of any award granted under the 2015 Plan shall vest before the one-year anniversary of the date of grant, except that
awards that result in the issuance to one or more participants of up to 5% of the shares of common stock which may be issued or
transferred under the 2015 Plan may be granted without regard to such minimum vesting provisions.

AWARDS SUBJECT TO CLAWBACK
Any incentive awards granted under the 2015 Plan, and any cash or property delivered pursuant to incentive awards, are subject to
forfeiture, recovery, or other action by PayPal as necessary for compliance with any Company policy or as required by law.

TRANSFERABILITY OF AWARDS
Awards granted under the 2015 Plan generally are not transferable, and all rights with respect to an award granted to a participant
generally will be available during a participant’s lifetime only to the participant (or the participant’s guardian or legal
representative).

CHANGE IN CONTROL
A “change in control” generally means a transaction in which any person or group acquires more than 50% of our voting securities,
a change in a majority of the Board over a two-year period that is not approved by at least two-thirds of the incumbent Board
members, a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets, a merger or consolidation in which we are not the
surviving corporation, or a reverse merger in which we are the surviving corporation but the shares of our stock outstanding
immediately preceding the merger are converted by virtue of the merger into other property or the Company’s stockholders
approval of a liquidation or dissolution of the Company.

Outstanding awards do not automatically terminate in the event of a change in control. In the event of a change in control, any
surviving corporation or acquiring corporation must either assume or continue outstanding awards or substitute similar awards. If
it does not do so, the vesting of such awards (and, if applicable, the time during which such awards may be exercised) will be
accelerated in full and all forfeiture restrictions on such awards shall lapse. The unexercised portion of all outstanding awards may
terminate upon the change in control.

If a change in control occurs during a performance period with respect to an outstanding award that vests based on performance
goals or other performance-based objectives, the performance period of the award will end as of the date of the change in control
and the performance goals will be deemed to have been satisfied at the actual level of performance as of the date of the change in
control, as determined by the Compensation Committee, as constituted immediately prior to the change in control, without
proration, and such award, to the extent deemed earned by the Compensation Committee will continue to be subject to time-
based vesting following the change in control in accordance with the original vesting schedule; provided, however, that if the
awards are not converted, assumed or replaced by a successor entity, then immediately prior to the change in control, such award
will become fully vested, as described in the paragraph above.

TERMINATION OR AMENDMENT
The 2015 Plan will automatically terminate ten years from the Effective Date (defined as the date the 2015 Plan is last approved by
the Company’s stockholders), unless terminated at an earlier time by the Administrator. The Administrator may terminate or
amend the 2015 Plan at any time, subject to stockholder approval for any amendment (i) to the extent necessary and desirable to
comply with any applicable law, regulation, or stock exchange rule, (ii) to increase the number of shares available under the 2015
Plan, (iii) to permit the Compensation Committee or the Board to grant options with a price below fair market value on the date of
grant, or (iv) to extend the exercise period for an option or stock appreciation right beyond ten years from the date of grant. No
termination or amendment may adversely affect in any material respect any Award previously granted pursuant to the 2015 Plan
without the prior written consent of the participant.

Summary of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences
The following is a general summary under current law of the material federal income tax consequences to participants in the 2015
Plan under U.S. law. This summary deals with the general tax principles that apply and is provided only for general information.
Certain types of taxes, such as state and local income taxes and taxes imposed by jurisdictions outside the U.S., are not discussed.
Tax laws are complex and subject to change and may vary depending on individual circumstances and from locality to locality. The
summary does not discuss all aspects of income taxation that may be relevant to a participant in light of his or her personal
investment circumstances. This summarized tax information is not tax advice.

SECTION 162(M) OF THE CODE
Section 162(m) of the Code generally limits to $1 million the amount that a publicly held corporation is allowed each year to deduct
for the compensation paid to the corporation’s chief executive officer, chief financial officer and certain of the corporation’s current
and former executive officers.

Proposal 3

STOCK OPTIONS
A participant will not recognize taxable income at the time an option is granted and the Company will not be entitled to a tax
deduction at that time. A participant will recognize compensation taxable as ordinary income (and subject to income tax
withholding in respect of an employee) upon exercise of a nonqualified stock option equal to the excess of the fair market value of
the shares purchased over their purchase price, and the Company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction, except to the
extent the deduction limits of Section 162(m) of the Code apply. A participant will not recognize income (except for purposes of
the alternative minimum tax) upon exercise of an incentive stock option. If the shares acquired by exercise of an incentive stock
option are held for at least two years from the date the option was granted and one year from the date it was exercised, any gain
or loss arising from a subsequent disposition of those shares will be taxed as long-term capital gain or loss, and the Company will
not be entitled to any deduction. If, however, such shares are disposed of within the above-described period, then in the year of
that disposition the participant will recognize compensation taxable as ordinary income equal to the excess of the lesser of (i) the
amount realized upon that disposition, and (ii) the excess of the fair market value of those shares on the date of exercise over the
purchase price, and the Company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction, except to the extent the deduction limits of
Section 162(m) of the Code apply.

STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
A participant will not recognize taxable income at the time SARs are granted and the Company will not be entitled to a tax
deduction at that time. Upon exercise, the participant will recognize compensation taxable as ordinary income (and subject to
income tax withholding in respect of an employee) in an amount equal to the fair market value of any Shares delivered and the
amount of cash paid by the Company. This amount is deductible by the Company as compensation expense, except to the extent
the deduction limits of Section 162(m) of the Code apply.

STOCK AWARDS
A participant will not recognize taxable income at the time restricted stock is granted and the Company will not be entitled to a
tax deduction at that time, unless the participant makes an election to be taxed at that time. If such election is made, the
participant will recognize compensation taxable as ordinary income (and subject to income tax withholding in respect of an
employee) at the time of the grant in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value for the Shares at such time over the
amount, if any, paid for those Shares. If such election is not made, the participant will recognize compensation taxable as ordinary
income (and subject to income tax withholding in respect of an employee) at the time the restrictions constituting a substantial
risk of forfeiture lapse in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the Shares at such time over the amount, if any,
paid for those Shares. The amount of ordinary income recognized by making the above-described election or upon the lapse of
restrictions is deductible by the Company as compensation expense, except to the extent the deduction limits of Section 162(m)
of the Code apply.

A participant will not recognize taxable income at the time a RSU is granted and the Company will not be entitled to a tax
deduction at that time. Upon settlement of RSUs, the participant will recognize compensation taxable as ordinary income (and
subject to income tax withholding in respect of an employee) in an amount equal to the fair market value of any Shares delivered
and the amount of any cash paid by the Company. The amount of ordinary income recognized is deductible by the Company as
compensation expense, except to the extent the deduction limits of Section 162(m) of the Code apply.

The tax consequences for equity awards outside of the U.S. may differ significantly from the U.S. federal income tax consequences
described above.

Number of Awards Granted to Employees, Directors, and Consultants
The Company’s NEOs and members of the Board will be eligible to receive grants under the 2015 Plan and therefore have an
interest in this Proposal.

Because grants under the 2015 Plan to participants are within the discretion of the Compensation Committee (or its delegate), it is
not possible to determine the grants that will be made to participants under the 2015 Plan.

The 2015 Plan authorizes the grant of discretionary awards to non-employee directors, the terms and conditions of which are
determined by the Compensation Committee. Historically, our non-employee directors have received annual equity grants under
our equity incentive plans. Under our current Independent Director Compensation Policy, our non-employee directors receive
annual equity grants promptly following the date of each annual stockholders meeting in the form of fully vested stock payment
awards with a dollar value equal to $275,000, and with respect to the Chairman of the Board, an additional fully vested stock
payment award that has a dollar value equal to $100,000. In addition, our non-employee directors may elect to receive their annual
retainers in the form of fully vested stock awards.

Proposal 4

Proposal 4 — Approval of the Amended and Restated
Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (the “ESPP” or “Purchase Plan”), is a benefit that we make broadly available to our
employees and employees of our participating subsidiaries and affiliates that allows them to purchase Shares at a discount. The
ESPP helps us attract, motivate and retain highly qualified employees and promotes employee stock ownership, which aligns
employees’ interests with those of our stockholders. We are asking stockholders to approve the amended and restated ESPP
primarily to increase the number of Shares reserved for issuance under the ESPP by 50 million. The Board, upon the
recommendation of the Compensation Committee, has approved the amended and restated ESPP, subject to stockholder
approval at the Annual Meeting.

If our stockholders approve this proposal, the total number of Shares authorized and reserved for issuance under the ESPP will be
62 million Shares. However, if this proposal is not approved by our stockholders, the total number of Shares authorized and
reserved for issuance under the ESPP will remain at 12 million, of which approximately 5 million remain available for issuance as of
April 3, 2018. Based on our current forecasts and estimated participation rates, if the increase is not approved, we expect that the
ESPP will run out of available Shares in approximately one year.

We believe that the ESPP is an essential tool that helps us compete for talent in the labor markets in which we operate. We also believe
the ESPP is a crucial element in rewarding and encouraging current employees that promotes stock ownership by employees, which
aligns their interests with those of our stockholders. Without stockholder approval of this proposal, we believe our ability to attract and
retain talent would be hampered, and our recruiting, retention, and incentive efforts would become more difficult.
Background and Overview of the ESPP
The ESPP was initially adopted by the Board in June 2015, and became effective upon the completion of the Separation.

Under the ESPP, a participant may authorize participant contributions, generally in the form of payroll deductions, which may not
exceed 10% of the participant’s eligible compensation during an offering period. Payroll deductions are applied on the last day of a
purchase period (the “purchase date”) within an offering period to purchase a whole number of Shares on behalf of a participant.
The purchase price is 85% of the fair market value of a Share on the first day of the offering period or on the purchase date,
whichever date results in a lower price.
Reasons for Voting for the Proposal
The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to continue to provide employees with the
opportunity to acquire an ownership interest in the Company through their participation in the ESPP and thereby encourage them
to remain in the employ of the Company (including its participating subsidiaries and affiliates) and more closely align their
interests with those of our stockholders. We believe that the number of Shares remaining available for issuance under the ESPP
will not be sufficient in light of the expected levels of ongoing participation in the ESPP. Accordingly, we are asking stockholders to
approve increasing the number of Shares available under the ESPP to help the Company meet the goals of its compensation
strategy.

In considering its recommendation to seek stockholder approval for the addition of 50 million Shares to the ESPP, the Board
considered the historical number of Shares purchased under the ESPP since Separation. The Board also considered the Company’s
expectation that the additional Shares should last approximately ten years. However, the additional Shares could last for a longer
or shorter period of time based on various factors which cannot be predicted, including the growth of our employee population,
future ESPP offering practices, our stock price and prevailing market conditions. In the event that more Shares are required for the
ESPP in the future, prior stockholder approval will be required.
Material Changes to the ESPP
As noted above, the number of Shares reserved for issuance under the ESPP has been increased by 50 million Shares to 62 million
Shares. The amendment and restatement of the ESPP also includes other administrative, clarifying, and conforming changes.
Summary of the ESPP
The following paragraphs provide a summary of the principal features of the ESPP and its operation. This summary is not a
complete description of all of the provisions of the ESPP, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the ESPP,
which is provided as Appendix B to this proxy statement.

PURPOSE
The purpose of the ESPP is to provide employees with a convenient means of acquiring an equity interest in the Company through
payroll deductions or other contributions to enhance such employees’ sense of participation in the affairs of the Company. We
believe that the ESPP advances the interests of the Company and its stockholders by providing an incentive to attract, retain and
reward eligible employees and by motivating such employees to contribute to the growth and profitability of the Company and its
subsidiaries and affiliates. The ESPP provides eligible employees with the opportunity to acquire an equity interest in the Company
through the purchase of Shares. The ESPP includes two components. The first component, which we refer to as the 423 component,
is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan within the meaning of Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code (the

2017 Annual Report / 2018 Proxy Statement

Proposal 4

69

“Code”) and generally covers our U.S. employees. The second component, which we refer to as the non-423 component, is not
intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Code, and generally covers certain of our non-U.S. employees.

Our employees and the employees of our participating subsidiaries and affiliates that have been employed for at least ten business
days and who meet the other requirements established by the Administrator (as defined below) prior to the applicable offering
period are eligible to participate in the ESPP, effective as of the first day of the first offering period for which they are eligible. No
employee is eligible to participate if he or she owns stock or holds options, (or would as a result of ESPP participation own stock or
hold options), to purchase five percent or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company
or of any subsidiary corporation of the Company.

In its discretion, the Administrator may determine that certain employees or categories of employees will not be eligible to
participate in the ESPP, which authority will be exercised in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 423 of the Code for
rights granted under the 423 component.

As of April 3, 2018, approximately 19,000 employees, including seven executive officers, were eligible to participate in the ESPP.
Non-employee directors and consultants are not eligible to participate in the ESPP.

NUMBER OF SHARES AND MARKET PRICE OF SHARES AVAILABLE UNDER THE ESPP
A total of 12 million Shares were initially authorized and reserved for issuance under the ESPP. If stockholders approve this
proposal, the total number of Shares authorized and reserved for issuance under the ESPP will be 62 million Shares. The number of
Shares is subject to adjustment in the case of certain corporate transactions, as described below. As of April 3, 2018, the closing
price of a Share on NASDAQ was $74.56 per Share.

ADMINISTRATION
The Compensation Committee of the Board is responsible for administering the ESPP (the “Administrator”), but is authorized to
delegate its duties and authority to officers and employees of the Company, as appropriate. In its sole discretion, the Board may
administer the ESPP. The Administrator will have, among other authority, the authority to interpret the ESPP, to determine
eligibility and adjudicate disputed claims under the ESPP, to determine the terms and conditions of offerings and rights under the
ESPP, and to make any other determination and take any other action desirable for the administration of the ESPP. Additionally,
the Administrator is authorized to adopt, amend and rescind rules or procedures relating to the administration of the ESPP to
accommodate the specific requirements of local laws and procedures. The Administrator may also adopt sub-plans applicable to
particular participating subsidiaries and affiliates, which may be designed to be outside the scope of Section 423 of the Code and
which may have terms different to those of the ESPP other than with respect to the number of Shares reserved under the ESPP.
All determinations and decisions by the Administrator regarding the interpretation or application of the ESPP are final and binding
on all ESPP participants.

ENROLLMENT AND CONTRIBUTIONS
Eligible employees voluntarily elect whether or not to enroll in the ESPP by completing, signing and submitting to the Company an
enrollment form in a form and manner and by the deadline set by the Administrator. Each employee who joins the ESPP (a
“participant”) is granted a right to purchase Shares on the first day of each applicable offering period (the “offering date”) while
participating in the ESPP and, as long as he or she has not withdrawn from participation (including by reducing his or her
contributions down to 0%, as described below) or terminated employment or eligibility, automatically is re-enrolled in the
subsequent offering period. An employee may cancel his or her enrollment in an offering period at any time (subject to ESPP rules,
as outlined below under “Termination of Participation”).

Participants contribute to the ESPP through payroll deductions or, if permitted by the Administrator, through other means specified by
the Administrator. Currently, contributions are permitted only through payroll deductions. Participants generally may contribute a
minimum of 2% and up to a maximum of 10% of their eligible compensation through after-tax payroll deductions. Compensation for
purposes of the ESPP includes the following forms of cash compensation paid to or earned by an employee: base wages, salary,
overtime, performance or merit bonuses, commissions, shift differentials, language differentials, payments for paid time off and
holidays, sabbatical pay, payments in lieu of notice, travel pay, retroactive pay, on-call/standby pay, hazard pay, bereavement pay, jury/
witness duty pay, pay during a period of suspension, military leave pay, compensation deferred pursuant to Section 401(k) or
Section 125 of the Code, distributions under any nonqualified deferred compensation plan, retention bonuses and any other
compensation or remuneration that the Administrator approves as “compensation” in accordance with Section 423 of the Code.

During an offering period, a participant may increase or decrease his or her contribution percentage, including to 0%, by following
procedures established by the Administrator, but only one such change can take effect during any purchase period. If a participant
reduces his or her contribution percentage to 0% during an offering period and does not increase such rate above 0% prior to the
start of the next purchase period within that offering period (or, if none, prior to the start of the next subsequent offering period),
the participant will be withdrawn from the ESPP, unless the participant is on a bona fide leave of absence.

From time to time, the Administrator may establish a lower maximum permitted contribution percentage, change the definition
of eligible compensation, limit the nature or number of contribution rate changes that may be made during an offering period or
purchase period, adopt other rules regarding participation in the ESPP, or change the length of the offering and purchase periods
(but in no event may such periods exceed 27 months).

Proposal 4

OFFERING PERIOD AND PURCHASE PERIODS
Under the 423 component of the ESPP, an offering period lasts for 24 months, comprised of four six-month purchase periods.
Purchases will be made four times during each offering period on the last trading day of each purchase period, and the dates of
such purchases are referred to as “purchase dates.” A new purchase period will begin the day after a purchase date. A new
24-month offering period will commence on each May 1st and November 1st during the term of the ESPP. Offering periods under
the non-423 component of the ESPP may have a different duration, currently six months and consisting of a single six-month
purchase period, but subject to change by the Administrator. Purchases will be made on the last trading day of the purchase
period, and a new offering period and purchase period will begin the day after a purchase date. The Administrator may change the
frequency and duration of offering periods and purchase dates under the ESPP, for offerings under either the 423 component or
the non-423 component.

If the fair market value per share of our common stock on any purchase date in the 423 component of the ESPP is less than the
fair market value per share on the start date of a 24-month offering period, then that offering period will automatically terminate,
a new 24-month offering period will begin on the next day after the purchase date, and all participants participating in such original
offering period will be automatically enrolled in such new offering period.

PURCHASE OF SHARES
Employees electing to participate in the ESPP will authorize us to automatically deduct after-tax dollars from each compensation
payment during an offering period until the employee instructs us to stop the deductions or the employee’s employment is terminated.
Participants’ accumulated deductions will be applied to the purchase of whole shares on each semi-annual purchase date.

The purchase price per share will be equal to 85% of the fair market value per share on the participant’s entry date into the
offering period or, if lower, 85% of the fair market value per share on the purchase date.

The number of Shares that a participant is able to purchase is limited so that no participant has the right to purchase our common
stock under the ESPP and all similar purchase plans maintained by us or our subsidiaries at a rate which exceeds $25,000 of the
fair market value of such stock (determined at the time the right is granted) for each calendar year that a right granted to the
participant is outstanding at any time. In addition, no participant may purchase more than 5,000 Shares on any purchase date, or
such other maximum Share amount as may be set by the Administrator, subject to adjustment in the case of certain corporate
transactions, as described below.

TERMINATION OF PARTICIPATION
Participation in the ESPP generally terminates when a participating employee’s employment with the Company or its participating
subsidiaries and affiliates ceases for any reason, the employee withdraws from the ESPP (including by reducing his or her
contribution rate to 0%, as described above), or the Company terminates or amends the ESPP such that the employee no longer is
eligible to participate. Also, although the Administrator may establish other rules, the ESPP provides that a participant’s transfer of
employment from an entity participating in the 423 component of the ESPP to an entity participating in the non-423 component,
or vice versa, will result in a termination of the participant’s participation in the ESPP as of the date of his or her transfer. Employees
may end their participation in an offering at any time at least 15 business days before a purchase date, or within such other time
frame established by the Administrator. Upon withdrawal from the ESPP, generally the employee will receive the refund of any
remaining amounts not used to purchase Shares that have been credited to his or her account, without interest (unless otherwise
required by applicable law), and his or her payroll withholdings or contributions under the ESPP will cease.

NON-TRANSFERABILITY
Rights to purchase Shares and any other rights and interests under the ESPP may not be sold, pledged, assigned, or transferred in
any manner other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. A right to purchase shares under the ESPP is exercisable
during the lifetime of a participant only by the participant.

ADJUSTMENTS; CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS
Certain transactions with our stockholders not involving our receipt of consideration, such as a stock split, spin-off, stock dividend,
or certain recapitalizations, may affect the share price of our common stock. We refer to these transactions as equity
restructurings. In the event that an equity restructuring occurs, the Administrator will equitably adjust the class of shares issuable
and the maximum number of shares of our stock subject to the ESPP, and will equitably adjust any rights outstanding as to the
class, number of shares and price per share of our stock. Other types of transactions may also affect our common stock, such as a
dividend or other distribution, reorganization, merger, or other changes in corporate structure. In the event that there is such a
transaction that is not an equity restructuring, and the Administrator determines that an adjustment to the ESPP and any rights
outstanding would be appropriate to prevent any dilution or enlargement of benefits under the ESPP, the Administrator will
equitably adjust the ESPP as to the class or type of shares issuable and the maximum number of shares of our stock subject to the
ESPP, as well as the maximum number of shares that may be purchased by an employee, and will adjust any rights outstanding as
to the class or type and number of shares and price per share of our stock in such manner as it may deem equitable.

In the event we merge with or into another corporation in which we do not survive (or we survive but our stockholders cease to own
our shares); sell all or substantially all of our assets; or more than 50% of our shares are acquired, sold or transferred in a tender offer
or similar transaction, the outstanding rights under the ESPP will continue unless otherwise provided by the Administrator.

2017 Annual Report / 2018 Proxy Statement

Proposal 4

71

In the event of our proposed dissolution or liquidation, the offering period then in progress will be shortened by setting a new
purchase date, and shall terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed dissolution or liquidation, unless the
Administrator provides otherwise in its sole discretion.

AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION
The Administrator generally may amend, suspend or terminate the ESPP or any part of the ESPP at any time and for any reason.
However, any termination may not affect previously made grants or adversely affect the rights of any participant without such
participant’s consent. Amendments to increase the number of Shares available under the ESPP or to change the definition of the
corporations whose employees (or class of employees) are eligible to participate in the ESPP must be approved by the
stockholders of the Company within 12 months of the adoption of the amendment. However, the Administrator may make
amendments to the ESPP as it determines to be advisable if the continuation of the ESPP or any offering period would result in
financial accounting treatment for the ESPP that is different from the financial accounting treatment in effect on the date the
ESPP was initially adopted by the Board.

Number of Shares Purchased by Certain Individuals and Groups
Participation in the ESPP is voluntary and dependent on each eligible employee’s election to participate and his or her determination as
to the level of payroll deductions. Further, the number of Shares that may be purchased under the ESPP is determined, in part, by the
price of our Common Stock on the first and last day of each offering period or purchase period, as applicable. Accordingly, the actual
number of Shares that may be purchased by any eligible individual in the future is not determinable.

The following table provides information on the number of Shares purchased by the following employees and groups since the
inception of the ESPP on July 17, 2015 through April 3, 2018:

Proposal 4

Summary of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences
The following is a general summary under current law of the material federal income tax consequences to participants in the ESPP
under U.S. law. This summary deals with the general tax principles that apply and is provided only for general information. Certain
types of taxes, such as state and local income taxes, are not discussed. Tax laws are complex and subject to change and may vary
depending on individual circumstances and from locality to locality. The summary does not discuss all aspects of income taxation
that may be relevant to a participant in light of his or her personal investment circumstances. This summarized tax information is
not tax advice.

The ESPP is intended to be an employee stock purchase plan within the meaning of Section 423 of the Code. The ESPP also
authorizes the grant of rights to purchase Shares that do not qualify under Section 423 pursuant to the non-423 component.

423 COMPONENT OFFERINGS
Under an employee stock purchase plan that qualifies under Section 423, no taxable income will be recognized by a participant,
and no deductions will be allowable to the Company, upon either the grant or the exercise of the purchase rights. Taxable income
will not be recognized until there is a sale or other disposition of the Shares acquired under the ESPP or in the event the
participant should die while still owning the purchased Shares.

If the participant sells or otherwise disposes of the purchased Shares within two years after the start date of the offering period in
which the Shares were acquired or within one year after the actual purchase date of those Shares, then the participant generally
will recognize ordinary income in the year of sale or disposition equal to the amount by which the fair market value of the Shares
on the purchase date exceeded the purchase price paid for those Shares, and the Company will be entitled to an income tax
deduction (subject to applicable limits under the Code), for the taxable year in which such disposition occurs equal in amount to
such excess. The amount of this ordinary income will be added to the participant’s basis in the Shares, and any resulting gain or
loss recognized upon the sale or disposition will be a capital gain or loss. If the Shares have been held for more than one year since
the date of purchase, the gain or loss will be long-term.

If the participant sells or disposes of the purchased Shares more than two years after the start date of the offering period in which
the Shares were acquired and more than one year after the actual purchase date of those Shares, then the participant generally
will recognize ordinary income in the year of sale or disposition equal to the lesser of (a) the amount by which the fair market value
of the Shares on the sale or disposition date exceeded the purchase price paid for those Shares, or (b) 15% of the fair market value
of the Shares on the start date of that offering period. Any additional gain upon the disposition will be taxed as a long-term capital
gain. Alternatively, if the fair market value of the Shares on the date of the sale or disposition is less than the purchase price, there
will be no ordinary income and any loss recognized will be a long-term capital loss. The Company will not be entitled to an income
tax deduction with respect to such disposition.

If the participant still owns the purchased Shares at the time of death, the lesser of (i) the amount by which the fair market value
of the Shares on the date of death exceeds the purchase price or (ii) 15% of the fair market value of the Shares on the start date of
the offering period in which those Shares were acquired will constitute ordinary income in the year of death.

NON-423 COMPONENT OFFERINGS
If a purchase right is granted under the non-423 component of the ESPP, then to the extent a participant is subject to U.S. federal
income tax, the amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the Shares on the purchase date and the
purchase price is taxed as ordinary income at the time of such purchase and is subject to tax withholding. The amount of such
ordinary income will be added to the participant’s basis in the Shares, and any additional gain or resulting loss recognized on the
disposition of the Shares after such basis adjustment will be a capital gain or loss. A capital gain or loss will be long-term if the
participant holds the Shares for more than one year after the purchase date. The Company may be entitled to a deduction in the
year of purchase equal to the amount of ordinary income realized by the participant.

The tax consequences for Shares purchased pursuant to the ESPP may differ significantly from the U.S. federal income tax
consequences described above.

Proposal 5—Ratification of Appointment of
Independent Auditor

The ARC Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the Company’s
independent auditor.

The ARC Committee has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) as our independent auditor for 2018. PwC has served as
the Company’s independent auditor since 2000, and as the Company’s independent auditor as an independent public company
since July 2015, following the completion of the Separation from eBay. The Board and the ARC Committee believe that the
continued retention of PwC to serve as our independent auditor is in the best interests of Company and our stockholders.
Accordingly, we are asking our stockholders to ratify the selection of PwC as our independent auditor for 2018. Although
ratification is not legally required, we are submitting the appointment of PwC for ratification by our stockholders because we value
our stockholders’ views on the Company’s independent auditors and as a matter of good corporate practice. We expect that
representatives of PwC will be present at the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they wish, and will
be able to respond to appropriate questions.

In the event that our stockholders do not ratify the appointment, it will be considered a recommendation to the Board and the
ARC Committee to consider the selection of a different firm. Even if the appointment is ratified, the ARC Committee may in its
discretion select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a
change would be in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders.

The Board and the ARC Committee Recommend a Vote FOR Proposal 5.

ARC COMMITTEE REPORT
The ARC Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board. The Charter of the ARC Committee is available on
the corporate governance section of PayPal’s investor relations website at https://investor.paypal-corp.com/corporate-
governance.cfm. Any future changes in the committee charter or key practices will also be reflected on the website. The ARC
Committee is composed entirely of directors who meet the independence requirements of NASDAQ and the SEC, and who
otherwise satisfy the requirements for audit committee service imposed by the Exchange Act.

The ARC Committee provides assistance and guidance to the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to:

• PayPal’s corporate accounting and financial reporting practices and the audit of its financial statements;
• The independent auditor’s qualifications and independence;
• The performance of PayPal’s internal audit function and independent auditor;
• The quality and integrity of PayPal’s financial statements and reports;
• Reviewing and approving all audit engagement fees and terms, as well as all non-audit engagements with the independent

auditor;

• Producing this report;
• PayPal’s overall risk framework and risk appetite framework; and
• PayPal’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

The ARC Committee relies on the expertise and knowledge of management, the internal audit department, and the independent
auditor in carrying out its oversight responsibilities. Management is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of
PayPal’s financial statements, and for maintaining appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles and policies and
internal controls and procedures that provide for compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations.
PayPal’s independent auditor, PwC, is responsible for performing an audit of PayPal’s financial statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those
financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. The independent auditor is also responsible for
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of PayPal’s internal control over financial reporting.

During 2017 and early 2018, among other things, the ARC Committee:

• Reviewed and discussed with management and the independent auditor the Company’s quarterly earnings press releases,

financial statements, and related periodic reports filed with the SEC;

• Reviewed and discussed with senior management, the internal audit team, and the independent auditor the scope, adequacy,
and effectiveness of the Company’s internal accounting and financial reporting controls and the independent auditor’s opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting;

• Monitored and evaluated the independent auditor’s qualifications, performance, and independence on an ongoing basis;
• Reviewed and discussed with management, the independent auditor and, as appropriate, the chief accounting officer, the audit

scope, any significant matters arising from any audit and the audit plans of both the internal audit department and the
independent auditor;

• Reviewed and discussed the Company’s enterprise-wide risk management program and overall risk management framework,

including policies and practices established by management to identify, assess, measure, and manage key risks facing the
Company;

• Reviewed and discussed the Company’s enterprise-wide compliance program and global financial crimes compliance program,

including compliance risks, management actions on significant compliance matters, progress of major compliance initiatives,
and reports concerning the Company’s compliance with applicable laws and regulations;

• Reviewed with the Chief Business Affairs and Legal Officer and/or the Chief Risk, Compliance and Security Officer, as applicable,

any significant legal, compliance, or regulatory matters that could have a material impact on the Company’s financial
statements, business or compliance policies, including material notices to or inquiries received from governmental agencies;

• Reviewed and discussed with the independent auditor the audited financial statements in the Company’s 2017 Annual Report

on Form 10-K, including a discussion of the quality, not just acceptability, of accounting principles, the reasonableness of
significant judgments and estimates, the nature of significant risks and exposures, and the clarity and adequacy of the
disclosures in the financial statements; and

• Held separate executive sessions with the independent auditor, the internal audit department, the internal Sarbanes-Oxley Act

of 2002 team, and senior management to enable them to discuss legal, accounting, auditing and internal controls matters
privately with the ARC Committee.

The ARC Committee has discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed by the requirements of the PCAOB and the
SEC. In addition, the ARC Committee discussed with PwC its independence from PayPal and its management, received the written
disclosures and the letter required by applicable PCAOB requirements regarding the independent auditor’s communications with
the ARC Committee concerning independence, and considered whether PwC’s provision of non-audit services was compatible with
maintaining PwC’s independence. The ARC Committee has confirmed that PwC’s provision of audit and non-audit services to
PayPal and its affiliates is compatible with PwC’s independence.

Based on the ARC Committee’s reviews and discussions described above, the ARC Committee recommended to the Board that
the consolidated audited financial statements be included in PayPal’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2017 for filing with the SEC. The ARC Committee also concluded that the appointment of PwC as the Company’s
independent auditor for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The
Board recommends that stockholders ratify this appointment at the Annual Meeting.

“Audit-Related Fees” are fees for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or
review of our consolidated financial statements or internal control over financial reporting and are not included in “Audit Fees.”
These services primarily include fees for procedures in connection with our Service Organizational Control (“SOC”) reports and
consultation regarding financial accounting and reporting matters.

“Tax Fees” are fees for tax services, including transfer pricing consulting, tax planning and advice, and tax compliance.

“All Other Fees” are fees for permitted services performed by PwC that do not meet the “Audit Fees,” “Audit-Related Fees,” or
“Tax Fees” category description. These services primarily include fees for consulting services, compliance-related services, and
software licenses, as well as the lease payment described above.

The ARC Committee has determined that the provision of the non-audit services listed above is compatible with PwC’s
independence.

ARC PRE-APPROVAL POLICY
The ARC Committee has adopted a policy requiring the pre-approval of any audit and permissible non-audit services provided by
PwC. Under this policy, the ARC Committee preapproves all audit and permissible non-audit services to be provided by PwC. These
services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services, and other services. Pre-approval is generally provided for a
period of up to one year and any pre-approval is detailed as to the particular service or category of services and is generally subject
to a specified budget. PwC is required to report periodically to the ARC Committee regarding the extent of services provided in
accordance with each pre-approval and the fees for such services provided to date. The ARC may also pre-approve particular
services on a case-by-case basis.

Proposal 6—Stockholder Proposal Regarding Stockholder
Proxy Access Enhancement

John Chevedden, whose address is 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo Beach, California 90278, has advised the Company that
he intends to present the following stockholder proposal at the Annual Meeting. Mr. Chevedden has indicated that he holds no
fewer than 100 shares of PayPal common stock. The stockholder proposal will be voted on at the Annual Meeting only if properly
presented by or on behalf of the proponent.

The text of the stockholder proposal and supporting statement appear exactly as received by the Company unless otherwise
noted. All statements contained in the stockholder proposal and supporting statement are the sole responsibility of the
proponent. The stockholder proposal may contain assertions about the Company or other matters that we believe are incorrect,
but we have not attempted to refute all of those assertions.

The Board Recommends a Vote AGAINST Stockholder Proposal 6 based on the reasons set forth in PayPal’s

Statement in Opposition following the stockholder proposal.

John Chevedden’s Proposal and Supporting Statement (as received)

Proposal 6 – Shareholder Proxy Access Enhancement

Stockholders request the board of directors to take the steps necessary to amend its proxy access bylaw provisions and any
associated documents, to include the following changes for the purpose of decreasing the average amount of Company
common stock the average member of a nominating group would be required to hold for 3-years to satisfy the aggregate
ownership requirements to form a nominating group and to increase the possible number of proxy access director candidates:

• No limitation shall be placed on the number of stockholders who can aggregate their shares to achieve the 3% of common

stock required to nominate directors under our Company’s proxy access provisions.

• The number of shareholder-nominated candidates eligible to appear in proxy materials will be 25% of Directors (rounded

down) but not less than 2.

Even if the 20 largest public pension funds were able to aggregate their shares, they would not meet the current 3% criteria for
a continuous 3-years at most companies according to the Council of Institutional Investors. This proposal addresses the
contradiction that our company now has with proxy access for only the largest shareholders who are probably the least unlikely
shareholders to make use of it.

It is especially important to improve a shareholder right, such as proxy access, to make up for our management taking away an
important shareholder right—the right to an in-person annual meeting. We did not have an opportunity to vote on giving up
this right.

For decades shareholders of U.S. companies had a once-a-year opportunity to ask a $10 million CEO and directors questions in
person. Now our directors can casually flip their phones to mute during the annual shareholder meeting.

Our management is now free to run a make-believe meeting with Investor Relations devising softball questions in advance
while tossing out challenging shareholder questions. Then our $10 million + CEO can simply read the scripted IR answers to a
microphone—no opportunity for live audience feedback. There is no auditor present to see if IR is trashing incoming
shareholder questions.

The lack of an in-person annual meeting means that a board meeting can be scheduled months after the virtual meeting—by
which time any serious issues raised by shareholders under these adverse conditions will be long forgotten by the directors.
Plus a virtual meeting guarantees that there will be no media coverage for the benefit of shareholders.

A virtual meeting is a complacency plan for our directors and top management. Top management has no incentive to avoid
making mistakes for 365 days of the year out of concern that there will be an in-person accounting at the annual meeting in
front of media.

Please vote to improve proxy access to help make up for our top management stripping away an important shareholder right:

PAYPAL’S STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION
The Board has carefully considered this proposal and, for the reasons set forth below, does not believe that it is in the best
interests of PayPal and its stockholders. The Board believes that PayPal has already implemented a progressive proxy access
framework for its stockholders aligned with current best practices, which gives stockholders a meaningful voice in director
elections, and that the Board believes is in the best interests of all its stockholders.

PayPal has had a proxy access framework in place since it became an independent publicly traded company in July 2015. Our proxy
access provisions originally permitted a stockholder, or group of up to 15 stockholders, who have owned at least 3% or more of our
outstanding common stock continuously for at least 3 years, to nominate and include in our proxy statement director nominees
for up to 20% of the Board, in accordance with our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. In May 2017, we proposed, and our
stockholders approved, an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation increasing the number of stockholders who can
aggregate their shares to meet the 3% ownership threshold to 20 stockholders (the “aggregation limit”). We proposed this change
to advance stockholders’ rights by aligning PayPal’s proxy access aggregation limit with the consensus formulation adopted by the
vast majority of U.S. public companies that have instituted proxy access.

We engaged with many of our large stockholders regarding our proxy access framework. Based on their feedback as well as a
benchmarking review of proxy access rights adopted by other companies, we continue to believe that our current proxy access
framework is appropriate for the Company and our stockholders. The Board believes that the Company’s current proxy access
provisions strike the right balance between providing a meaningful stockholder right to nominate director candidates and
mitigating the risk of abuse of this right by stockholders pursuing objectives that are not aligned with the interests of a majority of
long-term stockholders.

As further discussed below, the changes to our proxy access framework requested by this stockholder proposal represent a
fundamental change to the carefully considered and balanced approach reflected in our existing provisions.

• The proposal requests removing any limitation on the number of stockholders that can aggregate their shares to meet the 3%
ownership threshold. We believe the 20-stockholder aggregation limit in our proxy access provisions is a reasonable limitation
to control the administrative burden of confirming and monitoring share ownership within a nominating group and preventing
the use of proxy access by a group that includes stockholders that do not have a substantial economic stake in the Company.
Additionally, a 20-stockholder aggregation limit is the consensus formulation among companies that have adopted proxy
access. Also, as we believe is consistent with best practices, two or more investment funds under common management and
investment control are considered a single stockholder for the purposes of the aggregation limit, as are any two or more funds
under common management and funded primarily by a single employer.

• The proposal also requests an increase in the number of permitted proxy access nominees to 25% of the Board, but not less

than two. We have capped the number of permitted proxy access nominees at 20% of the Board. Our Governance Committee
and Board seek to ensure that our directors have an appropriate mix of relevant skills, professional experience and
backgrounds, bring diverse viewpoints and perspectives, and effectively represent the long-term interests of stockholders.
Capping the number of permitted proxy access nominees at 20% of the Board ensures that stockholders have a meaningful
right of nomination without overly disrupting the balance of characteristics the Board seeks to achieve through the regular
nomination process. We believe this limit also helps to address concerns that a stockholder could use proxy access to
eventually cause a change in control or to pursue special interests that are not widely supported by our stockholders.

PayPal has a history of strong corporate governance, and our leadership structure reflects our long-standing commitment to best
practices in governance and accountability to our stockholders. For example, in addition to our proxy access framework:

• All of our directors are elected annually, with a majority voting standard.
• Nine of our 11 directors are independent.
• We have separate Chairman and CEO roles and a lead independent director with robust responsibilities.
• Our stockholders have a right to call a special meeting.
• We have an active stockholder engagement program through which we connect with our stockholders regularly to understand
and discuss their views on corporate governance matters and issues of importance to all stockholders, including proxy access.
• We proactively focus on Board composition and refreshment, with an emphasis on building a Board consisting of directors who

bring a wide range of diversity, skills, experiences, and perspectives. In 2017, we added three new directors to our Board.

• There are multiple channels for stockholders and other interested parties to communicate with our directors, as described

under the heading “Communication with the Board” and elsewhere in this proxy statement.

In light of the Board’s commitment to strong corporate governance, the Company’s record of performance as supported by its
governance structure and our existing proxy access rights which are consistent with best practices, the Board believes that
adoption of this stockholder proposal is both unnecessary and would be detrimental to stockholder value.

For the reasons set forth above, the Board believes that implementation of this proposal is not in the best interests of PayPal and
its stockholders. The Board therefore recommends a vote AGAINST the proposal.

Proposal 7

Proposal 7—Stockholder Proposal Regarding Political
Transparency

James McRitchie and Myra K. Young, whose address is 9295 Yorkship Court, Elk Grove, California 95758, have advised the Company
that they intend to present the following stockholder proposal at the Annual Meeting. Mr. McRitchie and Ms. Young have
indicated that they hold 50 shares of PayPal common stock, and have delegated John Chevedden to act as their agent regarding
this stockholder proposal, including its presentation at the Annual Meeting. The stockholder proposal will be voted on at the
Annual Meeting only if properly presented by or on behalf of the proponents.

The text of the stockholder proposal and supporting statement appear exactly as received by the Company unless otherwise
noted. All statements contained in the stockholder proposal and supporting statement are the sole responsibility of the
proponents. The stockholder proposal may contain assertions about the Company or other matters that we believe are incorrect,
but we have not attempted to refute all of those assertions.

The Board Recommends a Vote AGAINST Stockholder Proposal 7 based on the reasons set forth in PayPal’s

Statement in Opposition following the stockholder proposal.

James McRitchie’s and Myra K. Young’s Proposal and Supporting Statement (as received)

Resolved: Shareholders of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (“PayPal” or “Company”) hereby request PayPal provide a report, updated
semiannually, disclosing the Company’s:

1. Policies and procedures for making, with corporate funds or assets, contributions and expenditures (direct or indirect) to
(a) participate or intervene in any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office, or
(b) influence the general public, or any segment thereof, with respect to an election or referendum.

2. Monetary and non-monetary contributions and expenditures (direct and indirect) used in the manner described in section 1
above, including: (a) The identity of the recipient as well as the amount paid to each; and (b) The title(s) of the person(s) in the
Company responsible for decision-making.

The report shall be presented to the board of directors or relevant board committee and posted on the Company’s website
within 12 months from the date of the annual meeting. This resolution does not encompass lobbying.

Supporting Statement: As long-term shareholders of PayPal, we support transparency and accountability in corporate political
spending. This includes any activity considered intervention in a political campaign under the Internal Revenue Code, such as
direct and indirect contributions to political candidates, parties, or organizations, and independent expenditures or
electioneering communications on behalf of federal, state, or local candidates.

Disclosure is in the best interest of PayPal and its shareholders. The Supreme Court recognized this in its 2010 Citizens United
decision: “…prompt disclosure of expenditures can provide shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold
corporations and elected officials accountable for their positions and supporters. Shareholders can determine whether their
corporation’s political speech advances the corporation’s interest in making profits, and citizens can see whether elected
officials are “in the pocket” of so-called moneyed interests… This transparency enables the electorate to make informed
decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages.”

The Court expressed enthusiasm that technology today makes disclosure “rapid and informative.” Unfortunately, the Court
envisioned a mechanism that does not currently exist. Relying on publicly available data does not provide a complete picture of
our Company’s political spending. For example, PayPal’s payments to trade associations that may be used for election-related
activities are undisclosed. This proposal asks our Company to disclose all of its political spending, including payments to trade
associations and other tax exempt organizations, which may be used for political purposes. Implementation would bring PayPal
in line with a growing number of leading companies, including Procter & Gamble Co., which present this information on their
websites.

Support by mutual funds for this topic jumped significantly in 2017, to 48 percent from 43 percent in 2016, according to an
analysis by Fund Votes. Our Company’s board and shareholders need comprehensive disclosure to fully evaluate the political
use of corporate assets.

We urge you to vote For:

Proposal 7 – Transparent Political Spending

PAYPAL’S STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION
The Board has considered this proposal and concluded that its adoption is unnecessary and not in the best interests of our
stockholders.

The Board believes it is in the best interests of our stockholders, customers and employees for PayPal to be an effective
participant in the political process. We conduct business in over 200 jurisdictions, necessitating compliance with a complex set of
laws, rules, and regulations. Proposed changes to these laws, rules, and regulations can have a significant effect on our business,
operating results and stockholder value. We are committed to transparency in all areas of our business, including our political
contributions and public policy activities.

Our policy and practices regarding political contributions are available at https:// public policy.paypal-corp.com/about-
us#politicaltranspacency. Our Government Relations team focuses its efforts on public policy issues relevant to the long-term
interest of our Company and stockholders, and without regard to the personal political preferences of individual PayPal directors,
officers, and employees. We are committed to the highest ethical standards, and have procedures in place to ensure that our
political contributions and lobbying activities are subject to appropriate oversight. Our Corporate Governance and Nominating
Committee, consisting entirely of independent directors, has oversight of our political contributions and lobbying activities. Our
Senior Vice President, Corporate Affairs, and Vice President, Government Relations, review and approve all plans for corporate
political contributions to ensure that these activities are consistent with the Company’s guidelines and comply with applicable
laws.

Our political contributions and lobbying activities are governed by extensive laws and regulations, including those requiring public
disclosure of such contributions and activities. We also have a non-partisan political action committee (the “PayPal PAC”), funded
entirely on a voluntary basis by eligible PayPal employees. No corporate funds are used. Federal Election Commission (“FEC”)
Reports on political contributions and expenditures by the PayPal PAC are available at www.fec.gov.

While the PayPal PAC is the primary vehicle for political engagement, we make a limited number of corporate political
contributions at the state level where permitted by law. This includes corporate contributions to state candidates and political
committees in areas where the Company has a significant employee or facility presence. We voluntarily disclose information
regarding our political contributions under U.S. state and local laws, contributions to organizations operating under Section 527 of
the Internal Revenue Code, and information regarding the governance of our political activities on our investor relations site at
https:// public policy.paypal-corp.com/about-us#politicaltranspacency.

We believe that the adoption of this proposal is unnecessary given our existing disclosure and reporting practices, and could result
in competitive harm without providing commensurate benefit to our stockholders. The requested report could put us at a
disadvantage relative to our competitors, who are not required to disclose this information, by revealing confidential information
about our long-term strategies and priorities. Any additional political contribution reporting requirements that go beyond those
required under existing law should be applicable to all participants engaged in the political process, rather than to us alone, as the
proposal requests.

Finally, we note that our political contributions and expenditures are not financially material to the Company and are insignificant
when compared to our total operating costs.

In conclusion, we believe this proposal is unnecessary given that ample public disclosure already exists regarding PayPal’s political
contributions and expenditures. If adopted, the proposal would apply only to PayPal and to no other company and would cause
PayPal to incur undue cost and administrative burden, as well as competitive harm, without commensurate benefit to our
stockholders. Accordingly, we recommend that you vote AGAINST this proposal.

Proposal 8—Stockholder Proposal Regarding Human and
Indigenous Peoples’ Rights

John C. Harrington TTEE Harrington Investments, Inc. 401k Plan, whose address is 1001 2nd Street, Suite 325, Napa, California
94559 (the “Plan”), has advised the Company that it intends to present the following stockholder proposal at the Annual Meeting.
The Plan has indicated that it holds at least $2,000 worth of PayPal common stock. The stockholder proposal will be voted on at
the Annual Meeting only if properly presented by or on behalf of the proponent.

The text of the stockholder proposal and supporting statement appear exactly as received by the Company unless otherwise
noted. All statements contained in the stockholder proposal and supporting statement are the sole responsibility of the
proponent. The stockholder proposal may contain assertions about the Company or other matters that we believe are incorrect,
but we have not attempted to refute all of those assertions.

The Board Recommends a Vote AGAINST Stockholder Proposal 8 based on the reasons set forth in PayPal’s

Statement in Opposition following the stockholder proposal.

The Plan’s Proposal and Supporting Statement (as received)

PAYPAL

Whereas, in 2015 our Company endorsed the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) landmark federal non-discrimination legislation
(Equality Act) to protect LGBT people from discrimination; and

Whereas, our Company on its website highlighted its long-time support for domestic partnership and against discrimination
based on sexual orientation or gender identity; and

Whereas, our Company, on the other hand, has been attacked for hypocrisy for supporting government policies to expand
business in Cuba and for conducting business in at least 25 countries where homosexual behavior is illegal; and

Whereas, our Company has also been accused of discriminating against Palestinians and Palestinian businesses while not
denying financial services to Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip; and

Whereas, our Company in 2017 earned a perfect 100% score on Human Rights Campaign’s (HRC) Corporate Equity Index for the
second year in a row and was named one of the Best Places to Work for LGBT Equality by HRC; and

Whereas, our Company has adopted a voluntary Code of Business Conduct and Ethics; and

Whereas, none of our Company’s committee charters, Bylaws, or Articles of Incorporation mention human rights policies or
statements that outline PayPal’s official company policies on international human rights; and

Whereas, The United Nations in 1948 adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the United Nations Human
Rights Council in 2011 adopted the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and in 2006, the United
Nations adopted the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples;

Whereas, the Proponent believes it is a fiduciary duty of the board and management to consider human rights when making all
executive decisions where there is significant potential impact or consequences of our Company’s involvement, as well as
significant risk to our Company;

Whereas, our Company, addresses human rights in non-binding policy statements and non-binding guidelines with limited legal
teeth or enforcement mechanisms and therefore minimal assurance of respect or protection for global human rights; and

Whereas, reputational damage, negative publicity and loss of customers’ business can result in long-term consequences for our
Company;

Therefore, be it resolved, shareholders request that PayPal modify its committee charters, Bylaws or Articles of Incorporation
to ensure that our Human and Indigenous Peoples’ Rights Policies clearly delineate the fiduciary duties of Board and
management to respect and honor global human and indigenous peoples’ rights in all relevant business transactions.

PAYPAL’S STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION
PayPal is committed to the highest standards of social responsibility and human rights in our business operations, and respecting
the dignity of every person is a long-held commitment. We have carefully considered the stockholder proposal, and our Board does
not believe that formally amending our corporate governance documents is an effective or appropriate way to address human
rights.

We operate with a strong mission and vision and set values that are grounded in the idea that it is a critical role of businesses
today to be a force for good in our world. We believe that our Company must have a purpose beyond profit and that our
customers, employees and other stakeholders increasingly expect us to take meaningful action. Consistent with our mission, vision
and purpose, we work meaningfully to respect and honor global human rights in our business operations.

Social
We are committed to improving financial participation and health for individuals and businesses, powering charitable giving to
nonprofits around the world, and strengthening the communities in which we live and work. Inclusion and equality are at the heart
of our mission to make moving and managing money a right for all. This mission extends to how we treat one another and how we
operate in the world. It shapes our culture, strengthens our communities, guides our actions, and is evidenced in our drive to
create a fully inclusive workplace. For example:

• PayPal is committed to improving the health of local communities and the strength of the global economy. Through products

such as PayPal Working Capital, we have been at the forefront of helping small businesses gain access to capital since 2013,
providing more than $4.5 billion in funding to more than 140,000 small businesses, many in communities where physical bank
branches are not easily accessible.

• PayPal partners with Village Capital, an organization that trains and invests in seed-stage social entrepreneurs. Together we are

supporting entrepreneurs focused on democratizing access to financial services for low-wealth individuals and families around
the world.

• PayPal has provided Kiva, an international nonprofit that pioneers micro-lending to small entrepreneurs around the world,

fee-free transactions for over a decade. PayPal’s support has helped enable Kiva to provide interest-free loans to approximately
2.5 million entrepreneurs in 86 countries, many of whom are female and lack other methods of access to capital. Additionally,
PayPal connects skilled volunteers with Kiva projects, promotes and manages a lending campaign with consumers and
employees, and cross-promotes Kiva’s platform to small merchants on PayPal.

• We are committed to providing charitable organizations with the tools and technology they need to raise mission-critical funds.

During the 2017 holiday season, the global PayPal community contributed over $1 billion to charities and nonprofits with
donations coming from people in 175 different countries.

• More information about our efforts to improve financial participation and health for individuals and businesses, power

charitable giving to nonprofits around the world, and strengthen the communities in which we live and work can be found on

Inclusion and Diversity
We are a purpose-driven company whose beliefs are reflected in the way we do business every day. One area that is of particular
importance is inclusion and diversity. For example:

• PayPal’s vision is for everyone to have access to our services, subject to our ability to properly meet the customer needs,

mitigate risk, and address regulatory and compliance requirements and resource allocation considerations in regions where our
services are not currently available.

• Through our core business we are working on ways to use technology and data to serve underserved customers. For consumers

•

sending money overseas with our Xoom and PayPal products, it costs consumers on average just 3.93% of the amount sent
compared with World Bank data demonstrating that the average cost of sending a remittance is 7.45%.
In 2018, for the third year in a row, PayPal received a perfect score of 100 percent on the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate
Equality Index, which is a U.S. national report from the Human Rights Campaign about practices and polices related to LGBTQ
workplace equality, such as non-discrimination protections, domestic partner benefits, transgender-inclusive health care
benefits, and public engagement. PayPal supports efforts to make the discrimination of LGBTQ persons unlawful through
legislative efforts, including participation in amicus curiae briefs and through public endorsement of the Equality Act bill. Our
employee affinity group, Pride, serves as a platform for LGBTQ community events and other activities within PayPal, with
chapters in PayPal offices across the globe.

Governance
From a governance perspective, our ARC Committee, consisting entirely of independent directors, already supports the Board in
overseeing and assessing key current and emerging risks facing the Company, including factors that contribute to our operational
and reputational exposures. In addition, we have adopted both a Code of Business Conduct & Ethics, which is applicable to all of
our directors and employees, as well as a Supplier Code of Business Conduct & Ethics, which is applicable to our suppliers, vendors
and

www.paypal.com

82

Proposal 8

consultants. Both of these governance documents provide clear guidance on how we should conduct business for the benefit of
ourselves, our colleagues, our customers, our suppliers and our stockholders. These policies are available at https://investor.paypal-
corp.com/corporate-governance.cfm and https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/about/responsible-practices.

Our Board and management are committed to working together to continue to advance the Company’s commitment to human
rights. Our existing governance framework has produced a strong commitment to human rights and progress that is evident in our
established policies, practices and procedures, which continue to evolve. As a result, our Board believes that the proposal’s
recommendations are unnecessary and counterproductive in light of our existing commitment to human rights.

In light of the measures that PayPal has already taken to maintain the highest standards of social responsibility and human rights
in the operations of our business, we believe that the formal amendments to our corporate governance documents requested by
the proponent is not necessary and would not be beneficial to PayPal or our stockholders. The Board therefore recommends a
vote AGAINST the proposal.

Questions and Answers
PROXY MATERIALS
1. Why did I receive these proxy materials?

The Board has made these materials available to you on the Internet or, upon your request, has delivered printed proxy
materials to you, in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Company for use at our Annual Meeting, which will take
place exclusively online on May 23, 2018. You are receiving these materials because you were a stockholder at the close of
business on April 3, 2018, the record date, and are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. This proxy statement and our 2017
Annual Report on Form 10-K, together with a proxy card or voting instruction form, are being mailed to stockholders
beginning on or about April 12, 2018.

2. What is included in the proxy materials?

The proxy materials include:

• Our proxy statement for the Annual Meeting, which includes information that we are required to provide to you under SEC

rules and that is designed to assist you in voting your shares; and

• Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.

If you received a paper copy of these materials by mail, the proxy materials also include a proxy card or a voting instruction
form for the Annual Meeting. If you received a “Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials” (described below) instead of
a paper copy of the proxy materials, see Question 10 below for information regarding how you can vote your shares.

3. Why did I receive a notice in the mail regarding the Internet availability of proxy materials instead of a full set of proxy

materials?
We are distributing our proxy materials to certain stockholders over the Internet under the “notice and access” approach in
accordance with SEC rules. As a result, we are mailing to many of our stockholders a “Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy
Materials” (“Notice”) of the proxy materials instead of a paper copy of the proxy materials. All stockholders receiving the
Notice will have the ability to access the proxy materials over the Internet and request to receive a paper copy of the proxy
materials by mail. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request a paper copy may be
found in the Notice. In addition, the Notice contains instructions on how you may request access to proxy materials in printed
form by mail or electronically on an ongoing basis.

t
a
t

This approach conserves natural resources and reduces our printing and distribution costs, while providing a timely and
convenient method of accessing the materials and voting. On April 12, 2018, we mailed the Notice to participating
stockholders, containing instructions on how to access the proxy materials on the Internet.

4. How can I access the proxy materials over the Internet?

Your Notice, proxy card or voting instruction card will contain instructions on how to:

• view our proxy materials for the annual meeting on the Internet; and
•

instruct us to send our future proxy materials to you electronically by e-mail.

Our proxy materials are also available on our website at https://investor.paypal-corp.com/annuals-proxies.cfm and our proxy
materials will be available during the voting period starting on April 12, 2018.

Instead of receiving future copies of our proxy statements and annual reports by mail, stockholders of record and most
beneficial owners can elect to receive an email that will provide an electronic link to these documents. Choosing to receive
your proxy materials by email will save us the cost of printing and mailing documents to you and reduce the environmental
impact of our annual meetings of stockholders. Your election to receive future proxy materials by email will remain in effect
until you revoke it.

Stockholder of Record
If you vote on the Internet, simply follow the prompts to
enroll in the electronic proxy delivery service. You also may
enroll in the electronic proxy delivery service at any time in
the future by going directly to https://investor.paypal-
corp.com/annuals-proxies.cfm and following the enrollment
instructions.

Beneficial Owner
If you hold your shares in a brokerage account or through
a broker, bank, or other nominee, you also may be able to
receive copies of these documents electronically. Please
check the information provided in the proxy materials
sent to you by your broker, bank or other nominee
regarding the availability of this service.

84 Other Information

5. How may I obtain a paper copy of the proxy materials?

Stockholders who receive a paper copy of the Notice will find instructions about how to obtain a paper copy of the proxy
materials on the Notice. Stockholders who receive the Notice by email will find instructions about how to obtain a paper copy
of the proxy materials as part of that email. All stockholders of record who do not receive a Notice by paper copy or email will
receive a paper copy of the proxy materials by mail.

6.

I share an address with another stockholder and we received only one paper copy of the proxy materials or Notice. How
may I obtain an additional copy?
We have adopted a procedure called “householding,” which the SEC has approved. Under this procedure, we deliver a single
copy of the Notice and, if applicable, the proxy materials to multiple stockholders who share the same address unless we
received contrary instructions from one or more of the stockholders. This procedure reduces our printing and mailing costs
and fees. Stockholders who participate in householding will continue to be able to access and receive separate proxy cards.

Upon written request, we will deliver promptly a separate copy of the Notice and, if applicable, the proxy materials to any
stockholder at a shared address to which we delivered a single copy of any of these documents. To receive a separate copy of
the Notice and, if applicable, the proxy materials, stockholders of record may contact Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. at:

• By Internet: www.proxyvote.com
• By telephone: 1-800-579-1639
• By email: sendmaterial@proxyvote.com

Additionally, stockholders who share the same address and receive multiple copies of the Notice can request a single Notice
by contacting us at the address, email address or telephone number above.

Beneficial owners of shares may contact their brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer, or other nominee to request information
about householding.

9. What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?

Most PayPal stockholders hold their shares as a beneficial owner through a bank, broker or other nominee rather than directly
in their own name. As summarized below, there are some important distinctions between shares held of record and those
owned beneficially.

Stockholder of Record
If your shares are registered directly in your name with
PayPal’s transfer agent, Computershare Shareowner
Services LLC, you are considered the stockholder of record
with respect to those shares. The Notice and proxy
statement and any accompanying documents, if applicable,
have been provided directly to you by PayPal.

Beneficial Owner
If your shares are held in a brokerage account or by a bank
or other holder of record, you are considered the “beneficial
owner” of those shares (this is also commonly referred to as
holding shares in “street name”). Accordingly, the Notice
and proxy statement and any accompanying documents, if
applicable, have been provided to your broker, bank, or
other holder of record, who in turn provided the materials
to you. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct
your broker, bank or other holder of record how to vote
your shares by using the voting instruction card or by
following their instructions for voting on the Internet or by
telephone.

10. How do I vote?

Stockholders may vote by Internet, telephone, mail, or in person by attending the virtual Annual Meeting by webcast. Please
make sure that you have your Notice, proxy card or voting instruction form available and carefully follow the instructions.

Stockholder of Record
By Internet: vote your shares online at www.proxyvote.com.

submitting a revised proxy by Internet, telephone, or paper ballot after the date of the revoked proxy; or

•
•
• voting in person by attending the virtual Annual Meeting by webcast.

If you are a beneficial owner of shares, you may submit new voting instructions by contacting your broker, bank or other

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent auditor for 2018, unless you provide specific instructions by completing and
returning the voting instruction form or following the instructions provided to you to vote your shares on the Internet or by
telephone. If you do not provide voting instructions, your shares will not be voted on any proposal on which the broker does
not have discretionary authority to vote. This is called a “broker non-vote” and will have no effect on the Proposals described
above except for Proposal 5 (see Question 7 above). For your vote to be counted, you will need to communicate your voting
decision to your broker, bank or other nominee before the date of the Annual Meeting.

14. What constitutes a quorum?

A majority of the shares of PayPal common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, present in person or represented by
proxy, is necessary to constitute a quorum for purposes of adopting proposals at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker
non-votes are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum.

15. Who will bear the cost of soliciting votes for the Annual Meeting?

We bear all expenses incurred in connection with the solicitation of proxies. We have engaged D.F. King & Co., Inc. to assist us
in distributing proxy materials and soliciting proxies for a fee of $15,000, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. We will
reimburse brokerage houses and other custodians, fiduciaries, and nominees for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for
forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of shares. Our directors, officers, and employees may solicit proxies in person,
by mail, by telephone, or by electronic communication, but they will not receive any additional compensation for these
activities.

16. What happens if additional matters are presented at the Annual Meeting?

Other than the nine items of business described in this proxy statement, we are not aware of any other business to be acted
upon at the Annual Meeting. If you grant a proxy, the persons named as proxy holders, Daniel H. Schulman, John D. Rainey, A.
Louise Pentland, Wanji Walcott and Brian Y. Yamasaki, will have the discretion to vote your shares on any additional matters
properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting. If, for any reason, any of the nominees is not available as a candidate for
director, the persons named as proxy holders will vote your proxy for such other candidate or candidates as may be
nominated by the Board.

17. Where can I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting?

We will announce preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting. We will publish the final voting results in a Current Report

ATTENDING THE ANNUAL MEETING
18. How can I attend the Annual Meeting?

The Annual Meeting will be a completely virtual meeting of stockholders, which will be conducted exclusively via live webcast.
You are entitled to participate in the annual meeting only if you were a PayPal stockholder as of the close of business on
April 3, 2018, the record date, or if you hold a valid proxy for the annual meeting.

You will be able to attend the Annual Meeting online and submit your questions during the meeting by visiting
pypl.onlineshareholdermeeting.com. You also will be able to vote your shares by attending the virtual Annual Meeting online.

To participate in the annual meeting, you will need the 16-digit control number included on your Notice, on your proxy card or

time. Online check-in will begin at 7:45 a.m., Pacific Time, and you should allow sufficient time for the check-in procedures.

19. Why are you holding a virtual meeting instead of a physical meeting?

We are excited to embrace the latest technology to provide expanded access, improved communication and cost savings for
our stockholders and our Company. We believe that hosting a virtual meeting will enable more of our stockholders to attend
and participate in the meeting since our stockholders can participate from any location around the world with Internet access.

20. What is the deadline to propose actions for consideration at next year’s Annual Meeting of Stockholders or to nominate

individuals to serve as directors?
Stockholder Proposals: Stockholders may present proper proposals for inclusion in our proxy statement and for consideration

Corporate Secretary in a timely manner. For a stockholder proposal to be considered for inclusion in our proxy statement for
our 2019 Annual Meeting, our Corporate Secretary must receive the written proposal at our principal executive offices no later

reasonably determined to inform stockholders. In addition, stockholder proposals must otherwise comply with the

Our Bylaws also establish an advance notice procedure for stockholders who wish to present a proposal before an annual

Company and specified in the notice of a meeting given by or at the direction of our Board, (2) brought before the meeting by
or at the direction of our Board, or (3) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder of record entitled to

If a stockholder who has notified us of his or her intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting does not appear
virtually (for a virtual annual meeting) or in person (for a physical annual meeting) to present his or her proposal at such
meeting, we are not required to present the proposal for a vote at such meeting.

Nomination of Director Candidates: You may propose director candidates for consideration by our Governance Committee.
Any such recommendations should include the nominee’s name and qualifications for membership on our Board, and should
be directed to our Corporate Secretary at the address set forth above. For additional information regarding stockholder
recommendations for director candidates, see “Proposal 1—Election of Directors—Consideration of Director Nominees—

In addition, our Bylaws permit stockholders to nominate directors for election at an annual meeting of stockholders. To
nominate a director, the stockholder must provide the information required by our Bylaws. In addition, the stockholder must
give timely notice to our Corporate Secretary in accordance with our Bylaws, which, in general, require that our Corporate
Secretary receive the notice within the time period described above under “Stockholder Proposals” for stockholder proposals
that are not intended to be included in our proxy statement.

We advise you to review our Bylaws, which contain these and other requirements with respect to advance notice of
stockholder proposals and director nominations, including certain information that must be included concerning the
stockholder and each proposal and nominee. Our Bylaws were filed with the SEC on February 7, 2018 as an exhibit to the

Termination of Service, including, without limitation, questions relating to the nature and type of Termination of
Service, and all questions of whether particular leaves of absence constitute Termination of Service; provided, however,
that, with respect to Incentive Stock Options, unless the Committee otherwise provides in the terms of the Award
Agreement, a leave of absence, change in status from an employee to an independent contractor or other change in
the employee-employer relationship shall constitute a Termination of Service if, and to the extent that, such leave of
absence, change in status or other change interrupts employment for the purposes of Section 422(a)(2) of the Code
and the then applicable regulations and revenue rulings under said Section. For purposes of the Plan, a Participant shall
be deemed to have a Termination of Service in the event that the Subsidiary employing or contracting with such
Participant ceases to remain a Subsidiary following any merger, sale of stock or other corporate transaction or event
(including, without limitation, a spin-off).

ARTICLE 3. SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN
3.1 Number of Shares.

(a)

Subject to Article 11 and Section 3.1(b), the aggregate number of shares of Stock which may be issued or transferred
pursuant to Awards granted under the Plan is 145,000,000 which includes the aggregate number of shares of Stock
subject to all Assumed Spin-Off Awards. Any shares of Stock that are subject to Awards granted under the Plan on or
after the 2016 annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders (the “2016 Annual Meeting”) other than Full Value
Awards shall be counted against this limit as 0.50 shares for every share of Stock subject to the Award granted. Any
shares of Stock that are subject to Full Value Awards granted under the Plan shall be counted against this limit as one
(1) share for every share of Stock subject to the Award granted.

(b) To the extent that an Award terminates, expires, or lapses for any reason, or such an Award is settled in cash without

delivery of shares to the Participant, then any shares of Stock subject to the Award shall again be available for the grant
of an Award pursuant to the Plan. Any such shares of Stock that cease to be subject to such an Award other than a Full
Value Award shall be added to the number of shares available under the Plan as the number of shares of Stock (or
portion thereof) deemed subject to such Award under Section 3.1(a) as of the date of grant for every share of Stock
that ceases to be subject to such Award. Any such shares of Stock that cease to be subject to a Full Value Award shall
be added to the number of shares available under the Plan as one (1) share for every share of Stock that ceases to be
subject to such Award. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 3.1(b) to the contrary, shares of Stock subject to an
Award may not again be made available for issuance under this Plan if such shares are: (x) shares delivered to or
withheld by the Company to pay the exercise price of an Option or SAR, (y) shares delivered to or withheld by the
Company to satisfy withholding taxes related to such an Award or (z) shares that were subject to an Award and were
not issued upon the net settlement of such Award. To the extent permitted by applicable law or any exchange rule,
shares of Stock issued in assumption of, or in substitution for, any outstanding Awards of any entity acquired in any
form of combination by the Company or any Subsidiary shall not be counted against shares of Stock available for grant
pursuant to this Plan. The payment of Dividend Equivalents in cash in conjunction with any outstanding Awards shall
not be counted against the shares available for issuance under the Plan. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
Section 3.1(b), no shares of Stock may again be optioned, granted or awarded if such action would cause an Incentive
Stock Option to fail to qualify as an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Code.

Stock Distributed. Any Stock distributed pursuant to an Award may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued
Stock, treasury Stock or Stock purchased on the open market.

Limitation on Number of Shares Subject to Awards. Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, and subject
to Article 11, the maximum number of shares of Stock with respect to one or more Awards that may be granted to any one
Participant during any calendar year shall be 2,000,000 and the maximum amount that may be paid in cash during any
calendar year with respect to any performance-based Award (including, without limitation, any Performance Bonus Award)
shall be $3,000,000; provided, however, that such limits shall apply without regard to the Assumed Spin-Off Awards. Any
shares of Stock that are subject to Awards granted under the Plan on or after the 2016 Annual Meeting other than Full Value
Awards shall be counted against this limit as 0.50 shares for every share of Stock subject to the Award granted. Any shares of
Stock that are subject to Full Value Awards granted under the Plan shall be counted against this limit as one (1) share for
every share of Stock subject to the Award granted. Awards to Non-Employee Directors and Independent Directors are
subject to the limits set forth in Article 10.

from among all Eligible Individuals, those to whom Awards shall be granted and shall determine the nature and amount of
each Award. No Eligible Individual shall have any right to be granted an Award pursuant to this Plan. In connection with the
Spin-Off and pursuant to the terms of the Employee Matters Agreement between the Company and eBay Inc., entered into
in connection with the Spin-Off, certain employees, consultants and directors of the Company, eBay Inc. and their respective
subsidiaries will receive Assumed Spin-Off Awards.

4.2 Foreign Participants. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, in order to comply with the laws in other

countries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate or have Eligible Individuals, the Committee, in its sole
discretion, shall have the power and authority to: (i) determine which Subsidiaries shall be covered by the Plan; (ii) determine
which Eligible Individuals outside the United States are eligible to participate in the Plan; (iii) modify the terms and
conditions of any Award granted to Eligible Individuals outside the United States to comply with applicable foreign laws;
(iv) establish subplans and modify exercise procedures and other terms and procedures, to the extent such actions may be
necessary or advisable, including adoption of rules, procedures or sub-plans applicable to particular Subsidiaries or
Participants residing in particular locations; provided, however, that no such subplans and/or modifications shall increase the
share limitations contained in Sections 3.1 and 3.3 of the Plan; and (v) take any action, before or after an Award is made, that
it deems advisable to obtain approval or comply with any necessary local governmental regulatory exemptions or approvals.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee is specifically authorized to adopt rules, procedures and
sub-plans with provisions that limit or modify rights on eligibility to receive an Award under the Plan or on death, disability,
retirement or other Termination of Service, available methods of exercise or settlement of an Award, payment of income,
social insurance contributions and payroll taxes, the shifting of employer tax liability to the Participant, the withholding
procedures and handling of any Stock certificates or other indicia of ownership. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Committee may not take any actions hereunder, and no Awards shall be granted, that would violate the Exchange Act, the
Code, any securities law or governing statute or any other law applicable to the Stock or the issuance of Stock under the Plan.

ARTICLE 5. STOCK OPTIONS
5.1

General. The Committee is authorized to grant Options to Eligible Individuals on the following terms and conditions:
(a) Exercise Price. The exercise price per share of Stock subject to an Option shall be determined by the Committee and

less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of grant.

(b) Time and Conditions of Exercise. The Committee shall determine the time or times at which an Option may be

exercised in whole or in part; provided, that the term of any Option granted under the Plan shall not exceed ten years.
The Committee shall determine the time period, including the time period following a Termination of Service, during
which the Participant has the right to exercise the vested Options, which time period may not extend beyond the term
of the Option. Except as limited by the requirements of Section 409A or Section 422 of the Code and regulations and
rulings thereunder, the Committee may extend the term of any outstanding Option, and may extend the time period
during which vested Options may be exercised, in connection with any Termination of Service of the Participant, and
may amend any other term or condition of such Option relating to such a Termination of Service. The Committee shall
also determine the performance or other conditions, if any, that must be satisfied before all or part of an Option may
be exercised.
Evidence of Grant. All Options shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement between the Company and the Participant.
The Award Agreement shall include such additional provisions as may be specified by the Committee.

(c)

5.2

Incentive Stock Options. Incentive Stock Options shall be granted only to Employees and the terms of any Incentive Stock
Options granted pursuant to the Plan, in addition to the requirements of Section 5.1, must comply with the provisions of this
Section 5.2.
(a) Expiration. Subject to Section 5.2(c), an Incentive Stock Option shall expire and may not be exercised to any extent by

Ten years from the date it is granted, unless an earlier time is set in the Award Agreement;

(i)
(ii) Three months after the Participant’s termination of employment as an Employee; and
(iii) One year after the date of the Participant’s termination of employment or service on account of Disability or
death. Upon the Participant’s Disability or death, any Incentive Stock Options exercisable at the Participant’s
Disability or death may be exercised by the Participant’s legal representative or representatives, by the person or
persons entitled to do so pursuant to the Participant’s last will and testament, or, if the Participant fails to make
testamentary disposition of such Incentive Stock Option or dies intestate, by the person or persons entitled to
receive the Incentive Stock Option pursuant to the applicable laws of descent and distribution.

(b) Dollar Limitation. The aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the time the Option is granted) of all shares of
Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are first exercisable by a Participant in any calendar year may not
exceed $100,000 or such other limitation as imposed by Section 422(d) of the Code, or any successor provision. To the
extent that Incentive Stock Options are first exercisable by a Participant in excess of such limitation, the excess shall be
considered Non-Qualified Stock Options.

2017 Annual Report / 2018 Proxy Statement

Appendix A A-7

(c) Ten Percent Owners. An Incentive Stock Option shall be granted to any individual who, at the date of grant, owns

stock possessing more than ten percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of Stock of the Company only
if such Option is granted at a price that is not less than 110% of Fair Market Value on the date of grant (or the date the
Option is modified, extended or renewed for purposes of Section 424(h) of the Code) and the Option is exercisable for
no more than five years from the date of grant.

(d) Notice of Disposition. The Participant shall give the Company prompt notice of any disposition of shares of Stock

Failure to Meet Requirements. Any Option (or portion thereof) purported to be an Incentive Stock Option, which, for
(f)
any reason, fails to meet the requirements of Section 422 of the Code shall be considered a Non-Qualified Stock
Option.

5.3

Substitution of Stock Appreciation Rights. Subject to Section 9.8, the Committee may provide in the Award Agreement
evidencing the grant of an Option that the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall have to right to substitute a Stock
Appreciation Right for such Option at any time prior to or upon exercise of such Option; provided, that such Stock
Appreciation Right shall be exercisable with respect to the same number of shares of Stock for which such substituted
Option would have been exercisable.

5.4 Substitute Awards. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article 5 to the contrary, in the case of an Option that

is a Substitute Award, the exercise price per share of the shares subject to such Option may be less than the Fair Market
Value per share on the date of grant, provided, that the excess of: (a) the aggregate Fair Market Value (as of the date such
Substitute Award is granted) of the shares subject to the Substitute Award, over (b) the aggregate exercise price thereof
does not exceed the excess of: (x) the aggregate fair market value (as of the time immediately preceding the transaction
giving rise to the Substitute Award, such fair market value to be determined by the Committee) of the shares of the
predecessor entity that were subject to the grant assumed or substituted for by the Company, over (y) the aggregate
exercise price of such shares.

ARTICLE 6. RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS
6.1 Grant of Restricted Stock.

(a) The Committee is authorized to make Awards of Restricted Stock to any Eligible Individual selected by the Committee
in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as determined by the Committee. All Awards of Restricted
Stock shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement.

(b) The Committee shall establish the purchase price, if any, and form of payment for Restricted Stock; provided, however,

that such purchase price shall be no less than the par value of the Stock to be purchased, unless otherwise permitted
by applicable state law. In all cases, legal consideration shall be required for each issuance of Restricted Stock.

6.2

Issuance and Restrictions. All shares of Restricted Stock (including any shares received by Participants thereof with respect
to shares of Restricted Stock as a result of stock dividends, stock splits or any other form of recapitalization) shall, in the
terms of each individual Award Agreement, be subject to such restrictions on transferability and other restrictions and
vesting requirements as the Committee shall provide. Such restrictions may include, without limitation, restrictions
concerning voting rights and transferability and such restrictions may lapse separately or in combination at such times and
pursuant to such circumstances or based on such criteria as selected by the Committee, including, without limitation, criteria
based on the Participant’s duration of employment, directorship or consultancy with the Company, Performance Criteria,
Company performance, individual performance or other criteria selected by the Committee. By action taken after the
Restricted Stock is issued, the Committee may, on such terms and conditions as it may determine to be appropriate,
accelerate the vesting of such Restricted Stock by removing any or all of the restrictions imposed by the terms of the Award
Agreement. Restricted Stock may not be sold or encumbered until all restrictions are terminated or expire.

6.3 Repurchase or Forfeiture of Restricted Stock. If no price was paid by the Participant for the Restricted Stock, upon a

Termination of Service the Participant’s rights in unvested Restricted Stock then subject to restrictions shall lapse, and such
Restricted Stock shall be surrendered to the Company without consideration. If a price was paid by the Participant for the
Restricted Stock, upon a Termination of Service the Company shall have the right to repurchase from the Participant the
unvested Restricted Stock then subject to restrictions at a cash price per share equal to the price paid by the Participant for
such Restricted Stock or such other amount as may be specified in the Award Agreement. The Committee in its discretion
may provide that in the event of certain events, including a Change in Control, the Participant’s death, retirement or
disability or any other specified Termination of Service or any other event, the Participant’s rights in unvested Restricted
Stock shall not lapse, such Restricted Stock shall vest and, if applicable, the Company shall not have a right of repurchase.

6.4 Certificates for Restricted Stock. Restricted Stock granted pursuant to the Plan may be evidenced in such manner as the

Committee shall determine. If certificates representing shares of Restricted Stock are registered in the name of the

such Restricted Stock, and the Company may, at its discretion, retain physical possession of the certificate until such time as
all applicable restrictions lapse.

6.5

Section 83(b) Election. If a Participant makes an election under Section 83(b) of the Code to be taxed with respect to the
Restricted Stock as of the date of transfer of the Restricted Stock rather than as of the date or dates upon which the
Participant would otherwise be taxable under Section 83(a) of the Code, the Participant shall be required to deliver a copy of
such election to the Company promptly after filing such election with the Internal Revenue Service.

ARTICLE 7. STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

Right pursuant to the Plan) to exercise all or a specified portion of the Stock Appreciation Right (to the extent then
exercisable pursuant to its terms) and to receive from the Company an amount equal to the product of (i) the excess
of (A) the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the date the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised over (B) the Fair Market
Value of the Stock on the date the Stock Appreciation Right was granted and (ii) the number of shares of Stock with
respect to which the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised, subject to any limitations the Committee may impose.
Except as described in (c) below, the exercise price per share of Stock subject to each Stock Appreciation Right shall be
set by the Committee, but shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value on the date the Stock Appreciation
Right is granted.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 7.1(b) to the contrary, in the case of a Stock Appreciation Right

that is a Substitute Award, the price per share of the shares subject to such Stock Appreciation Right may be less than
the Fair Market Value per share on the date of grant; provided, that the excess of: (a) the aggregate Fair Market Value
(as of the date such Substitute Award is granted) of the shares subject to the Substitute Award, over (b) the aggregate
exercise price thereof does not exceed the excess of: (x) the aggregate fair market value (as of the time immediately
preceding the transaction giving rise to the Substitute Award, such fair market value to be determined by the
Committee) of the shares of the predecessor entity that were subject to the grant assumed or substituted for by the
Company, over (y) the aggregate exercise price of such shares.

7.2 Payment and Limitations on Exercise.

(a)

Subject to Sections 7.2(b) payment of the amounts determined under Section 7.1(b) above shall be in cash, in Stock
(based on its Fair Market Value as of the date the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised) or a combination of both, as
determined by the Committee in the Award Agreement and subject to any tax withholding requirements.

(b) To the extent any payment under Section 7.1(b) is effected in Stock, it shall be made subject to satisfaction of all

Share awards which shall be denominated in a number of shares of Stock and which may be linked to any one or more of the
Performance Criteria or other specific performance criteria determined appropriate by the Committee, in each case on a

Committee shall consider (among such other factors as it deems relevant in light of the specific type of award) the
contributions, responsibilities and other compensation of the particular Participant.

8.2 Performance Stock Units. Any Eligible Individual selected by the Committee may be granted one or more Performance
Stock Unit awards which shall be denominated in unit equivalent of shares of Stock and/or units of value including dollar

performance criteria determined appropriate by the Committee, in each case on a specified date or dates or over any period
or periods determined by the Committee. In making such determinations, the Committee shall consider (among such other
factors as it deems relevant in light of the specific type of award) the contributions, responsibilities and other compensation
of the particular Participant.

8.3 Dividend Equivalents.

(a) Any Eligible Individual selected by the Committee may be granted Dividend Equivalents based on the dividends

declared on the shares of Stock that are subject to any Award, to be credited as of dividend payment dates, during the
period between the date the Award is granted and the date the Award is exercised, vests or expires, as determined by
the Committee. Such Dividend Equivalents shall be converted to cash or additional shares of Stock by such formula
and at such time and subject to such limitations as may be determined by the Committee; provided, that to the extent
shares of Stock subject to an Award are subject to vesting conditions, any Dividend Equivalents relating to such shares
shall be subject to the same vesting conditions.

2017 Annual Report / 2018 Proxy Statement

Appendix A A-9

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Dividend Equivalents shall be payable with respect to Options or SARs.

8.4 Stock Payments. Any Eligible Individual selected by the Committee may receive Stock Payments in the manner determined

determined to be appropriate by the Committee, including service to the Company or any Subsidiary, in each case on a
specified date or dates or over any period or periods determined by the Committee. Stock underlying a Deferred Stock Unit
award will not be issued until the Deferred Stock Unit award has vested, pursuant to a vesting schedule or performance
criteria set by the Committee. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, a Participant awarded Deferred Stock Units
shall have no rights as a Company stockholder with respect to such Deferred Stock Units until such time as the Deferred
Stock Unit Award has vested and the Stock underlying the Deferred Stock Unit Award has been issued.

8.6 Restricted Stock Units. The Committee is authorized to make Awards of Restricted Stock Units to any Eligible Individual

selected by the Committee in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as determined by the Committee. At
the time of grant, the Committee shall specify the date or dates on which the Restricted Stock Units shall become fully
vested and nonforfeitable, and may specify such conditions to vesting as it deems appropriate. The Committee shall specify,
or permit the Participant to elect, the conditions and dates upon which the shares of Stock underlying the Restricted Stock
Units shall be issued, which dates shall not be earlier than the date as of which the Restricted Stock Units vest and become
nonforfeitable and which conditions and dates shall be subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Code. On the
distribution dates, the Company shall, subject to Section 9.6(b), transfer to the Participant one unrestricted, fully
transferable share of Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit scheduled to be paid out on such date and not previously forfeited.

8.7 Performance Bonus Awards. Any Eligible Individual selected by the Committee may be granted one or more performance-

permitted by applicable state law.

8.10 Exercise or Payment upon Termination of Service. An Award of Performance Shares, Performance Stock Units, Dividend

Equivalents, Deferred Stock Units, Stock Payments and Restricted Stock Units shall only be exercisable or payable while the
Participant is an Employee, Consultant or Director, as applicable; provided, however, that the Committee in its sole and
absolute discretion may provide that an Award of Performance Shares, Performance Stock Units, Dividend Equivalents,
Stock Payments, Deferred Stock Units or Restricted Stock Units may be exercised or paid subsequent to a Termination of
Service, as applicable, or following a Change in Control of the Company, or because of the Participant’s retirement, death or

Participant’s employment or service terminates, and the Company’s authority to unilaterally or bilaterally amend, modify,
suspend, cancel or rescind an Award.

9.3 Payment. The Committee shall determine the methods by which payments by any Participant with respect to any Awards

granted under the Plan may be paid, the form of payment including, without limitation: (i) cash, (ii) shares of Stock
(including, in the case of payment of the exercise price of an Award, shares of Stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of the
Award) held for such period of time as may be required by the Committee in order to avoid adverse accounting
consequences and having a Fair Market Value on the date of delivery equal to the aggregate payments required, or (iii) other
property acceptable to the Committee (including through the delivery of a notice that the Participant has placed a market
sell order with a broker with respect to shares of Stock then issuable upon exercise or vesting of an Award, and that the
broker has been directed to pay a sufficient portion of the net proceeds of the sale to the Company in satisfaction of the
aggregate payments required; provided, that payment of such proceeds is then made to the Company upon settlement of
such sale). The Committee shall also determine the methods by which shares of Stock shall be delivered or deemed to be
delivered to Participants. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, no Participant who is a Director or
an “executive officer” of the Company within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act shall be permitted to pay the
exercise price of an Option with a loan from the Company or a loan arranged by the Company in violation of Section 13(k) of
the Exchange Act.

9.4 Limits on Transfer.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.4(b):

(i) No Award under the Plan may be sold, pledged, assigned or transferred in any manner other than by will or the

laws of descent and distribution or, subject to the consent of the Committee, pursuant to a DRO, unless and until
such Award has been exercised, or the shares underlying such Award have been issued, and all restrictions
applicable to such shares have lapsed;

(ii) No Award or interest or right therein shall be liable for the debts, contracts or engagements of the Participant or

his successors in interest or shall be subject to disposition by transfer, alienation, anticipation, pledge,
hypothecation, encumbrance, assignment or any other means whether such disposition be voluntary or
involuntary or by operation of law by judgment, levy, attachment, garnishment or any other legal or equitable
proceedings (including bankruptcy), and any attempted disposition thereof shall be null and void and of no effect,
except to the extent that such disposition is permitted by the preceding sentence; and

(iii) During the lifetime of the Participant, only the Participant may exercise an Award (or any portion thereof)

granted to him under the Plan, unless it has been disposed of pursuant to a DRO; after the death of the
Participant, any exercisable portion of an Award may, prior to the time when such portion becomes unexercisable
under the Plan or the applicable Award Agreement, be exercised by his personal representative or by any person
empowered to do so under the deceased Participant’s will or under the then applicable laws of descent and
distribution.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 9.4(a), the Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine to permit a Participant to

transfer an Award other than an Incentive Stock Option to any one or more Permitted Transferees (as defined below),
subject to the following terms and conditions: (i) an Award transferred to a Permitted Transferee shall not be
assignable or transferable by the Permitted Transferee other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution; (ii) an
Award transferred to a Permitted Transferee shall continue to be subject to all the terms and conditions of the Award
as applicable to the original Participant (other than the ability to further transfer the Award); and (iii) the Participant
and the Permitted Transferee shall execute any and all documents requested by the Committee, including, without
limitation documents to (A) confirm the status of the transferee as a Permitted Transferee, (B) satisfy any
requirements for an exemption for the transfer under applicable federal, state and foreign securities laws and
(C) evidence the transfer. For purposes of this Section 9.4(b), “Permitted Transferee” shall mean, with respect to a
Participant, any “family member” of the Participant, as defined under the instructions to the Form S-8 Registration
Statement under the Securities Act, or any other transferee specifically approved by the Committee after taking into
account any state, federal, local or foreign tax and securities laws applicable to transferable Awards.

9.5 Beneficiaries. Notwithstanding Section 9.4, if provided in the applicable Award Agreement, a Participant may, in the manner

determined by the Committee, designate a beneficiary to exercise the rights of the Participant and to receive any
distribution with respect to any Award upon the Participant’s death. A beneficiary, legal guardian, legal representative, or
other person claiming any rights pursuant to the Plan is subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan and any Award
Agreement applicable to the Participant, except to the extent the Plan and Award Agreement otherwise provide, and to any
additional restrictions deemed necessary or appropriate by the Committee. If the Participant is married and resides in a
community property state, a designation of a person other than the Participant’s spouse as his or her beneficiary with
respect to more than 50% of the Participant’s interest in the Award shall not be effective without the prior written consent
of the Participant’s spouse. If no beneficiary designation is provided in the applicable Award Agreement or if no beneficiary
has been designated or survives the Participant (or if a beneficiary designation is not enforceable and/or valid under the
inheritance and other laws in the Participant’s country, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion), payment
shall be made to the person entitled thereto pursuant to the Participant’s will or the laws of descent and distribution.

2017 Annual Report / 2018 Proxy Statement

Subject to the foregoing, a beneficiary designation may be changed or revoked by a Participant at any time provided the
change or revocation is filed with the Committee.

9.6 Stock Certificates; Book Entry Procedures.

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any certificates
or make any book entries evidencing shares of Stock pursuant to the exercise of any Award, unless and until the Board
has determined, with advice of counsel, that the issuance and delivery of such shares is in compliance with all
applicable laws, regulations of governmental authorities and, if applicable, the requirements of any exchange on which
the shares of Stock are listed or traded. All Stock certificates delivered pursuant to the Plan are subject to any stop-
transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee deems necessary or advisable to comply with federal, state, or
foreign jurisdiction, securities or other laws, rules and regulations and the rules of any national securities exchange or
automated quotation system on which the Stock is listed, quoted, or traded. The Committee may place legends on any
Stock certificate to reference restrictions applicable to the Stock. In addition to the terms and conditions provided
herein, the Board may require that a Participant make such reasonable covenants, agreements, and representations as
the Board, in its discretion, deems advisable in order to comply with any such laws, regulations, or requirements. The
Committee shall have the right to require any Participant to comply with any timing or other restrictions with respect
to the settlement or exercise of any Award, including a window-period limitation, as may be imposed in the discretion
of the Committee.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, unless otherwise determined by the Committee or required by any

applicable law, rule or regulation, the Company shall not deliver to any Participant certificates evidencing shares of
Stock issued in connection with any Award and instead such shares of Stock shall be recorded in the books of the
Company (or, as applicable, its transfer agent or stock plan administrator).

9.7 Paperless Administration. In the event that the Company establishes, for itself or using the services of a third party, an
automated system for the documentation, granting or exercise of Awards, such as a system using an internet website or
interactive voice response, then the paperless documentation, granting or exercise of Awards by a Participant may be
permitted through the use of such an automated system.

9.8 Prohibition on Repricing. Subject to Section 11.1, the Committee shall not, without the approval of the stockholders of the

Company, authorize the amendment of any outstanding Award to reduce its price per share. Furthermore, subject to
Section 12.1, no Award shall be canceled and replaced or substituted for with the grant of an Award having a lesser price per
share without the further approval of stockholders of the Company. Subject to Section 11.1, the Committee shall have the
authority, without the approval of the stockholders of the Company, to amend any outstanding award to increase the price
per share or to cancel and replace or substitute for an Award with the grant of an Award having a price per share that is
greater than or equal to the price per share of the original Award. Subject to Section 11.1, absent the approval of the
stockholders of the Company, the Committee shall not offer to buyout for a payment in cash, an Option or Stock
Appreciation Right previously granted when the per share exercise price exceeds the Fair Market Value of the underlying
share of stock.

9.9 Award Vesting Limitations. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, but subject to Sections 6.2,
11.1, 11.2 and 12.3(d) of the Plan, effective as of the 2018 annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders (the “2018 Annual
Meeting”), no portion of Awards granted under the Plan shall vest before the one-year anniversary of the date of grant;
provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Awards that result in the issuance to one or more Participants of an
aggregate of up to 5% of the shares of Stock which may be issued or transferred under the Plan may be granted without
regard to such minimum vesting provisions. Nothing in this Section 9.9 shall preclude the Board or the Committee from
taking action, in its sole discretion, to accelerate the vesting of any Award in connection with or following a Change in
Control.

9.10 Dividends on Unvested Awards. To the extent shares of Stock subject to an Award are subject to vesting conditions, any

dividends related to such unvested shares of Stock shall be subject to the same vesting conditions.

ARTICLE 10. INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR AWARDS
10.1 The Board may grant Awards to Independent Directors, subject to the limitations of the Plan, pursuant to a written

non-discretionary formula established by the Committee, or any successor committee thereto carrying out its
responsibilities on the date of grant of any such Award (the “Independent Director Equity Compensation Policy”). The
Independent Director Equity Compensation Policy shall set forth the type of Award(s) to be granted to Independent
Directors, the number of shares of Stock to be subject to Independent Director Awards, the conditions on which such
Awards shall be granted, become exercisable and/or payable and expire, and such other terms and conditions as the
Committee (or such other successor committee as described above) shall determine in its discretion, except that any
Assumed Spin-Off Awards shall be subject to the terms as in existence as of the completion of the Spin-Off.

10.2 Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, the aggregate grant date fair value of shares of Stock that

may be granted during any fiscal year of the Company to any Non-Employee Director or Independent Director shall not

exceed $600,000; provided, however, that (i) the limit set forth in this sentence shall be multiplied by two in the fiscal year in
which a Non-Employee Director or Independent Director commences service on the Board, and (ii) the limit set forth in this
sentence shall not apply to awards made pursuant to a Non-Employee Director’s or Independent Director’s election to
receive an Award in lieu of all or a portion of a cash retainer for service on the Board or any committee thereunder or
pursuant to conversion of an eBay Inc. award to a Company award.

ARTICLE 11. CHANGES IN CAPITAL STRUCTURE
11.1 Adjustments.

(a)

(b)

(c)

In the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or exchange of shares, merger, consolidation or other
distribution (other than normal cash dividends) of Company assets to stockholders, or any other change affecting the
shares of Stock or the share price of the Stock other than an Equity Restructuring, the Committee shall make such
equitable adjustments, if any, as the Committee in its discretion may deem appropriate to reflect such change with
respect to (i) the aggregate number and kind of shares that may be issued under the Plan (including, but not limited
to, adjustments of the limitations in Sections 3.1 and 3.3); (ii) the number and kind of shares (or other securities or
property) subject to outstanding Awards; (iii) the terms and conditions of any outstanding Awards (including, without
limitation, any applicable performance targets or criteria with respect thereto); and (iv) the grant or exercise price per
share for any outstanding Awards under the Plan.
In the event of any transaction or event described in Section 11.1 or any unusual or nonrecurring transactions or events
affecting the Company, any affiliate of the Company, or the financial statements of the Company or any of its affiliates,
or of changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles, the Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion,
and on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, either by the terms of the Award or by action taken prior to
the occurrence of such transaction or event and either automatically or upon the Participant’s request, is hereby
authorized to take any one or more of the following actions whenever the Committee determines that such action is
appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made
available under the Plan or with respect to any Award under the Plan, to facilitate such transactions or events or to give
effect to such changes in laws, regulations or principles:
(i)

To provide for either (A) termination of any such Award in exchange for an amount of cash, if any, equal to the
amount that would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Participant’s rights
(and, for the avoidance of doubt, if as of the date of the occurrence of the transaction or event described in this
Section 11.1 the Committee determines in good faith that no amount would have been attained upon the exercise
of such Award or realization of the Participant’s rights, then such Award may be terminated by the Company
without payment) or (B) the replacement of such Award with other rights or property selected by the Committee
in its sole discretion;

(ii) To provide that such Award be assumed by the successor or survivor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary

thereof, or shall be substituted for by similar options, rights or awards covering the stock of the successor or
survivor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind
of shares and prices;

(iii) To make adjustments in the number and type of shares of Stock (or other securities or property) subject to

outstanding Awards, and in the number and kind of outstanding Restricted Stock or Deferred Stock Units and/or
in the terms and conditions of (including the grant or exercise price), and the criteria included in, outstanding
options, rights and awards and options, rights and awards which may be granted in the future;

(iv) To provide that such Award shall be exercisable or payable or fully vested with respect to all shares covered

thereby, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan or the applicable Award Agreement; and

(v) To provide that the Award cannot vest, be exercised or become payable after such event.
In connection with the occurrence of any Equity Restructuring, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
Sections 11.1(a) and 11.1(b):
(i)

The number and type of securities subject to each outstanding Award and the exercise price or grant price
thereof, if applicable, will be equitably adjusted. The adjustments provided under this Section 11.1(c)(i) shall be
nondiscretionary and shall be final and binding on the affected Participant and the Company.

(ii) The Committee shall make such equitable adjustments, if any, as the Committee in its discretion may deem

appropriate to reflect such Equity Restructuring with respect to the aggregate number and kind of shares that
may be issued under the Plan (including, but not limited to, adjustments of the limitations in Sections 3.1 and
3.3).

(iii) To the extent that such equitable adjustments result in tax consequences to the Participant, the Participant shall

be responsible for payment of such taxes and shall not be compensated for such payments by the Company or
its Subsidiaries.

(d) The existence of the Plan, the Award Agreement and the Awards granted hereunder shall not affect or restrict in any

way the right or power of the Company or the stockholders of the Company to make or authorize any adjustment,
recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the Company’s capital structure or its business, any merger or
consolidation of the Company, any issue of stock or of options, warrants or rights to purchase stock or of bonds,
debentures, preferred or prior preference stocks whose rights are superior to or affect the Stock or the rights thereof or

which are convertible into or exchangeable for Stock, or the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, or any sale or
transfer of all or any part of its assets or business, or any other corporate act or proceeding, whether of a similar
character or otherwise.

11.2 Acceleration Upon a Change in Control.

(a) Notwithstanding Section 11.1, subject to Section 11.2(b) below, and except as may otherwise be provided in any

applicable Award Agreement or other written agreement entered into between the Company and a Participant, if a
Change in Control occurs and a Participant’s Awards are not converted, assumed, or replaced by a successor entity,
then immediately prior to the Change in Control such Awards shall become fully exercisable and all forfeiture
restrictions on such Awards shall lapse. Upon, or in anticipation of, a Change in Control, the Committee may cause any
and all Awards outstanding hereunder to terminate at a specific time in the future, including but not limited to the
date of such Change in Control, and shall give each Participant the right to exercise such Awards during a period of time
as the Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, shall determine. In the event that the terms of any agreement
between the Company or any Company subsidiary or affiliate and a Participant contains provisions that conflict with
and are more restrictive than the provisions of this Section 11.2, this Section 11.2 shall prevail and control and the more
restrictive terms of such agreement (and only such terms) shall be of no force or effect. Further, to the extent that
there are tax consequences to the Participant as a result of the acceleration or lapsing of forfeiture restriction upon a
Change in Control, the Participant shall be responsible for payment of such taxes and shall not be compensated for
such payment by the Company or its Subsidiaries.

(b) Except as may otherwise be provided in any applicable Award Agreement or other written agreement entered into

between the Company and a Participant, if a Change in Control occurs during the Performance Period with respect to
an outstanding Award that vests based on Performance Goal(s) or other performance-based objectives, the
Performance Period of such Award shall end as of the date of the Change in Control and the Performance Goal(s) or
other performance-based objectives shall be deemed to have been satisfied at the actual level of performance as of the
date of the Change in Control, as determined by the Committee, as constituted immediately prior to the Change in
Control, without proration, and such Award, to the extent deemed earned by the Committee, shall continue to be
subject to time-based vesting following the Change in Control in accordance with the original vesting schedule;
provided, however, that if the Awards are not converted, assumed, or replaced by a successor entity, then immediately
prior to the Change in Control such Awards shall become fully vested pursuant to Section 12.2(a) above.

11.3 No Other Rights. Except as expressly provided in the Plan, no Participant shall have any rights by reason of any subdivision

or consolidation of shares of stock of any class, the payment of any dividend, any increase or decrease in the number of
shares of stock of any class or any dissolution, liquidation, merger, or consolidation of the Company or any other corporation.
Except as expressly provided in the Plan or pursuant to action of the Committee under the Plan, no issuance by the
Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no
adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number of shares of Stock subject to an Award or the grant
or exercise price of any Award.

ARTICLE 12. ADMINISTRATION
12.1 Committee. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Plan shall be administered by a committee consisting of two or more
members of the Board (the “Committee”). Unless otherwise determined by the Board, the Committee shall consist solely of
two or more members of the Board each of whom is a Non-Employee Director and an “independent director” under the rules
of the Nasdaq Stock Market (or other principal securities market on which shares of Stock are traded); provided, that any
action taken by the Committee shall be valid and effective, whether or not members of the Committee at the time of such
action are later determined not to have satisfied the requirements for membership set forth in this Section 12.1 or otherwise
provided in any charter of the Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) the full Board, acting by a majority of its
members in office, shall conduct the general administration of the Plan with respect to all Awards granted to Independent
Directors and for purposes of such Awards the term “Committee” as used in this Plan shall be deemed to refer to the Board
and (b) the Committee may delegate its authority hereunder to the extent permitted by Section 12.5. In its sole discretion,
the Board may at any time and from time to time exercise any and all rights and duties of the Committee under the Plan
except with respect to matters which under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, or any regulations or rules issued
thereunder, are required to be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. Except as may otherwise be provided in
any charter of the Committee, appointment of Committee members shall be effective upon acceptance of appointment;
Committee members may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the Board; and vacancies in the Committee may
only be filled by the Board.

12.2 Action by the Committee. Unless otherwise established by the Board or in any charter of the Committee, a majority of the
Committee shall constitute a quorum and the acts of a majority of the members present at any meeting at which a quorum
is present, and acts approved in writing by a majority of the Committee in lieu of a meeting, shall be deemed the acts of the
Committee. Each member of the Committee is entitled to, in good faith, rely or act upon any report or other information
furnished to that member by any officer or other employee of the Company or any Subsidiary, the Company’s independent
certified public accountants, or any executive compensation consultant or other professional retained by the Company to
assist in the administration of the Plan.

such officers (or Directors). Any delegation hereunder shall be subject to the restrictions and limits that the Board or the
Committee specifies at the time of such delegation, and the Board or the Committee may at any time rescind the authority
so delegated or appoint a new delegatee. At all times, the delegatee appointed under this Section 12.5 shall serve in such
capacity at the pleasure of the Board or the Committee.

ARTICLE 13. EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATE
13.1 Effective Date. The effective date of this Plan is the date the Plan (as it may be amended and/or restated from time to time)

is last approved by the Company’s stockholders (the “Effective Date”). Each award granted under the Plan or subject to a
written binding contract on or before November 2, 2017 shall be subject to the Plan as in effect as of the date on which such
award was granted, and it is intended that each such award continue to be subject to Section 162(m) of the Code as in effect
prior to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

the Effective Date, except that no Incentive Stock Options may be granted under the Plan after the earlier of the tenth

Agreement.

ARTICLE 14. AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION, AND TERMINATION

time to time, the Committee may terminate, amend or modify the Plan; provided, however, that (a) to the extent necessary
and desirable to comply with any applicable law, regulation, or stock exchange rule, the Company shall obtain stockholder

required for any amendment to the Plan that (i) increases the number of shares available under the Plan (other than any

Appendix A A-15

Market Value on the date of grant, (iii) permits the Committee to extend the exercise period for an Option beyond ten years
from the date of grant or (iv) amends Section 9.8 of the Plan.

14.2 Awards Previously Granted. Except with respect to amendments made pursuant to Section 15.16, no termination,

amendment, or modification of the Plan shall adversely affect in any material way any Award previously granted pursuant to
the Plan without the prior written consent of the Participant.

ARTICLE 15. GENERAL PROVISIONS
15.1 No Rights to Awards. No Eligible Individual or other person shall have any claim to be granted any Award pursuant to the

Plan, and neither the Company nor the Committee is obligated to treat Eligible Individuals, Participants or any other persons
uniformly.

15.2 No Stockholders Rights. Except as otherwise provided herein, a Participant shall have none of the rights of a stockholder

with respect to shares of Stock covered by any Award until the Participant becomes the record owner of such shares of
Stock.

15.3 Withholding. The Company or any Subsidiary shall have the authority and the right to deduct or withhold (by any means set

forth herein or in an Award Agreement), or require a Participant to remit to the Company or a Subsidiary, an amount
sufficient to satisfy federal, state, local and foreign income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on
account or other tax-related items related to participation in the Plan and legally applicable to Participant and required by
law to be withheld (including any amount deemed by the Company or the Participant’s employer, in its discretion, to be an
appropriate charge to the Participant even if legally applicable to the Company or the Participant’s employer). The
Committee may, in its discretion and in satisfaction of the foregoing requirement, allow a Participant to elect to have the
Company withhold shares of Stock otherwise issuable under an Award (or allow the return of shares of Stock) having a Fair
Market Value equal to the sums required to be withheld. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the number of
shares of Stock which may be withheld with respect to the issuance, vesting, exercise or payment of any Award (or which
may be repurchased from the Participant of such Award within six months (or such other period as may be determined by
the Committee) after such shares of Stock were acquired by the Participant from the Company) in order to satisfy the
Participant’s federal, state, local and foreign income and payroll tax liabilities with respect to the issuance, vesting, exercise or
payment of the Award (as described above) shall be limited to the number of shares which have a Fair Market Value on the
date of withholding or repurchase equal to the aggregate amount of such liabilities based on the minimum statutory
withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates to the extent that the withholding or repurchase of shares in
excess of such minimum statutory amount would result in adverse accounting consequences to the Company.

15.4 No Right to Employment or Services. Nothing in the Plan or any Award Agreement shall interfere with or limit in any way
the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate any Participant’s employment or services at any time, nor confer
upon any Participant any right to continue in the employ or service of the Company or any Subsidiary.

15.5 Unfunded Status of Awards. The Plan is intended to be an “unfunded” plan for incentive compensation. With respect to any
payments not yet made to a Participant pursuant to an Award, nothing contained in the Plan or any Award Agreement shall
give the Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company or any Subsidiary.

15.6 Assumed Spin-Off Awards. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, each Assumed Spin-Off Award shall be

subject to the terms and conditions of the equity compensation plan and award agreement to which such Award was subject
immediately prior to the Spin-Off, subject to the adjustment of such Award by the Compensation Committee of eBay Inc.
and the terms of the Employee Matters Agreement, dated as of July 17, 2015, between the Company and eBay Inc. entered
into in connection with the Spin-Off; provided, that following July 17, 2015, each such Award shall relate solely to shares of
Stock and be administered by the Committee in accordance with the administrative procedures in effect under this Plan.

each person to whom the Committee delegates its authority under Section 12.5 shall be indemnified and held harmless by
the Company from any loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such member in
connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or
she may be involved by reason of any action or failure to act pursuant to the Plan and against and from any and all amounts
paid by him or her in satisfaction of judgment in such action, suit, or proceeding against him or her; provided he or she gives
the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and
defend it on his or her own behalf. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of
indemnification to which such persons may be entitled pursuant to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, as
a matter of law, or otherwise, or any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless.

15.8 Relationship to Benefits. No payment pursuant to the Plan shall be taken into account in determining any benefits
pursuant to any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, long-term service awards,
pension, retirement, savings, profit sharing, group insurance, welfare or benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary except
to the extent otherwise expressly provided in writing in such other plan or an agreement thereunder.

A-16 Appendix A

15.9 Effect of Plan upon Compensation Plans. The adoption of the Plan shall not affect any compensation or incentive plans in

effect for the Company or any Subsidiary. Nothing in the Plan shall be construed to limit the right of the Company or any
Subsidiary: (a) to establish any forms of incentives or compensation for Employees, Directors or Consultants of the Company
or any Subsidiary, or (b) to grant or assume options or other rights or awards otherwise than under the Plan in connection
with any proper corporate purpose including, without limitation, the grant or assumption of options in connection with the
acquisition by purchase, lease, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of the business, stock or assets of any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, firm or association.

15.10 Awards Subject to Clawback. The Awards and any cash payment or shares of Stock delivered pursuant to an Award are

subject to forfeiture, recovery by the Company or other action pursuant to the applicable Award Agreement or any clawback
or recoupment policy which the Company may adopt from time to time, including without limitation any such policy which
the Company may be required to adopt under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and
implementing rules and regulations thereunder, or as otherwise required by law.

15.11 Expenses. The expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company and its Subsidiaries.

15.12 Titles and Headings. The titles and headings of the Sections in the Plan are for convenience of reference only and, in the

event of any conflict, the text of the Plan, rather than such titles or headings, shall control.

15.13 Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Stock shall be issued and the Committee shall determine, in its discretion, whether
cash shall be given in lieu of fractional shares or whether such fractional shares shall be eliminated by rounding up or down as
appropriate.

15.14 Limitations Applicable to Section 16 Persons. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Plan, and any Award

granted or awarded to any Participant who is then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, shall be subject to any
additional limitations set forth in any applicable exemptive rule under Section 16 of the Exchange Act (including any
amendment to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act) that are requirements for the application of such exemptive rule. To the
extent permitted by applicable law, the Plan and Awards granted or awarded hereunder shall be deemed amended to the
extent necessary to conform to such applicable exemptive rule.

15.15 Compliance with Laws. The Plan, the granting and vesting of Awards under the Plan and the issuance and delivery of shares

of Stock and the payment of money under the Plan or under Awards granted or awarded hereunder are subject to
compliance with all applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations (including but not limited to state,
federal and foreign securities law and margin requirements) and to such approvals by any listing, regulatory or governmental
authority as may, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, be necessary or advisable in connection therewith. The
Company shall have no obligation to issue or deliver shares of Stock prior to obtaining any approvals from listing, regulatory
or governmental authority that the Company determines are necessary or advisable. Any securities delivered under the Plan
shall be subject to such restrictions, and the person acquiring such securities shall, if requested by the Company, provide
such assurances and representations to the Company as the Company may deem necessary or desirable to assure
compliance with all applicable legal requirements. The Company shall be under no obligation to register pursuant to the
Securities Act, any of the shares of Stock paid pursuant to the Plan. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Plan and
Awards granted or awarded hereunder shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such laws, rules and
regulations.

15.16 Governing Law. The Plan and all Award Agreements shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the

State of Delaware, without regard to the principles of conflict of laws of that State.

15.17 Section 409A. To the extent that the Committee determines that any Award granted under the Plan is subject to

Section 409A of the Code, the Award Agreement evidencing such Award shall incorporate the terms and conditions required
by Section 409A of the Code. To the extent applicable, the Plan and Award Agreements shall be interpreted in accordance
with Section 409A of the Code and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder,
including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the Effective Date.
Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, in the event that the Committee determines that any Award may
be subject to Section 409A of the Code and related Department of Treasury guidance (including such Department of
Treasury guidance as may be issued after the Effective Date), the Committee may adopt such amendments to the Plan and
the applicable Award Agreement or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures
with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, that the Committee determines are necessary or appropriate to
(a) exempt the Award from Section 409A of the Code and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the benefits provided
with respect to the Award, or (b) comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and related Department of
Treasury guidance and thereby avoid the application of any penalty taxes under such Section.

PayPal Holdings, Inc.
Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan

1. Establishment of Plan. The board of directors (the “Board”) of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) has, effective as of July 17,
2015, established this Employee Stock Purchase Plan pursuant to which the Company may grant options to purchase shares of the
Company’s common stock (“Common Stock”) to Eligible Employees (as defined in Section 4 below). The Employee Stock
Purchase Plan has been amended and restated by the Board on March 28, 2018, subject to approval of the Company’s stockholders
pursuant to Section 23 hereof (such date, the “Amendment Effective Date”). The Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended and
restated, is referred to herein as the “Plan.”

This Plan includes two components: (a) a component intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423
of the Code (the “423 Component”), the provisions of which shall be construed so as to extend and limit participation in a uniform
and nondiscriminatory manner consistent with the requirements of Section 423 of the Code; and (b) a component that does not
qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Code (the “Non-423 Component”), under which options
shall be granted pursuant to rules, procedures or sub-plans adopted by the Administrator (as defined in Section 3 below) designed
to achieve tax, securities laws or other objectives for Eligible Employees, the Company and its Participating Subsidiaries and
Participating Affiliates (both, as hereinafter defined). Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, the Non-423 Component will
operate and be administered in the same manner as the 423 Component.

For purposes of this Plan, “Subsidiary” means a “subsidiary corporation” of the Company, whether now or hereafter existing, as
such term is defined in Section 424(f) of the Code. “Participating Subsidiary” means any Subsidiary that the Administrator
designates from time to time as eligible to participate in the 423 Component. For purposes of this Plan, “Affiliate” means (a) any
entity that, directly or indirectly, is controlled by, controls or is under common control with, the Company and (b) any entity in
which the Company has a significant equity interest, in either case as determined by the Administrator, whether now or hereafter
existing (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall include any Subsidiary). “Participating Affiliate” means any Affiliate designated by
the Administrator as eligible to participate in the Non-423 Component. For purposes of this Plan, “Code” means the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; reference to a specific section of the Code or United States Treasury Regulation
thereunder will include such section or regulation, any valid regulation or other official applicable guidance promulgated under
such section, and any comparable provision of any future legislation or regulation amending, supplementing or superseding such
section or regulation.

As of the Amendment Effective Date, a total of 62,000,000 shares of Common Stock are reserved for issuance under this Plan,
which reflects an increase of 50,000,000 shares over the number of shares initially reserved for issuance. Such number shall be
subject to adjustments effected in accordance with Section 14 of this Plan.

2. Purpose. The purpose of this Plan is to provide Eligible Employees with a convenient means of acquiring an equity interest in
the Company through payroll deductions or other contributions, to enhance such employees’ sense of participation in the affairs
of the Company.

3. Administration.

(a) This Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Administrator”), provided, however, that
the Board may determine to administer the Plan, in its sole discretion, and in such case any references to the Administrator in the
Plan shall be taken to be references to the Board. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Administrator shall have exclusive
authority, in its sole discretion, to determine all matters relating to options granted under the Plan, including, without limitation,
the authority to: (i) construe, interpret, reconcile any inconsistency in, correct any default in, supply any omission in, and apply the
terms of, the Plan and any subscription agreement or other instrument or agreement relating to the Plan, (ii) adjudicate all
disputed claims filed under the Plan (including making factual determinations), (iii) determine the terms and conditions of any
Offering (as defined in Section 5 below) and any option under the Plan, (iv) establish, amend, suspend or waive such rules and
regulations and appoint such agents as it shall deem appropriate for the proper administration of the Plan, and (v) make any other
determination and take any other action that the Administrator deems necessary or desirable for the administration of the Plan.

(b) The Administrator shall have exclusive authority, in its sole discretion, to (i) designate separate Offerings under the Plan,
(ii) determine which entities shall be Participating Subsidiaries or Participating Affiliates, (iii) determine who is an Eligible
Employee, (iii) change the length and duration of Offering Periods and Purchase Periods (as such terms are defined in Section 5
below), (iv) limit the frequency and/or number of changes in the amount deducted or contributed during an Offering Period or
Purchase Period, (v) permit payroll deductions or other contributions in excess of the amount designated by a participant in the
Plan in order to adjust for administrative errors in the Company’s processing of properly submitted subscription agreements and/
or changes in contribution amounts, (vi) establish reasonable waiting and adjustment periods and/or accounting and crediting
procedures to ensure that amounts applied toward the purchase of Common Stock for each Plan participant properly correspond

B-2 Appendix B

with payroll deductions or other contribution amounts, and (vii) establish such other limitations or procedures as the
Administrator determines in its sole discretion advisable that are consistent with the Plan.

(c) Further, the Administrator may adopt such rules, procedures and sub-plans as are necessary or appropriate to permit the
participation in the Plan by Eligible Employees who are citizens or residents of a non-U.S. jurisdiction and/or employed outside the
United States, the terms of which sub-plans may take precedence over other provisions of this Plan, with the exception of the
provision in Section 1 above setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Plan, but unless
otherwise superseded by the terms of such sub-plan, the provisions of this Plan shall govern the operation of such sub-plan. To
the extent inconsistent with the requirements of Section 423, any such sub-plan shall be considered part of the Non-423
Component, and rights granted thereunder shall not be required by the terms of the Plan to comply with Section 423 of the Code.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrator is specifically authorized to adopt rules and procedures
regarding eligibility to participate, the application of the definition of Compensation (as defined in Section 9(b) below) to
participants on payrolls outside of the United States, handling of payroll deductions and other contributions, taking of payroll
deductions and making of other contributions to the Plan, establishment of bank or trust accounts to hold contributions, payment
of interest, establishment of the exchange rate applicable to payroll deductions taken and other contributions made in a currency
other than U.S. dollars, obligations to pay payroll tax, determination of beneficiary designation requirements, tax withholding
procedures and handling of stock certificates that vary with applicable local requirements.

(d) The Administrator’s interpretation of the Plan and its rules and regulations, and all actions taken and determinations made by
the Administrator pursuant to the Plan, shall be conclusive and binding on all parties involved or affected. The Administrator may
delegate its duties and authority to such of the Company’s officers or employees as it so determines.

4. Eligibility.

(a) Unless otherwise provided in this Section 4 and subject to the requirements of Section 6, any Eligible Employee on a given
Offering Date (as defined in Section 5 below) shall be eligible to participate in the Plan.

(b) For purposes of this Plan, “Eligible Employee” means any individual who is treated as an employee in the records of the
Company or any Participating Subsidiary or Participating Affiliate, in each case regardless of any subsequent reclassification by the
Company or by any Participating Subsidiary or Participating Affiliate, any governmental agency, or any court, and subject to the
qualifications set forth in this section.

(c) For purposes of this Plan, the employment relationship shall be treated as continuing intact while the individual is on military
or sick leave or other bona fide leave of absence approved by the Company or the applicable Participating Subsidiary or
Participating Affiliate so long as the leave does not exceed three (3) months or, if longer than three (3) months, the individual’s
right to reemployment is provided by statute or has been agreed to by contract or in a written policy of the Company or the
applicable Participating Subsidiary or Participating Affiliate which provides for a right of reemployment following the leave of
absence.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, for all options to be granted on an Offering Date, the definition of Eligible Employee will not
include an individual, if (i) the individual is not employed by the Company or a Participating Subsidiary or Participating Affiliate, as
applicable, ten (10) business days before the beginning of such Offering Period (or for such other period permitted by Code
Section 423 and determined by the Administrator), and/or (ii) the employee, together with any other person whose stock would
be attributed to such employee pursuant to Section 424(d) of the Code, owns stock or holds options to purchase stock possessing
five percent (5%) or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or any Subsidiary or
who, as a result of being granted an option under this Plan with respect to such Offering Period, would own stock or hold options
to purchase stock possessing five percent (5%) or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the
Company or any Subsidiary.

(e) The Administrator, in its sole discretion, from time to time may, prior to an Offering Date for all options to be granted on such
Offering Date, determine (on a uniform and nondiscriminatory basis or as otherwise permitted by U.S. Treasury Regulation
Section 1.423-2 for options granted under the 423 Component) that the definition of Eligible Employee will or will not include an
individual if he or she: (i) customarily works twenty (20) hours or less per week (or such lesser period of time as may be
determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion), or (ii) customarily works not more than five (5) months per calendar year
(or such lesser period of time as may be determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion). Under the 423 Component, such
exclusions shall be applied with respect to an Offering in a manner complying with U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.423-
2(e)(2)(ii).

(f) In the case of the 423 Component, Eligible Employees who are citizens or residents of a non-U.S. jurisdiction (without regard to
whether they also are citizens or residents of the United States or resident aliens within the meaning of Section 7701(b)(1)(A) of
the Code) may be excluded from participation in the Plan or an Offering if the participation of such Eligible Employees is
prohibited under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction or if complying with the laws of the applicable jurisdiction would cause the

2017 Annual Report / 2018 Proxy Statement

Appendix B B-3

Plan or an Offering to violate Section 423 of the Code (or to the extent such exclusion is permitted under Section 423 of the Code).
In the case of the Non-423 Component, Eligible Employees may be excluded from participation in the Plan or an Offering if the
Administrator has determined that participation of such Eligible Employees is not advisable or practicable.

(g) A participant in the Plan shall cease to be an Eligible Employee upon termination of employment (as further described in
Section 12 below), upon the entity employing such participant during an Offering Period ceasing to be an Affiliate, or upon the
participant transferring to an Affiliate that is not a Participating Subsidiary or Participating Affiliate.

5. Offerings; Offering Periods; Purchase Periods.

(a) For purposes of this Plan, “Offering” means an offer of an option under the Plan that may be exercised on one or more
Purchase Dates (as hereinafter defined) during an Offering Period. Unless otherwise specified by the Administrator, each Offering
to the Eligible Employees of the Company, a Participating Subsidiary or a Participating Affiliate shall be deemed a separate Offering
(the terms of which Offering under the Non-423 Component need not be identical), even if the dates and other terms of the
separate Offerings are identical and the provisions of the Plan shall separately apply to each Offering. To the extent permitted by
U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.423-2(a)(1), the terms of each separate Offering under the 423 Component need not be
identical, provided that the terms of the Plan and an Offering together satisfy U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.423-2(a)(2) and
(a)(3).

(b) Except as otherwise specified by the Administrator prior to the commencement of an Offering Period (as defined below): (i)
the offering periods of this Plan (each, an “Offering Period”) shall be twenty- four (24) month periods commencing on May 1 and
November 1 of each year and ending on April 30 and October 31 of each year, and (ii) each Offering Period shall consist of four
(4) six-month purchase periods (each, a “Purchase Period”) during which payroll deductions or other contributions of the
participants are accumulated under this Plan. The first business day of each Offering Period is referred to as the “Offering Date.”
The last business day of each Purchase Period is referred to as the “Purchase Date.”

(c) The Administrator shall have the power to change the duration of Offering Periods with respect to Offerings without
stockholder approval if such change is announced at least fifteen (15) days prior to the scheduled beginning of the first Offering
Period to be affected. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a merger, recapitalization, restructuring or other corporate
transaction affecting the Common Stock, the Administrator may, without stockholder approval and in accordance with applicable
law, shorten the duration of Offering Periods or establish other Offering Periods in addition to those described above, which shall
be subject to any specific terms and conditions that the Administrator approves, including requirements with respect to eligibility,
participation, the establishment of Purchase Periods and Purchase Dates and other rights under any such offering. A participant
may be enrolled in only one Offering Period at a time.

6. Participation in this Plan.

(a) An Eligible Employee may become a participant in the Plan by completing, within five (5) business days prior to the applicable
Offering Date (or such other time frame set forth by the Administrator), a subscription agreement (through the Company’s online
Plan enrollment process or in paper form if required by the Administrator) and/or any other forms and by following any other
procedures for enrollment in the Plan as may be established by the Administrator.

(b) Once an Eligible Employee becomes a participant in the Plan, the Eligible Employee will automatically participate in each
succeeding Offering Period unless (i) he or she withdraws or is deemed to withdraw from this Plan or terminates further
participation in the Offering Period as set forth in Section 11 below, or (ii) ceases to be an Eligible Employee. Any such participant is
not required to complete any additional subscription agreement, form or procedure in order to continue participation in this Plan,
unless requested by the Administrator for legal or administrative reasons.

(c) If a participant in the Plan transfers employment between the Company and a Participating Subsidiary or between Participating
Subsidiaries, his or her participation in the Plan shall continue unless and until otherwise terminated in accordance with the Plan.
Similarly, if a participant in the Plan transfers employment between Participating Affiliates, his or her participation in the Plan shall
continue unless and until otherwise terminated in accordance with the Plan. If a participant in the Plan transfers employment
(i) from the Company or a Participating Subsidiary to a Participating Affiliate or (ii) from a Participating Affiliate to the Company or
a Participating Subsidiary, he or she shall be deemed to withdraw from the Plan as of the transfer date and shall have his or her
accumulated payroll deductions refunded to him or her (without interest, subject to Section 9(e) below) as soon as practicable
following the transfer. Such former participant shall be entitled to re-enroll in the Plan as of the next Offering Period provided that
he or she is an Eligible Employee at that time, completes a subscription agreement and follows the procedures set forth in
Section 6(a) above. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6(c), the Administrator may establish additional and/
or different rules to govern transfers of employment among the Company and any Participating Subsidiary or Participating
Affiliate, consistent with the applicable requirements of Code Section 423 and the terms of the Plan.

7. Grant of Option. On the Offering Date of each Offering Period, and subject in all cases to the provisions of the Plan, each
participant in the Plan shall be granted an option to purchase on each Purchase Date during the Offering Period (at the purchase

www.paypal.com

B-4 Appendix B

price described in Section 8 below) up to that number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing (a) the amount
accumulated in such participant’s payroll deduction or other contribution account during such Purchase Period by (b) the lesser of
(i) eighty-five percent (85%) of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Offering Date (but in no event less than
the par value of a share of Common Stock), or (ii) eighty-five percent (85%) of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock
on the Purchase Date (but in no event less than the par value of a share of Common Stock), provided, however, that the number
of shares of Common Stock subject to any option granted pursuant to this Plan shall not exceed the lesser of (x) the maximum
number of shares which may be purchased pursuant to Section 10(a) with respect to the applicable Purchase Date, or (y) the
maximum number of shares set by the Administrator pursuant to Section 10(b) below with respect to the applicable Purchase
Date. The Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock shall be determined as provided in Section 8 below.

8. Purchase Price. The purchase price at which each share of Common Stock will be sold in any Offering Period shall be eighty-five
percent (85%) of the lesser of:

(a) The Fair Market Value on the Offering Date; or

(b) The Fair Market Value on the Purchase Date.

For purposes of this Plan, the term “Fair Market Value” means, as of any date, the value of a share of Common Stock
determined as follows:

(i) if such Common Stock is then quoted on The NASDAQ Stock Market, its closing price on The NASDAQ Stock Market
on the date of determination as reported in The Wall Street Journal;
(ii) if such Common Stock is publicly traded and is then listed on another national securities exchange, its closing price on
the date of determination on the principal national securities exchange on which Common Stock is listed or admitted to
trading as reported in The Wall Street Journal;
(iii) if such Common Stock is publicly traded but is not quoted on The NASDAQ Stock Market nor listed or admitted to
trading on another national securities exchange, the average of the closing bid and asked prices on the date of
determination as reported in The Wall Street Journal; or
(iv) if none of the foregoing is applicable, by the Administrator in good faith.

9. Payment of Purchase Price; Changes in Payroll Deductions; Issuance of Shares.

(a) The purchase price of the shares of Common Stock shall be paid for by means of payroll deductions taken from the
participant’s Compensation (as hereinafter defined) during each Purchase Period. Except as set forth in this Section 9, the amount
of payroll deductions to be taken from a participant’s Compensation shall be determined by the Eligible Employee at the time of
completing the subscription agreement and enrolling in the Plan as described in Section 6(a) above.

Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provisions to the contrary in the Plan, the Administrator may allow participants to make
other contributions under the Plan via cash, check or other means instead of payroll deductions if payroll deductions are not
permitted under applicable local law and, for any Offering under the 423 Component, the Administrator determines that such
other contributions are permissible under Section 423 of the Code.

The payroll deductions or other contributions are made as a percentage of the participant’s Compensation in one percent (1%)
increments and shall not be less than two percent (2%), nor greater than ten percent (10%) or such lower limit set by the
Administrator. The Administrator shall determine whether the amount to be contributed is to be designated as a specific dollar
amount, or as a percentage of the eligible Compensation being paid on such payday, or as either, and may also establish a
minimum percentage or amount for such contributions.

Payroll deductions shall commence on the first payday of the Offering Period and shall continue to the end of the Offering Period
unless sooner altered or terminated as provided in this Plan. Other contributions shall be made at the time and in the manner
prescribed by the Administrator for the option and/or Offering under which other contributions are permitted pursuant to
foregoing provisions of this section.

(b) For purposes of this Plan, “Compensation” means the following forms of cash remuneration earned or payable to a participant
by the Company, a Participating Subsidiary or a Participating Affiliate during the applicable Offering Period: base wages; salary;
overtime (including pay in lieu of meal time); performance or merit bonuses; commissions; shift differentials; language differentials;
payments for paid time off and holidays; sabbatical pay; payments in lieu of notice; travel pay; retroactive pay; on-call/standby pay;
hazard pay; bereavement pay; jury/witness duty pay; pay during a period of suspension; military leave pay; compensation deferred
pursuant to Section 401(k) or Section 125 of the Code; distributions under any nonqualified deferred compensation plan; retention
bonuses; or any other compensation or remuneration approved as “compensation” by the Administrator in accordance with
Section 423 of the Code.

2017 Annual Report / 2018 Proxy Statement

Appendix B B-5

For purposes of this Plan, “Compensation” shall not include forms of compensation or remuneration that are not included or
covered by the first sentence in this Section 9(b), including the following: moving allowances; automobile allowances; gross-up
payments; compensation deferred under any nonqualified deferred compensation plan; payments pursuant to a severance plan,
agreement or arrangement; payments during a garden leave or other notice period preceding termination of employment;
equalization payments; termination pay (including the payout of accrued vacation time in connection with any such termination);
relocation allowances; expense reimbursements; meal allowances; commuting allowances; geographical hardship pay; any
payments (such as guaranteed bonuses in certain foreign jurisdictions) with respect to which salary reductions are not permitted
by the laws of the applicable jurisdiction); sign-on bonuses; nonqualified executive compensation; any amounts directly or
indirectly paid pursuant to this Plan or any other stock-based plan, including without limitation any stock option, stock purchase,
restricted stock, restricted stock unit, deferred stock unit, or similar plan, of the Company or any Affiliate, or cash paid in lieu of
any such awards.

The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may, on a uniform and nondiscriminatory basis for each Offering, establish a different
definition of Compensation for a subsequent Offering. Further, the Administrator shall have discretion to determine the
application of this definition to participants on payrolls outside the United States.

(c) A participant may increase or decrease the rate of payroll deductions or other contributions during an Offering Period by
completing a new authorization for payroll deductions or other contributions (through the Company’s online Plan process or in
paper form if required by the Administrator) and/or any other forms and by following any other procedures as may be established
by the Administrator, in which case the new rate shall become effective as soon as administratively practicable after the
participant elects such change and shall continue for the remainder of the Offering Period unless changed as described below. Such
change in the rate of payroll deductions or other contributions may be made at any time during an Offering Period, but not more
than one (1) change may be made effective during any Purchase Period.

A participant may increase or decrease the rate of payroll deductions or contributions for any subsequent Offering Period by
completing a new authorization for payroll deductions or other contributions (through the Company’s online Plan process or in
paper form if required by the Administrator) and/or any other forms and by following any other procedures as may be established
by the Administrator, not later than fifteen (15) business days before the beginning of such Offering Period or within such other
time frame set forth by the Administrator.

(d) A participant may reduce his or her payroll deductions or contributions percentage to zero during an Offering Period by
submitting to the Company a request for cessation of payroll deductions or other contributions (through the Company’s online
Plan process or in paper form if required by the Administrator) and/or any other forms and by following any other procedures as
may be established by the Administrator. Such reduction shall be effective as soon as administratively practicable after the
Participant elects such reduction and no further payroll deductions or contributions will be made for the duration of the Offering
Period. Payroll deductions or contributions credited to the participant’s account prior to the effective date of the request shall be
used to purchase shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 9(f) below. A participant may not resume making payroll
deductions or other contributions during the Offering Period in which he or she reduced his or her payroll deductions or other
contributions to zero. For avoidance of doubt, if a participant reduces his or her payroll deductions or contributions percentage to
zero during an Offering Period and does not increase such rate of payroll deductions or contributions above zero prior to the
commencement of the next subsequent purchase period (if any) within such Offering Period, or if there is no such subsequent
purchase period, prior to the commencement of the next subsequent Offering Period, such action will be treated as the
participant’s withdrawal from the Plan in accordance with Section 11(a), unless participant is on a bona fide leave of absence
pursuant to Section 4(c) above. The Administrator has the authority to change the foregoing rules set forth in this Section 9(d)
regarding participation in the Plan.

(e) A participant’s payroll deductions or other contributions shall be credited to an account maintained on such participant’s
behalf under this Plan. All payroll deductions or other contributions shall be deposited with the general funds of the Company and
may be used by the Company for any corporate purpose, and the Company shall not be obligated to segregate such payroll
deductions or other contributions, unless otherwise required by the laws of the jurisdiction where the payroll deductions are taken
or other contributions are made, as determined by the Administrator. No interest shall accrue on the payroll deductions or other
contributions, unless otherwise required by the laws of the jurisdiction where the payroll deductions are taken or other
contributions are made, as determined by the Administrator.

(f) On each Purchase Date, so long as this Plan remains in effect and provided that the participant has not withdrawn from the
Offering Period in accordance with the requirements of Section 11(a), the Company shall apply the funds then in the participant’s
account to the purchase of whole shares of Common Stock reserved under the option granted to such participant with respect to
the Offering Period to the extent that such option is exercisable on the Purchase Date. The purchase price per share shall be as
specified in Section 8 of this Plan. Any cash remaining in a participant’s account after such purchase of shares shall be refunded to
such participant in cash, without interest (subject to Section 9(e) above); provided, however, that any amount remaining in such
participant’s account on a Purchase Date which is less than the amount necessary to purchase a full share of Common Stock shall

be carried forward, without interest (subject to Section 9(e) above), into the next Purchase Period or Offering Period and in the
locations where the Administrator has determined that such rollover is available under the Plan, as the case may be. In the event
that this Plan has been oversubscribed, all funds not used to purchase shares on the Purchase Date shall be returned to the
participant, without interest (subject to Section 9(e) above). No Common Stock shall be purchased on a Purchase Date on behalf
of any employee whose participation in this Plan has terminated prior to such Purchase Date.

(g) Subject to Section 9(h) below, as promptly as practicable after the Purchase Date, the Company shall issue shares for the
participant’s benefit representing the shares purchased upon exercise of his or her option.

(h) At the time the option is exercised or at the time some or all of the shares of Common Stock issued under the Plan are
disposed of (or at any other time that a taxable event related to the Plan occurs), the Plan participant must make adequate
provision for any withholding obligation of the Company or a Participating Subsidiary or a Participating Affiliate with respect to
federal, state, local and foreign income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-
related items related to participation in the Plan and legally applicable to participant (including any amount deemed by the
Company, in its sole discretion, to be an appropriate charge to Participant even if legally applicable to the Company or the
participant’s employer). At any time, the Company or the participant’s employer may, but shall not be obligated to, withhold from
the participant’s wages or other cash compensation the amount necessary for the Company or the participant’s employer to meet
applicable withholding obligations, including any withholding required to make available to the Company or the participant’s
employer any tax deductions or benefits attributable to sale or early disposition of Common Stock by the participant. In addition,
the Company or the participant’s employer may, but shall not be obligated to, withhold from the proceeds of the sale of Common
Stock or by any other method of withholding the Company or the participant’s employer deems appropriate.

(i) During a participant’s lifetime, his or her option to purchase shares hereunder is exercisable only by him or her. The participant
will have no interest or voting right in shares covered by his or her option until such option has been exercised and the purchased
shares are issued or transferred to the participant.

10. Limitations on Shares to be Purchased.

(a) No participant shall be entitled to purchase Common Stock under this Plan at a rate which, when aggregated with his or her
rights to purchase stock under all other employee stock purchase plans of the Company or any Subsidiary exceeds $25,000 in Fair
Market Value, determined as of the Offering Date (or such other limit as may be imposed by the Code) for each calendar year in
which any option granted to the participant is outstanding at any time. The Company shall automatically suspend the payroll
deductions or other contributions of any participant as necessary to enforce such limit provided that when the Company
automatically resumes making such payroll deductions or accepting contributions, the Company shall apply the rate in effect
immediately prior to such suspension.

(b) No participant shall be entitled to purchase more than the Maximum Share Amount (as defined below) on any single Purchase
Date. Not less than thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of any Offering Period, the Administrator may, in its sole
discretion, set a maximum number of shares which may be purchased by any employee at any single Purchase Date (hereinafter
the “Maximum Share Amount”). Until otherwise determined by the Administrator, the Maximum Share Amount shall be 5,000
shares (subject to any adjustment pursuant to Section 14). If a new Maximum Share Amount is set, then all participants shall be
notified of such Maximum Share Amount prior to the commencement of the next Offering Period. The Maximum Share Amount
shall continue to apply with respect to all succeeding Purchase Dates and Offering Periods unless revised by the Administrator as
set forth above.

(c) If the number of shares to be purchased on a Purchase Date by all employees participating in this Plan exceeds the number of
shares then available for issuance under this Plan, then the Company will make a pro rata allocation of the remaining shares in as
uniform a manner as shall be reasonably practicable and as the Administrator shall determine to be equitable. In such event, the
Company shall provide notice of such reduction of the number of shares to be purchased under a participant’s option to each
participant affected.

(d) Any funds accumulated in a participant’s account which are not used to purchase Common Stock due to the limitations in this
Section 10 shall be returned to the participant as soon as practicable after the end of the applicable Purchase Period, without
interest (subject to Section 9(e) above).

11. Withdrawal.

(a) Each participant may withdraw from a Purchase Period under this Plan by completing a notice of withdrawal (through the
Company’s online Plan process or in paper form if required by the Administrator) and/or any other forms and by following any
other procedures for withdrawal from the Plan as may be established by the Administrator, at least fifteen (15) business days prior
to the end of a Purchase Period or within such other time frame set forth by the Administrator.

2017 Annual Report / 2018 Proxy Statement

Appendix B B-7

(b) Upon withdrawal from this Plan, the accumulated payroll deductions shall be returned to the withdrawn participant, without
interest (subject to Section 9(e) above), and his or her interest in this Plan shall terminate. In the event a participant voluntarily
elects to withdraw from this Plan, he or she may not resume his or her participation in this Plan during the same Offering Period,
but he or she may participate in any Offering Period under this Plan which commences on a date subsequent to such withdrawal
by completing a subscription agreement in the same manner as set forth in Section 6 above for initial participation in this Plan.

(c) If the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the first day of the current Offering Period in which a participant is
enrolled is higher than the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the first day of any subsequent Offering Period, the
Company will automatically enroll such participant in the subsequent Offering Period. Any funds accumulated in a participant’s
account prior to the first day of such subsequent Offering Period will be applied to the purchase of shares on the Purchase Date
immediately prior to the first day of such subsequent Offering Period. A participant does not need to file any forms with the
Company to be automatically enrolled in the subsequent Offering Period.

12. Termination of Employment. Termination of a participant’s employment for any reason, including retirement, death or the
failure of a participant to remain an Eligible Employee immediately terminates his or her participation in this Plan. For purposes of
this Plan, a participant’s employment will be considered terminated as of the date that participant is no longer actively providing
services as an employee and will not be extended by any notice period (i.e., active service would not include any contractual notice
period or any period of “garden leave” or similar period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction where participant is
employed or the terms of participant’s employment agreement, if any, but is not actively providing services); the Administrator
shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when the participant is no longer actively providing services for purposes of
participation in the Plan. In such event, the funds credited to the participant’s account will be returned to him or her or, in the case
of his or her death, to his or her legal representative, without interest (subject to Section 9(e) above).

13. Return of Payroll Deductions and Other Contributions. In the event a participant’s interest in this Plan is terminated by
withdrawal, termination of employment or otherwise, or in the event this Plan is terminated pursuant to Section 25, the Company
shall deliver to the participant all payroll deductions or other contributions credited to such participant’s account, without interest
(subject to Section 9(e) above).

14. Capital Changes.

(a) In the event that any dividend or other distribution, reorganization, merger, consolidation, combination, repurchase, or
exchange of Common Stock or other securities of the Company, or other change in the corporate structure of the Company
affecting Common Stock (other than an Equity Restructuring, as defined in Section 14(c) below) occurs such that an adjustment is
determined by the Administrator (in its sole discretion) to be appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the
benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, then the Administrator shall, in such manner as it may
deem equitable, adjust the number and class of Common Stock or type of securities which have been authorized for issuance
under this Plan but have not yet been placed under option (collectively, the “Reserves”), the Maximum Share Amount, the
number and class of Common Stock or type of securities covered by each outstanding option, and the purchase price per share of
Common Stock covered by each option which has not yet been exercised.

(b) In connection with the occurrence of any Equity Restructuring, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 14(a),
the number and type of securities subject to each outstanding option and the price per share thereof, if applicable, will be
equitably adjusted by the Administrator. The adjustments provided under this Section 14(b) shall be nondiscretionary and shall be
final and binding on the affected participants and the Company.

(c) “Equity Restructuring” means a non-reciprocal transaction (i.e., a transaction in which the Company does not receive
consideration or other resources in respect of the transaction approximately equal to and in exchange for the consideration or
resources the Company is relinquishing in such transaction) between the Company and its stockholders, such as a stock split, spin-
off, rights offering, nonrecurring stock dividend or recapitalization through a large, nonrecurring cash dividend, that affects the
shares of Common Stock (or other securities of the Company) or the share price of Common Stock (or other securities) and causes
a change in the per share value of Common Stock underlying outstanding options.

(d) In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Offering Period will terminate immediately prior to
the consummation of such proposed action, unless otherwise provided by the Administrator. The Administrator may, in the
exercise of its sole discretion in such instances, declare that this Plan shall terminate as of a date fixed by the Administrator and
give each participant the right to purchase shares under this Plan prior to such termination.

(e) In the event of (i) a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving corporation (other than a merger or
consolidation with a wholly-owned subsidiary, a reincorporation of the Company in a different jurisdiction, or other transaction in
which there is no substantial change in the stockholders of the Company or their relative stock holdings and the options under
this Plan are assumed, converted or replaced by the successor corporation, which assumption will be binding on all participants),
(ii) a merger in which the Company is the surviving corporation but after which the stockholders of the Company immediately

prior to such merger (other than any stockholder that merges, or which owns or controls another corporation that merges, with
the Company in such merger) cease to own their shares or other equity interest in the Company, (iii) the sale of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Company or (iv) the acquisition, sale, or transfer of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the
Company by tender offer or similar transaction, unless otherwise provided by the Administrator in its sole discretion, the Plan will
continue with regard to Offering Periods that commenced prior to the closing of the proposed transaction and shares will be
purchased based on the Fair Market Value of the surviving corporation’s stock on each Purchase Date. The Administrator may, in
the exercise of its sole discretion in such instances, declare that this Plan shall terminate as of a date fixed by the Administrator
and give each participant the right to purchase shares under this Plan prior to such termination.

15. Nonassignability. Neither payroll deductions or other contributions credited to a participant’s account nor any rights with
regard to the exercise of an option or to receive shares under this Plan may be assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise
disposed of in any way (other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution or as provided in Section 19 below) by the
participant. Any such attempt at assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition shall be void and without effect.

16. Notice of Disposition; Holding of Shares. If the shares purchased in any Offering Period under the 423 Component are not in
the participant’s Company stock plan account, each participant shall notify the Company in writing if the participant disposes of
any of the shares purchased in any such Offering Period under the 423 Component if such disposition occurs within two (2) years
from the Offering Date or within one (1) year from the Purchase Date on which such shares were purchased (the “Notice Period”).
The Company may, at any time during the Notice Period, place a legend or legends on any certificate representing shares acquired
pursuant to this Plan requesting the Company’s transfer agent to notify the Company of any transfer of the shares. The obligation
of the participant to provide such notice shall continue notwithstanding the placement of any such legend on the certificates.
Further, the Company may require that shares purchased in any Offering Period, whether under the 423 Component or the
Non-423 Component, be retained in the participant’s Company stock plan account or such other account for a designated period
of time, and/or may establish other procedures to permit tracking of dispositions of shares.

17. No Rights to Continued Employment. Neither this Plan nor the grant of any option hereunder shall confer any right on any
employee to remain in the employ of the Company or any Participating Subsidiary or Participating Affiliate, or restrict the right of
the Company or any Participating Subsidiary or Participating Affiliate to terminate such employee’s employment.

18. Notices. All notices or other communications by a participant to the Company under or in connection with this Plan shall be
deemed to have been duly given when received in the form specified by the Company at the location, or by the person, designated
by the Company for the receipt thereof.

19. Death of Participant. In the event of the death of a participant, the Company shall deliver the shares or cash, if any, credited to
the participant’s account to the executor or administrator of the estate of the participant, or if no such executor or administrator
has been appointed (to the knowledge of the Company), to such other individual as may be prescribed by applicable law.

20. Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares; Limitation on Sale of Shares. Shares shall not be issued with respect to an option unless
the exercise of such option and the issuance and delivery of such shares pursuant thereto shall comply with all applicable
provisions of law, domestic or foreign, including, without limitation, the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the U.S. Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the requirements of any stock
exchange or automated quotation system upon which the shares may then be listed, and shall be further subject to the approval
of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.

21. Section 409A. The 423 Component is exempt from the application of Section 409A of the Code (“Section 409A”) and any
ambiguities herein shall be interpreted to so be exempt from Section 409A. The Non-423 Component is intended to be exempt
from the application of Section 409A under the short-term deferral exception and any ambiguities shall be construed and
interpreted in accordance with such intent. In furtherance of the foregoing and notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the
contrary, if the Administrator determines that an option granted under the Plan may be subject to Section 409A or that any
provision in the Plan would cause an option under the Plan to be subject to Section 409A, the Administrator may amend the
terms of the Plan and/or of an outstanding option granted under the Plan, or take such other action the Administrator determines
is necessary or appropriate, in each case, without the participant’s consent, to exempt any outstanding option or future option
that may be granted under the Plan from or to allow any such options to comply with Section 409A, but only to the extent any
such amendments or action by the Administrator would not violate Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall have no liability to a participant or any other party if the option under the Plan that is intended to be exempt from or
compliant with Section 409A is not so exempt or compliant or for any action taken by the Administrator with respect thereto.

22. Tax Qualification. Although the Company may endeavor to (a) qualify an option for favorable tax treatment under the laws of
the United States or jurisdictions outside of the United States or (b) avoid adverse tax treatment (e.g., under Section 409A), the
Company makes no representation to that effect and expressly disavows any covenant to maintain favorable or avoid unfavorable
tax treatment, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, including Section 21. The Company shall be unconstrained in
its corporate activities without regard to the potential negative tax impact on participants under the Plan.

2017 Annual Report / 2018 Proxy Statement

Appendix B B-9

23. Stockholder Approval. After this Plan is adopted by the Board, this Plan will become effective on the Amendment Effective
Date. This Plan shall be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company, in a manner permitted by applicable corporate
law, within twelve (12) months before or after the date this Plan is adopted by the Board. No purchase of shares pursuant to this
Plan shall occur prior to such stockholder approval. This Plan shall continue until the earlier to occur of (a) termination of this Plan
by the Board (which termination may be effected by the Board at any time) or (b) issuance of all of the shares of Common Stock
reserved for issuance under this Plan.

24. Governing Law. The Plan shall be governed by the substantive laws (excluding the conflict of laws rules) of the State of
Delaware.

25. Amendment or Termination of this Plan. The Administrator may at any time amend or terminate the Plan, except that any
such termination cannot affect options previously granted under this Plan, nor may any amendment make any change in an
option previously granted which would adversely affect the right of any participant, nor may any amendment be made without
approval of the stockholders of the Company obtained in accordance with Section 23 above within twelve (12) months of the
adoption of such amendment (or earlier if required by Section 23 above) if such amendment would:

(a) increase the number of shares that may be issued under this Plan; or

(b) change the designation of the corporations whose employees (or class of employees) are eligible for participation in this Plan.

For the avoidance of doubt, the authority to take action under this Section 25 may not be delegated to an officer or other
employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator may make such amendments to the Plan as the Administrator
determines to be advisable, if the continuation of the Plan or any Offering Period would result in financial accounting treatment for
the Plan that is different from the financial accounting treatment in effect on the date this Plan is adopted by the Board.

26. Severability. If any provision of the Plan is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason in any
jurisdiction or as to any participant, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and
the Plan will be construed and enforced as to such jurisdiction or participant as if the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had
not been included.

Presentation of Information
On July 17, 2015, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (“PayPal Holdings”) became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata
distribution by eBay (defined below) of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal Holdings to eBay’s stockholders (which
we refer to as the “separation” or the “distribution”). For additional information, see “Business—Separation from eBay Inc.” To
accomplish this separation, in January 2015, eBay incorporated PayPal Holdings, Inc., which ultimately became the parent of PayPal,
Inc. and holds directly or indirectly all of the assets and liabilities associated with PayPal, Inc. Unless otherwise expressly stated or
the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company” or “PayPal” refer to PayPal Holdings, Inc. and its
consolidated subsidiaries or, in the case of information as of dates or for periods prior to our separation from eBay, the
consolidated entities of the payments business of eBay, including PayPal, Inc. and certain other assets and liabilities that were
historically held at the eBay corporate level, but were specifically identifiable and attributable to the payments business, and
references to our “Payments Platform” mean our combined payment solution capabilities, including our PayPal, PayPal Credit,
Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, and Paydiant products.

References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “eBay” refer to eBay Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated
subsidiaries, which prior to the separation and distribution, but not after such date, included the business and operations of
PayPal.

Trademarks, Trade Names and Service Marks

its business. Some of the more important trademarks that PayPal owns or has rights to use that appear in this Annual Report on

ITEM 1. Business
OVERVIEW
PayPal Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 and is a leading technology platform and digital payments
company that enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and merchants worldwide. Our vision is to democratize
financial services, as we believe that managing and moving money is a right for all people, not just the affluent. Our goal is to
increase our relevance for consumers and merchants to manage and move their money anywhere in the world, anytime, on any
platform and using any device. Our combined payment solutions, including our PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom,
and Paydiant products, compose our proprietary Payments Platform.

We operate a two-sided proprietary global technology platform that links our customers, which consist of both merchants and
consumers, around the globe to facilitate the processing of payment transactions, allowing us to connect millions of merchants
and consumers worldwide. We offer our customers the flexibility to use their account to both purchase and receive payment for
goods and services, as well as to transfer and withdraw funds. We enable consumers to more safely exchange funds with
merchants using a variety of funding sources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal account balance, a PayPal Credit
account, a credit or debit card or other stored value products such as coupons and gift cards. Our PayPal, Venmo and Xoom
products also make it safer and simpler for friends and family to transfer funds to each other. We offer merchants an end-to-end
payments solution that provides authorization and settlement capabilities, as well as instant access to funds. We help merchants
connect with their customers and manage risk. We enable consumers to engage in cross-border shopping and merchants to
extend their global reach while reducing the complexity and friction involved in enabling overseas and cross-border trade.

We generate revenues by charging fees for providing transaction processing and other payment-related services based primarily
on the volume of activity processed through our Payments Platform. We generally do not charge consumers to fund or draw from
their accounts; however, we generate revenue from consumers on fees charged for foreign currency exchange. We also earn
revenue by providing value added services to consumers and merchants, such as our PayPal Credit and gateway services. Our
gateway services, which include our Payflow Gateway services and Braintree Gateway services, provide the technology that links a
merchant’s website to its processing network and merchant account and enable merchants to accept payments online with credit
or debit cards.

STRATEGY
Our ability to grow revenue is affected by, among other things, consumer spending patterns, merchant and consumer adoption of
digital payment methods, the expansion of multiple commerce channels, the growth of mobile devices and merchant and
consumer applications on those devices, the growth of consumers globally with Internet and mobile access, the pace of transition
from cash and checks to digital forms of payment, our share of the digital payments market, and our ability to innovate new
methods of payment that merchants and consumers value. Our strategy to drive growth in our business includes the following:

• Growing our core: through expanding our global capabilities, customer base and scale, increasing our customers’ use of our

products and services by better addressing their everyday needs related to accessing, managing and moving money and
expanding the adoption of our solutions by new merchants and consumers;

• Expanding our value proposition for customers: by focusing on trust and simplicity, providing risk management and insights

from our two-sided Payments Platform and being technology and platform agnostic;

• Extending through strategic partnerships: by building new strategic partnerships to provide better experiences for our
customers, offering greater choice and flexibility, acquiring new customers and reinforcing our role in the ecosystem; and

• Seeking new areas of growth: through new international markets around the world and focusing on innovation both in the

digital and the physical world.

KEY PERFORMANCE METRICS

2017 Key Performance Metrics

Expanding Our Base:
Active Customer Accounts of 227 Million

Up 15% from 2016

Driving Customer Engagement:
7.6 Billion Payment Transactions

Up 24% from 2016

$

Gaining Share:
$451 Billion inTotal Payment Volume

Up 27% from 2016

We measure the relevance of our products to our customers, and therefore the success of our business, through active customer
accounts, payment volume and payment transactions:

Active Customer Accounts: An active customer account is a registered account that successfully sent or received at least one
payment or payment reversal through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and
Paydiant products, in the past 12 months. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 227 million active customer accounts
across more than 200 markets. A market is a geographic area or political jurisdiction, such as a country, territory, or protectorate,
in which we offer our services. A country, territory or protectorate is identified by a distinct set of laws and regulations.

Number of Payment Transactions: Number of payment transactions is defined as the total number of payments, net of payment
reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and
Paydiant products.

Total Payment Volume (“TPV”): TPV is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our
Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products.

OUR STRENGTHS
Our business is built on a strong foundation designed to drive growth and differentiate us from our competitors. We believe that
our competitive strengths include the following:

• Two-sided Platform—our platform connecting merchants and consumers enables PayPal to offer unique end-to-end product

experiences while gaining valuable insights into customer behavior through our data. Our platform provides for simple digital
and mobile transactions while being both brand and technology agnostic.

• Scale—our global scale allows us to drive organic growth. As of December 31, 2017, we had 227 million active customer

accounts, which included 18 million active merchant accounts. In 2017, we processed $451 billion of TPV in more than 200
markets around the world.

• Brand—we have built a well-recognized and trusted brand. Our marketing efforts play an important role in building brand

visibility, usage and overall preference among customers.

• Risk Management—our risk management system and tokenization usage are designed to keep our customers safe and to

ensure we process legitimate transactions around the world, while reducing illegal, high-risk, or fraudulent transactions.

• Regulatory—we believe that our regulatory licenses, which enable us to operate in markets around the world, are a distinct

advantage and support business growth.

TECHNOLOGY
Our Payments Platform utilizes a combination of proprietary technologies and services as well as technologies and services
provided by third parties to efficiently and securely facilitate transactions between millions of merchants and consumers
worldwide across different channels, markets and networks. Our Payments Platform connects with financial institutions around
the world and allows consumers to make purchases using a wide range of payment methods, regardless of where a merchant is
located. Consumers who use our Payments Platform can send payments in more than 200 markets across the globe and in more
than 100 currencies, withdraw funds to their bank accounts in 56 currencies and hold balances in their PayPal accounts in 25
currencies.

A transaction on our Payments Platform can involve multiple participants in addition to us including a merchant, a consumer and
the consumer’s funding source provider. We have developed intuitive user interfaces, customer tools on our Payments Platform,
transaction processing, and database and network applications that help our customers utilize our suite of products and services.
Our Payments Platform, open application programming interfaces, and developer tools are designed to enable developers to
innovate with ease and offer robust applications to our global ecosystem of merchants and consumers, while at the same time
maintaining the security of our customers’ financial information.

The technology infrastructure supporting our Payments Platform simplifies the storage and processing of large amounts of data,
and facilitates the deployment and operation of large-scale global products and services and automates much of the
administration of large-scale clusters of computers. Our technology infrastructure has been designed around industry-standard
architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences. Our Payments Platform incorporates
multiple layers of protection, both for continuity and system redundancy purposes and to help address cybersecurity challenges.
We engage in multiple efforts to protect our technology infrastructure and Payments Platform against these challenges, including
regularly testing our systems to address potential vulnerabilities. We strive to continually improve our technology infrastructure
and Payments Platform to enhance the customer experience and to increase efficiency, scalability and security.

MERCHANT AND CONSUMER PAYMENT SOLUTIONS
Our combined payment solution capabilities offer our merchants and consumers a broad range of products and services, enabling
our merchants to safely and simply receive payments from their customers while allowing our consumers to make seamless
transactions across different markets and networks.

We partner with our merchants to help grow and expand their businesses by improving sales conversion, providing global reach,
offering alternative payment methods, reducing losses through proprietary protection programs and leveraging data analytics.
Merchants can onboard quickly with PayPal and are not required to invest in new or specialized hardware. For our standard service,
we do not charge merchants setup or recurring fees. We offer access to credit products for certain small and medium-sized
merchants through PayPal Working Capital and, with the recent acquisition of Swift Financial Corporation (“Swift”), other business
loan products. Our PayPal Working Capital product allows businesses to borrow a certain percentage of their annual payment
volume processed by PayPal for a fee. Our Swift business loan products provide businesses with access to short-term business
financing based on an evaluation of both the applying business as well as the business owner. We believe that our business
financing offerings allow us to deepen our engagement with our small and medium-sized business merchants by providing them
with access to capital to grow their business that they may not otherwise be able to effectively or efficiently access from traditional
banks or other lending providers. Our recent acquisition of Swift also enables us to enhance our underwriting capabilities and
strengthen our business financing offerings, helping us to deepen relationships with our existing merchants and expand services to
new merchants.

PayPal is a popular form of payment for mobile commerce, and our business has grown with the increased adoption of mobile
devices. We believe our Braintree products strengthen our position in mobile payments and extend our coverage to a new class of
retailers and service providers that offer their services primarily through mobile applications. Through a single Braintree
integration, a merchant can begin accepting payments with credit or debit cards, PayPal, Android Pay, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay
and other payment solutions. We also offer gateway services, including our Payflow Gateway services and Braintree Gateway
services, that enable merchants to accept payments online with credit or debit cards. Our gateway services provide the payment
gateway technology that links a merchant’s website to its processing network and enable merchants to accept payments online
with credit and debit cards.

We focus on providing affordable consumer products intended to democratize the management and movement of money. We
offer our customers the flexibility to use their account to both purchase and receive payment for goods and services, as well as
transfer and withdraw funds. We enable consumers to more safely exchange funds with merchants using a variety of financial

resources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal account balance, a PayPal Credit account, a credit or debit card or other
stored value products such as coupons and gift cards. We generally do not charge consumers to fund or draw from their accounts.
We generate revenue from consumers on fees charged for foreign currency exchange and on interest and fees from our PayPal
Credit product. We offer our PayPal Credit product to consumers as a potential funding source at checkout. Once a consumer is
approved for credit, PayPal Credit is made available as a funding source in their account. We believe that our consumer credit
products allow us to increase engagement with both consumers and merchants on our two-sided network as well as differentiate
ourselves from rival payment processors by helping merchants drive incremental sales through products like PayPal Credit. We are
responsible for all servicing functions related to all of our credit products. In the U.S., credit originated through our PayPal Credit,
PayPal Working Capital and Swift business loan products is currently extended through third-party financial institutions, from
whom we purchase the related receivables. For our consumer and merchant credit products outside the U.S., we extend credit
through certain international PayPal subsidiaries.

During the fourth quarter of 2017, we expanded our strategic consumer credit relationship with Synchrony Financial (“Synchrony”)
and agreed to sell our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank. Following the closing of this transaction, which
is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2018, Synchrony Bank will become the exclusive issuer of the PayPal Credit online
consumer financing program in the U.S. and we will no longer hold any participation interest in the receivables generated through
the program (other than charged off receivables).

We offer consumers person-to-person (“P2P”) payment solutions through our PayPal, Venmo and Xoom products. PayPal
continues to drive the majority of our total P2P volumes, enabling both domestic and international P2P transfers across our
Payments Platform. Our Venmo app in the U.S. is a leading mobile application used to move money between friends and family.
Xoom is an international money transfer service that enables our customers to send money to, pay bills for and send prepaid
mobile phone reloads for family and friends around the world in a secure, fast and cost-effective way, using their mobile device or
personal computers. P2P is a significant customer acquisition channel with network effects that helps us to establish relationships
with potential PayPal users by allowing them to join our Payments Platform at the time of making or receiving P2P payments,
which drives organic growth.

PROTECTING MERCHANTS AND CONSUMERS
Protecting merchants and consumers on our Payments Platform from financial and data loss is imperative to successfully
competing in the payments industry and sustainably growing our business. Fraudulent activities, such as account takeover,
identity theft and counterparty malicious activities, represent a significant and growing risk to merchants and consumers, as well
as their payment partners. We provide merchants and consumers with protection programs on most purchase transactions
completed through our Payments Platform, except for transactions using our gateway and Paydiant products. We believe that
these programs, which protect both merchants and consumers from financial and data loss due primarily to fraud and
counterparty non-performance, are generally much broader than similar protections provided by other participants in the
payments industry. Many payment providers do not offer merchant protection in general, and those that do generally do not
provide protection for online or card not present transactions. As a result, merchants may incur losses for chargebacks and other
claims on certain transactions when using other payments providers that they would not incur if they used our payments services.
We also provide consumer protection against losses on qualifying purchases and accept claims for 180 days post transaction in the
markets that we serve. We believe that this protection is generally consistent with, or better than, that offered by other payments
providers. We believe that as a result of these programs, consumers can be confident that they will only be required to pay if they
receive the product in the condition as described, and merchants can be confident that they will receive payment for the product
that they are delivering to the customer.

Our ability to protect both consumers and merchants is based largely on our proprietary end-to-end payments platform and our
ability to leverage the data we collect on both sides of the transactions on our two-sided network (i.e., from buyers and sellers, and
from senders and receivers of payments). We believe mobile devices will continue to play a significant and increasing role in
commerce, including by creating the opportunities to make our ecosystem safer. For example, PayPal is able to use location data
from mobile devices and growing protection for the mobile operating environment to reduce risk to merchants and consumers.
Our ongoing investment in systems and processes, designed to enhance the safety and security of our products, reflects our goal
of having PayPal recognized as one of the world’s most trusted payments brands.

COMPETITION
The global payments industry is highly competitive. We compete against a wide range of businesses, including banks, credit card
providers, technology and ecommerce companies and traditional retailers, many of which are larger than we are, have a dominant
and secure position, or offer other products and services to consumers and merchants which we do not offer. We compete against
all forms of payments, including credit and debit cards; automated clearing house and bank transfers; other online payment
services; mobile payments; and offline payment methods, including cash and check.

We compete primarily on the basis of the following:

• ability to attract, retain and engage both merchants and consumers with our two-sided platform;
• ability to show merchants that they may achieve incremental sales by offering our end-to-end services;

competition worldwide in the global payments industry may harm our business” for further discussion of the potential impact of
competition on our business.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Total research and development expense was $953 million, $834 million and $792 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
The protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks (particularly those covering the PayPal name), patents,
copyrights, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets is important to the success of our business. We seek to protect our
intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of
administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring
products and services. We have routinely entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees
and contractors and non-disclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business to control access to and limit
disclosure of our proprietary information.

We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and internationally. Additionally, we
have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain aspects of our proprietary technology. We have registered our
core brands as trademarks and domain names in the U.S. and a large number of other jurisdictions and have in place an active
program to continue to secure trademarks and domain names that correspond to our brands in markets of interest.

For additional information regarding some of the risks relating to our intellectual property, including costs of protecting our
intellectual property, see the information in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the captions “We are subject to patent litigation” and
“We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or third parties may allege that we are
infringing their intellectual property rights.”

GOVERNMENT REGULATION
We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects
of the payments industry. That focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on such
important issues as countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy and consumer protection. Some of the laws and
regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently, and the laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted
prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments, are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial
interpretation. Non-compliance with laws and regulations, increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance,
changes in laws and regulations, or their interpretation, and the enactment of new laws and regulations applicable to us could have
a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Therefore, we monitor these areas closely
to design compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us.

Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business. We are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in
the markets we operate.

Payments Regulation. Various laws and regulations govern the payments industry in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S.,
PayPal, Inc. holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent), which, among other things, subjects PayPal, Inc. to
reporting requirements, bonding requirements, limitations on the investment of customer funds and inspection by state
regulatory agencies. Outside the U.S., we provide localized versions of our service to customers through various foreign
subsidiaries. The activities of those non-U.S. entities are, or may be, supervised by a financial regulatory authority in the
jurisdictions in which they operate. Among other regulatory authorities, the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur
Financier (the “CSSF”), the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Reserve
Bank of India, and the Central Bank of Russia have asserted jurisdiction over some or all of our activities in country. This list is not

www.paypal.com

6

Part I

exhaustive, as there are numerous other regulatory agencies that have or may assert jurisdiction over our activities. The laws and
regulations applicable to the payments industry in any given jurisdiction are subject to interpretation and change.

Banking Agency Supervision. We serve our customers in the European Union through PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie, SCA, a
wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in Luxembourg by the CSSF. Consequently, we must
comply with rules and regulations of the banking industry, including those related to capitalization, funds management, corporate
governance, anti-money laundering, disclosure, reporting and inspection. We also are, or may be, subject to banking-related
regulations in other countries now or in the future related to our role in the financial industry. In addition, based on our
relationships with our partner financial institutions, we are, or may be, subject to indirect regulation and examination by these
financial institutions’ regulators.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) has significant authority to
regulate consumer financial products in the United States, including consumer credit, deposit, payment, and similar products. As a
large market participant of remittance transfers, the CFPB has direct supervisory authority over our business. The CFPB and other
similar regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions may have broad consumer protection mandates that could result in the
promulgation and interpretation of rules and regulations that may affect our business.

Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing. PayPal is subject to anti-money laundering (“AML”) laws and
regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as laws designed to prevent the use of the financial systems to facilitate
terrorist activities. Our AML program is designed to prevent our payment network from being used to facilitate money laundering,
terrorist financing, and other illicit activities, or to do business in countries or with persons and entities included on designated
country or person lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls (“OFAC”) and
equivalent authorities in other countries. Our AML compliance program, overseen by our AML/Bank Secrecy Act Officer, is
composed of policies, procedures and internal controls, and is designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and
assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.

Interchange Fees. Interchange fees associated with four-party payments systems are being reviewed or challenged in various
jurisdictions. For example, in the European Union (“EU”), the Multilateral Interchange Fee (“MIF”) Regulation caps credit and debit
interchange fees for cards payments and provides for business rules to be complied with by any company dealing with card
transactions, including PayPal. As a result, the fees that we collect in certain jurisdictions may become the subject of regulatory
challenge.

Data Protection and Information Security. Aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy and data protection
regulation in the United States (“U.S.”), the EU and elsewhere. For example, the EU has adopted a comprehensive General Data
Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which comes into effect in May 2018 and expands the scope of the EU data protection law to
all foreign companies processing personal data of EU residents, imposes a strict data protection compliance regime, and includes
new rights. In the United States, we are subject to information safeguarding requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that
require the maintenance of a written, comprehensive information security program and in Europe, the operations of our
Luxembourg bank are subject to information safeguarding requirements under the Luxembourg Banking Act, among other laws.
Regulatory authorities around the world are considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and
data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in the United States,
Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in a state of flux.

Anti-Corruption. PayPal is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K.
Bribery Act, and similar anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit
offering, promising, giving, accepting or authorizing others to provide anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to or from a
government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to
obtain or retain business. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with these
laws and regulations.

Additional Regulatory Developments. Various regulatory agencies continue to examine a wide variety of issues, including virtual
currencies, identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules, security and marketing that may impact
PayPal’s business.

For an additional discussion on governmental regulation affecting our business, please see the risk factors related to regulation of
our payments business and regulation in the areas of consumer privacy, data use and/or security in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under
the caption “Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition” and “Item 3. Legal
Proceedings” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

SEASONALITY
The Company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to net revenues. No individual quarter in 2017, 2016 or
2015 accounted for more than 30% of annual net revenue.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS
We operate in one business segment and have one reportable segment. See “Note 11—Segment and Geographical Information” to
the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information including
certain financial information about our operations in the U.S. and internationally. Additionally, please see the information in “Item
1A. Risk Factors” under the caption “Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business,”
which describes risks associated with our foreign operations.

EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 18,700 people globally, of whom approximately 10,600 were located in the
U.S. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

SEPARATION FROM EBAY INC.
PayPal Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 for the purpose of owning and operating eBay’s Payments
business in connection with the separation and distribution described below. Prior to the contribution of this business to PayPal
Holdings, Inc., which occurred prior to the distribution in July 2015, PayPal Holdings, Inc. had no operations. On July 17, 2015 (the
“distribution date”), PayPal became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by eBay of 100% of
the outstanding common stock of PayPal to eBay stockholders (which we refer to as the “separation” or the “distribution”). Each
eBay stockholder of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2015 received one share of PayPal common stock for every share of
eBay common stock held on the record date. Approximately 1.2 billion shares of PayPal common stock were distributed on July 17,
2015 to eBay stockholders. PayPal’s common stock began “regular way” trading under the ticker symbol “PYPL” on the NASDAQ
Stock Market on July 20, 2015. Prior to the separation, eBay transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations
of eBay’s payments business to PayPal, which was completed in June 2015.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

The following discussion is divided into three sections. The first section, which begins immediately following this paragraph,
discusses some of the risks that may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The second
section, captioned “Risks Related to the Separation and Our Operation as an Independent Publicly Traded Company,”
discusses some of the risks relating to our separation into an independent publicly traded company. The third section,
captioned “Risks Related to Our Common Stock,” discusses some of the risks relating to an investment in our Common Stock.
You should carefully review all of these sections for important information regarding risks and uncertainties that affect us, in
addition to the other information appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial
statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and
uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that
adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of
operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected.

RISK FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may harm our business.
The global payments industry is highly competitive, and we compete against a wide range of businesses, some of which are larger
than we are, have a dominant and secure position, or offer other products and services to consumers and merchants that we do
not offer. The global payments industry is rapidly changing, highly innovative and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny. Many
of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent

Part I

introductions of new products and services. Competition may also intensify as businesses against which we compete or merchants
enter into business combinations and alliances, and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with
our business.

We compete against a wide range of businesses with varying roles in all forms of payments, including:

• paper-based transactions (principally cash and checks);
• providers of traditional payment methods, particularly credit and debit cards and Automated Clearing House transactions (in

particular, well-established banks);

• payment networks which facilitate payments for credit card users;
• providers of “digital wallets” which offer customers the ability to pay online and/or in-store through a variety of payment

methods, including with mobile applications, through contactless payments, and with a variety of payment cards;

• providers of mobile payments solutions that use tokenized card data approaches and contactless payments (e.g., near field

communication (“NFC”) or host card emulation functionality) to eliminate the need to swipe or insert a card or enter a personal
identification number or password;

• payment-card processors that offer their services to merchants, including for “card on file” payments where the merchant

invites the consumer to select a payment method for their first transaction and to use the same payment method for
subsequent transactions;

• providers of “person-to-person” payments that facilitate individuals sending money with an email address or mobile phone

number;

• merchants and merchant associations providing proprietary payment networks to facilitate payments within their own retail

network;

• money remitters;
• providers of card readers for mobile devices and of other point-of-sale and multi-channel technologies; and
• providers of virtual currencies and distributed ledger technologies.

We often partner with many of these businesses and we consider the ability to continue establishing these partnerships as
important to our business. Competition for relationships with these partners is intense and there can be no assurance that we will
be able to continue to establish, grow or maintain these partner relationships.

We also face competition and potential competition from:

•

service providers that provide online merchants the ability to offer their customers the option of paying for purchases from
their bank account or paying on credit;
issuers of stored value targeted at online payments;

•
• other global online and mobile payment-services providers;
• other providers of online and mobile account-based payments;
•

services targeting users of social networks and online gaming, including those offering social commerce and peer-to-peer
payments;

• mobile payment services between bank accounts;
• payment services enabling banking customers to send and receive payments through their bank account, including through

immediate or real-time payments systems;

• ecommerce services that provide special offers linked to a specific payment provider;
•
• electronic funds transfer services as a method of payment for both online and offline transactions.

services that help merchants accept and manage virtual currencies; and

Some of these competitors have larger customer bases, volume, scale, resources, and market share than we do, which may provide
significant competitive advantages. Some of our competitors may also be subject to less burdensome licensing, anti-money
laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and other regulatory requirements. They may devote greater resources to the
development, promotion, and sale of products and services, and they may offer lower prices or more effectively introduce their
own innovative programs, products and services that adversely impact our growth.

We compete primarily on the basis of the following:

• ability to attract, retain and engage both merchants and consumers;
• ability to demonstrate that merchants will achieve incremental sales by offering PayPal services;
• consumer confidence in safety and security of transactions on our Payments Platform, including the ability for consumers to
use PayPal products and services without sharing their financial information with the merchant or the party they are paying;
simplicity of our fee structure;

•
• ability to develop services across multiple commerce channels, including mobile payments and payments at the retail point of

sale;
trust in our dispute resolution and buyer and seller protection programs;

• customer service;
• brand recognition;
• website, mobile platform and application onboarding, ease-of-use, speed, availability, and dependability;

• ease and quality of integration into third-party mobile applications and operating systems; and
• quality of developer tools, such as our application programming interfaces and software development kits.

the technology- and payment-agnostic nature of our Payments Platform;
system reliability and data security;

If we are not able to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors, drive value for our customers, or
effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors.
Our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely harm our
business.

Substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter, which
may result in significant fluctuations in our operating results that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of
operations, and cash flows, as well as the trading price of our common stock.
Substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter. As a
result, our operating and financial results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history, and may continue to
fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including as a result of the risks set forth in this “Risk Factors” section. It is
difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or earnings accurately. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of our
business, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an
indication of future performance. Due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues, it is also difficult to forecast expenses as a
percentage of net revenues. Quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of net revenues reflected in our financial statements
may be significantly different from historical or projected rates. Our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below
the expectations of securities analysts and investors. The trading price of our common stock may decline significantly as a result of
the factors described in this paragraph.

Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business.
Our operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Uncertainty about global and
regional economic events and conditions may result in consumers and businesses postponing or lowering spending in response to
tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates,
government austerity programs, negative financial news, declines in income or asset values, and other factors. These and other
global and regional economic events and conditions could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and
services, including a reduction in the volume and size of transactions on our Payments Platform. In addition, any financial turmoil
affecting the banking system or financial markets could cause additional consolidation of the financial services industry, significant
financial service institution failures, new or incremental tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity, and extreme volatility or
distress in the fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.

If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative products and services, the use of our
products and services and, consequently, our revenues could decline.
Rapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes impact the industries in which we operate, including developments in
payment card tokenization, mobile, social commerce (i.e., ecommerce through social networks), authentication, virtual currencies
(including distributed ledger technologies), and NFC and other proximity payment devices, such as contactless payments. We
cannot predict the effects of technological changes on our business. In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we rely in
part on third parties, including some of our competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. We expect that
new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and may be superior to, or
render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. Developing and incorporating new technologies
into our products and services may require substantial expenditures, take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful.
In addition, our ability to adopt new products and services and to develop new technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide
standards, payments networks, changes to laws and regulations, resistance to change from consumers or merchants, third-party
intellectual property rights, or other factors. Our success will depend on our ability to develop and incorporate new technologies
and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards; if we are unable to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner,
our business could be harmed.

Changes in how consumers fund their PayPal transactions could harm our business.
We pay transaction fees when consumers fund payment transactions using credit cards, lower fees when consumers fund
payments with debit cards, and nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from
bank accounts, or from an existing PayPal account balance or through our PayPal Credit products. Our financial success is sensitive
to changes in the rate at which our consumers fund payments using credit and debit cards (collectively, “payment cards”), which
can significantly increase our costs. Although we provide consumers with the opportunity to use their existing PayPal account
balance to fund payment transactions, some of our consumers may prefer to use payment cards, especially if these payment cards
offer features and benefits that are not provided as part of their PayPal accounts. An increase in the portion of our payment

Part I

volume funded using payment cards or in fees associated with our funding mix, or other events or developments that make it
more difficult or costly for us to fund transactions with lower-cost funding options, could materially and adversely affect our
financial performance and significantly harm our business.

We have entered into strategic partnerships with major payment card networks and/or issuing banks to promote greater
consumer choice and make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to pay with these partners’ credit and/or debt cards
and to allow us to gain access to these partners’ tokenization services for in-store point of sale PayPal transactions. These
arrangements may have an uncertain impact on our business. While we anticipate that these and similar strategic partnerships we
may enter into in the future will result in an increase in the number of transactions and transaction volume that we process, we
also anticipate that a greater percentage of customer transactions will be executed using a payment card, which would likely
increase the transaction costs associated with our funding mix, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches.
Our business involves the collection, storage, processing and transmission of customers’ personal data, including financial
information and information about how they interact with our Payments Platform. In addition, a significant number of our
customers authorize us to bill their payment card or bank accounts directly for all transaction and other fees charged by us. We
have built our reputation on the premise that our Payments Platform offers customers a more secure way to make payments. An
increasing number of organizations, including large merchants and businesses, other large technology companies, financial
institutions, and government institutions, have disclosed breaches of their information security systems, some of which have
involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks, including on their websites and infrastructure.

The techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper or illegal access to our systems, our data or customers’ data, disable or
degrade service, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving, may be difficult to detect quickly, and often are not recognized until
launched against a target. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means,
including hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers, partners or vendors, or attempting to fraudulently
induce (often through spear phishing attacks) our employees, customers, partners, vendors or other users of our systems into
disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access
our information technology systems. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored and supported by significant financial and
technological resources, making them even more sophisticated and difficult to detect. We believe that PayPal is a particularly
attractive target for such breaches and attacks due to our name and brand recognition and the widespread adoption and use of
our products and services. Although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect our data and customer data
and to prevent data loss and other security breaches, and expect to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these
protections, these security measures cannot provide absolute security. Our information technology and infrastructure may be
vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches, and third parties may be able to access our customers’ personal or proprietary
information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through those systems. Our security measures may also be
breached due to human error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, or other irregularities. Actual or perceived breaches of
our security could interrupt our operations, result in our systems or services being unavailable, result in improper disclosure of
data, materially harm our reputation and brands, result in significant regulatory scrutiny and legal and financial exposure, cause us
to incur significant remediation costs, lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services, divert
the attention of management from the operation of our business, result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from
us to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses to them or claims by them, and adversely affect our business
and results of operations. In addition, any cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting companies that we acquire or our
customers, partners or vendors (including data center and cloud computing providers) could have similar negative effects. See
Note 3—“Business Combinations,” Note 4—“Goodwill and Intangible Assets” and Note 13—“Commitments and Contingencies” to
our consolidated financial statements for disclosure relating to the suspension of operations of TIO Networks (“TIO”) (which we
acquired in July 2017) as part of an ongoing investigation of security vulnerability of the TIO platform. Actual or perceived
vulnerabilities or data breaches have led and may lead to claims against us.

In addition, under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information
that we store, or that is stored by our direct payment card processing customers, we could be liable to the payment card issuing
banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. We also expect to expend significant additional resources to protect
against security or privacy breaches, and may be required to redress problems caused by breaches. Financial services regulators in
various jurisdictions, including the U.S. and the EU, have implemented authentication requirements for banks and payment
processors intended to reduce online fraud, which could impose significant costs, require us to change our business practices,
make it more difficult for new customers to join PayPal, and reduce the ease of use of our products, which could harm our
business. Additionally, while we maintain insurance policies, they may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by
security breaches.

Systems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, applications, products or services could harm our
business.
Our systems and those of our services providers and partners may experience service interruptions or degradation because of
hardware and software defects or malfunctions, computer denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, human error, earthquakes,

hurricanes, floods, fires, natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political
conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses or other malware, or other events. Our systems also may be subject to break-ins,
sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may
not be sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, as a provider of payments solutions, we are subject to heightened scrutiny by
regulators that may require specific business continuity, resiliency and disaster recovery plans, and more rigorous testing of such
plans, which may be costly and time-consuming and may divert our resources from other business priorities.

We have experienced and expect to continue to experience system failures, denial of service attacks, and other events or
conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability, or reduce or adversely affect the speed or functionality of our products
and services. These events have resulted and likely will result in loss of revenue. A prolonged interruption in the availability or
reduction in the availability, speed or functionality of our products and services could materially harm our business. Frequent or
persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential customers to believe that our systems are unreliable,
leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid or reduce the use of our products and services, and could permanently harm
our reputation and brands. Moreover, if any system failure or similar event results in damages to our customers or their business
partners, these customers or partners could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses, and
those claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address, and could have other
consequences described in this “Risk Factors” section under the caption “Our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and
privacy breaches.”

Our Payments Platform has experienced and may in the future experience intermittent unavailability. The full-time availability
and expeditious delivery of our products and services is critical to our goal of gaining widespread acceptance among consumers
and merchants for digital payments. We have undertaken certain system upgrades and re-platforming efforts designed to improve
our reliability and speed. These efforts are costly and time-consuming, involve significant technical risk and may divert our
resources from new features and products, and there can be no guarantee that these efforts will succeed. Because we are a
regulated financial institution in certain jurisdictions, frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny,
significant fines and penalties, and mandatory and costly changes to our business practices, and ultimately could cause us to lose
existing licenses that we need to operate or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our
business.

We also rely on facilities, components and services supplied by third parties, including data center facilities and cloud storage
services. If these third parties cease to provide the facilities or services, experience operational interference or disruptions, breach
their agreements with us, or fail to perform their obligations and meet our expectations, our operations could be disrupted or
otherwise negatively affected, which could result in customer dissatisfaction and damage to our reputation and brands, and
materially and adversely affect our business. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all
losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.

In addition, we are continually improving and upgrading our information systems and technologies. Implementation of new
systems and technologies is complex, expensive and time-consuming. If we fail to timely and successfully implement new
information systems and technologies, or improvements or upgrades to existing information systems and technologies, or if such
systems and technologies do not operate as intended, this could have an adverse impact on our business, internal controls
(including internal controls over financial reporting), results of operations and financial condition.

Changes to payment card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices could harm our business.
We rely on banks or other payment processors to process transactions and pay fees for the services. From time to time, payment
card networks have increased, and may increase in the future, the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each
transaction that accesses their networks. Payment card networks have or may impose special fees or assessments for transactions
that are executed through a “digital wallet” such as PayPal’s, which could particularly impact us and significantly increase our costs.
Our payment card processors may have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us as well as
increase their own fees for processing. Any changes in interchange fees and assessments could increase our operating costs and
reduce our operating income. We have entered into strategic partnerships with Visa and Mastercard to further expand our
relationships in a way that will make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay with Visa and Mastercard
credit and debit cards. During the terms of these agreements, Visa and Mastercard have each agreed to not enact or impose any
fees or rules that solely target PayPal. Upon termination of the agreements, PayPal could become subject to special digital wallet
fees or other special assessments.

In addition, in some jurisdictions, governmental regulations have required payment card networks to reduce interchange fees. Any
material change in credit or debit card interchange rates in the U.S. or other markets, including as a result of changes in
interchange fee limitations, could adversely affect our competitive position against traditional credit and debit card service
providers and our business.

We are required by our processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including special operating rules for
payment service providers to merchants. We have agreed to reimburse our processors for any fines they are assessed by payment

www.paypal.com

12

Part I

card networks as a result of any rule violations by us or our merchants. The payment card networks set and interpret the card
operating rules. From time to time, the networks have alleged that various aspects of our business model violate these operating
rules. If such allegations are not resolved favorably, they may result in significant fines and penalties or require changes in our
business practices that may be costly. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret
existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. As a result, we
could lose our ability to give consumers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments or the choice of currency in
which they would like their payment card to be charged. If we are unable to accept payment cards or are limited in our ability to do
so, our business would be adversely affected.

We and our payment card processors have implemented specific business processes for merchants to comply with payment card
network operating rules for providing services to merchants. Any failure to comply with these rules could result in fines. We are
also subject to fines from payment card networks if we fail to detect that merchants are engaging in activities that are illegal or
that are considered “high risk,” including the sale of certain types of digital content. For “high risk” merchants, we must either
prevent such merchants from using PayPal services or register such merchants with the payment card networks and conduct
additional monitoring with respect to such merchants. Although the amount of these fines has not been material to date,
additional fines in the future could become significant and could result in a termination of our ability to accept payment cards or
require changes in our process for registering new customers, which would adversely affect our business. Payment card network
rules may also increase the cost of, impose restrictions on, or otherwise negatively impact the development of, our retail
point-of-sale solutions, which may negatively impact their deployment and adoption.

Failure to deal effectively with fraud, fictitious transactions, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences would increase
our loss rate and harm our business, and could severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services.
In the event that merchants do not fulfill their obligations to consumers or a merchant’s goods or services do not match the
merchant’s description, we may incur substantial losses as a result of claims from consumers. We seek to recover such losses from
the merchant, but may not be able to recover in full if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay. In addition, in the event of the
bankruptcy or other business interruption of a merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use
(e.g., airline, cruise or concert tickets, custom-made goods and subscriptions), we could be liable to the buyers of such goods or
services, either through our buyer protection program or through chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their
payment. While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such
eventualities, these reserves may be insufficient.

We also incur substantial losses from claims that the consumer did not authorize the purchase, from customer fraud, from
erroneous transactions, and as a result of customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in their bank
accounts to satisfy payments. In addition, if losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive, they
could potentially result in our losing the right to accept payment cards for payment, which would harm our business. We have
taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, but these measures need to be continually improved and may not be
effective against fraud, particularly new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new product offerings. If
these measures do not succeed, our business could be harmed.

We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, including the British Pound, Euro,
Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar
versus the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar impacts the translation of our net revenues generated in
these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. In connection with providing our services in multiple currencies, we may face financial
exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the times
that we set them. Given that we also hold some corporate and customer funds in non-U.S. currencies, our financial results are
affected by the remeasurement of these non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars. We also have foreign exchange risk on our assets and
liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. While we regularly enter into
transactions to hedge foreign currency risk for portions of our foreign currency translation and balance sheet exposure, it is
impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of this exposure. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could materially and
adversely impact our financial results.

Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business.
Cross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our
revenue and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions
that take place within a single country or market. Cross-border trade also represents our primary (and in some cases, our only)
presence in certain important markets.

Cross-border trade is subject to, and may be negatively impacted by, foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, the
interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions (e.g., the jurisdiction of the merchant and of the consumer) are
often extremely complicated in the context of cross-border trade. Changes to or the interpretation and/or application of laws and
regulations applicable to cross-border trade could impose additional requirements and restrictions, impose conflicting obligations,

2017 Annual Report

Part I

13

and increase the costs associated with cross-border trade. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our
customers or that restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical would lower our revenues and profits and
could harm our business.

The United Kingdom’s departure from the EU could adversely affect us.
The United Kingdom (“U.K.”) held a referendum in June 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the EU (“Brexit”).
In March 2017, the U.K. invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, which triggered a two-year period, with extension
subject to unanimous consent by the other EU member states, during which the U.K. government will negotiate its withdrawal
agreement with the EU. Brexit could adversely affect U.K., regional (including European), and worldwide economic and market
conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of
the British Pound and Euro, which in turn could adversely affect our customers and companies with which we do business,
particularly in the U.K. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and see national laws and regulations in the U.K. diverge
from EU laws and regulations, as the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. In particular, depending on the terms
of Brexit, we may face new regulatory costs and challenges, including the following:

• we could lose our ability for our EU operations to offer services on a cross-border basis into the U.K. market utilizing regulatory
permissions of PayPal (Europe) S.à r.l. et Cie, SCA (“PayPal (Europe)”), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject
to regulation as a credit institution in Luxembourg, and our corresponding ability to work with the Luxembourg regulators as
the lead authority for various aspects of our U.K. operations;

• we could be required to obtain additional regulatory permissions to operate in the U.K. market, adding costs and potential

inconsistency to our business (and, depending on the capacity of the U.K. authorities, the criteria for obtaining permission, and
any possible transitional arrangements, there is a risk that our business in the U.K. could be materially affected or disrupted);

• we could be required to comply with regulatory requirements in the U.K. that are in addition to, or inconsistent with, the

regulatory requirements of the EU; and

• our ability to attract and retain the necessary human resources in appropriate locations to support the U.K. business and the

EU business of PayPal could be adversely impacted.

Any of the effects of Brexit described above and others that we cannot anticipate could adversely affect our business, results of
operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight, as well as extensive, complex, overlapping and
frequently changing rules, regulations and legal interpretations.
Our business is subject to laws, rules, regulations, policies, and legal interpretations in the markets in which we operate, including,
but not limited to, those governing banking, credit, deposit taking, cross-border and domestic money transmission, foreign
exchange, privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, banking secrecy, payment services (including payment processing and
settlement services), consumer protection, economic and trade sanctions, anti-money laundering, and counter-terrorist financing.
The legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us are extensive, complex, frequently changing, and increasing in number, and
may impose overlapping and/or conflicting requirements or obligations.

Financial and political events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on the payments industry, and regulatory agencies
may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past and in a manner adverse to our business.
Our success and increased visibility may result in increased regulatory oversight and tighter enforcement of rules and regulations
that may apply to our business.

As we expand and localize our international activities, we are increasingly becoming obligated to comply with the laws of the
countries or markets in which we operate. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of
goods and provide services to customers worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to
comply with their laws. Laws regulating the Internet, mobile and related technologies outside of the U.S. often impose different,
more specific, or even conflicting obligations on us, as well as broader liability. For example, certain transactions that may be
permissible in a local jurisdiction may be prohibited by regulations of U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets
Control (“OFAC”) or U.S. anti-money laundering or counter-terrorist financing regulations.

Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws, regulations or orders of any governmental authority (including
changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws, regulations or orders), including those discussed in this risk factor,
may subject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, and enforcement actions in
one or more jurisdictions, result in additional compliance and licensure requirements, increase regulatory scrutiny of our business,
restrict our operations, and force us to change our business practices, make product or operational changes or delay planned
product launches or improvements. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, damage our brands and business,
and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The complexity of U.S. federal and state regulatory and
enforcement regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment, could result
in a single event giving rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple
government authorities in different jurisdictions. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure

www.paypal.com

14

Part I

compliance with applicable laws, and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not
violate such laws and regulations.

Payments Regulation
In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. has obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where it is
required, as well as in the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. These licenses include not only the PayPal
branded products and services in these states, but also our Braintree, Venmo, Xoom and TIO branded products and services. As a
licensed money transmitter, PayPal is subject to restrictions with respect to the investment of customer funds, reporting
requirements, bonding requirements and inspection by state regulatory agencies. Accordingly, if we violate these laws or
regulations, we could be subject to liability and/or additional restrictions, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain
states, forced to change our business practices or required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals, which could
impose substantial costs.

While we currently allow our customers with payment cards to send payments from approximately 200 markets, we allow
customers in only approximately half of those markets (including the U.S.) to also receive payments, in some cases with significant
restrictions on the manner in which customers can withdraw funds. These limitations may adversely affect our ability to grow our
business in these markets.

We provide our services to customers in the EU through PayPal (Europe), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject
to regulation as a credit institution in Luxembourg. Accordingly, PayPal (Europe) is subject to significant fines or other
enforcement action if it violates the disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, fund management, corporate
governance, privacy, data protection, information security, banking secrecy, taxation, sanctions, or other requirements imposed on
Luxembourg banks. In addition, EU laws and regulations are typically subject to different and potentially inconsistent
interpretations by the countries that are members of the EU, which can make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to
manage. Moreover, the countries that are EU members may each have different and potentially inconsistent domestic regulations
implementing European Directives, including the EU Payment Services Directive and the E-Money Directive, which could make
compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage. The Revised Payment Services Directive (“PSD2”) entered into force
in January 2016 and is in the process of being implemented into national legislation, with certain requirements effective January 13,
2018. The implementation of the PSD2 may negatively affect our business. PSD2 seeks to enable new payment models whereby a
newly formed category of regulated payment provider would be able to access bank and payment accounts (including PayPal
accounts) for the purposes of accessing account information or initiating a payment on behalf of a customer. Such access could
subject us to data security and other legal and financial risks and could create new competitive forces and new types of
competitors in the European payments market. PSD2 seeks to regulate more online platforms that handle payments for their
sellers. PayPal merchants with affected business models which are not licensed, or which do not benefit from exemptions or
integrate a compliant marketplaces solution may not be able to offer PayPal products in the future. PSD2 also imposes new
standards for payment security and strong customer authentication that may make it more difficult and time consuming to carry
out a PayPal transaction, which may adversely impact PayPal’s customer value proposition and its European business.

Finally, if the business activities of PayPal (Europe) exceed certain thresholds, or if the European Central Bank (“ECB”) determines
that PayPal (Europe) is a significant supervised entity or that some activity of PayPal (Europe) is deemed subject to oversight by
the ECB, PayPal (Europe) could become directly regulated by the ECB in addition to the Luxembourg regulator, the Commission
de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the “CSSF”), as its national supervisor, which could subject us to additional requirements and
would likely increase compliance costs.

In Australia, we serve our customers through PayPal Australia Pty. Ltd. (“PayPal Australia”), which is licensed by the Australian
Securities and Investments Commission as a provider of a non-cash payment product and by the Australian Prudential Regulation
Authority as a purchased payment facility provider, which is a type of authorized depository institution. Accordingly, PayPal
Australia is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the product disclosure, reporting, anti-money
laundering, capital requirements, privacy, corporate governance or other requirements imposed on Australian depository
institutions.

In Hong Kong, we serve our customers through PayPal Hong Kong Limited (“PayPal Hong Kong”), which is licensed by the Hong
Kong Monetary Authority as an issuer of stored value facility (“SVF Licensee”). Accordingly, PayPal Hong Kong is subject to
significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the reporting, anti-money laundering, capital requirements, privacy,
corporate governance, risk management, float management, and/or any other requirements imposed on SVF Licensees.

In many of the other markets in which we do business, we serve our customers through PayPal Pte. Ltd., our wholly-owned
subsidiary based in Singapore. PayPal Pte. Ltd. is supervised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and designated as a holder of
a stored value facility, but does not hold a remittance license. As a result, PayPal Pte. Ltd. is not able to offer outbound remittance
payments (including donations to charities) from Singapore, and can only offer payments for the purchase of goods and services in
Singapore. In many of the markets (other than Singapore) served by PayPal Pte. Ltd., it is unclear and uncertain whether our
Singapore-based service is subject only to Singapore law or, if it is subject to the application of local laws, whether such local laws
would require a payment processor like us to be licensed as a payments service, bank, financial institution or otherwise.

2017 Annual Report

Part I

We are also subject to regulation in other markets in which we do business, and we have been and expect to continue to be
required to apply for various licenses, certifications and regulatory approvals in a number of the countries where we provide our
services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such licenses, certifications, and approvals. In addition, there
are substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining such licenses, certifications, and approvals, and we
could be subject to fines or other enforcement action if we are found to violate disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering,
capitalization, corporate governance or other requirements of such licenses. These factors could impose substantial additional
costs and involve considerable delay to the development or provision of our products or services, or could require significant and
costly operational changes or prevent us from providing our products or services in a given market.

In many countries, it may not be clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider, bank, financial
institution or otherwise. In such markets, we may rely on local banks to process payments and conduct foreign exchange
transactions in local currency. Local regulators may use their power to slow or halt payments to local merchants conducted
through local banks or otherwise prohibit us from doing business in a country. Such regulatory actions or the need to obtain
licenses, certifications or other regulatory approvals could impose substantial costs, involve considerable delay to the provision or
development of our services, require significant and costly operational changes, impose restrictions, limitations, or additional
requirements on our business, or prevent us from providing any products or services in a given market.

Consumer Protection
The financial services sector is subject to significant regulation and we are subject to consumer protection laws and regulations in
the countries in which we operate. In the U.S., we are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations
applicable to our activities, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (“EFTA”) and Regulation E as implemented by the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). These regulations require us to provide advance disclosure of changes to our
services, follow specified error resolution procedures, and reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized
by the consumer, among other requirements. Additionally, technical violations of consumer protection laws could result in the
assessment of actual damages or statutory damages or penalties of up to $1,000 in individual cases or up to $500,000 per violation
in any class action and treble damages in some instances; we could also be liable for plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees in such cases. We are
subject to, and have paid amounts in settlement of, lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the EFTA and
Regulation E or otherwise advance claims for relief relating to our business practices (e.g., that we improperly held consumer funds
or otherwise improperly limited consumer accounts).

In October 2016, the CFPB issued a final rule on prepaid accounts. The rule’s definition of prepaid account includes certain
accounts that are capable of being loaded with funds and whose primary function is to conduct transactions with multiple,
unaffiliated merchants, at ATMs and/or for person-to-person transfers, including certain digital wallets. The rule’s requirements
include: the disclosure of fees and other information to the consumer prior to the creation of a prepaid account; the extension of
Regulation E liability limits and error-resolution requirements to all prepaid accounts; the application of Regulation Z credit card
requirements to prepaid accounts with overdraft and credit features; and the submission of prepaid account agreements to the
CFPB and their publication to the general public. In April 2017, the CFPB delayed the effective date of the final rule on prepaid
accounts to April 1, 2018, and indicated that it would review, among other issues, the linking of credit cards to digital wallets that
are capable of storing funds. In June 2017, the CFPB released proposed changes to its final rule, and in January 2018, the CFPB
issued its final rule, with an effective date of April 1, 2019. We are evaluating the final rule and its requirements. Implementation of
the rule could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices and the design of certain products, allocate
additional resources, and increase our costs, which could negatively affect our business.

In May 2015, we entered into a Stipulated Final Judgment and Consent Order (“Consent Order”) with the CFPB in which we settled
regulatory claims arising from PayPal Credit practices between 2011 and 2015. The Consent Order included obligations on PayPal to
pay $15 million in redress to consumers and a $10 million civil monetary penalty, and required PayPal to make various changes to
PayPal Credit disclosures and related business practices. We continue to cooperate and engage with the CFPB and work to ensure
compliance with the Consent Order, which may result in us incurring additional costs.

PayPal (Europe) principally offers its services in EU countries through a “passport” notification process through the Luxembourg
regulator to regulators in other EU member states pursuant to EU regulation. Regulators in these countries could notify PayPal
(Europe) of local consumer protection laws that apply to its business, in addition to Luxembourg consumer protection law, and
could also seek to persuade the Luxembourg regulator to order PayPal (Europe) to conduct its or the PayPal group’s activities in
the local country directly or through a branch office. These or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of, or
delay, our plans to expand our business in EU countries.

Economic and Trade Sanctions
We are required to comply with U.S. economic and trade sanctions administered by OFAC. We have self-reported to OFAC certain
transactions that were inadvertently processed but subsequently identified as possible violations of U.S. economic and trade
sanctions. In March 2015, we reached a settlement with OFAC regarding possible violations arising from our sanctions compliance
practices between 2009 and 2013, prior to the implementation of our real-time transaction scanning program. Subsequently, we
have self-reported additional transactions as possible violations, and we have received new subpoenas from OFAC seeking

www.paypal.com

16

Part I

additional information about certain of these transactions. Such self-reported transactions could result in claims or actions against
us, including litigation, injunctions, damage awards, fines or penalties, or require us to change our business practices in a manner
that could result in a material loss, require significant management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources
or otherwise harm our business. Furthermore, compliance with economic and trade sanctions in force in one jurisdiction may
conflict with the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions in which we operate and can expose us to the risk of fines, sanctions
and penalties.

Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing
We are subject to various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations around the world that
prohibit, among other things, our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. U.S. and other regulators globally
continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations, which may require us to further revise or expand our
compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and
domestic transactions. Many countries in which we operate also have anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws
and regulations, and we have been and will continue to be required to make changes to our compliance program in various
jurisdictions in response. Regulators regularly re-examine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep
applicable records or verify identities of customers and any change in such thresholds could result in greater costs for compliance.
In the EU, the implementation of the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive and the regulation on information accompanying
transfer of funds (commonly known as the Revised Wire Transfer Regulation) are expected to make compliance more costly and
operationally difficult to manage, lead to increased friction for customers, and result in a decrease in business. As of December
2017, PayPal (Europe)’s home state, Luxembourg, had not yet implemented all of the provisions of the Fourth Anti-Money
Laundering Directive and there is uncertainty as to the exact requirements with which PayPal (Europe) will be required to comply.
Penalties for non-compliance with the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive could include fines of up to 10% of PayPal
(Europe)’s total annual turnover. EU institutions are also proposing changes to the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive which
could be even more stringent.

Privacy and Protection of User Data
We are subject to a number of laws, rules, directives and regulations (which we refer to as “privacy laws”) relating to the collection,
use, retention, security, processing and transfer (which we refer to as “process”) of personally identifiable information about our
customers and employees (which we refer to as “personal data”) in the countries where we operate. Much of the personal data
that we process, especially financial information, is regulated by multiple privacy laws and, in some cases, the privacy laws of
multiple jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information
between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relationships.

Regulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, and the collection, use and sharing of data is increasing around the world. There is
uncertainty associated with the legal and regulatory environment relating to privacy and data protection laws, which continue to
develop in ways we cannot predict, including with respect to evolving technologies such as cloud computing. Privacy and data
protection laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and impose inconsistent or conflicting
requirements. Complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance or
require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and violations of privacy and data protection-
related laws may expose us to significant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate,
materially harm our business and reputation. In addition, compliance with inconsistent privacy laws may restrict our ability to
provide products and services to our customers.

PayPal relies on a variety of compliance methods to transfer personal data of EU citizens to the U.S., including reliance on Binding
Corporate Rules (“BCRs”) for internal transfers of certain types of personal data and Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) as
approved by the European Commission for transfers to and from third parties. PayPal must also ensure that third parties
processing personal data of PayPal’s EU customers and/or employees outside of the EU have compliant transfer mechanisms. In
October 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework clauses that were previously relied upon
by some PayPal vendors to lawfully transfer personal data of EU citizens to U.S. companies, and PayPal entered into SCCs with
those third parties who had previously relied on the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework. In July 2016, the U.S. and EU authorities
agreed on a replacement for Safe Harbor known as “Privacy Shield.” Both the Privacy Shield framework and SCCs are facing legal
challenges in the European justice system. To the extent that the Privacy Shield or SCCs are invalidated, PayPal’s ability to process
EU personal data with third parties outside of the EU could be jeopardized.

In 2016, the EU adopted a comprehensive overhaul of its data protection regime from the current national legislative approach to a
single European Economic Area Privacy Regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which comes into effect in
May 2018. The proposed EU data protection regime expands the scope of the EU data protection law to all foreign companies
processing personal data of EU residents, imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to the
greater of 4% of worldwide turnover and €20 million, and includes new rights such as the “portability” of personal data. Although
the GDPR will apply across the EU without a need for local implementing legislation, local data protection authorities (“DPAs”) will
still have the ability to interpret the GDPR through so-called opening clauses, which permit region-specific data protection
legislation and have the potential to create inconsistencies on a country-by-country basis. We are evaluating the rule and its

requirements. Implementation of the GDPR could require us to change our business practices and increase the costs and
complexity of compliance.

PayPal also faces additional potential challenges from local DPAs. Because PayPal (Europe) is headquartered in Luxembourg and
subject to regulation as a bank in that jurisdiction, we have relied on the “one-stop-shop” concept under which Luxembourg has
been our lead data protection regulator in the EU. However, a 2015 European Court of Justice ruling (Weltimmo) affecting
companies that do business in the EU potentially could make us subject to the local data protection laws or regulatory
enforcement activities of the various EU member states in which we have established legal entities and which apply privacy laws
that are different than, and may conflict with, Luxembourg privacy laws.

In addition, because of the large number of text messages, emails, phone calls and other communications we send or make to our
customers for various business purposes, communication-related privacy laws that provide a specified monetary damage award or
fine for each violation could result in particularly significant damage awards or fines. For example, under the Telephone Consumer
Protection Act (“TCPA”), in the U.S., plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500 per violation,
whichever is greater, and courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations. We have been, and may continue to
be subject to lawsuits (including class-action lawsuits) containing allegations that our business violated the TCPA. These lawsuits
seek damages (including statutory damages) and injunctive relief, among other remedies. Given the large number of
communications we send to our customers, a determination that there have been violations of the TCPA or other
communications-based statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could, individually or in the aggregate,
materially harm our business.

Data protection, privacy and information security have become the subject of increasing public, media, regulatory and legislative
concern. We post on our websites and applications our privacy policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of
user data. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies, with any applicable regulatory
requirements or orders, or with privacy, data protection, information security or consumer protection-related laws and regulations
in one or more jurisdictions could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, including class
action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and negative publicity, require
us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and adversely affect our business. As noted
above, we are also subject to the possibility of security and privacy breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of privacy
laws.

If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail, we may
incur significant losses.
We have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other
financial institutions in the U.S. and abroad. As part of our currency hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving
derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions. Certain banks and financial institutions are also lenders under
our credit facilities. We regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk, and actively manage this exposure to mitigate
the associated risk. Despite these efforts, we may be exposed to the risk of default by, or deteriorating operating results or
financial condition or failure of, these counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default, deterioration or failure
may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties
were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to access or recover
our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the
applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our
counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.

PayPal is not a bank or licensed lender in the U.S. and relies upon third parties to make loans and provide other products critical to
our business.
As PayPal is neither a chartered financial institution nor licensed to make loans in any state in the U.S., we rely on a third-party
chartered financial institution to issue the PayPal Credit consumer product in the U.S., and different chartered financial institutions
to issue the PayPal Working Capital product and other business loan products in the U.S. These chartered financial institutions are
state chartered industrial banks. Any termination or interruption in a partner bank’s ability to lend could result in us being unable
or unwilling to offer our consumer and business loan products, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to issue our
loan products in the U.S. and our business. In the event of a partner bank’s inability or unwillingness to lend, we may need to reach
a similar agreement with another chartered financial institution or obtain our own bank charter or lending licenses. We may be
unable to reach a similar agreement with another partner on favorable terms or at all, and obtaining a bank charter or lending
licenses would be a costly, time-consuming and uncertain process, subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements,
which could be burdensome, increase our costs and require us to change our business practices. In addition, as a service provider
to these bank partners, which are federally supervised U.S. financial institutions, we are subject from time to time to examination
by their federal banking regulators.

A case decided in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Maddenv.MidlandFunding,LLC(786 F.3d 246 (2d Cir. 2015)),
resulted in some uncertainty as to whether non-bank entities purchasing loans originated by a bank may rely on federal

Part I

preemption of state usury laws, and may create an increased risk of litigation by plaintiffs challenging our ability to collect interest
and fees in accordance with the terms of certain loans. Although the decision specifically addressed preemption under the
National Bank Act, this decision could support future challenges to federal preemption for other institutions, including FDIC-
insured, state chartered industrial banks like those that we rely on to issue our loan products in the U.S. After the Madden
decision, there continue to be a number of U.S. state and federal court legal actions challenging the viability of business models
where a non-bank entity relies on a third party chartered financial institution in connection with the issuance of credit products.
While we believe the manner in which we offer our credit products can be distinguished from Madden, there can be no assurance
as to the outcome of any potential litigation, which could materially and adversely impact our ability to issue our loan products in
the U.S. and our business.

On November 16, 2017, we announced an arrangement under which Synchrony Bank will acquire the U.S. consumer credit
receivables portfolio held by us and certain of our affiliates, which totaled approximately $6.4 billion in receivables as of
December 31, 2017. The purchase price is subject to a post-closing true-up and certain adjustments. The transaction is expected to
be completed during the third quarter of 2018, subject to certain closing conditions. The transaction may not close within the
expected timeframe or at all. Even if the transaction is consummated, it may take us longer than expected to realize the
anticipated benefits of the transaction, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all,
which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Under our expanded program agreement with Synchrony Bank, at
the closing of the consumer credit receivables portfolio sale, Synchrony Bank will become the exclusive issuer of the PayPal Credit
online consumer financing program in the U.S. for a 10-year term, and we retain an option to designate a purchaser of the portfolio
at the end of that term, Our increased reliance on Synchrony will subject us to risks in the nature of those discussed in this “Risk
Factors” section under the caption “We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.”

Our credit products expose us to additional risks.
We offer our PayPal Credit consumer product and PayPal Working Capital and other business loan products to a wide range of
consumers and merchants in various markets, and the financial success of these products depends on the effective management
of related risk. The credit decisioning process for our PayPal Credit consumer product uses proprietary segmentation and credit
algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on their past purchasing
and payment history with PayPal as well as their credit scores. Similarly proprietary risk models and other indicators are applied to
assess merchants who wish to use our business loan products to help predict their ability to repay. These risk models may not
accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to factors such as inaccurate assumptions, including
assumptions related to the particular consumer or merchant, market conditions, economic environment or limited transaction
history or other data, among other factors. The accuracy of these risk models and the ability to manage credit risk related to our
credit products may also be affected by legal or regulatory requirements, competitors’ actions, changes in consumer behavior,
changes in the economic environment and other factors. Our international expansion of our credit product offerings also exposes
us to additional risks, including those discussed below under the risk factor titled “Our international operations are subject to
increased risks, which could harm our business.”

Like other businesses with significant exposure to losses from consumer and merchant credit, we face the risk that account
holders will default on their payment obligations, creating the risk of potential charge-offs. The non-payment rate among account
holders may increase due to, among other things, changes to underwriting standards, worsening economic conditions, such as a
recession or government austerity programs, increases in prevailing interest rates, and high unemployment rates. Account holders
who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally
do not repay their loans.

We currently purchase receivables related to our credit products in the U.S. If we are unable to fund our purchase of these
receivables adequately or in a cost-effective manner, or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these
purposes, our business could be harmed.

Our business may be impacted by political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other business
interruptions.
War, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues, natural disasters and other business interruptions have caused and
could cause damage or disruption to the economy and commerce on a global or regional basis, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, our customers, and companies with which we do business. Our business operations are subject to
interruption by, among others, natural disasters, fire, power shortages, earthquakes, floods, nuclear power plant accidents and
other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond our
control. Such events could decrease demand for our products and services or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver
products and services to our customers. In the event of a natural disaster, we could incur significant losses, require substantial
recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume or maintain operations, which could have a material
adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Changes to our buyer and seller protection programs could increase our loss rate.
Our buyer and seller protection programs protect merchants and consumers from fraudulent transactions, and consumers if they
do not receive the item ordered or if the item received is significantly different from its description. In 2015, we increased the scope

2017 Annual Report

Part I

19

of our buyer protection program to cover digital goods and intangible goods and services. In addition, consumers who pay through
PayPal may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer (usually a bank), which in turn will seek recovery from us.
The risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to individual buyers, sellers and transactions, and may
also be impacted by regional variations to these programs, modifications to these programs resulting from changes in regulatory
requirements, or changes that we decide to implement, such as expanding the scope of transactions covered by one or more of
these programs. Upon PayPal becoming an independent publicly traded company in July 2015, we extended our protection
programs in several countries to cover certain customers’ purchases on eBay, and our costs associated with these programs have
therefore increased. Increases in our loss rate, including as a result of changing our buyer and seller protection programs, could
harm our business.

Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business.
Our international operations have generated approximately one-half of our net revenues in recent years. There are risks inherent
in doing business internationally on both a domestic (i.e., in-country) and cross-border basis, including:

•

foreign currency and cross-border trade risks discussed earlier in this “Risk Factors” section under the captions “We are
exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates” and “Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such
trade more difficult could harm our business”;
risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws;
local licensing and reporting obligations (e.g., data localization requirements);

•
•
• expenses associated with localizing our products and services, including offering customers the ability to transact business in

the local currency, and adapting our products and services to local preferences (e.g., payment methods) with which we may
have limited or no experience;
trade barriers and changes in trade regulations;

•
• difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of

distance, language, and cultural differences;
stringent local labor laws and regulations;

•
• credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;
• profit repatriation restrictions, foreign currency exchange restrictions or extreme fluctuations in foreign currency exchange

rates for a particular currency;

• political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues;
• geopolitical events, including natural disasters, public health issues, acts of war, and terrorism;
•
• compliance with U.S. laws and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, such as the Foreign Corrupt

import or export regulations;

Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local anticorruption laws;

• compliance with U.S. and foreign laws designed to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities;
• antitrust and competition regulations;
• potentially adverse tax developments and consequences;
• economic uncertainties relating to sovereign and other debt;
• national or regional differences in macroeconomic growth rates;
• different, uncertain, overlapping, or more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations;

and
increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable.

•

Violations of the complex foreign and U.S. laws, rules and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines,
criminal actions, or sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage
to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, there
can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies. These risks are inherent in our
international operations and expansion, may increase our costs of doing business internationally, and could harm our business.

We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates.
We are exposed to interest rate risk from our investment portfolio and from interest-rate sensitive assets underlying the customer
balances we hold on our balance sheet as customer accounts. A low interest rate environment or reductions in interest rates may
negatively impact our investment income and our net income. In addition, fluctuations in interest rates may adversely impact our
customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Higher interest rates often lead to
higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage, credit card and other consumer and merchant
loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased
delinquencies, charge-offs and allowance for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net income.

We have entered into a revolving credit facility and a 364-day delayed-draw term loan credit facility. We have borrowed under
these credit facilities from time to time, and any borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest at a floating rate, exposing us
to interest rate fluctuations.

Use of our payments services for illegal purposes could harm our business.
Our payment system is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, illegal
online gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illegal sales of prescription medications or controlled substances, piracy of
software, movies, music, and other copyrighted or trademarked goods (in particular, digital goods), bank fraud, child pornography
trafficking, prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products, online securities fraud, or to facilitate other illegal activity.
Any use of our payment system for illegal or improper uses could subject us to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, and
government and regulatory investigations, inquiries or requests that could result in liability and reputational harm for us.
Moreover, certain activity that may be legal in one country may be illegal in another country, and a merchant may intentionally or
inadvertently be found responsible for importing or exporting illegal goods, resulting in liability for us. Changes in law have
increased the penalties for intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal activities, and government authorities may
consider additional payments-related proposals from time to time. Owners of intellectual property rights or government
authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions, including PayPal, that are peripherally involved
in the sale of infringing or allegedly infringing items. Any threatened or resulting claims could result in reputational harm, and any
resulting liabilities, loss of transaction volume or increased costs could harm our business.

Our failure to manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds properly could harm our business.
We hold a substantial amount of funds belonging to our customers, including deposits in customer accounts and funds being
remitted to sellers of goods and services. In certain jurisdictions where we operate, we are required to hold eligible liquid assets, as
defined by the relevant regulators in each jurisdiction, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances.
Our ability to manage and account accurately for the assets underlying our customer funds and comply with applicable liquid asset
requirements requires a high level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and we expand our product offerings, we
must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls. PayPal (Europe), with the permission of the CSSF, utilizes certain
European customer balances held by our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to fund credit balances relating to our customers. Our
success requires significant public confidence in our ability to properly manage our customers’ balances and handle large and
growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to manage our
customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds accurately and in compliance with applicable regulatory
requirements could result in reputational harm, lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our products and result in
significant penalties and fines, which could materially harm our business.

We are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competition laws.
We are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies under U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including antitrust and
competition laws. An increasing number of jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to
assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. Other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future
allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the U.S., individual states, other countries, or the European
Commission, or otherwise constitute unfair competition. An increasing number of governments are regulating and increasing their
scrutiny of competition law activities. Our business agreements or arrangements with customers or other companies could give
rise to regulatory action or antitrust litigation. Some regulators, particularly those outside of the U.S., may perceive that our
products and services are used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive.
Any claims or investigations, even if without merit, may be very expensive to defend or respond to, involve negative publicity and
substantial diversion of management time and effort, and could result in reputational harm, significant judgments against us, or
require us to change our business practices.

We are subject to patent litigation.
We have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other parties’ patents. At any given time, we are typically a defendant in a
number of patent lawsuits and have been notified of several other potential patent disputes. We expect that we will continue to be
subject to patent infringement claims because, among other reasons:

• our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity;
• we continue to expand into new business areas, including through acquisitions; and
•

the number of patent owners who may claim that we, any of the companies that we have acquired, or our customers infringe
their patents, and the aggregate number of patents controlled by such patent owners, continues to increase.

Such claims may be brought directly against us or against our customers whom we may indemnify because we are contractually
obligated to do so or we choose to do so as a business matter. We believe that many of the claims against us and other technology
companies have been, and continue to be, initiated by third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. In
addition, we have seen significant patent disputes between operating companies in some technology industries. Patent claims,
whether meritorious or not, are time-consuming and costly to defend and resolve, and could require us to make expensive
changes in our methods of doing business, enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements, make substantial payments to satisfy
adverse judgments or settle claims or proceedings, or cease conducting certain operations, which would harm our business.

2017 Annual Report

We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or third parties may allege that we are
infringing their intellectual property rights.
The protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, and trade
secrets, is important to the success of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable
laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual
restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services, including confidentiality and
invention assignment agreements entered into with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties
with whom we conduct business.

Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our products and services. We
may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights.

Although we have generally taken measures to protect our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that we will be
successful in protecting or enforcing our rights in every jurisdiction, or that contractual arrangements and other steps that we
have taken to protect our intellectual property will prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual
property or deter independent development of equivalent or superior intellectual property rights by others. If we are unable to
prevent third parties from adopting, registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate
our trademark rights, the value of our brands could be diminished and our business could be adversely affected. Also, we may not
be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. We have licensed in the past, and
expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others. These
licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. Any failure to adequately
protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or significant costs incurred in doing so, could diminish the value of our
intangible assets and materially harm our business.

As the number of products in the technology and payments industries increases and the functionality of these products further
overlaps, and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses, we may become increasingly subject to intellectual
property infringement and other claims. Litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent and other
intellectual property rights of others. The ultimate outcome of any allegation is often uncertain and, regardless of the outcome,
any such claim, with or without merit, may be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management’s time and attention
from our business, and require us to, among other things, redesign or stop providing our products or services, pay substantial
amounts to satisfy judgments or settle claims or lawsuits, pay substantial royalty or licensing fees, or satisfy indemnification
obligations that we have with certain parties with whom we have commercial relationships. Our failure to obtain necessary license
or other rights, or litigation or claims arising out of intellectual property matters, may harm our business.

We are regularly subject to general litigation, regulatory disputes, and government inquiries.
We are regularly subject to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, government and regulatory investigations, inquiries or
requests, and other proceedings alleging violations of laws, rules and regulations with respect to competition, antitrust, intellectual
property, privacy, data protection, information security, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, sanctions, anti-
corruption, consumer protection, fraud, accessibility, securities, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, services,
charitable fundraising, contract disputes, escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property, and other matters. In particular, our
business faces ongoing consumer protection and intellectual property litigation, as discussed above. The number and significance
of these disputes and inquiries have increased as our business has expanded in scale, scope and geographic reach, and our
products and services have increased in complexity. In addition, the laws, rules and regulations affecting our business, including
those pertaining to Internet and mobile commerce, payments services, and credit, are subject to ongoing interpretation by the
courts and governmental authorities, and the resulting uncertainty in the scope and application of these laws, rules and
regulations increases the risk that we will be subject to private claims and governmental actions alleging violations.

The scope, outcome and impact of claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and proceedings to which we are subject cannot be
predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, such investigations and proceedings can have an adverse impact on us
because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, reputational damage, and other factors. Determining reserves for our
pending litigation and regulatory proceedings is a complex, fact-intensive process that involves a high degree of judgment.
Resolving one or more such legal and regulatory proceedings could potentially require us to make substantial payments to satisfy
judgments, fines or penalties or to settle claims or proceedings, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business.
These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders that prevent us from
offering certain products or services, require us to change our business practices in costly ways or develop non-infringing or
otherwise altered products or technologies. Any of these consequences could materially and adversely affect our business, results
of operations and financial condition.

While certain of our customer agreements contain arbitration provisions with class action waiver provisions that may limit our
exposure to consumer class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing these arbitration
provisions, including the class action waiver provisions, in the future or in any given case. Legislative, administrative or regulatory
developments may directly or indirectly prohibit or limit the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses and class action waiver

provisions. Any such prohibitions or limitations on or discontinuation of the use of, such arbitration or class action waiver
provisions could subject us to additional lawsuits, including additional consumer class action litigation, and significantly limit our
ability to avoid exposure from consumer class action litigation.

Changes in U.S. tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations and financial
conditions.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive Federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act makes changes to the corporate tax rate, business-related deductions and
taxation of foreign earnings, among others, that will generally be effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.
These changes could have a material adverse impact on the value of our U.S. deferred tax assets, result in significant one-time
charges in the current or future taxable years and increase our future U.S. tax expense. We are continuing to evaluate the Tax Act
and its requirements, as well as its application to our business and its impact on our effective tax rate. At this stage, it is unclear
how many U.S. states will incorporate these federal law changes, or portions thereof, into their tax codes. The implementation by
us of new practices and processes designed to comply with, and benefit from, the Tax Act and its rules and regulations could
require us to make substantial changes to our business practices, allocate additional resources, and increase our costs, which could
negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.
The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant
judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Like many other
multinational corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our determination of our tax liability
is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities, and we are currently undergoing a number
of investigations, audits and reviews by taxing authorities throughout the world. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review
could have a negative effect on our business, and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial
statements and may materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made. While we have
established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these
reserves may prove to be insufficient.

In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated, or by the incurrence of
losses, in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory
tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk
management program, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.

Various levels of government, such as U.S. federal and state legislatures, and international organizations, such as the Organization
for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and the EU, are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative or
regulatory action to increase tax revenue. Any such tax reform or other legislative or regulatory actions could increase our effective
tax rate.

We and our merchants may be subject to sales reporting and record-keeping obligations.
A number of U.S. states, the U.S. federal government and foreign countries have implemented or are in the process of
implementing reporting or record-keeping obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce to improve tax
compliance. Additionally, a number of jurisdictions are reviewing whether payment service providers and other intermediaries
could be deemed to be the legal agent of merchants for certain tax purposes. We have modified our systems to meet known
requirements and expect further modifications will be required to comply with future requirements, which may negatively impact
our customer experience and increase operational costs. Any failure by us to comply with these and similar reporting and record-
keeping obligations could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions, adversely impact our ability to do business
in certain jurisdictions, and harm our business.

Acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and could
harm our business.
Acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic transactions are important elements of our overall
corporate strategy. We expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our
overall business strategy, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions of certain businesses, technologies,
services, products, and other assets, as well as joint ventures, strategic investments, and commercial and strategic partnerships.
These transactions may involve significant challenges and risks, including:

•

the potential loss of key customers, vendors and other key business partners of the companies we acquire, or dispose of,
following and continuing after announcement of our transaction plans;

• difficulty making strategic hires of new employees, declining employee morale and retention issues affecting employees

(particularly the potential loss of key personnel) of companies that we acquire or dispose of, which may result from changes in
compensation, management, reporting relationships, future prospects, or the direction of the acquired or disposed business;

• diversion of management time and focus;

•

•

•

the need to and difficulty of integrating the operations, systems (including accounting, compliance, management, information,
human resource and other administrative systems), technologies, products and personnel of each acquired company, which is
an inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costly process;
the need to and difficulty of implementing and/or enhancing controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public
company at acquired companies which, prior to the acquisition, may have lacked such controls, procedures and policies or
whose controls, procedures and policies did not meet applicable legal and regulatory standards;
the inefficiencies and lack of control that may result if integration of acquired companies is delayed or not implemented, and
unforeseen difficulties and costs that may arise as a result;

• potential exposure to new or increased regulatory oversight and regulatory obligations associated with new products and

risks associated with our expansion into new international markets;
risks associated with the complexity of entering into and effectively managing joint ventures, strategic investments, and other
strategic partnerships;
risks associated with undetected cyberattacks or security breaches at companies that we acquire or with which we may
combine or partner;
lawsuits or regulatory actions resulting from the transaction;
liability for activities or conduct of the acquired company before the acquisition, including legal and regulatory claims or
disputes, violations of laws and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities;
the acquisition of new customer and employee personal information, which in and of itself may require regulatory approval and
or additional controls, policies and procedures and subject us to additional exposure and additional complexity and costs of
compliance; and

• our dependence on the accounting, financial reporting, operating metrics and similar systems, controls and processes of

acquired businesses and the risk that errors or irregularities in those systems, controls and processes will lead to errors in our
financial statements or make it more difficult to manage the acquired business.

At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these or other types of
transactions, any of which could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to our financial condition and results of operations.
There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, and consummating favorable transaction
opportunities. It may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions, and those
benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely affect our business and
operating results. Any acquisitions or dispositions may also require us to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur
debt (and increased interest expense), recognize liabilities, and record amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write-
offs of goodwill or intangibles, which could dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders and adversely affect our
results of operations and the interests of holders of our indebtedness, as applicable.

Joint ventures and minority investment inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially
increasing the financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment. In
addition, we may be dependent on joint venture partners, controlling shareholders, management or other persons or entities who
control them and who may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Business decisions or other
actions or omissions of the joint venture partners, controlling shareholders, management or other persons or entities who control
them and who may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us and otherwise
damage our reputation and brand.

There are risks associated with our indebtedness.
We have incurred indebtedness, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the
principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to
service such debt and the other factors discussed in this “Risk Factors” section. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
manage any of these risks successfully. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively
affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest amounts we pay on outstanding or future debt.
These risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.
We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including the following:

• networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to

process transactions;

• unaffiliated third-party lenders to originate loans in the U.S. for our PayPal Credit consumer product. PayPal Working Capital

•
•

•

and other business loan products;
third parties that provide loan servicing and customer statements processing;
third parties that provide certain outsourced customer support and product development functions, which are critical to our
operations; and
third parties that provide facilities, infrastructure, components and services, including data center facilities and cloud
computing.

Part I

Because we rely on third parties to provide services to us and our customers and to facilitate certain of our business activities, we
face increased operational risk. These third parties may be subject to financial, legal, regulatory, labor or other issues, such as
service terminations, disruptions or interruptions, that prevent them from providing services to us or our customers. Moreover,
these third parties are themselves subject to the risks discussed earlier in the “Risk Factors” section under the caption “Our
business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches.” In addition, these third parties may breach their
agreements with us, disagree with our interpretation of contract terms or applicable laws and regulations, refuse to continue or
renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms or at all, fail or refuse to process transactions adequately, take actions
that degrade the functionality of our services, impose additional costs or requirements on us, or give preferential treatment to
competitive services. There can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or our customers will
continue to do so on acceptable terms, or at all. If any third parties were to stop providing services to us or our customers on
acceptable terms, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner, and on
acceptable terms or at all. If third parties we rely on do not adequately or appropriately provide their services or perform their
responsibilities, we may be subject to business disruptions, losses or costs to remediate any of the deficiencies, customer
dissatisfaction, reputational damage, legal or regulatory proceedings, or other adverse consequences which could harm our
business.

Our developer platforms, which are open to merchants and third-party developers, subject us to additional risks.
We provide third-party developers with access to application programming interfaces, software development kits and other tools
designed to allow them to produce applications for use, with a particular focus on mobile applications. There can be no assurance
that merchants or third-party developers will develop and maintain applications and services on our open platforms on a timely
basis or at all, and a number of factors could cause such third-party developers to curtail or stop development for our platforms. In
addition, our business is subject to many regulatory restrictions. It is possible that merchants and third-party developers who
utilize our development platforms or tools could violate these regulatory restrictions and we may be held responsible for such
violations, which could harm our business.

Our retail point of sale solutions expose us to additional risks.
We have announced several retail point of sale solutions, which enable merchants to accept payments using a payments card
reader attached to, or otherwise communicating with, a mobile device or to scan payment cards and codes using the mobile
device’s embedded camera, and which enable consumers to use their mobile devices to pay at the point of sale. We have entered
into strategic partnerships with major payment card networks to further expand our relationship in a way that will make it easier
for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay for transactions utilizing these companies’ credit and debit cards. Those
agreements provide us with access to each of these partner’s tokenization services in the U.S. for in-store point-of-sale PayPal
transactions, which we expect will increase the number of point of sale transactions that we process. As we continue to expand our
product and service offerings at the retail point of sale, we will face additional risks, including:

•

•

•

increased expectations from offline retailers regarding the reliability and availability of our systems and services and
correspondingly lower amounts of downtime, which we may not be able to meet;
significant competition at the retail point of sale, particularly from established payment card providers , many of which have
substantially greater resources than we do;
increased targeting by fraudsters; given that our fraud models are less developed in this area, we may experience increases in
fraud and associated transaction losses as we adjust to fraudulent activity at the point of sale;

• exposure to product liability claims to the extent that hardware devices that we produce for use at the retail point of sale

malfunction or are not in compliance with laws, which could result in substantial liability and require product recalls or other
actions;

• exposure to additional laws, rules and regulations;
•

increased reliance on third parties involved with processing in-store payments, including independent software providers,
electronic point of sale providers, hardware providers (such as cash register and pin-pad providers), payment processors and
banks that enable in-store transactions; and
lower operating income than our other payment solutions.

•

Unless we are able to successfully manage these risks, including driving adoption of, and significant volume through, our retail
point of sale solutions over time, our business may be harmed.

Our success largely depends on key personnel. Because competition for our key employees is intense, we may not be able to
attract, retain, and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business. The loss of key personnel could harm
our business.
Our future performance depends substantially on the continued services of key personnel, including our executive team and other
highly skilled employees, and our ability to attract, retain, and motivate such personnel. Competition for key personnel is intense,
especially in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our corporate headquarters are located and where the cost of living is high, and we
may be unable to successfully attract, integrate, or retain sufficiently qualified key personnel. In making employment decisions,
particularly in the technology and payments industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they would
receive in connection with their employment, and fluctuations in our stock price, or a perception that the market price of our

2017 Annual Report

Part I

25

stock may not increase or may increase more slowly than stock prices at other technology or payments companies, may make it
more difficult to attract, retain, and motivate employees. We may be limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive
domestic immigration laws or policies. In addition, we do not have long-term employment agreements with any of our key
personnel and do not maintain any “key person” life insurance policies. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, or our
inability to attract highly qualified key personnel, could harm our business.

We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our products and services.
Companies providing online services may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through them, including claims
alleging defamation, libel, harassment, hate speech, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark
infringement, among other things. The laws relating to the liability of companies providing online services for information
disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges. We are also subject to potential liability to third parties for
the customer-provided content on our products and services, particularly in jurisdictions outside the U.S. where the applicable
laws are unsettled. If we become liable for information provided by our customers and carried on our products and services, we
could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability, including
expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain product or service offerings, which could harm our business.

RISKS RELATED TO THE SEPARATION FROM EBAY
If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S.
federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), eBay, PayPal and
eBay stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify
eBay for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement.
On July 17, 2015, we became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by eBay Inc. of 100% of our
outstanding common stock to eBay’s stockholders (which we sometimes refer to as the “separation” or the “distribution”). eBay
received an opinion from its outside legal counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution, together with certain related
transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of
the Code. The opinion was based on and relied on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain
representations, statements and undertakings of eBay and of us, including those relating to the past and future conduct of eBay
and of us. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings were, or became, inaccurate or incomplete, or if eBay or we
breach any of our respective covenants in the separation documents, the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions
reached therein could be jeopardized.

Notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that the distribution, together with certain related transactions,
should be treated as a taxable transaction if the IRS determines that any of these representations, assumptions, or undertakings
upon which such opinion was based are incorrect or have been violated or if the IRS disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion
of counsel. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS or any court and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not
challenge the conclusions reached in the opinion. The IRS did not provide any opinion in advance of the separation that our
proposed transaction is tax-free.

If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free under
Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, in general, eBay would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the PayPal common stock
in a taxable sale for its fair market value, eBay stockholders who received PayPal common stock in the distribution may be subject
to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares and we could incur significant
liabilities.

There are risks associated with certain agreements that we entered into with eBay at the separation.
In connection with the separation, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with eBay as well as various other
agreements, including an operating agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, an intellectual
property matters agreement, a data sharing addendum, and a product development agreement. The separation agreement, the
tax matters agreement, the employee matters agreement, and the intellectual property matters agreement determine the
allocation of assets and liabilities (including by means of licensing) between the companies following the separation for those
respective areas and include associated indemnification obligations. The operating agreement, the data sharing addendum and the
product development agreement establish certain commercial relationships between eBay and us related to payment processing,
credit and data sharing. If we or eBay is unable to satisfy its performance, payment or indemnification obligations under these
agreements, we could incur operational difficulties or losses or be required to make substantial indemnification or other payments
to eBay.

Our relationship with eBay is governed in part by an operating agreement entered into at separation with a term of five years. This
operating agreement defines a number of important elements of our commercial relationship with eBay, as well as certain
obligations and limitations that limit PayPal’s provision of services to certain competitive platform operators of eBay (as specified
in the operating agreement). eBay remains a significant source of our revenues and operating income. If our operating agreement
with eBay expires or is terminated prior to its expiration, or if there is a significant change in our relationship with eBay, including if
eBay becomes a merchant of record, eliminates or modifies any of its risk management or customer protection programs, directs

transactions to a different provider of payment services or offers eBay customers alternative payment options, it could lead to
customer dissatisfaction, reputational damage, and other adverse consequences, and our business, financial condition and results
of operations could be materially harmed.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK
The price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly.
The price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of
which may be beyond our control, including, but not limited to:

• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;
• changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations by securities analysts;
• changes in our capital structure;
•
•
• changes to the regulatory and legal environment under which we operate; and
• market conditions or trends in the payments industry, the industries of merchants and the domestic and worldwide economy

speculation, coverage or sentiment in the media or the investment community;
the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies;

as a whole.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court
located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for
certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and
our directors and officers.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the corporation otherwise determines, the state courts
of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of
Delaware, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a
claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim
against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”) or
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors
or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to
bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may
discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court outside of Delaware were to find this
exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or
proceedings described above, we could incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which
could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may prevent or delay an acquisition of our
company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.
Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect
of deterring coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to
the bidder and by encouraging prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile
takeover. These provisions include, among others:

•
•

•

•

•
•

rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;
the fact that directors may not be elected, removed or replaced at stockholder-requested special meetings unless a person,
entity or group owns at least a majority of our outstanding common stock;
the right of our board to issue preferred stock and to determine the voting, dividend and other rights of preferred stock
without stockholder approval;
the ability of our directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on our board of directors in most circumstances and to
determine the size of our board of directors;
the prohibition on stockholders acting by written consent; and
the absence of cumulative rights in the election of directors.

We have also elected not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL, which provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons
that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation
shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional
shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the
corporation’s outstanding voting stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, however, contains a provision that
generally mirrors Section 203 of the DGCL, except that it provides for a 20% threshold instead of the 15% provided for by the
DGCL. These provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may favor.

These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may
be considered beneficial by some stockholders and may delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is

2017 Annual Report

not in the best interests of us and our stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and
replace incumbent directors.

DIVIDEND POLICY
We have never paid any cash dividends and we currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

STOCK REPURCHASE ACTIVITY
We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in 2015. In January 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a stock
repurchase program that provided for the repurchase of up to $2 billion of our common stock, with no expiration from the date of
authorization. In April 2017, our Board of Directors authorized an additional stock repurchase program that provides for the
repurchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. This program became
effective upon completion of the January 2016 stock repurchase program. The stock repurchase programs are intended to offset
the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions and other factors, may also be
used to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under
our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions or
other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or
other financing alternatives. However, any stock repurchases are subject to market conditions and other uncertainties and we
cannot predict if or when any stock repurchases will be made. Moreover, we may terminate our stock repurchase programs at any
time without notice.

The stock repurchase activity under our stock repurchase programs during the three months ended December 31, 2017 is
summarized as follows:

among others, those discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in our consolidated
financial statements, related notes, and the other information appearing elsewhere in this report and our other filings with
the SEC. We do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update any of our forward-looking statements after the date of
this report to reflect actual results or future events or circumstances. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. You should read the following “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in conjunction with the audited consolidated
financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this report.

SEPARATION FROM EBAY INC.
On September 30, 2014, eBay Inc. (“eBay”) announced its intent to separate its payments business into an independent, publicly
traded company. To accomplish this separation, in January 2015, eBay incorporated PayPal Holdings, Inc. (“PayPal Holdings”) which
is now the parent of PayPal, Inc. and holds directly or indirectly all of the assets and liabilities associated with PayPal, Inc. In June
2015, the board of directors of eBay approved the separation (the “separation”) of eBay’s payments business through the
distribution (the “distribution”) of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal Holdings to eBay’s stockholders. PayPal
Holdings’ registration statement on Form 10, as amended, was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
on June 29, 2015. On July 17, 2015 (the “distribution date”), PayPal Holdings became an independent publicly traded company
through the pro rata distribution by eBay of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal Holdings to eBay stockholders.
Each eBay stockholder of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2015 received one share of PayPal Holdings common stock for
every share of eBay common stock held on the record date. Approximately 1.2 billion shares of PayPal Holdings common stock
were distributed on July 17, 2015 to eBay stockholders. PayPal Holdings’ common stock began “regular way” trading under the
ticker symbol “PYPL” on the NASDAQ Stock Market on July 20, 2015.

Prior to the separation, eBay transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations of eBay’s payments business to
PayPal Holdings, which was completed in June 2015 (the “capitalization”). The consolidated financial statements prior to the
capitalization were prepared on a stand-alone basis and were derived from eBay’s consolidated financial statements and
accounting records. The consolidated financial statements reflect our financial position, results of operations, comprehensive
income and cash flows as our business was operated as part of eBay prior to the capitalization. Following the capitalization, our
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PayPal Holdings and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The consolidated
financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of dates and for periods prior to the separation may not be indicative of
what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been as a separate stand-alone entity during the
periods presented, nor are they indicative of what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be in the future.
For additional information, see “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company” and “PayPal”
refer to PayPal Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries or, in the case of information as of dates or for periods prior to the
separation, the consolidated entities of the payments business of eBay, including PayPal, Inc. and certain other assets and liabilities
that had been historically held at the eBay corporate level but were specifically identifiable and attributable to the payments
business.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
We are a leading technology platform and digital payments company that enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of
consumers and merchants worldwide. Our vision is to democratize financial services, as we believe that managing and moving
money is a right for all people, not just the affluent. Our goal is to increase our relevance for consumers and merchants to manage
and move their money anywhere in the world, anytime, on any platform and using any device. Our combined payment solutions,
including our PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, and Paydiant products, compose our proprietary Payments Platform.

We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects
of the payments industry. That focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on such
important issues as countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy and consumer protection. Some of the laws and
regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently, and the laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted
prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments, are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial

changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation, and the enactment of new laws and regulations applicable to us could have
a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Therefore, we monitor these areas closely
to ensure compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us.

The United Kingdom (“U.K.”) held a referendum in June 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the European
Union (“EU”) (“Brexit”). In March 2017, the U.K. government gave formal notice of its intention to leave the EU and started the
process of negotiating the future terms of the U.K.‘s relationship with the EU. Brexit could adversely affect U.K., regional (including
European) and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign
exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound and Euro.

We have foreign exchange exposure management programs designed to help reduce the impact from foreign currency rate
movements. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, net revenues generated from our U.K. operations constituted 11%, 12% and 13%, respectively,
of total net revenues. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, net revenues generated from the EU (excluding the U.K.) constituted approximately
20% of total net revenues. For additional information on how Brexit could affect our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under
the caption—“The United Kingdom’s departure from the EU could adversely affect us.”

Information security risks for global payments and technology companies have significantly increased in recent years. Although we
are not aware of any material impacts relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches on our Payments Platform,
we are not immune to these risks and there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. See “Item 1A. Risk
Factors” under the caption—“Our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches.”

Net revenues increased $2.3 billion, or 21%, in 2017 and $1.6 billion, or 17%, in 2016. The increases were primarily driven by growth in
TPV (as defined below under “Net Revenues”) of 27% in 2017 and 26% in 2016. Net revenues from our recent acquisitions of TIO
and Swift were not material. Net revenues from Xoom (acquired in November 2015) contributed two percentage points to the
2016 growth rate.

Total operating expenses increased $1.7 billion, or 18%, in 2017 and $1.5 billion or 19% in 2016. The increase in 2017 was due
primarily to an increase in transaction expense, sales and marketing, general and administrative, product development, and
restructuring and other charges. Operating expenses related to TIO and Swift collectively contributed one percentage point to the
2017 growth rate. The increase in total operating expense in 2016 was due primarily to an increase in transaction expense and
transaction and loan losses which increase with TPV and higher customer support and operations, general and administrative
expenses, and depreciation and amortization incurred to operate as an independent public company, partially offset by a decrease
in restructuring expense. Xoom operating expenses contributed three percentage points to the 2016 growth rate.

Part II

Operating income increased $541 million, or 34%, in 2017 and $125 million, or 9% in 2016. Operating income increased in 2017 and
2016 due primarily to the increase in net revenues, partially offset by the growth in operating expenses. TIO and Swift collectively
had a negative impact our 2017 growth rate of four percentage points. Xoom negatively impacted our 2016 growth rate by four
percentage points. Our operating margin was 16%, 15% and 16% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Operating margin in 2017 was
negatively impacted by growth in our transaction expense which increased 32% in 2017 compared to 2016, compared to net
revenues which increased 21% in the same period, as well as restructuring expense of $40 million incurred in 2017. These impacts
were offset by operating efficiencies in our business, and a one time benefit of $322 million pertaining to reversal of allowances
related to loans and interest receivables due to the designation as held for sale of our U.S. consumer credit portfolio. Operating
margin decreased in 2016 due primarily to growth in our transaction expense and transaction and loan losses, which together
increased 30% in 2016 compared to 2015.

Net income increased by $394 million, or 28%, in 2017 and $173 million, or 14%, in 2016. The increase in net income in 2017 was
attributable to an increase in operating income of $541 million and an increase in other income (expense), net of $28 million,
partially offset by an increase in income tax expense of $175 million. The increase in net income in 2016 was attributable to an
increase in operating income of $125 million, a decrease in income tax expense of $30 million and an increase in other income
(expense), net of $18 million.

IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES
We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro,
Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our financial results. The
strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, as well as other
currencies in which we conduct our international operations, impacts the translation of our net revenues and expenses generated
in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, we generated approximately 46%, 47% and 50% of our net
revenues from customers domiciled outside of the United States, respectively. During each of these periods, U.K. was the only
country, other than the United States, where we generated more than 10% of total net revenues in. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, net
revenues generated from the EU (excluding the U.K.) constituted approximately 20% of total net revenues. Because we have
generated substantial net revenues internationally in recent periods, including during the periods presented, we are subject to the
risks of doing business in countries outside of the U.S. as discussed under “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risk Factors That May Affect
Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.”

2017 Annual Report

We calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements on our business using prior period foreign currency
exchange rates applied to current period transactional currency amounts. While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect
our reported results, we have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program whereby we designate certain foreign
currency exchange contracts as cash flow hedges designed to reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate
movements. Gains and losses from these foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized as a component of transaction
revenues in the same period the forecasted transactions impact earnings.

In the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the year-over-year foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar had the
following impact on our reported results:

While we enter into foreign exchange contracts to help reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency rate movements, it is
impossible to predict or eliminate the total effects of this exposure.

Additionally, in connection with our services in multiple currencies, we generally set our foreign currency exchange rates twice per
day, and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign currency exchange rates. Given that we also have
foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our
subsidiaries, we have an additional foreign currency exchange exposure management program whereby we use foreign currency
exchange contracts to offset the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency
gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on
the foreign currency exchange contracts. These foreign currency exchange contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the
impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities.

FINANCIAL RESULTS

NET REVENUES

Revenue description
We earn revenue primarily by processing customer transactions on our Payments Platform and from other value added services.
Our revenues are classified into the following two categories:

• Transaction revenues: Net transaction fees charged to consumers and merchants primarily based on the volume of activity, or

Total Payments Volume (“TPV”), processed through our Payments Platform. We define TPV as the value of payments, net of
payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our
gateway and Paydiant products. Growth in TPV is directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable on
our Payments Platform. Payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully
completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products. We
earn additional fees on transactions settled in foreign currencies when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions
where the merchant or consumer are in different countries).

• Other value added services: Net revenues derived principally from interest and fees earned on our loans and interest

receivable, net and held for sale portfolio, subscription fees, gateway fees, gains on sale of participation interests in certain
consumer loans receivable and working capital loans and advances, revenue share we earn through partnerships, interest
earned on certain PayPal customer account balances, fees earned through our Paydiant products and other services that we
provide to consumers and merchants.

Our revenues can be significantly impacted by the following:

• The mix between domestic and cross-border transactions;
• The geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and
• The amount of PayPal credit loans receivable outstanding with consumers and merchants.

Transaction revenues
Transaction revenues increased by $1.9 billion, or 20%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and by $1.4 billion, or 17%, in 2016 compared to
2015. The increase in transaction revenues in 2017 and 2016 was due primarily to the growth in TPV, mainly from our PayPal and
Braintree products, and in the number of payment transactions, both of which were due primarily to an increase in our active
customer accounts and increased engagement from our customers (measured by payment transactions per active account). Xoom
transaction revenues contributed two percentage points to the 2016 growth rate. Net gains from our foreign currency exchange
contracts recognized as a component of transaction revenues in 2017 were $17 million, compared to $119 million in 2016. Refer to
“Note 8—Derivative Instruments” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K for additional information on our foreign currency exposure management program.

(4) TPV is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our
gateway and Paydiant products.
** Not meaningful

Transaction revenues grew more slowly than both TPV and number of payment transactions in 2017 due primarily to a higher
proportion of person-to-person (“P2P”) transactions, primarily from our PayPal and Venmo products from which we earn lower
rates and foreign exchange hedging losses. The percentage growth in transaction revenues was lower than the percentage growth
in TPV and payment transactions in 2016 primarily due to a higher proportion of P2P transactions (including our Venmo products)
for which we earn lower rates, and a higher portion of TPV generated by large merchants who generally pay lower rates with higher
transaction volume. The impact of increases or decreases in prices charged to our customers did not significantly impact
transaction revenue growth in 2017 or 2016.

Other value added services
Net revenues from other value added services increased by $340 million, or 25%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and by $232 million, or
21%, in 2016 compared to 2015. Growth in net revenues from other value-added services in 2017 was due primarily to interest and
fee income earned on our PayPal credit loans receivable portfolio. Swift revenues contributed approximately three percentage
points to the 2017 growth rate. The total consumer and merchant loans receivable balance, including loans and receivables, held
for sale, as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $7.8 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, reflecting a year-over-year
increase of 37%.

2017 Annual Report

Part II

In November 2017, we reached an agreement to sell our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank, which we
believe will enable us, at closing, to free up balance sheet capacity and cash flow for other uses, and mitigate balance sheet risk.
Historically, this portfolio was reported as outstanding principal balances, net of any participation interest sold and pro-rata
allowances including, unamortized deferred origination costs and estimated collectible interest and fees. Upon approval of the
decision to sell these receivables from our Board of Directors, the portfolio was reclassified as held for sale, and recorded at the
lower of cost or fair value. Due to the designation as held for sale, the associated allowance for this portfolio was reversed, resulting
in an increase of approximately $39 million in revenue from other value added services. This transaction will be accounted for as a
sale, and the receivables will no longer be reported in our consolidated financial statements

Following the closing of this transaction, which is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2018, Synchrony Bank will become the
exclusive issuer of the PayPal Credit online consumer financing program in the U.S., and we will no longer hold an ownership
interest in the receivables generated through the program (other than charged off receivables). In addition, we will earn a profit
share on the portfolio of consumer receivables owned by Synchrony Bank.

Growth in net revenues from other value added services in 2016 was due primarily to interest and fee income earned on our PayPal
Credit loans receivable portfolio. The total consumer and merchant loans receivable balance as of December 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 was $5.7 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 29%.

In the third quarter of 2015, we amended the terms of our credit program agreement with Synchrony Bank. As a result of the
amendment, we recognized $78 million of revenue under the agreement during 2015. In addition, as part of the amended
agreement, our obligation to purchase the portfolio of consumer loan receivables relating to the customer accounts arising out of
the credit program agreement with Synchrony Bank was terminated. The amended credit program agreement will, upon closing of
the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivable portfolio to Synchrony Bank, be superseded by the new program agreement signed
in November 2017.

In the second quarter of 2015, we completed an arrangement with certain investors under which we sold participation interests in
certain consumer loans and interest receivables related to our PayPal Credit product with a gross book value of approximately
$708 million. In connection with its purchase of our U.S. consumer credit receivable portfolio, Synchrony Bank has also agreed to
acquire the participation interests held by the investors.

OPERATING EXPENSES
Beginning with the first quarter of 2016, we reclassified certain operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income to
better align our external and internal financial reporting. These classification changes relate primarily to real estate and
information technology operating expenses that were previously allocated among customer support and operations expense, sales
and marketing expense and product development expense. Our management no longer allocates these operating expenses for
internal financial reporting purposes or general management of the business and has therefore discontinued this allocation for
external financial reporting purposes. As a result, starting with the first quarter of 2016 these operating expenses were reported as
part of general and administrative expenses. These changes have no impact on the previously reported consolidated net income
for prior periods, including total operating expenses, financial position or cash flows for any periods presented, and do not
eliminate any of the costs allocated to us by eBay for any periods prior to the separation. Prior period amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. See “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional
information on the effects of the changes on the presentation of operating expenses to our previously reported consolidated
statement of income. Growth rates presented below are calculated based upon the reclassified prior period amounts.

Transaction expense
Transaction expense is primarily composed of the costs we incur to accept a customer’s funding source of payment. These costs
include fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions in order to draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit
card, bank account or other funding source they have stored in their digital wallet. Transaction expense also includes fees paid to
disbursement partners to enable a transaction and interest expense on borrowings incurred to finance our portfolio of loans
receivable arising from our PayPal Credit funding option. We refer to the allocation of funding sources used by our consumers as
our “funding mix.” The cost of funding a transaction with a credit or debit card is generally higher than the cost of funding a
transaction from a bank or through internal sources such as a PayPal account balance or PayPal Credit. As we expand the
availability of alternative funding sources to our customers, a change in funding mix can increase or decrease our transaction
expense rate. The cost of funding a transaction is also impacted by the geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs
because we generally pay lower rates for transactions funded with credit cards outside the U.S. than in the U.S.

Transaction expense increased by $1.1 billion, or 32%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and increased by $736 million, or 28%, in 2016
compared to 2015. The increase in transaction expense in 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in TPV of 27% and higher
assessments charged by payment processors and other financial institutions. The increase in transaction expense in 2016 was
primarily attributable to an increase in TPV of 26%.

The increase in our transaction expense rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to higher assessments charged by
payment processors and other financial institutions. Our transaction expense rate in 2016 increased compared to 2015 due
primarily to changes in funding mix. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, approximately 2% of TPV was funded
with PayPal Credit. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, approximately 44%, 45%, and 45% of TPV, respectively,
was generated outside of the U.S. Interest expense on borrowings incurred to finance our portfolio of loans receivable, included in
transaction expense, was not material for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Transaction and loan losses
Transaction losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud, and chargebacks. Loan losses
include the losses associated with our consumer and merchant loans receivable portfolio, except loans and interest receivable, held
for sale. Our transaction and loan losses fluctuate depending on many factors, including TPV, macroeconomic conditions, changes
to our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from
transactions funded with our credit products for consumers and loans and advances to merchant sellers. Additionally, prior to the
distribution we recovered certain amounts from eBay related to customer protection programs offered on eligible eBay purchases
made with PayPal. These costs included the actual amount of protection losses associated with eBay’s customer protection
programs that we administered and funded on behalf of eBay, which were included as a reduction of transaction and loan losses.
Recoveries associated with protection losses incurred on eligible eBay purchases during the year ended December 31, 2015 were
$27 million. Following the distribution, we no longer administer eBay’s customer protection programs or recover amounts from
eBay associated with protection losses incurred on eligible eBay purchases; instead, we and eBay each independently administer
our own customer protection programs. Further, our customer protection programs extend to customers’ eligible purchases on

2017 Annual Report

eBay and therefore we have incurred and expect to continue to incur incremental costs associated with our customer protection
programs following the distribution.

The components of our transaction and loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:

Transaction losses increased by $168 million, or 26%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and increased by $144 million, or 28%, in 2016
compared to 2015, due primarily to higher TPV. Our transaction loss rate, calculated by dividing transaction loss by TPV, in 2017
and 2016 was roughly flat compared to 2016 and 2015, respectively. The growth in transaction losses in 2016 was higher than the
growth in TPV in 2016 due primarily to lower incremental costs in 2015 associated with our customer protection programs
following the distribution.

Loan losses decreased by $245 million, or 57%, in 2017 compared to 2016 and increased by $135 million, or 45%, in 2016 compared
to 2015. The decrease in loan losses in 2017 was due primarily to the reversal of approximately $283 million of allowance on loans
receivable due to the designation of our U.S. consumer credit portfolio as held for sale. The increase in loan losses in 2016 was due
primarily to an increase in the loans receivable balance year over year and additional reserves recorded in that period due to
increases to forecasted principal balance delinquency rates. The total consumer loans receivable balance as of December 31, 2017,
2016 and 2015 was $326 million, $5.1 billion, and $4.0 billion, respectively, reflecting year-over-year decrease of 94% from 2016 to
2017 and an increase of 28% from 2015 to 2016. The decrease in consumer loan receivables in 2017 was due to designation of U.S.
consumer credit portfolio as held for sale. The increase in consumer loans receivable in 2016 was due to the growth in the portfolio
of loans receivable outstanding arising from consumers who chose PayPal Credit as a funding option and an increase in working
capital advances to selected merchant sellers.

The following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our pool of consumer loans and interest receivable

that date.
(2) Represents percentage of balances which are 90 days past the billing date to the consumer.
(3) Net charge off rate is the annual ratio of net credit losses on consumer loans receivables as a percentage of the average daily amount of consumer loans and interest
receivables balance during the year.

Through our PayPal Working Capital product, we offer credit products to certain small and medium-sized merchants that are
existing users of our other payment services. Total PayPal Working Capital loans, advances and fees receivable outstanding as of
December 31, 2017, net of participation interest sold, were $703 million. Total PayPal Working Capital loans, advances and fees
receivable outstanding as of December 31, 2016 were $558 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 26% due to the increase
in the availability of our credit products domestically and internationally.

To assess a merchant who requests a PayPal Working Capital loan or advance, we use, among other indicators, an internally
developed risk model that we refer to as our PayPal Working Capital Risk Model (“PRM”), as a credit quality indicator to help
predict the merchant’s ability to repay the amount of the loan or advance and fixed fee. The PRM uses multiple variables as
predictors of the merchant’s ability to repay a working capital loan or advance. Primary drivers of the model include the
merchant’s annual payment volume and payment processing history with PayPal, prior repayment history with the PayPal
Working Capital product, and other measures. Merchants are assigned a PRM credit score within the range of 350 to 750. We

generally expect that merchants to which we extend a working capital loan or advance will have PRM scores greater than 525. We
generally consider scores above 610 to be very good and to pose less credit risk. For all outstanding working capital loans and
advances, we assess a participating merchant’s PRM score on a recurring basis. At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the
weighted average PRM score related to our PayPal Working Capital balances outstanding was 619 and 625, respectively.

The number of days our PayPal Working Capital loans and advances receivables are past due is based on the current expected
repayment period of the loan or advance and fixed fee as compared to an original expected repayment period. We generally
calculate the repayment rate of the merchant’s estimated future payment volume such that repayment of the advance and fixed
fee is expected to occur within 9 to 12 months from the date of the loan or advance. On a monthly basis, we recalculate the
repayment period based on the repayment activity on the receivable. As such, actual repayment periods are dependent on actual
payment processing volumes. We monitor receivables with repayment periods greater than the original expected repayment
period.

As of December 31, 2017, the total outstanding balance in our pool of Swift merchant loans, advances, interest and fees receivable
was $309 million. We closely monitor credit quality for all merchant loans and advances, so that we can evaluate, quantify, and
manage our credit risk exposure. To assess a merchant seeking a loan or an advance, we use, among other indicators, a risk model
developed internally which utilizes information obtained from multiple data sources, both external and internal, to predict the
likelihood of timely and satisfactory repayment by the merchant of the loan or advance amount and the related interest or fixed
fee. Drivers of the model include elements sourced from a consumer credit bureau report, business credit bureau report, prior
repayment history with our products where available, and other information obtained during the application process. We use
delinquency status and trends to assist in making new and ongoing credit decisions, to adjust our internal model, plan our
collection practices and strategies and in the end our determination of our allowance for these loans and advances.

For Swift business loan and advance products, the determination of delinquency, from current to 180 days past due, is based on
the current expected repayment period of the loan and fixed fee payment as compared to the original expected repayment period.

Modifications to the acceptable risk parameters of our PayPal credit products for the periods presented did not have a material
impact on our loans. For additional information, see “Note 10—Loans and Interest Receivable” in the notes to the consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Customer support and operations
Customer support and operations expenses include costs incurred to provide 24-hour call support to our customers, our site
operations and other infrastructure costs incurred to support our Payments Platform, costs to support our trust and security
programs protecting our merchants and consumers and other costs incurred related to the delivery of our products.

Customer support and operations costs increased $97 million, or 8%, in 2017 compared to 2016 and increased $157 million, or 14%,
in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to an increase in network infrastructure expenses and contractor
and employee related expenses to support the growth in our active customer accounts and the number of payment transactions
occurring on our Payments Platform. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to an increase in contractor and employee related
expenses to service the growth in our active customer accounts and the number of payment transactions occurring on our
Payments Platform.

Sales and marketing
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of customer acquisition, business development, advertising, marketing programs,
and employee compensation and contractor costs to support these programs.

2017 Annual Report

Part II

39

Sales and marketing expenses increased $159 million, or 16%, in 2017 compared to 2016 and increased $32 million, or 3%, in 2016
compared to 2015. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to higher spend on external marketing campaigns and higher employee
related expenses. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to higher marketing spend related to Xoom on advertising campaigns
intended to enhance our global brand recognition.

Product development
Product development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and contractor costs that are incurred in connection
with the development of our Payments Platform, new products and the improvement of our existing products. Product
development expenses exclude software and website development costs that are capitalized. The amortization of developed
technology is included in depreciation and amortization expense.

Product development expenses increased $119 million, or 14%, in 2017 compared to 2016 and increased $42 million, or 5%, in 2016
compared to 2015. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to an increase in employee related expenses. The increase in 2016 was
due primarily to an increase in employee related expenses, driven primarily by Xoom, offset by a decrease in contractor related
expenses.

General and administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs incurred to provide support to our business, including legal, human
resources, finance, risk and compliance, executive and other support operations. Our legal expenses, including those related to
ongoing legal and regulatory proceedings, settlements, judgments and fines, may fluctuate substantially from period to period.

For the period prior to the separation, our consolidated financial statements include expenses associated with workplace resources
and information technology that were previously allocated to the Payments segment of eBay, and additional expenses related to
certain corporate functions, including senior management, legal, human resources and finance. These expenses also include
allocations related to stock-based compensation. The expenses incurred by eBay were allocated to us based on direct usage or
benefit where identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of revenue, headcount, or other systematic measure.
The corporate costs and allocation of expenses from eBay may not be indicative of the expenses that may have been incurred had
we been a separate stand-alone entity during the period presented, nor are the results stated herein indicative of the expenses we
may incur in the future. Such expenses could be higher or lower. In the period presented prior to the separation, a significant
portion of expenses associated with these functions and allocated to us in our consolidated financial statements are included in
general and administrative expenses.

General and administrative expenses increased $127 million, or 12%, in 2017 compared to 2016 and increased $155 million, or 18%, in
2016 compared to 2015. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to an increase in employee related expenses and professional
expenses, and continued investments in compliance programs. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to an increase in employee
expenses, contractor related expenses incurred to operate as an independent public company, and continued investments in
compliance programs.

Depreciation and amortization
The primary components of our depreciation and amortization expenses include the depreciation and amortization of software,
including the amortization of capitalized software and website development costs, amortization of equipment used to deliver our
services and the amortization of acquired intangible assets.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $81 million, or 11%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and increased $116 million, or 19%,
in 2016 compared to 2015. The increases in 2017 and 2016 were due primarily to additional depreciation expenses associated with
investments in our technology platform. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $126 million, $150 million and $93 million
in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in amortization of acquired intangibles in 2017
was due primarily to lower amortization expense resulting from fully amortized assets. Additionally, the increase in depreciation
and amortization in 2017 was partially attributable to an impairment charge of $30 million related to a portion of the acquired
customer-related intangible assets. For additional information, see “Note 4—Goodwill and Intangible Assets” to our consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The increase in amortization of intangibles in 2016
was due primarily to our acquisitions completed in 2015.

Restructuring and other charges
Restructuring and other charges consist of restructuring expenses and cost adjustments related to our loans and receivables, held
for sale portfolio. Restructuring and other charges increased by $132 million in 2017 compared to 2016 due to restructuring charges
of $40 million and cost adjustments of $92 million related to our loans and receivables, held for sale portfolio.

In the first quarter of 2017, management approved a plan to implement a strategic reduction of the existing global workforce which
was substantially completed by the end of 2017. We recognized $40 million of restructuring expenses during the year ended
December 31, 2017. No restructuring expenses were recognized in 2016. In January 2015, at a regular meeting of eBay’s board of
directors (the “eBay Board”), the eBay Board approved a plan to implement a strategic reduction of its existing global workforce.
The reduction was completed by the end of 2015 primarily impacting sales and marketing and product development expenses.
Restructuring expenses were $48 million in 2015.

Part II

Subsequent to the designation as held for sale of the U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio in November 2017, approximately
$92 million related to adjustments to the cost basis, which are primarily driven by charge offs against those loans and interest
receivables, were recorded in restructuring and other charges during the year ended December 31, 2017.

Income Tax Expense
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act includes significant
changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system including: a federal corporate rate reduction from 35% to 21%; limitations on the
deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation; creation of new minimum taxes such as the base erosion anti-abuse
tax (“BEAT”) and Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”) tax; and the transition of U.S. international taxation from a
worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system, which will result in a one time U.S. tax liability on those earnings which
have not previously been repatriated to the U.S. (the “Transition Tax”).

In connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act, we have recorded a provisional estimate of discrete net tax
expense of $180 million in the period ended December 31, 2017. This discrete expense consists of provisional estimates of
$1,468 million net expense for the Transition Tax payable in installments over eight years, $1,295 million net benefit for the
decrease in our deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings, and $7 million net expense for remeasurement of our deferred
tax assets/liabilities for the corporate rate reduction and changes in our valuation allowance.

We have not completed our accounting for the income tax effects of certain elements of the Tax Act, including the new GILTI and
BEAT taxes. Due to the complexity of these new tax rules, we are continuing to evaluate these provisions of the Tax Act and
whether such taxes are recorded as a current-period expense when incurred or whether such amounts should be factored into a
company’s measurement of its deferred taxes. As a result, we have not included an estimate of the tax expense/benefit related to
these items for the period ended December 31, 2017.

Our effective tax rate was 18% in 2017, 14% in 2016, and 17% in 2015. The increase in our effective tax rate in 2017 was primarily due
to discrete net tax expense recorded for U.S. tax reform, partially offset by the adoption of the new stock-based compensation
accounting standard in 2017. The decrease in our effective tax rate during 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to favorable
discrete tax adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2016 and other separation-related costs incurred during the year
ended December 31, 2015. See “Note 17—Income Taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our effective tax rate.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Non-GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts
that create differences between the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation S-K, the following portion
of this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” includes a reconciliation of
certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP
financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with
GAAP.

We present non-GAAP financial measures to enhance an investor’s evaluation of our operating results and to facilitate meaningful
comparisons of our results between periods. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things;
evaluate our operations, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation.

We exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, non-GAAP operating
income, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP effective tax rate:

• Stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes. This consists of expenses for equity awards under
our equity incentive plans. We exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP measures primarily because
they are non-cash expenses. The related employer payroll taxes are dependent on our stock price and the timing and size of
exercises and vesting of equity awards, over which management has limited to no control, and as such management does not
believe it correlates to the operation of our business.

• Amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and transaction expenses from the
acquisition or disposal of a business. We incur amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill in
connection with acquisitions and may incur significant gains or losses or transactional expenses from the acquisition or disposal
of a business and therefore exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP measures. We exclude these items because
management does not believe they are reflective of our ongoing operating results.

• Separation. These are significant expenses related to the separation of our business from eBay into a separate, independent
publicly traded company. These consist primarily of third-party consulting fees, legal fees, employee retention payments and
other expenses incurred to complete the separation. We exclude these items because management does not believe they are
reflective of our ongoing operating results.

2017 Annual Report

Part II

41

• Restructuring. These consist of expenses for employee severance and other exit and disposal costs. We exclude restructuring

charges primarily because management does not believe they are reflective of ongoing operating results.

• Certain other significant gains, losses, benefits, or charges that are not indicative of our core operating results. These are

significant gains, losses, benefits, or charges during a period that are the result of isolated events or transactions which have not
occurred frequently in the past and are not expected to occur regularly in the future. We exclude these amounts from our
non-GAAP results because management does not believe they are indicative of our ongoing operating results.

• Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. This adjustment is made to present stock-based compensation and the other amounts

described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income.

The following table provides reconciliations of our consolidated non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable
GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:

period beginning after the distribution date.

In addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, we also use free cash flow to assess our performance. Free cash flow
represents cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We consider free cash flow to be a
liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the
business after the purchases of property and equipment, and including investments in our Payments Platform, which can then be
used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, and repurchase stock. A limitation of the utility of
free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance
for the period.

2017 Annual Report

Part II

Cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were $6.1 billion as of December 31, 2017 and $5.0 billion at
December 31, 2016, or 81% and 78% of our total cash, cash equivalents and investments as of those respective dates. At
December 31, 2017 all of our cash, cash equivalents and investments held by foreign subsidiaries were subject to U.S. taxation
under the one-time transition tax as further discussed in “Note 17—Income Taxes” to our consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Subsequent repatriations will not be taxable from a U.S. federal tax
perspective, but may be subject to state or foreign withholding tax.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, we entered into a credit agreement (“2017 Credit Agreement”) that provides for an unsecured
$3.0 billion, 364-day delayed-draw term loan credit facility, which is available in up to three borrowings. Borrowings and other
amounts payable under the 2017 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our PayPal, Inc. subsidiary. Subject to specified conditions,
we may designate one or more of our subsidiaries as additional borrowers under the 2017 Credit Agreement provided that we and
PayPal, Inc. guarantee all borrowings and other obligations of any such subsidiaries under the 2017 Credit Agreement. As of
December 31, 2017, no subsidiaries were designated as additional borrowers. Funds borrowed under the 2017 Credit Agreement
may be used for capital allocation and other general corporate purposes of us and our subsidiaries.

Loans under the 2017 Credit Agreement will bear interest at either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin
(based on our public debt ratings) ranging from 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent or (ii) a formula based on the agent bank’s prime rate,
the NYFRB rate (the greater of the federal funds effective rate and the overnight bank funding rate) or LIBOR plus a margin
(based on our public debt ratings) ranging from zero percent to 0.25 percent. The 2017 Credit Agreement will terminate and all
amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable in December 2018, unless the commitments are terminated earlier, either at
our request or, if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events).
Subject to certain exceptions, if we were to issue debt securities or enter into a credit facility, a corresponding portion of the
aggregate commitments and outstanding loans under the 2017 Credit Agreement will be terminated and be required to be paid, as
applicable. The 2017 Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants,
including financial covenants, events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders. The negative covenants
include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens, subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenants require us to meet a
quarterly financial test with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage
ratio, based on our public debt ratings.

As of December 31, 2017, $1.0 billion was outstanding under the 2017 Credit Agreement at an interest rate of 2.78% (one month
LIBOR plus a margin of 1.125%). Accordingly, at December 31, 2017, $2.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes
permitted by the 2017 Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.

The company maintains uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world, aggregating to approximately
$250 million. Interest rate terms for these facilities vary by region and reflect prevailing market rates for companies with strong
credit ratings. As of December 31, 2017, no amounts were outstanding under these facilities, and therefore, approximately
$250 million of borrowing capacity was available, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.

In the third quarter of 2015, we entered into a credit agreement (“2015 Credit Agreement” and collectively with the 2017 Credit
Agreement, the “Credit Agreements”) that provides for an unsecured $2.0 billion, five-year revolving credit facility that includes a
$150 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $150 million swingline sub-facility, with available borrowings under the revolving
credit facility reduced by the amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding from time to time. Borrowings
and other amounts payable under the 2015 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our PayPal, Inc. subsidiary. We may also, subject
to the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to $500 million.
Subject to specified conditions, we may designate one or more of our subsidiaries as additional borrowers under the 2015 Credit
Agreement provided that we and PayPal, Inc. guarantee all borrowings and other obligations of any such subsidiaries under the
2015 Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2017, no subsidiaries were designated as additional borrowers. Funds borrowed under
the 2015 Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate
purposes.

Loans under the 2015 Credit Agreement will bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin (based on our public debt ratings)
ranging from 1.00 percent to 1.625 percent or (ii) a formula based on the agent bank’s prime rate, the federal funds effective rate
or LIBOR plus a margin (based on our public debt ratings) ranging from zero percent to 0.625 percent. Subject to certain
conditions stated in the 2015 Credit Agreement, we and any of our subsidiaries designated as additional borrowers may borrow,
prepay and re-borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility at any time during the term of the 2015 Credit Agreement. The
2015 Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on July 17, 2020, unless (a) the
commitments are terminated earlier, either at our request or, if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the
case of certain bankruptcy-related events), or (b) the maturity date is extended upon our request, subject to the agreement of the
lenders. The 2015 Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including
financial covenants, events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the banks. The negative covenants include
restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens, subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenants require us to meet a quarterly
financial test with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, based
on our public debt ratings.

During the third quarter of 2017, we drew down $800 million under the 2015 Credit Agreement, which was repaid during the fourth
quarter of 2017. As of December 31, 2017, no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under the 2015 Credit Agreement.
Accordingly, at December 31, 2017, $2.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the 2015 Credit
Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.

We have a cash pooling arrangement with a financial institution for cash management purposes. The arrangement allows for cash
withdrawals from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the financial institution
(“Aggregate Cash Deposits”). The arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to
an agreed-upon limit. The net balance of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash Deposits are used by the financial institution as
a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under these arrangements. As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of
$3.3 billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our $3.3 billion in Aggregate Cash Deposits held within the financial institution under the
cash pooling arrangement.

Growth in the portfolio of loan receivables increases our liquidity needs and any failure to meet those liquidity needs could
adversely affect our business. We continue to evaluate partnerships and third party sources of funding of our credit portfolio. In
March 2016, as approved by management and our Luxembourg banking subsidiary’s Supervisory Board and as permitted within
regulations set forth by the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the “CSSF”), we designated
$800 million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used to extend credit to our
European customers. In the fourth quarter of 2017, an additional amount of $700 million of European customer balances held in
our Luxembourg banking subsidiary was approved and designated to be used to extend credit to our U.S. consumers. These funds
were classified as cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheet on the date of designation and represent
approximately 30% of European customer balances potentially available for corporate use by us at December 31, 2017 as
determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the CSSF. We may periodically seek to designate additional amounts of
customer balances, if necessary, based on utilization of the approved funds and anticipated credit funding requirements. Our
objective is to expand the availability of our credit products with capital from external sources, although there can be no assurance
that we will be successful in achieving that goal.

In November 2017, we reached an agreement to sell our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank. Historically,
this portfolio was reported as outstanding principal balances, net of any participation interest sold and pro-rata allowances
including, unamortized deferred origination costs and estimated collectible interest and fees. Following the closing of this
transaction, which is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2018, Synchrony Bank will become the exclusive issuer of the PayPal
credit online consumer financing program in the U.S., and we will no longer hold an ownership interest in the receivables generated
through the program (other than charged off receivables).

As of December 31, 2017, we continue to be rated investment grade by Standard and Poor’s Financial Services, LLC and Fitch
Ratings, Inc. We expect that these credit rating agencies will continue to monitor our performance, including our capital structure
and results of operations. Our goal is to be rated investment grade, but as circumstances change, there are factors that could
result in our credit ratings being downgraded or put on a watch list for possible downgrading. If that were to occur, it could increase
our borrowing rates, including the interest rate on loans under the Credit Agreements. The risk of losses from our customer
protection programs are specific to individual customers, merchants and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional
variations in, and changes or modifications to, the programs, including as a result of changes in regulatory requirements. For the
periods presented in these consolidated financial statements included in this report, our transaction loss rates, calculated by
dividing transaction loss by TPV, ranged between 0.18% and 0.19% of TPV. Historical trends may not be an indication of future
results.

In January 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program that provided for the repurchase of up to $2
billion of our common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. In April 2017, our Board of Directors authorized an
additional stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock, with no expiration
from the date of authorization. This program became effective upon completion of the January 2016 stock repurchase program.
The stock repurchase programs are intended to offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject
to market conditions and other factors, may also be used to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce
outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market
transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems
appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives. However, any stock repurchases are
subject to market conditions and other uncertainties and we cannot predict if or when any stock repurchases will be made.
Moreover, we may terminate our stock repurchase programs at any time without notice.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased approximately $1.0 billion of our common stock under our January 2016
and April 2017 stock repurchase programs. As of December 31, 2017, a total of approximately $5.0 billion remained available for
future repurchases of our common stock under our April 2017 stock repurchase program. During the year ended December 31,
2016, we repurchased approximately $995 million of our common stock under our January 2016 stock repurchase program. As
of December 31, 2016, a total of approximately $1.0 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under
our January 2016 stock repurchase program.

Our liquidity, access to capital and borrowing costs could be adversely impacted by declines in our credit rating, our financial
performance, and global credit market conditions, as well as a broad range of other factors. In addition, our liquidity, access to
capital and borrowing costs could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to
which we are a party. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial
Condition” and “Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business.

We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, cash expected to be generated from operations, and our
expected access to capital markets, together with potential external funding through third party sources, will be sufficient to fund
our operating activities, anticipated capital expenditures, and PayPal credit products for the foreseeable future. Depending on
market conditions, we may from time to time issue debt, including in private or public offerings, to fund our operating activities,
finance acquisitions, repurchase shares under our share repurchase program, or reduce our cost of capital.

CASH FLOWS
In March 2016, we designated $800 million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used
to extend credit to our European customers. In the fourth quarter of 2017, an additional amount of $700 million of European
customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary was approved and designated to be used to extend credit to our
U.S. consumers. We have presented changes in funds receivable and customer accounts as cash flows from investing activities in
our consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature of the activity underlying our customer accounts which includes
purchases of investments, maturities and sales of investments and changes in funds receivable and customer accounts. We have
elected to conform the prior period statement of cash flows to the current period presentation to enhance transparency and
provide comparability. See “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the effects of the changes on the
presentation of our statement of cash flows to our previously reported consolidated statement of cash flows.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES
Cash flows from operating activities includes net income adjusted for certain non-cash expenses, timing differences between
expenses recognized for provision for transaction and loan losses and actual cash transaction losses incurred, and changes in other
assets and liabilities. Significant non-cash expenses for the period include depreciation and amortization and stock-based
compensation. The cash impact from actual transaction losses incurred during a period is reflected as a negative impact to
changes in other assets and liabilities in cash from operating activities. The expenses recognized during the period for provision for
loan losses are estimates of probable incurred losses on our consumer and merchant credit products (excluding the U.S. consumer
credit portfolio from and after November 2017). Actual charge-offs of receivables related to our consumer and merchant credit
products (excluding the U.S. consumer credit portfolio from and after November 2017) have no impact on cash from operating
activities.

We generated cash from operating activities of $2.5 billion in 2017 due primarily to operating income of approximately $2.1 billion.
Adjustments for non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation were approximately
$1.5 billion during 2017. Adjustments for non-cash expenses related to the provision for transaction and loan losses were
approximately $1.0 billion during 2017. The cash generated from operating activities was negatively impacted by adjustments for
non-cash expenses related to deferred income taxes of approximately $1.3 billion during 2017. The cash generated from operating
activities was negatively impacted by changes in working capital primarily related to loans and interest receivable held for sale, net
of $1.3 billion due to changes in the presentation of originations and collections on loans within the U.S. consumer credit portfolio
subsequent to its designation as held for sale in November 2017, which are now presented in operating activities instead of
investing activities, offset by changes in other assets and liabilities of $634 million. Collections on the U.S. consumer credit portfolio
for originations that occurred prior to November 2017 will continue to be reflected in investing activities.

We generated cash from operating activities of $3.2 billion in 2016 due primarily to operating income of approximately $1.6 billion.
Adjustments for non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation (including excess tax
benefits from stock-based compensation) were approximately $1.1 billion during 2016. Adjustments for non-cash expenses related
to the provision for transaction and loan losses were approximately $1.1 billion during 2016. The cash generated from operating
activities was negatively impacted by changes in working capital primarily related to transaction loss allowance for cash losses, net.

We generated cash from operating activities of $2.5 billion in 2015 due primarily to operating income of approximately $1.5 billion.
Adjustments for non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation (including excess tax
benefits from stock-based compensation) were approximately $928 million during 2015. Adjustments to non-cash expenses
related to transaction and loan losses were approximately $809 million during 2015. The cash generated from operating activities
was negatively impacted by changes in working capital primarily related to actual transaction losses paid during the period.
Additional uses of cash impacting cash generated from operating activities include net cash outflows relating to settlement of eBay
payables and receivables of approximately $96 million and increases in accounts receivable of approximately $22 million.

Cash paid for income taxes in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $117 million, $48 million and $216 million, respectively.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES
Cash flows from investing activities includes purchases, maturities and sales of investments, cash paid for acquisitions, purchases
and sales of property and equipment, changes in principal loans receivable, funds receivable and customer accounts. For periods
prior to the distribution, it also includes notes payable and receivable from eBay.

The net cash used in investing activities of $5.4 billion in 2017 was due primarily to purchases of investments of $19.4 billion,
increase in funds receivable and customer accounts of $2.5 billion including the reclassification of $700 million of European
customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary as cash and cash equivalents, changes in principal loans receivable
portfolio (net of collections) originated through our consumer and merchant credit products excluding originations and collections
pertaining to the U.S. consumer credit portfolio from and after November 2017 which are now presented in operating activities, of
$920 million, acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $323 million, and purchases of property and equipment of $667 million. These
net cash outflows were offset by maturities and sales of investments of $18.5 billion. Collections on the U.S. consumer credit
portfolio for originations that occurred prior to November 2017 will continue to be reflected in investing activities.

The net cash used in investing activities of $5.0 billion in 2016 was due primarily to purchases of investments of $21.0 billion,
increases in our loan receivable portfolio (net of collections) originated through our PayPal credit products of $1.5 billion, purchases
of property and equipment of $669 million and net increases in funds receivable from customers and customer accounts of
$176 million, including the reclassification of $800 million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking
subsidiary as cash and cash equivalents. These net cash outflows were offset by maturities and sales of investments of $18.4 billion.

The net cash used in investing activities of $8.0 billion in 2015 was due primarily to purchases of investments of $21.6 billion,
acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $1.2 billion, increases in our loan receivable portfolio (net of collections) originated through our
PayPal credit products of $819 million, and purchases of property and equipment of $722 million. These net cash outflows were
offset in part by maturities and sales of investments of $16.1 billion and net cash inflows relating to receivables from eBay of
$575 million.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES
Cash flows from financing activities includes proceeds from issuance of common stock, purchases of treasury stock, tax
withholdings related to net share settlements of equity awards, borrowings net of repayments under financing arrangements,
funds payable and amounts due to customers, and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation (for periods prior to 2017).
For periods prior to the distribution, it also includes contribution from eBay.

The net cash provided by financing activities of $4.1 billion in 2017 was due primarily to increases in funds payable and amounts
due to customers of $4.3 billion and borrowings of $1.0 billion, partially offset by repayment of a loan of $170 million assumed in
connection with our acquisition of Swift Financial, the repurchase of $1.0 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase
programs and tax withholdings related to net share settlement of equity awards of $166 million.

The net cash provided by financing activities of $2.0 billion in 2016 was due primarily to increases in funds payable and amounts
due to customers of $3.0 billion, offset in part by the repurchase of $995 million of our common stock under our stock repurchase
program.

The net cash provided by financing activities of $4.7 billion in 2015 was due primarily to a contribution of approximately $3.9 billion
of cash from eBay and increases in funds payable and amounts due to customers of $1.6 billion, offset in part by repayments of
borrowings from eBay of $862 million.

FREE CASH FLOW
We define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment.

Free cash flow was $1.9 billion in 2017, a decrease of $625 million from 2016. The decrease in free cash flow during the period was
primarily due to lower cash generated from operating activities of $627 million, which was impacted by the change in presentation
from investing activities to operating activities of originations and collections on the U.S. consumer credit portfolio subsequent to
its designation as held for sale in November 2017. Free cash flow generated during 2017 was used for repurchasing our common
stock under our stock repurchase programs, funding our credit portfolio, acquisitions and general business purposes.

Free cash flow was $2.5 billion in 2016, an increase of $665 million from 2015. The increase in free cash flow during the period was
primarily due to higher cash generated from operating activities of $612 million and lower purchases of property and equipment of
$53 million. Free cash flow generated during 2016 was used for funding our credit portfolio, repurchasing our common stock under
our stock repurchase program, and general business purposes.

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Non-GAAP Financial Information” for information on how we compute free
cash flow and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATES ON CASH
The positive effect of currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during 2017 of $36 million was due to the weakening
of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. Currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on
cash and cash equivalents in 2016. The negative effect of currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during 2015 of
$44 million was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies, primarily the Euro.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current
or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources.

FUTURE LIQUIDITY AND OBLIGATIONS
As of December 31, 2017, approximately $26.4 billion of unused credit was available to PayPal Credit account holders compared to
$28.8 billion of unused credit as of December 31, 2016. While this amount represents the total unused credit available, we have not
experienced, and do not anticipate, that all of our PayPal Credit account holders will access their entire available credit at any given
point in time. In addition, the individual lines of credit that make up this unused credit are subject to periodic review and
termination by the chartered financial institution that is the issuer of our U.S. PayPal Credit consumer products based on, among
other things, account usage and customer creditworthiness. When a consumer funds a purchase in the U.S. using a PayPal credit
product issued by a chartered financial institution, the chartered financial institution extends credit to the consumer, funds the
extension of credit at the point of sale and advances funds to the merchant. We subsequently purchase the receivables related to
the consumer loans extended by the chartered financial institution and, as a result of such purchase, bear the risk of loss in the
event of loan defaults. Although the chartered financial institution continues to own each customer account, we own the related
receivable (excluding participation interests sold) and are responsible for all servicing functions related to the account. Upon the
closing of the sale of our loans and interest receivables, held for sale, which is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2018, we will
no longer purchase receivables related to the U.S. consumer loans extended by the chartered financial institution.

We have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating
purposes. Changes in our business needs, contractual cancellation provisions, fluctuating interest rates, and other factors may
result in actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these
payments. The following table summarizes our obligations as of December 31, 2017 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash
flow in future periods. We believe we will be able to fund these obligations through our existing cash and investment portfolio and
cash expected to be generated from operations.

The significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows:

• Purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising, capital expenditures (computer

equipment, software applications, engineering development services and construction contracts) and other goods and services
entered into in the ordinary course of business.

• Operating lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our non-cancelable operating leases for office and data

center facilities. The amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly from
actual results under our existing leases, unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to expand our occupied
space or exit an office facility early.

• Transition Tax represents the one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings under the Tax Act, as further
discussed in “Note 17—Income Taxes” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

As we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, net, the table
above does not include $383 million of such non-current liabilities included in deferred and other tax liabilities recorded on our
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017.

SEASONALITY
The Company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to net revenues. No individual quarter in 2017, 2016 or
2015 accounted for more than 30% of annual net revenue.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The application of U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly
affect our reported financial condition. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable
assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period
to period. The accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical
to our financial statements. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or assumption is
material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the
estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and
disclosure of these estimates with the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors. Our significant accounting
policies, including recent accounting pronouncements, are described in “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies” to the consolidated annual financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

A quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available, can be reliably estimated and
provides material information to investors. The amounts used to assess sensitivity are included to allow users of this report to
understand a general direction cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent management’s predictions of
variability. For all of these estimates, it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and estimates
require regular review and adjustment.

Transaction and loan losses
Transaction and loan losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud, chargebacks, and credit
losses associated with our loans receivable balances. Our transaction and loan losses fluctuate depending on many factors,
including: total TPV, macroeconomic conditions, changes to our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes,
and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our PayPal credit products, which include our
PayPal Credit consumer product and merchant loans and advances consisting of PayPal Working Capital and Swift business loans
and advances to merchant sellers.

We establish allowances for estimated transaction losses arising from processing customer transactions, such as chargebacks for
unauthorized credit card use and merchant-related chargebacks due to non-delivery of goods or services, ACH returns, buyer
protection program claims, account takeovers, and account overdrafts. Additions to the allowance, in the form of provisions, are
reflected in transaction and loan losses in our consolidated statements of income. The allowances are monitored regularly and are
updated based on actual claims data reported by our claims processors and other actual data received. The allowances are based
on known facts and circumstances, internal factors including experience with similar cases, historical trends involving loss payment
patterns, and the mix of transaction and loss types.

We also establish an allowance for loans receivable, which represents our estimate of probable incurred loan losses inherent in our
consumer loans receivable and merchant loans and advances. Increases to the allowance for loans receivable are reflected as
transaction and loan losses in our consolidated financial statements. This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and
judgments. In connection with the pending sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank, and the
designation of that portfolio as held for sale in November 2017, we released corresponding allowances against those loans and
interest receivable balances. Such allowances on any newly originated U.S. consumer loan receivables from and after November

2017 Annual Report

Part II

49

2017 will not be established. Adjustments to the cost basis of this portfolio, which are primarily driven by charge offs, are recorded
in restructuring and other charges in our consolidated statement of income. For our consumer loan receivables not subject to the
sale agreement with Synchrony Bank, consisting primarily of our international consumer receivables, the allowance is primarily
based on forecasted principal balance delinquency rates (“roll rates”). Roll rates are the percentage of balances which we estimate
will migrate from one stage of delinquency to the next based on our historical experience, as well as external factors such as
estimated bankruptcies and levels of unemployment. Roll rates are applied to the principal amount of our international consumer
receivables for each stage of delinquency, from current to 180 days past the payment due date, in order to estimate the principal
loans which have incurred losses and are probable to be charged off. For merchant loans and advances receivable, that includes
PayPal Working Capital and Swift business loan and advance products, the allowance is primarily based on principal balances,
forecasted delinquency rates and recoveries through the use of a vintage-based loss forecasting model.

The determination of delinquency, from current to 180 days past due, for principal balances related to merchant loans and
advances is based on the current expected repayment period of the loan or advance and interest or fixed fee as compared to the
original expected repayment period. For PayPal Working Capital product we calculate the repayment rate based on the merchant’s
expected future payment volume such that repayment of the advance and fixed fee is typically expected to occur within 9 to 12
months from the date of the loan or advance. On a regular basis, we recalculate the repayment period based on the actual
repayment activity on the receivable. As such, actual repayment periods are dependent on actual payment processing volumes.

The allowance for loss against the interest receivable is primarily determined by applying historical average customer account roll
rates to the interest receivable balance in each stage of delinquency to project the value of accounts that have incurred losses and
are probable to be charged off. The allowance for fees receivable is primarily based on fee balances, forecasted delinquency rates
and recoveries through the use of a vintage-based loss forecasting model. Increases to the allowance for fees receivable is
recognized as a reduction in deferred revenues included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.

We charge off consumer loan receivable balances in the month in which a customer balance becomes 180 days past the payment
due date. We charge off the PayPal Working Capital receivable when the updated repayment period is 180 days past the original
expected repayment period and the merchant has not made a payment in the last 60 days. We also charge off the receivable when
the updated repayment period is 360 days past the original expected repayment period regardless of whether or not the merchant
has made a payment within the last 60 days. Bankrupt accounts are charged off within 60 days of receiving notification of
bankruptcy. Loans receivable past the payment due date continue to accrue interest until such time as they are charged off, with
the portion of the reserve related to the interest receivable balance classified as a reduction of revenue for international
consumers and recorded in restructuring and other charges for the U.S. consumer receivables, in our consolidated statement of
income. For Swift business loan and advance products, we charge off the receivable when the repayments are 180 days past our
expectation of repayments. Bankrupt accounts are charged off within 60 days of receiving notification of bankruptcy. The
provision for loan losses is recognized in transaction and loan losses. Charge-offs that are recovered are recorded as a reduction to
our allowance for loans and interest receivable.

Determining appropriate allowances for these losses is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate losses may vary from the
current estimates. We regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact
the settlement or recovery of losses. The allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for
losses incurred at the balance sheet date. Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2017, an aggregate ten percent
increase in our transaction and loan loss rate would negatively impact transaction and loan losses by approximately $101 million.

Accounting for Income Taxes
Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various
jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective
government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions,
including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes
available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings. In addition to local
country tax laws and regulations, our income tax rate depends on the extent that our foreign earnings are taxed by the U.S.
through new provisions under the Tax Act such as the new GILTI tax and BEAT or as a result of our indefinite reinvestment
assertion. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about and intentions concerning our future
operations.

Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets
arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing
the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted
operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a
number of factors, including our historical experience and short range and long-range business forecasts. To the extent deferred
tax assets are not expected to be realized, we record a valuation allowance.

Part II

We recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with GAAP, pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit
from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing
authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such
positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon
ultimate settlement. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to
be taken in a tax return. GAAP further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain
tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs. We recognize interest and penalties, if any,
related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

We file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse before an
uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final
outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes are
adequate such that we reflect the benefits more likely than not to be sustained in an examination. We adjust these reserves, as
well as the related interest, where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position
could require the use of cash.

Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2017, a one-percentage point increase in our effective tax rate would have
resulted in an increase in our income tax expense of approximately $22 million.

Loss Contingencies
We are currently involved in various claims, legal proceedings and investigations of potential operating violations by regulatory
oversight authorities. We regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the
potential loss from any claim, legal proceeding or potential regulatory violation is considered probable and the amount can be
reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of
probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or
regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. Because of
uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional
information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims, litigation or other violation and may
revise our estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we
operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes.

Revenue Recognition
Application of the various accounting principles in U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us
to make judgments and estimates. Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant
contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. Specifically, the determination of whether we are a principal to a
transaction (gross revenue) or an agent (net revenue) can require considerable judgment. Further, we provide incentive payments
to consumers and merchants, which require judgment to determine whether the payments should be recorded as a reduction to
gross revenue. Changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue
recognized.

Valuation of Goodwill and Intangibles
The valuation of assets acquired in a business combination and asset impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates
and assumptions. The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets
acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in an acquired business to properly allocate purchase price
consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. Impairment testing for assets, other than
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if
required, an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be
reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These valuations require the use of management’s assumptions,
which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.

We evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. Under
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance, the evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment
allows for a qualitative assessment to be performed, which is similar to the FASB guidance for evaluating goodwill for impairment.
In performing these qualitative assessments, we consider relevant events and conditions, including but not limited to:
macroeconomic trends, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, cost factors, company-specific events, legal
and regulatory factors and our market capitalization. If the qualitative assessments indicate that it is more likely than not that the
fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts, we must perform a
quantitative impairment test.

Under the quantitative impairment test, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset
exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset, an impairment loss is recorded in
the statement of income. Measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit is based on one or more of the following fair value

2017 Annual Report

Part II

measures: amounts at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, using
present value techniques of estimated future cash flows, or using valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue,
or a similar performance measure.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Item 7a.
Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes
in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk. Management establishes and
oversees the implementation of policies governing our investing, funding, and foreign currency derivative activities in order to
mitigate market risks. We monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis.

INTEREST RATE RISK
We are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investment portfolio and from interest-rate sensitive assets underlying the
customer balances we hold on our consolidated balance sheet as customer accounts. We seek to reduce earnings volatility that
may result from changes in interest rates.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, approximately 39% and 25%, respectively, of our total cash and investment portfolio was held in
cash and cash equivalents. The assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our consolidated balance sheet as customer
accounts are maintained in interest and non-interest bearing bank deposits, time deposits, U.S. and foreign government and
agency securities and corporate debt securities. We classify the assets underlying the customer balances as current based on their
purpose and availability to fulfill our direct obligation under amounts due to customers. We seek to preserve principal while
holding eligible liquid assets, as defined by applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law in the jurisdictions where we
operate, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. We do not pay interest on amounts due to
customers.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, we entered into an unsecured $3.0 billion, 364 day delayed-draw term loan credit facility, which is
available in up to three borrowings (“2017 Credit Agreement”). In the third quarter of 2015, we entered into a $2.0 billion senior
unsecured credit facility maturing in 2020 (“2015 Credit Agreement”). The company maintains uncommitted credit facilities in
various regions throughout the world, aggregating to approximately $250 million.

Borrowings under the 2017 Credit Agreement and 2015 Credit Agreement, if any, bear interest at floating rates. As a result, we will
be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates to the extent of our borrowings. As of December 31, 2017, $1.0 billion was outstanding
under the 2017 Credit Agreement at an interest rate of 2.78% (one month LIBOR plus a margin of 1.125%). Accordingly, at
December 31, 2017, $2.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the 2017 Credit Agreement,
subject to customary conditions to borrowing. As of December 31, 2017, no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under
the 2015 Credit Agreement or uncommitted facilities.

Interest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts
owed to us. Higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage,
credit card and other consumer and merchant loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their
obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs and allowance for loan and interest receivable, which
could have an adverse effect on our net income.

u
a
l

R
e
p
o
r
t

A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not have had a material impact on our financial assets or liabilities at
December 31, 2017 and 2016.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK
We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro,
Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our financial results. We
transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues and costs. In addition, we charge our
international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services. Our cash flows,
results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ
materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related
hedging activities. We are generally a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the U.S. dollar,
and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to foreign currencies.

We have a foreign exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures, manage
these exposures and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flows and results of
operations through the execution of foreign currency exchange contracts. These foreign currency exchange contracts are
accounted for as derivative instruments; for additional details related to our foreign currency exchange contracts, please see
“Note 8—Derivative Instruments” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

www.paypal.com

52

Part II

We use foreign exchange forward contracts to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from adverse changes in
foreign currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency
exchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. The effective portion of the
derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and
subsequently reclassified into revenue in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of
the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts, if any, is recorded immediately in earnings.

We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in
exchange rates of 20% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 20% at December 31,
2017 and 2016, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign currency exchange forward contracts, before taxes, would have
been approximately $536 million and $341 million lower, respectively. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 20% at December 31, 2017
and 2016, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign currency exchange forward contracts, before taxes, would have been
approximately $536 million and $341 million higher, respectively.

We have an additional foreign exchange management program whereby we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the
foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our
subsidiaries. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of
currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on our assets and liabilities
are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts.

Adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% for all currencies would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income
taxes of approximately $243 million and $160 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, without considering the
offsetting effect of hedging. Foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of December 31, 2017 would have positively impacted
income before income taxes by approximately $211 million, resulting in a net negative impact of approximately $32 million. Foreign
currency exchange contracts in place as of December 31, 2016 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by
approximately $128 million, resulting in a net negative impact of approximately $32 million. These reasonably possible adverse
changes in currency exchange rates of 20% were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other
than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would
have had on our income before income taxes in the near term.

EQUITY PRICE RISK
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our cost method investments totaled $88 million and $50 million, respectively, which
represented approximately 1% of our total cash and investment portfolio and were primarily related to cost method investments
in privately held companies. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we did not hold any marketable equity instruments. We review our
investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such assets below carrying value is
other-than-temporary. Our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales and acquisitions of the
securities in which we have invested and other publicly available data.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
The audited consolidated financial statements covering the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 and accompanying

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of PayPal Holdings, Inc.

OPINIONS ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PayPal Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31,
2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying
accounts for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to
as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

BASIS FOR OPINIONS
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in
Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and
the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,
whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement
of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

DEFINITION AND LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

PayPal Holdings, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
OVERVIEW AND ORGANIZATION
PayPal Holdings, Inc. (“PayPal,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 and is a leading
technology platform and digital payments company that enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and
merchants worldwide. Our vision is to democratize financial services, as we believe that managing and moving money is a right for
all people, not just the affluent. Our goal is to increase our relevance for consumers and merchants to manage and move their
money anywhere in the world, anytime, on any platform and using any device. We also facilitate person-to-person payments
through our PayPal, Venmo and Xoom products. Our combined payment solutions, including our PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree,
Venmo, Xoom, and Paydiant products, compose our proprietary Payments Platform. The terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,”
and “PayPal” mean PayPal Holdings, Inc. and, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context requires, its subsidiaries.

We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects
of the payments industry. Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business. We are subject to regulations that affect
the payments industry in the markets in which we operate. Non-compliance with laws and regulations, increased penalties and
enforcement actions related to non-compliance, changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation, and the enactment of new
laws and regulations applicable to us could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
On July 17, 2015 (the “distribution date”), PayPal became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata
distribution by eBay Inc. (“eBay”) of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal to eBay stockholders (which we refer to as
the “separation” or the “distribution”). Each eBay stockholder of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2015 received one
share of PayPal common stock for every share of eBay common stock held on the record date. Approximately 1.2 billion shares of
PayPal common stock were distributed on July 17, 2015 to eBay stockholders. PayPal’s common stock began “regular way” trading
under the ticker symbol “PYPL” on the NASDAQ Stock Market on July 20, 2015.

Prior to the separation, eBay transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations of eBay’s payments business to
PayPal, which was completed in June 2015 (the “capitalization”). The consolidated financial statements prior to the capitalization
were prepared on a stand-alone basis and were derived from eBay’s consolidated financial statements and accounting records. The
consolidated financial statements reflect our financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows as our
business was operated as part of eBay prior to the capitalization. Following the capitalization, the consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All periods presented have been accounted
for in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).

For periods prior to the capitalization, the consolidated financial statements include expenses associated with real estate and
information technology that were previously allocated to the payments business of eBay, and additional expenses related to
certain corporate functions, including senior management, legal, human resources and finance. These expenses also include
allocations related to stock-based compensation. The expenses that were incurred by eBay were allocated to us based on direct
usage or benefit where identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of revenue, headcount, or other systematic
measure. We consider the expense allocation methodology and results to be reasonable for all periods presented. The consolidated
financial statements also include certain assets and liabilities that were historically held at the eBay corporate level, but which are
specifically identifiable and attributable to us. The consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of PayPal
prior to the distribution may not be indicative of our results had we been a separate stand-alone entity throughout the periods
presented, nor are the results stated herein indicative of what the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash
flows may be in the future. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. Transactions between the Company
and eBay are included in these consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

Beginning with the first quarter of 2016, we reclassified certain operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income to
better align our external and internal financial reporting. These classification changes relate primarily to real estate and
information technology operating expenses that were previously allocated among customer support and operations expense, sales
and marketing expense and product development expense. As of the first quarter of 2016, our management did not allocate these
operating expenses for internal financial reporting and general management of the business, and we therefore discontinued this
allocation for external financial reporting purposes. As a result, starting with the first quarter of 2016, these operating expenses
were reported as part of general and administrative expenses. These changes have no impact on the previously reported

consolidated net income for prior periods, including total operating expenses, financial position or cash flows for any periods
presented, and do not eliminate any of the costs allocated to us by eBay for any periods prior to the separation. Prior period
amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of PayPal and our wholly and majority-
owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities
where we hold less than a 20% ownership interest are generally accounted for using the cost method of accounting, and our share
of the investees’ results of operations is included in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statement of income to the
extent dividends are received. Our investment balance is included in long-term investments on our consolidated balance sheet.

In the opinion of management, these consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
adjustments, which are necessary for fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. We have
evaluated all subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued. Certain amounts for prior years have been
reclassified to conform to the financial statement presentation as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Use of estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses, including allocations from eBay,
during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to provisions for transaction
and loan losses, loss contingencies, income taxes, revenue recognition, and the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets. We base
our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when
purchased and are composed of primarily bank deposits, government and agency securities and commercial paper.

Investments
Short-term investments include time deposits, government and agency securities and corporate debt securities with original
maturities of greater than three months but less than one year when purchased. Government and agency securities and corporate
debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value using the specific identification method. Unrealized
gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of related
estimated tax provisions or benefits.

Long-term investments include corporate debt securities, government and agency securities and cost method investments with
maturities exceeding one year. Corporate debt securities and government and agency securities are classified as available-for-sale
and are reported at fair value using the specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings and
reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of related estimated tax provisions or benefits.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

We elect to account for foreign currency denominated available-for-sale investments underlying funds receivable and customer
accounts, short-term investments and long-term investments under the fair value option as further discussed in “Note 5—Funds
Receivable and Customer Accounts” and “Note 6—Investments.” The changes in fair value related to initial measurement and
subsequent changes in fair value are included in earnings as a component of other income (expense), net.

Our cost method investments consist of investments in privately held companies where we do not have the ability to exercise
significant influence, or have control over the investee. These investments are recorded at cost and are subject to periodic tests
for other-than-temporary impairment.

We assess whether an other-than-temporary impairment loss on our investments has occurred due to declines in fair value or
other market conditions. If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we write down the investment to its fair value
and record the corresponding charge through other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income. With respect
to our debt securities, this assessment takes into account the severity and duration of the decline in value, our intent to sell the
security, whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and
whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security (that is, whether a credit loss exists).

Loans and interest receivable, held for sale
In November 2017, we reached an agreement to sell our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank. Historically,
this portfolio was reported as outstanding principal balances, net of any participation interest sold and pro-rata allowances,
including unamortized deferred origination costs and estimated collectible interest and fees. Upon approval of the decision to sell
these receivables from our Board of Directors, the portfolio was reclassified as held for sale, and recorded at the lower of cost or fair
value, determined on an aggregate basis. Following the closing of this transaction, which is expected to occur in the third quarter of
2018, Synchrony Bank will become the exclusive issuer of the PayPal Credit online consumer financing program in the U.S., and we
will no longer hold an ownership interest in the receivables generated through the program (other than charged off receivables).
This transaction will be accounted for as a sale, and the receivables will no longer be reported on our consolidated financial
statements.

Loans and interest receivable, held for sale, represents consumer receivables originated under PayPal credit consumer accounts
that are subject to the sale agreement with Synchrony Bank. Until the transaction with Synchrony Bank closes, we will continue to
work with independent chartered financial institutions to extend credit to U.S. consumers using our PayPal credit product. We
purchase the related receivables extended by an independent chartered financial institution and are responsible for the related
servicing functions. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we purchased approximately $8.7 billion and $7.4 billion,
respectively, in U.S. consumer credit receivables.

As part of the arrangements with the independent chartered financial institutions in the U.S., we sell back a participation interest
in the pool of consumer receivables outstanding under PayPal Credit consumer accounts. For this arrangement, gains or losses on
the sale of the participation interest are not material as the carrying amount of the participation interest sold approximates the
fair value at time of transfer. However, we have a separate arrangement with certain investors under which we sell to these
investors a participation interest in certain consumer loans receivable that we purchased where the consideration received
exceeds the carrying amount of the participation interest sold, which results in a gain reflected as net revenues in our consolidated
financial statements. The independent chartered financial institution and other investors have no recourse against us related to
their participation interests for failure of debtors to pay when due. The participation interests held by the chartered financial
institution and other investors have the same priority to the interests held by us and are subject to the same credit, prepayment,
and interest rate risk associated with this pool of consumer receivables. All risks of loss are shared pro rata based on participation
interests held among all participating stakeholders. We apply a control-oriented, financial-components approach and account for
the asset transfer as a sale and derecognize the portion of the participation interest for which control has been surrendered. In
connection with its purchase of our U.S. consumer credit receivable portfolio, Synchrony Bank has also agreed to acquire the
participation interests held in the pool of consumer receivables held by the chartered financial institution and other investors.

The terms of our consumer relationships require us to submit monthly bills to the consumer detailing loan repayment
requirements. The terms also allow us to charge the consumer interest and fees in certain circumstances. Due to the relatively
small dollar amount of individual loans and interest receivable, we do not require collateral on these balances.

Loans and interest receivable, net
Loans and interest receivable, net represents consumer loans not classified as held for sale and merchant receivables originated
under our PayPal Working Capital product and Swift merchant loan and advance products. In the U.S., we work with independent
chartered financial institutions that extend credit to the consumer or merchant using our PayPal Working Capital product and

2017 Annual Report

Part IV 65

PayPal Holdings, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Swift merchant loan product, and purchase the related receivables extended by the independent chartered financial institutions.
During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we purchased approximately $1.5 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, in credit
receivables.

For our consumer credit products outside the U.S., we extend credit through our Luxembourg banking subsidiary. For our
merchant credit products outside the U.S., we extend working capital advances in the U.K. through our Luxembourg banking
subsidiary, and we extend working capital loans in Australia through an Australian subsidiary.

As part of our arrangements with independent chartered financial institutions in the U.S., we sell back a participation interest in
the pool of merchant receivables outstanding under the PayPal Working Capital program for merchants. For this arrangement,
gains or losses on the sale of the participation interest are not material as the carrying amount of the participation interest sold
approximates the fair value at time of transfer. The independent chartered financial institution has no recourse against us related
to their participation interests for failure of debtors to pay when due. The participation interests held by the chartered financial
institution and other investors have the same priority to the interests held by us and are subject to the same credit, prepayment,
and interest rate risk associated with this pool of merchant receivables. All risks of loss are shared pro rata based on participation
interests held among all participating stakeholders. We apply a control-oriented, financial-components approach and account for
the asset transfer as a sale and derecognize the portion of the participation interest for which control has been surrendered.

Loans, advances, interest and fees receivable are reported at their outstanding principal balances, net of any participation interest
sold and pro-rata allowances, including unamortized deferred origination costs and estimated collectible interest and fees. We
maintain the servicing rights for the entire pool of consumer and merchant receivables outstanding and receive a fee
approximating the fair value for servicing the assets underlying the participation interest sold.

Allowance for loans and interest receivable
In connection with the pending sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables to Synchrony Bank, and the designation of that
portfolio as held for sale, we reversed the corresponding allowances against those loans and interest receivable balances. Such
allowances on any newly originated U.S. consumer loans and interest receivables held for sale will not be established. Adjustments
to the cost basis of this portfolio, which are primarily driven by charge-offs, will be recorded in restructuring and other charges in
our consolidated statement of income.

The allowance for loans and interest receivable represents management’s estimate of incurred losses inherent in our portfolio of
loans and receivables, net. Increases to the allowance for loans receivables are reflected as transaction and loan losses in our
consolidated financial statements. The evaluation process to assess the adequacy of allowances is subject to numerous estimates
and judgments.

For our consumer loans receivable not classified as held for sale, the allowance is primarily based on forecasted principal balance
delinquency rates (“roll rates”). Roll rates are the percentage of balances which we estimate will migrate from one stage of
delinquency to the next based on our historical experience, as well as external factors such as estimated bankruptcies and levels of
unemployment. Roll rates are applied to the principal amount of our consumer receivables for each stage of delinquency, from
current to 180 days past the payment due date, in order to estimate the principal loans which have incurred losses and are
probable to be charged off.

For merchant loans and advances receivable, the allowance is primarily based on principal balances, forecasted delinquency rates
and recoveries through the use of a vintage-based loss forecasting model. The determination of delinquency, from current to 180
days past due, for principal balances related to merchant receivables outstanding is based on the current expected repayment
period of the loan or advance and interest or fixed fee as compared to the original expected repayment period.

For PayPal Working Capital loans and advances, we calculate the repayment rate based on the merchant’s expected future
payment volume such that repayment of the advance and fixed fee is typically expected to occur within 9 to 12 months from the
date of the advance. On a regular basis, we recalculate the repayment period based on the actual repayment activity on the
receivable. As such, actual repayment periods are dependent on actual payment processing volumes.

The allowance for loss against interest receivable is primarily determined by applying historical average customer account roll rates
to the interest receivable balance in each stage of delinquency to project the value of accounts that have incurred losses and are
probable to be charged off. The allowance for fees receivable is primarily based on fee balances, forecasted delinquency rates and
recoveries through the use of a vintage-based loss forecasting model. Increases to the allowance for interest receivable are
reflected as a reduction of net revenues in our consolidated statement of income. Increases to the allowance for fees receivable are
recognized as a reduction in deferred revenues included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.

Part IV

PayPal Holdings, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

We charge off consumer loan receivable balances in the month in which a customer balance becomes 180 days past the payment
due date. We charge off PayPal Working Capital merchant receivable when the updated repayment period is 180 days past the
original expected repayment period and the merchant has not made a payment in the last 60 days. We also charge off the PayPal
Working Capital merchant receivable when the updated repayment period is 360 days past the original expected repayment
period regardless of whether or not the merchant has made a payment within the last 60 days. We charge off Swift merchant loans
and advances when the repayments are 180 days past our expectation of repayments.

Bankrupt accounts are charged off within 60 days after receipt of notification of bankruptcy. Consumer loans receivable past the
payment due date continue to accrue interest until such time as they are charged off. Charge-offs that are recovered are recorded
as a reduction to our allowance for loans and interest receivable.

Customer accounts
We hold all customer balances, both in the U.S. and internationally, as direct claims against us which are reflected on our
consolidated balance sheet as a liability classified as amounts due to customers. Certain jurisdictions where PayPal operates
require us to hold eligible liquid assets, as defined by the regulators in these jurisdictions, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate
amount of all customer balances. Therefore, we use the assets underlying the customer balances to meet these regulatory
requirements and separately classify the assets as customer accounts in our consolidated balance sheet. We classify the assets
underlying the customer balances as current based on their purpose and availability to fulfill our direct obligation under amounts
due to customers.

In March 2016, as approved by management and our Luxembourg banking subsidiary Supervisory Board and as permitted within
regulations set forth by the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the “CSSF”), we designated
$800 million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used to extend credit to our
European customers. In the fourth quarter of 2017, an additional amount of $700 million of European customer balances held in
our Luxembourg banking subsidiary was approved and designated to be used to extend credit to our U.S. consumers. This is
consistent with our strategy of diversifying funding sources for our credit business and does not represent a change in our credit
business development strategy or risk appetite. These funds were classified as cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated
balance sheet on the date of designation and collectively represent approximately 30% of European customer balances potentially
available for corporate use by the Company at December 31, 2017 as determined by applying financial regulations maintained by
the CSSF. The remaining assets underlying the customer balances remain separately classified as customer accounts in our
consolidated balance sheet. We do not commingle these customer accounts with corporate funds and maintain these assets
separately in interest and non-interest bearing bank deposits, time deposits, corporate debt securities and U.S. and foreign
government and agency securities. See “Note 5—Funds Receivable and Customer Accounts” for additional information related to
customer accounts.

Accordingly, we have presented changes in funds receivable and customer accounts as cash flows from investing activities in our
consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature of the activity underlying our customer accounts. We have elected to
conform the prior year statement of cash flows to the current period presentation to provide comparability. The following table
presents the effects of the changes on the presentation of the statement of cash flows to the previously reported cash flows from
investing activities and cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended
December 31, 2015. These changes had no impact on the previously reported total net cash flows:

PayPal Holdings, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Funds receivable and funds payable
Funds receivable and funds payable arise due to the time required to initiate collection from and clear transactions through
external payment networks. When customers fund their account using their bank account or a credit card or debit card, or
withdraw funds from their PayPal account to their bank account or through a debit card transaction, there is a clearing period
before the cash is received or settled, usually one to three business days for U.S. transactions and generally up to five business
days for international transactions.

Property and equipment
Property and equipment consists primarily of computer equipment, software and website development costs, land and buildings
and leasehold improvements. Property and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation
and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets; generally, one to
three years for computer equipment and software, including capitalized software and website development costs, three years for
furniture and fixtures, up to thirty years for buildings and building improvements, and the shorter of five years or the
non-cancelable term of the lease for leasehold improvements.

Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill is tested for impairment at a minimum on an annual basis. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by
first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is
less than its carrying value. If the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment, then the reporting unit’s carrying value
is compared to its fair value. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The
fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using income and market approaches. The discounted cash flow method, a form of the
income approach, uses expected future operating results and a market participant discount rate. The market approach uses
comparable company prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions (either publicly traded entities or
mergers and acquisitions) to develop pricing metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results of the
reporting unit. Failure to achieve these expected results, changes in the discount rate or market pricing metrics, may cause a
future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level. We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of August 31,
2017 and 2016. We determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill of our reporting unit was required. As of
December 31, 2017, we determined that no events occurred or circumstances changed from August 31, 2017 through December 31,
2017 that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount.

Intangible assets consist of customer-related intangible assets, marketing related intangibles, developed technologies and other
intangible assets including purchased partner relationships, purchased technology, patents and contractual agreements. Intangible
assets are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line method and estimated useful lives ranging from
one to eight years. No significant residual value is estimated for intangible assets.

Impairment of long-lived assets
We evaluate long-lived assets (including intangible assets) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount
exceeds the future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate.

Allowance for transaction losses and negative customer balances
We are exposed to transaction losses due to credit card and other payment misuse as well as nonperformance of and credit losses
from sellers who accept payments through PayPal. We establish an allowance for estimated losses arising from processing
customer transactions, such as chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchant-related chargebacks due to
non-delivery of goods or services, Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) returns, buyer protection program claims, account
takeovers, and account overdrafts. This allowance represents an accumulation of the estimated amounts necessary to provide for
transaction losses incurred as of the reporting date, including those which we have not yet identified. The allowance is monitored
regularly and is updated based on actual claims data reported by our claims processors and other actual data received. The
allowance is based on known facts and circumstances, internal factors including experience with similar cases, historical trends
involving loss payment patterns, and the mix of transaction and loss types. Additions to the allowance are reflected as transaction
and loan losses in our consolidated statement of income. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the allowance for transaction losses
totaled $92 million and $78 million, respectively, and was included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our
consolidated balance sheet.

Negative customer balances occur primarily when there are insufficient funds in a customer’s PayPal account to cover charges
applied for ACH returns, debit card transactions, merchant-related chargebacks due to nondelivery or unsatisfactory delivery of
goods or services. Negative balances can be cured by the customer by adding funds to the account, receiving payments, or through
back-up funding sources. We also utilize third-party collection agents. For negative customer balances that are not expected to be

cured or otherwise collected, we provide an allowance for uncollectible accounts. The allowance is estimated based on known facts
and circumstances, internal factors including our experience with similar cases, and historical trends involving collection and
write-off patterns. Negative customer balances are included in other current assets, net of the allowance in our consolidated
balance sheet. Adjustments to the allowance for negative customer balances are recorded as a component of transaction and loan
loss in our consolidated statement of income. The allowance for negative customer balances was $174 million and $144 million at
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Derivative instruments
We have significant international revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies, subjecting our operations to foreign
currency risk. We enter into foreign currency exchange contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges, generally with maturities of
18 months or less, to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenue denominated in certain foreign
currencies. All outstanding derivatives are recognized in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value. The effective portion of the
designated derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is
subsequently reclassified into the financial statement line item in which the hedged item is recorded in the period the forecasted
transaction affects earnings.

We also hedge our economic exposure to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities with foreign currency
contracts. The gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts economically offset transaction gains and losses on certain
foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities recognized in earnings. Accordingly, these outstanding
non-designated derivatives are recognized in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value, and changes in fair value from these
contracts are recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of income. Our hedging program is not
designed or operated for trading or speculative purposes.

We report cash flows arising from derivative instruments consistent with the classification of cash flows from the underlying
hedged items that these derivatives are hedging. Accordingly, the cash flows associated with derivatives designated as cash flow
hedges and our non-designated derivatives that hedge foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are classified
in cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.

Our derivative instruments expose us to credit risk to the extent counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the
agreements. We seek to mitigate this risk by limiting counterparties to major financial institutions, by spreading the risk across
several major financial institutions and by entering into collateral security arrangements. In addition, the potential risk of loss with
one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. See “Note 8—Derivative Instruments”
for additional information related to the derivative instruments.

Fair value of financial instruments
Our financial assets and liabilities are valued using market prices on both active markets (Level 1) and less active markets (Level 2).
Level 1 instrument valuations are obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical
assets. Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical
instruments in less active markets, or models using market observable inputs. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we did not have
any assets or liabilities requiring measurement at fair value without observable market values that would require a high level of
judgment to determine fair value (Level 3). Our financial instruments, including cash, time deposits, accounts receivable, loans and
interest receivable, loans and interest receivable held for sale, funds receivable, certain customer accounts, accounts payable, notes
payable, and funds payable and amounts due to customers are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value due to the
short-term maturity of these instruments.

Concentrations of risk
Our cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, loans and interest receivable, and funds receivable and customer accounts are
potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Cash, cash equivalents and customer accounts are placed with financial
institutions that management believes are of high credit quality. In addition, funds receivable are generated primarily with financial
institutions or credit card companies which management believes are of high credit quality. We invest our cash, cash equivalents
and customer accounts primarily in highly liquid, highly rated instruments which are uninsured. From time to time, we may also
have corporate deposit balances with financial services institutions which exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(“FDIC”) insurance limit of $250,000. As part of our cash management process, we perform periodic evaluations of the relative
credit standing of these financial institutions. Our accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned from customers located in
the U.S. and internationally. Our loans and interest receivable are derived from consumer and merchant financing activities for
customers located in the U.S. and internationally. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, one customer accounted for 16% and 24% of

2017 Annual Report

Part IV 69

PayPal Holdings, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

net accounts receivables, respectively. No customer accounted for more than 10% of net loans receivable as of December 31, 2017
and 2016. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, no customer accounted for more than 10% of net revenues.
During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we earned approximately 20%, 22%, and 26% of revenue from
customers on eBay’s Marketplaces platform. No other source of revenue represented more than 10% of our revenue.

Revenue recognition
We earn net revenues primarily from fees charged to customers on the volume of activity processed through our Payments
Platform. Net transaction revenues resulting from a payment processing transaction are recognized once the transaction is
complete. Based on historical experience, specified credits are made at the time revenue is recognized and recorded as a reduction
to revenue. In certain circumstances, we are required to record payments to a customer as a reduction to revenue. These
payments to customers primarily originate from certain customer acquisition arrangements.

We also earn net revenues from other value added services, including interest and fees earned on our loans and interest receivable,
net and held for sale portfolio, subscription fees, gateway fees, gain on sale of participation interest in certain consumer loans
receivable and merchant loans and advances, revenue share we earn through partnerships, interest earned on certain PayPal
customer account balances, fees earned through our Paydiant products and other services that we provide to our consumers and
merchants. Net revenues earned from other value added services are recognized over the period services are performed and when
amounts are deemed to be fixed or determinable. Interest and fees earned on our portfolio of loans and advances receivable are
computed and recognized based on contractual interest and fee rates, and are net of any required reserves and amortization of
deferred origination costs.

Advertising expense
We expense the cost of producing advertisements at the time production occurs and expense the cost of communicating
advertisements in the period during which the advertising space or airtime is used as sales and marketing expense. Online
advertising expenses are recognized based on the terms of the individual agreements, which is generally over the greater of the
ratio of the number of impressions delivered over the total number of contracted impressions, on a pay-per-click basis, or on a
straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Advertising expense totaled $438 million, $350 million and $303 million for the
years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.

Internal use software and website development costs
Direct costs incurred to develop software for internal use and website development costs are capitalized and amortized generally
over an estimated useful life of one to three years and are recorded as depreciation and amortization. PayPal capitalized
$309 million and $341 million of internally developed software and website development costs for the years ended December 31,
2017 and 2016, respectively. Amortization expense for these capitalized costs was $262 million, $208 million and $166 million for
the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Costs related to the maintenance of internal use software and
website development costs are expensed as incurred.

Defined contribution savings plans
We have a defined contribution savings plan in the U.S. which qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the
“Code”). Our non-U.S. employees are covered by other savings plans. Expenses related to our defined contribution savings plans
are recorded when services are rendered by our employees.

Stock-based compensation
Prior to the separation, our employees participated in eBay’s equity incentive plans, including stock options, restricted stock units
and performance-based restricted stock units and the employee stock purchases made under eBay’s employee stock purchase
plan.

All awards granted under these plans consisted of eBay common shares. Our consolidated statement of income reflected
compensation expense for these stock-based plans associated with the portion of eBay’s incentive plans in which our employees
participated as well as an allocation of stock-based compensation of certain employees of eBay who provided general and
administrative services on our behalf.

Upon separation, outstanding awards granted to PayPal employees under eBay’s equity incentive plans were converted into PayPal
awards under PayPal’s equity incentive plans based on a conversion ratio. This conversion ratio was determined as the closing
per-share price of eBay shares on the last regular trading session prior to separation divided by the opening per-share price of
PayPal shares on the first regular trading session after separation. There was no significant incremental stock-based compensation
expense recorded as a result of the share conversions.

70

Part IV

PayPal Holdings, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

For periods up to separation, we determined compensation expense associated with restricted stock units based on the fair value
of eBay’s common stock on the date of grant. Following separation, we determine compensation expense associated with
restricted stock units based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. We determine compensation expense
associated with stock options based on the estimated grant date fair value method using the Black-Scholes valuation model. We
generally recognize compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method over the respective vesting period for awards
that are ultimately expected to vest. Accordingly, stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016
and 2015 has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. When estimating forfeitures, we consider voluntary termination behavior of
our employees as well as trends of actual option forfeitures.

Foreign currency
Most of our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency of their respective countries as their functional currency. Assets and
liabilities of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the
balance sheet dates. Revenues, costs and expenses of our non-U.S. subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S.
dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using daily exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from these translations are recorded as
a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses from the remeasurement of foreign currency
transactions are recognized as other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of income.

Income taxes
We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for
the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the
financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of
enacted tax laws; the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. If necessary, the measurement of deferred
tax assets is reduced by the amount of any tax benefits that are not expected to be realized based on available evidence. We
report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

Net income per share
Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per
share for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
for the period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share for the year
ended December 31, 2015 was based on the number of common shares distributed on July 17, 2015 for the period prior to
distribution and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period beginning after the distribution date.
On July 17, 2015, the distribution date, eBay stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2015 received one share of
PayPal common stock for every share of eBay common stock held as of the record date. Diluted net income per share is computed
by dividing net income for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive
common stock outstanding for the period. The dilutive effect of outstanding options and equity incentive awards is reflected in
diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method. The calculation of diluted net income per share excludes
all anti-dilutive common shares.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. This
new standard will replace all current GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminate all industry-specific guidance. The new revenue
recognition guidance provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a
company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In 2015, the FASB deferred
the effective date to fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. In 2016, the
FASB updated the guidance for reporting revenue gross versus net to improve the implementation guidance on principal versus
agent considerations, and for identifying performance obligations and the accounting of intellectual property licenses. In addition,
the FASB introduced practical expedients and made narrow scope improvements to the new accounting guidance. We have
evaluated the impact of this new standard and have concluded that our financial statements will not be materially impacted upon
adoption; however, we will expand certain disclosures as required. We will adopt the guidance on January 1, 2018 on a full
retrospective basis, reflecting the application of the new standard in each prior reporting period.

In 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. This
new standard makes limited amendments to the guidance in GAAP by requiring equity investments to be measured at fair value
with changes in fair value recognized in net income. This new standard also amends the presentation of certain fair value changes

2017 Annual Report

Part IV 71

PayPal Holdings, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

for financial liabilities measured at fair value and it amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of
financial instruments. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted in limited situations. We are required to apply the new guidance on a modified
retrospective basis to all outstanding instruments, with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption and on a
prospective basis to all outstanding equity investments without a readily determinable fair value. We will adopt the guidance on
January 1, 2018 and prospectively apply the measurement alternative to our cost method investments, which will require us to
measure these equity investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price
changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer. The amount of the impact to long-term
investments will depend on any price changes observed after adoption on January 1, 2018.

In 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to accounting for leases, which will require lessees to recognize lease
assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms greater than 12
months. As we are not a lessor, other changes in the standard applicable to lessors do not apply. The standard is effective for fiscal
years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt the
new standard January 1, 2019, using a modified retrospective basis and anticipate applying the optional practical expedients related
to the transition. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on our financial statements.

In 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. Credit losses on loans, trade
and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities and other instruments will reflect our current estimate of the expected
credit losses that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. Credit losses on available-for-sale debt
securities with unrealized losses will be recognized as allowances for credit losses limited to the amount by which fair value is below
amortized cost. Additional disclosures will be required, including information used to track credit quality by year of origination for
most financing receivables. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are required to apply this standard’s provisions as a cumulative effect
adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted with impairment
of available-for-sale debt securities applied prospectively after adoption. We are evaluating the impact and approach to adopting
this new accounting guidance on our financial statements.

In 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on classifying certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows. The
new guidance addresses the classification of cash flows related to: debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of
zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the
effective interest rate of the borrowing, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the
settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance, including bank-owned life
insurance, distributions received from equity method investees and beneficial interests in securitization transactions. The
guidance also clarifies how the predominance principle should be applied when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of
more than one class of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The guidance should be applied retrospectively after adoption.
The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.

In 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on restricted cash on the statement of cash flows. The new guidance requires the
classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. Therefore,
amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents
when reconciling the beginning and ending balances shown on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal
years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The
guidance should be applied retrospectively after adoption. The adoption of this standard will require changes in cash and cash
equivalents underlying customer accounts and restricted cash to be included in the reconciliation of beginning and ending
balances shown on the statement of cash flows.

In 2017, the FASB issued new guidance clarifying the scope and application of the de-recognition of non-financial assets and the
sale or transfer of non-financial assets, including partial sales. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. Either of the following transition
methods is permitted: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the new standard in each prior reporting period,
or (ii) a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the
year the new standard is first applied. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial
statements.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

In 2017, the FASB issued new guidance that requires certain premiums on callable debt securities to be amortized to the earliest
call date. The amortization period for callable debt securities purchased at a discount will not be impacted. Therefore, the new
standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early
adoption permitted. Transition is on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of
the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. We are evaluating the impact this new accounting
guidance will have on our financial statements.

In 2017, the FASB issued new guidance clarifying which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award
require an entity to apply modification accounting. Specifically, an entity would apply modification accounting only if the fair value,
vesting conditions, or classification of the awards changes as a result of changes in the terms or conditions. The new standard is
effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption
permitted. The guidance will be applied prospectively upon adoption. The amount of the impact to share-based compensation
expense will depend on the terms specified in any new changes to the share-based payment awards.

In 2017, the FASB issued new guidance intended to better align the results of hedge accounting with an entity’s risk management
activities. This guidance updates the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships by expanding
hedge accounting for both nonfinancial and financial risk components and by refining the measurement of hedge results to better
reflect an entity’s hedging strategies. The amendments will also align the recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedge
results in the financial statements to increase the understandability of the results of an entity’s intended hedging strategies.
Additionally, the guidance includes certain targeted improvements to ease the operational burden of applying hedge accounting.
The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with
early adoption permitted. We are required to apply the guidance with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of
the beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is adopted and prospectively apply the presentation and disclosure guidance.
We will early adopt the guidance in the first quarter of 2018 using a modified retrospective approach to reflect application of the
new guidance effective January 1, 2018. Adoption of the guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.

Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance
In 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance to simplify the analysis for embedded derivatives. The new guidance clarifies
that when assessing whether a contingent put or call option qualifies as a separate derivative from the host contract (e.g., the debt
instrument), the nature of the exercise contingency would be excluded from the assessment. We adopted the new guidance
effective January 1, 2017. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

In 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on investments that qualify for the equity method of accounting as a result of
an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. The new guidance eliminates the requirement for
retrospective adjustment of the investment, results of operations and retained earnings as if the equity method had been in effect
during all the previous periods that the investment had been held. Instead, under the new guidance, the cost of acquiring the
additional interest in the investee would be added to the current basis of the previously held interest and equity method
accounting would be adopted as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. We adopted the new
guidance effective January 1, 2017. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

In 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on the accounting for share-based payment compensation. The new guidance makes
amendments to the following areas: accounting for income taxes upon vesting or settlement of awards, presentation of excess tax
benefits or tax deficiencies on the statement of cash flows, accounting for forfeitures, minimum statutory withholding
requirements and presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares to
meet minimum statutory withholding requirements. We adopted the new guidance effective January 1, 2017. As a result of the
adoption, starting in the first quarter of 2017, stock-based compensation (“SBC”) excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies are
reflected in the consolidated statement of income within the provision for income taxes rather than in the consolidated balance
sheet within additional paid-in capital. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized approximately $52 million of SBC net
excess tax benefits within the provision for income taxes. Additionally, starting in the first quarter of 2017, we presented the cash
flows related to the applicable SBC net excess tax benefits in operating activities along with other income tax cash flows rather
than in financing activities. The remaining amendments did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

In 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other
than inventory. The new guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset,
other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. Adoption of the new guidance must be made on a modified retrospective basis.
We elected to early adopt the new guidance effective January 1, 2017. As a result of the adoption, we recorded a decrease of
approximately $41 million in retained earnings as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2017, with a corresponding decrease in

2017 Annual Report

Part IV 73

PayPal Holdings, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

prepaid taxes related to the unamortized tax expense attributed to intra-entity transfers of assets previously deferred.
Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2017 we did not recognize approximately $16 million of amortization of prepaid taxes
attributed to prior period intra-entity asset transfers previously deferred within the provision for income taxes. As of adoption,
when a new intra-entity transfer of assets occurs, we will recognize the income tax consequences associated with this activity in
the consolidated statement of income in the period the transaction takes place. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we
recognized $44 million of income tax expense associated with intra-entity asset transfers which occurred during the period.

In 2017, the FASB issued new guidance to clarify the definition of a business to assist companies with evaluating whether
transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses. The new guidance requires a company to evaluate if
substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group
of similar identifiable assets; if so, the set of assets and activities is not a business. The guidance also requires a business to include
at least one substantive process and narrows the definition of outputs by more closely aligning it with how outputs are described
in the guidance for revenue from contracts with customers. The guidance should be applied prospectively to any transactions
occurring within the period of adoption. We elected to early adopt the new guidance effective January 1, 2017. The adoption of this
standard did not have an impact on our financial statements.

In 2017, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the accounting for goodwill impairment. The guidance simplifies the
measurement of goodwill impairment by removing step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires the determination of the
fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit. The new guidance requires goodwill impairment to be measured as
the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the
total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. We have
elected to early adopt the new guidance for our annual goodwill impairment test to be performed after January 1, 2017. The
adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

In 2017, the FASB issued guidance that requires a company to evaluate the appropriate financial statement disclosures about the
potential material effects that the new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition, measurement of credit losses on
financial instruments and accounting for leases will have on its financial statements when adopted. If a company does not know or
cannot reasonably estimate the impact that adoption of these new standards is expected to have on the financial statements,
then in addition to making a statement to that effect, the company should consider additional qualitative disclosures to assist the
reader in assessing the significance of the impact that these new guidance standards will have on the financial statements when
adopted. We have considered the guidance and, where possible, have added additional qualitative disclosures on the potential
impact to our financial statements.

Note 3—Business Combinations
During 2017, we completed two acquisitions, reflecting 100% of the equity interests of the acquired companies, for an aggregate
purchase price of $421 million:

TIO NETWORKS CORP.
We completed the acquisition of TIO Networks Corp. (“TIO”) in July 2017 by acquiring all of the outstanding shares of TIO for $2.64
per share in cash. We acquired TIO to expand our scale of operations, complement our product portfolio, and to help accelerate
our entry into bill payments. The total purchase price of $238 million consisted of cash consideration. The allocation of purchase
consideration resulted in approximately $66 million of technology and customer-related intangible assets with an estimated useful
life of 1 to 5 years, net assets of approximately $2 million and initial goodwill of approximately $170 million, which is attributable to
the workforce of TIO and the synergies expected to arise from the acquisition. We do not expect goodwill to be deductible for
income tax purposes. The allocation of the purchase price for this acquisition has been prepared on a preliminary basis and
changes to the allocation to certain assets, liabilities and tax estimates may occur as additional information becomes available.

In November 2017, we suspended the operations of TIO to protect customer data as part of an ongoing investigation of security
vulnerabilities of the TIO platform. Refer to Note 4—”Goodwill and Intangible Assets” and Note 13—“Commitments and
Contingencies” for further details.

SWIFT FINANCIAL CORPORATION
We completed the acquisition of Swift Financial Corporation (“Swift Financial”) in September 2017 by acquiring all of the
outstanding shares for a total purchase price of approximately $183 million. We acquired Swift Financial to enable us to enhance
our underwriting capabilities and strengthen our business financing offerings, helping us to deepen relationships with our existing
merchants and expand services to new merchants. The allocation of purchase consideration resulted in approximately $44 million
of technology and customer-related intangible assets with an estimated useful life of 1 to 3 years, $169 million of merchant
receivables, net liabilities of approximately $136 million and initial goodwill of approximately $106 million, which is attributable to
the workforce of Swift Financial and the synergies expected to arise from the acquisition. We do not expect goodwill to be
deductible for income tax purposes. The gross contractual merchant receivables acquired were approximately $213 million.
Management estimates that the cash collected will approximate the contractual amounts of merchant receivables. The allocation
of the purchase price for this acquisition has been prepared on a preliminary basis and changes to the allocation to certain assets,
liabilities and tax estimates may occur as additional information becomes available.

We have included the financial results of these acquired businesses in our consolidated financial statements from their respective
date of acquisition. Revenues and expenses related to these acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2017 were not material.
Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effect of these acquisitions were not material to our financial
results.

There were no acquisitions or divestitures completed in 2016.

During 2015, we completed four acquisitions, reflecting 100% of the equity interests of the acquired companies, for an aggregate
amount of $1.4 billion. During 2016, we finalized the allocation of the purchase consideration for Xoom, Paydiant, CyActive and one
other acquisition, which resulted in a $10 million adjustment to goodwill, primarily related to Xoom.

Xoom
We completed the acquisition of Xoom Corporation (“Xoom”) in November 2015 by acquiring all of the outstanding shares of
Xoom for $25 per share in cash. We acquired Xoom to offer a broader range of services to our global customer base, increase
customer engagement and accelerate our entrance into the international remittances markets. The total purchase price of $1.1
billion included cash consideration paid of approximately $961 million, net of cash acquired of $92 million, and the fair value of
assumed unvested equity totaling $7 million.

The intangibles acquired consists primarily of partner relationships, technology, trade name and customer-related intangible
assets, with an estimated useful life of 2 to 5 years. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill which is attributable to the workforce of Xoom and the synergies
expected to arise from the acquisition. We do not expect goodwill to be deductible for income tax purposes.

Paydiant
We completed the acquisition of Paydiant, Inc. (“Paydiant”) in April 2015 for total consideration of approximately $230 million, net
of cash acquired. We acquired Paydiant to expand our capabilities in mobile payments. The allocation of purchase consideration
resulted in approximately $49 million of technology and customer-related intangible assets, net liabilities of approximately
$6 million, and initial goodwill of approximately $187 million. We do not expect goodwill to be deductible for income tax purposes.

CyActive
We completed the acquisition of CyActive Security, Ltd. (“CyActive”) in April 2015 for total consideration of approximately
$43 million, net of cash acquired. We acquired CyActive to further enhance our information security capabilities. The allocation of
purchase consideration resulted in approximately $8 million of technology-related intangible assets, net liabilities of approximately
$2 million, and initial goodwill of approximately $37 million. We do not expect goodwill to be deductible for income tax purposes.

We have included the financial results of these acquired businesses in our consolidated financial statements from their respective
dates of acquisition. Revenues and expenses related to these acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2015 were not material.
Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effect of these acquisitions were not material to our financial

All identifiable intangible assets are subject to amortization and no significant residual value is estimated for the intangible assets.
Amortization expense for intangible assets was $126 million, $150 million and $93 million for the years ended December 31, 2017,
2016 and 2015, respectively. We test intangible assets for recoverability when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of an asset group may not be recoverable.

As a result of the suspension of TIO’s operations announced in November 2017, we performed a test for recoverability of the
customer-related intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of TIO in July 2017. The test involved comparing the
intangible assets’ carrying values to their future net undiscounted cash flows that we expected would be generated by the
intangible assets. Based on the results of this test, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $30 million in depreciation
and amortization in our consolidated statement of income, which was measured as the excess of carrying value over the estimated
fair value of the assets. The calculation of the estimated fair value of these customer-related intangible assets is based on the
income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology. Following recognition of the impairment charge, we will amortize
the adjusted carrying amount of those assets over their remaining useful life. We also determined that the suspension of TIO’s
operations did not indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit the TIO goodwill was assigned to would be below its carrying
amount.

Expected future intangible asset amortization as of December 31, 2017 is as follows:

We elect to account for certain investments within customer accounts, including foreign-currency denominated available-for-sale
investments, under the fair value option. As a result, any gains and losses from fair value changes on such investments are
recognized in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statement of income. Election of the fair value option allows us to
significantly reduce the accounting asymmetry that would otherwise arise when recognizing the changes in the fair value
of available-for-sale investments and the corresponding foreign exchange gains and losses relating to customer liabilities. At
December 31, 2017 and 2016, the estimated fair value of our investments included within funds receivable and customer accounts
under the fair value option was $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. In the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016,
$176 million of net gains and $66 million of net losses from fair value changes, respectively, were recognized in other income
(expense), net on the consolidated statement of income.

The aggregate fair value of investments in an unrealized loss position was $6.0 billion and $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2017 and
December 31, 2016, respectively. The aggregate gross unrealized loss on our short-term and long-term investments was not
material as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. We believe the decline in value is due to temporary market conditions
and expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the securities. We neither intend nor anticipate the need to sell the
securities before recovery. We will continue to monitor the performance of the investment portfolio and assess market and
interest rate risk when evaluating whether other-than-temporary impairment exists.

Our financial assets and liabilities are valued using market prices on both active markets (Level 1) and less active markets (Level 2).
Level 1 instrument valuations are obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical
assets. Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical
instruments in less active markets, or models using market observable inputs.

A majority of our derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that take into account the contract terms as well as
multiple inputs where applicable, such as currency rates, interest rate yield curves, option volatility and equity prices. Our
derivative instruments are primarily short-term in nature, generally one month to one year in duration. Certain foreign currency
contracts designated as cash flow hedges may have a duration of up to 18 months.

We did not have any transfers of financial instruments between valuation levels during the years ended December 31, 2017 and
2016. As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any assets or liabilities requiring measurement at fair value without observable
market values that would require a high level of judgment to determine fair value (Level 3).

Cash and cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when
purchased and are comprised primarily of bank deposits, government and agency securities and commercial paper.

We elect to account for foreign currency denominated available-for-sale investments underlying funds receivable and customer
accounts, short-term investments and long-term investments under the fair value option as further discussed in “Note 5—Funds
Receivable and Customer Accounts” and “Note 6—Investments.”

Our financial instruments, including cash, time deposits, accounts receivable, loans and interest receivable, loans and interest
receivable held for sale, funds receivable, certain customer accounts, accounts payable, notes payable, and funds payable and
amounts due to customers are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value due to the short-term maturity of these
instruments. If these financial instruments were measured at fair value in the financial statements, cash would be classified as
Level 1, time deposits, certain customer accounts, and notes payable would be classified as Level 2, and the remaining financial
instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

Part IV

PayPal Holdings, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Note 8—Derivative Instruments
SUMMARY OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign
currency exchange rates. Our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that our counterparties may be unable to meet the
terms of the arrangement. We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to, and by spreading the risk across, major
financial institutions. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is
monitored on an ongoing basis.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS
We transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues and costs denominated in foreign
currencies, which subjects us to foreign currency risk. We have a foreign currency exposure management program whereby we
designate certain foreign currency exchange contracts, generally with maturities of 18 months or less, to reduce the volatility of
cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies. The objective of the foreign
exchange contracts is to help mitigate the risk that the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are adversely affected by changes in the
applicable U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate. These derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and
accordingly, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period the forecasted transaction affects
earnings. The ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts, if any, is recorded immediately in earnings.
We evaluate the effectiveness of our foreign exchange contracts on a quarterly basis by comparing the change in the fair value of
the derivative instruments with the change in the fair value of the forecasted cash flows of the hedged item. We do not use any
foreign exchange contracts for trading or speculative purposes.

For our derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the amounts recognized in earnings related to the ineffective
portion were not material in each of the periods presented, and we did not exclude any component of the changes in fair value of
the derivative instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015
we did not discontinue any cash flow hedges because it was probable that the original forecasted transaction would not occur and
as such, did not reclassify any gains or losses to earnings. As of December 31, 2017, we estimated that $111 million of net derivative
losses related to our cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings
within the next 12 months.

We have an additional foreign currency exposure management program whereby we use foreign exchange contracts to offset the
foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries.
These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency
exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are
recorded in other income (expense), net, which is offset by the gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts.

FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS
The fair value of our outstanding derivative instruments as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:

Derivative Assets:
Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges
Foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments

Total derivative assets

Derivative Liabilities:

MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS—RIGHTS OF SETOFF
Under master netting agreements with respective counterparties to our foreign exchange contracts, subject to applicable
requirements, we are allowed to net settle transactions of the same type with a single net amount payable by one party to the
other. However, we have elected to present the derivative assets and derivative liabilities on a gross basis in our consolidated
balance sheet. Rights of setoff associated with our foreign exchange contracts represented a potential offset to both assets and
liabilities by $56 million as of December 31, 2017 and $44 million as of December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31,
2017, we entered into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value
of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. We posted $38 million of collateral related to
our derivative liabilities as of December 31, 2017. This amount, which is recognized in other current assets on our consolidated
balance sheet, is related to the right to reclaim cash collateral. We did not post or receive any collateral related to our derivative
liabilities as of December 31, 2016.

NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS
Derivative transactions are measured in terms of the notional amount; however, this amount is not recorded on the balance sheet
and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of the derivative instruments. The notional amount is
generally not exchanged, but is used only as the underlying basis on which the value of foreign exchange payments under these
contracts is determined. The following table provides the notional amounts of our outstanding derivatives:

Note 10—Loans and Interest Receivable
LOANS AND INTEREST RECEIVABLE, HELD FOR SALE
In November 2017, we reached an agreement to sell our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank. Historically,
this portfolio was reported as outstanding principal balances, net of any participation interest sold and pro-rata allowances,
including unamortized deferred origination costs and estimated collectible interest and fees. Upon approval of our Board of
Directors to sell these receivables, the portfolio was reclassified as held for sale and recorded at the lower of cost or fair value,
determined on an aggregate basis. Due to the designation as held for sale, the associated allowance for this portfolio was reversed,
resulting in an increase of approximately $39 million in revenue from other value added services and a decrease of approximately
$283 million in transaction and loan losses in our consolidated statement of income. See “Note 1—Overview and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies” for additional information. As of December 31, 2017, the total outstanding balance in our held for
sale portfolio was $6.4 billion, net of the participation interest sold to an independent chartered financial institution and other
investors of $1.1 billion.

We use consumer FICO scores, where available, among other measures in evaluating the credit quality of our U.S. PayPal Credit
consumer receivables, held for sale. A FICO score is a type of credit score that lenders use to assess an applicant’s credit risk and
whether to extend credit. Individual FICO scores are generally obtained each quarter in which the U.S. consumer has an

2017 Annual Report

Part IV 85

outstanding consumer receivable that we own. The weighted average U.S. consumer FICO scores related to our loans and interest
receivable, held for sale balance outstanding at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were 680 and 679, respectively. The
Company has revised its weighted average U.S. consumer FICO score as of December 31, 2016 to conform to the current period
presentation.

As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, approximately 51.1% and 52.1%, respectively, of the pool of loans and interest
receivable, held for sale was due from U.S. consumers with FICO scores greater than or equal to 680, which is generally considered
“prime” by the consumer credit industry. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, approximately 11.7% and 11.1%,
respectively, of the pool of loans and interest receivable, held for sale was due from U.S. customers with FICO scores below 599.

LOANS AND INTEREST RECEIVABLE, NET

Consumer receivables
We offer credit products to consumers who choose PayPal Credit as their funding source at checkout. As of December 31, 2017, the
outstanding balance in our pool of consumer receivables that excludes amounts classified as held for sale and consists of loans and
interest receivable due from international consumer accounts was $326 million. As of December 31, 2016, the outstanding balance
in our pool of consumer receivables was $5.1 billion, which includes receivables due from both U.S. and international consumers as
the U.S. consumer receivables were not designated as held for sale as of that date.

We closely monitor credit quality for our international consumer receivables to manage and evaluate our related exposure to credit
risk. Credit risk management begins with initial underwriting and continues through to full repayment of a loan. To assess a
consumer who requests a loan, we use, among other indicators, internally developed risk models using detailed information from
external sources such as credit bureaus where available and internal historical experience including the consumer’s prior
repayment history with PayPal Credit products as well as other measures. We use delinquency status and trends to assist in

The following tables present the delinquency status of the principal amount of consumer loans and interest receivable. The
amounts shown below are based on the number of days past the billing date to the consumer. Current represents balances that
are within 30 days of the billing date. Amounts as of December 31, 2017 represent loans and interest receivable due from consumer
accounts excluding amounts classified as held for sale, of which approximately 96.0% were current. Amounts as of December 31,

(1) Includes allowance related to loans and interest receivable, held for sale portfolio prior to its designation as held for sale.
(2) Includes approximately $50 million of U.S. consumer receivables not designated as held for sale that are fully reserved and are expected to be charged off.

The tables above exclude receivables from other consumer credit products of $55 million and $16 million at December 31, 2017 and
2016, respectively, and allowances of $7 million and $3 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The provision for loan losses relating to our international consumer loans receivable portfolio is recognized in transaction and loan
losses. The provision for interest receivable on the interest and fees earned on our international consumer loans receivable
portfolio is recognized in net revenues from other value added services as a reduction in revenue.

Merchant receivables
We offer credit products to certain existing small and medium-sized merchants through our PayPal Working Capital product and,
subsequent to our acquisition of Swift in late September 2017, Swift business loan and advance products. As of December 31, 2017,
the total outstanding balance in our pool of merchant loans, advances, interest and fees receivable was $1.01 billion, net of the

2017 Annual Report

participation interest sold to an independent chartered financial institution. As of December 31, 2016, the total outstanding
balance in our pool of merchant loans, advances, interest and fees receivable was $558 million. See “Note 1—Overview and
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for additional information on this participation arrangement.

PayPal Working Capital receivables
As of December 31, 2017, the total outstanding balance in our pool of PayPal Working Capital loans, advances and fees receivable
was $703 million, net of the related participation interest sold to an independent chartered financial institution of $28 million. As of
December 31, 2016, the total outstanding balance in our pool of working capital loans, advances and fees receivable was
$558 million.

Through our PayPal Working Capital product, merchants can borrow a certain percentage of their annual payment volume
processed by PayPal and are charged a fixed fee for the loan or advance, which targets an annual percentage rate based on the
overall credit assessment of the merchant. Loans and advances are repaid through a fixed percentage of the merchant’s future
payment volume that PayPal processes. The fee is fixed at the time the loan or advance is extended and recognized as deferred
revenues included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. The fixed fee is amortized to net revenues from
other value added services based on the amount repaid over the repayment period. We estimate the repayment period based on
the merchant’s payment processing history with PayPal. There is no stated interest rate. There is a general requirement that at
least 10% of the original amount of the loan or advance plus the fixed fee must be repaid every 90 days. We calculate the
repayment rate of the merchant’s future payment volume so that repayment of the loan or advance and fixed fee is expected to
generally occur within 9 to 12 months from the date of the loan or advance. On a monthly basis, we recalculate the repayment
period based on the repayment activity on the receivable. As such, actual repayment periods are dependent on actual merchant
payment processing volumes. We actively monitor receivables with repayment periods greater than the original expected
repayment period.

We closely monitor credit quality for all working capital loans and advances that we extend or purchase to manage and evaluate
our related exposure to credit risk. To assess a merchant who requests a PayPal Working Capital loan or advance, we use, among
other indicators, an internally developed risk model that we refer to as our PayPal Working Capital Risk Model (“PRM”), as a credit
quality indicator to help predict the merchant’s ability to repay loans or advances. Primary drivers of the model include the
merchant’s annual payment volume and payment processing history with PayPal, prior repayment history with the PayPal
Working Capital product and other measures. Merchants are assigned a PRM score within the range of 350 to 750. We generally
expect that merchants to which we extend a working capital loan or advance will have PRM scores greater than 525. We generally
consider scores above 610 to be very good and to pose less credit risk. We assess the participating merchant’s PRM score on a
recurring basis for all outstanding working capital loans and advances owned by PayPal. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the
weighted average PRM score related to our PayPal Working Capital balances outstanding was 619 and 625, respectively.

Swift Merchant loans and advance receivables
As of December 31, 2017, the total outstanding balance in our pool of Swift merchant loans, advances, interest and fees receivable
was $309 million. Through our Swift merchant loan products, we provide merchants with access to short-term business financing
based on an evaluation of both the applying business as well as the business owner.

We closely monitor credit quality for all merchant loans and advances that we underwrite and issue, so that we can evaluate,
quantify, and manage our credit risk exposure. To assess a merchant seeking a loan or an advance, we use, among other indicators,
a risk model developed internally which utilizes information obtained from multiple data sources, both external and internal, to
predict the likelihood of timely and satisfactory repayment by the merchant of the loan or advance amount and the related

interest or fixed fee. Drivers of the model include elements sourced from consumer credit bureau and business credit bureau
reports, prior repayment history with our products where available, and other information obtained during the application process.
We use delinquency status and trends to assist in making new and ongoing credit decisions, adjusting our internal model, plan our
collection practices and strategies and in our determination of our allowance for these loans and advances.

Swift merchant loans and advances are collected by daily or weekly payments until the balance has been satisfied. The interest or
fee is fixed at the time the loan is extended and recognized as deferred revenues included in other current liabilities in our
consolidated balance sheet. The fixed interest or fee is amortized to net revenues from other value added services based on the
amount repaid over the repayment period. There is no stated interest rate and the terms are generally less than 12 months.

Merchant receivable delinquency and allowance
The following tables present our estimate of the principal amount of PayPal Working Capital and Swift business loans, advances,
interest and fees receivable past their original expected repayment period. In the second quarter of 2016, we refined our estimate
of the original expected repayment period for PayPal Working Capital loans and advances to take into account the variability in
repayment patterns. Prior period amounts have been updated to reflect this change.

For our PayPal Working Capital product, we charge off the receivable when the repayments are 180 days past our expectation of
repayments and the merchant has not made a payment in the last 60 days. We also charge off the receivable when the
repayments are 360 days past due regardless of whether or not the merchant has made a payment within the last 60 days. The
provision for loan losses relating to our PayPal Working Capital loans and advances is recognized in transaction and loan losses, and
the provisions for fees receivable is recognized in deferred revenues included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance
sheet as a reduction in deferred revenue.

For Swift merchant loans and advances, the determination of delinquency, from current to 180 days past due, is based on the
current expected repayment period of the loan or advance and fixed interest or fee payment as compared to the original expected
repayment period. We charge off the receivable when the repayments are 180 days past our expectation of repayments. Bankrupt
accounts are charged off within 60 days of receiving notification of bankruptcy. The provision for loan losses is recognized in
transaction and loan losses. Charge-offs that are recovered are recorded as a reduction to our allowance for loans and interest
receivable.

Net revenues earned from transaction revenues are attributed to U.S., U.K. and other countries primarily based upon the country
in which the merchant is located, or in the case of a cross-border transaction, may be earned from the country in which the
consumer and the merchant respectively reside. Net revenues earned from value added services are typically attributed to the
country in which either the customer or partner reside. Tangible long-lived assets for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016
consisted of property and equipment. Long-lived assets attributed to the U.S. and other countries are based upon the country in

Note 12—Notes Payable
In the fourth quarter of 2017, we entered into a credit agreement (“2017 Credit Agreement”) that provides for an unsecured
$3.0 billion, 364-day delayed-draw term loan credit facility, which is available in up to three borrowings. Borrowings and other
amounts payable under the 2017 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by PayPal, Inc. Subject to specified conditions, we may
designate one or more of our subsidiaries as additional borrowers under the 2017 Credit Agreement provided that we and PayPal,
Inc. guarantee all borrowings and other obligations of any such subsidiaries under the 2017 Credit Agreement. As of December 31,
2017, no subsidiaries were designated as additional borrowers. Funds borrowed under the 2017 Credit Agreement may be used for
capital allocation and other general corporate purposes. During the three months ended December 31, 2017, we effected a single

www.paypal.com

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

draw down of $1.0 billion under the 2017 Credit Agreement. The borrowing bears interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate
(“LIBOR”) of one month plus a margin of 1.125% resulting in a weighted average interest rate of 2.78%. As of December 31, 2017,
$1.0 billion was outstanding under the 2017 Credit Agreement. Accordingly, at December 31, 2017, $2.0 billion of borrowing capacity
was available for the purposes permitted by the 2017 Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.

The company maintains uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world, aggregating to approximately
$250 million. Interest rate terms for these facilities vary by region and reflect prevailing market rates for companies with strong
credit ratings. As of December 31, 2017, no amounts were outstanding under those facilities, and therefore, approximately
$250 million of borrowing capacity was available, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.

In the third quarter of 2015, we entered into a credit agreement (“2015 Credit Agreement”) that provides for an unsecured
$2.0 billion, five-year revolving credit facility that includes a $150 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $150 million swingline
sub-facility, with available borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the amount of any letters of credit and
swingline borrowings outstanding. Borrowings and other amounts payable under the 2015 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by
PayPal, Inc. We may also, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase the commitments under the revolving credit
facility by up to $500 million. Subject to specified conditions, we may designate one or more of our subsidiaries as additional
borrowers under the 2015 Credit Agreement provided that we and PayPal, Inc. guarantee all borrowings and other obligations of
any such subsidiaries under the 2015 Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2017, no subsidiaries were designated as additional
borrowers. Funds borrowed under the 2015 Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions
and other general corporate purposes. During the third quarter of 2017, we drew down $800 million under the 2015 Credit
Agreement, which was repaid during the fourth quarter of 2017. The borrowing bore interest at LIBOR of one month plus a margin
of 1.125% resulting in a weighted-average interest rate of 2.36% . As of December 31, 2017, no borrowings or letters of credit were
outstanding under the 2015 Credit Agreement. Accordingly, at December 31, 2017, $2.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available
for the purposes permitted by the 2015 Credit Agreement subject to customary conditions to borrowing.

Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies
COMMITMENTS
As of December 31, 2017, approximately $26.4 billion of unused credit was available to PayPal Credit account holders compared to
$28.8 billion of unused credit as of December 31, 2016. While this amount represents the total unused credit available, we have not
experienced, and do not anticipate, that all of our PayPal Credit account holders will access their entire available credit at any given
point in time. In addition, the individual lines of credit that make up this unused credit are subject to periodic review and
termination by the chartered financial institution that is the issuer of PayPal Credit products based on, among other things,
account usage and customer creditworthiness. When a consumer funds a purchase in the U.S. using a PayPal Credit product issued
by a chartered financial institution, the chartered financial institution extends credit to the consumer, funds the extension of
credit at the point of sale and advances funds to the merchant. We subsequently purchase the receivables related to the consumer
loans extended by the chartered financial institution and, as a result of such purchase, bear the risk of loss in the event of loan
defaults. Although the chartered financial institution continues to own each customer account, we own the related receivable
(excluding participation interests sold) and are responsible for all servicing functions related to the account. See “Note 1—
Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for additional information.

LEASE ARRANGEMENTS
We have lease obligations under certain non-cancelable operating leases. Our non-cancelable operating lease agreements typically
have terms between 3-10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. We recognize rent expense under such
agreements on a straight-line basis.

Future minimum rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases at December 31, 2017, are as follows:

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS

Overview
We are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings on an ongoing basis. Many of these proceedings are in early stages, and may
seek an indeterminate amount of damages. If we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can be reasonably
estimated, we accrue the estimated liability in our financial statements. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we
accrue an amount within the range that, in our judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that
range is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the low end of the range. For those proceedings in which an
unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable, we have disclosed an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or
range of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising directly from the
proceeding (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) are not material. If we cannot estimate the
probable or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from a legal proceeding, we have disclosed that fact. In assessing the
materiality of a legal proceeding, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary damages claimed, as well as the
potential impact of non-monetary remedies sought by plaintiffs (e.g., injunctive relief) that may require us to change our business
practices in a manner that could have a material adverse impact on our business. With respect to the matters disclosed in this
Note 13, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of such
non-monetary remedies.

Amounts accrued for legal and regulatory proceedings for which we believe a loss is probable were not material for the year ended
December 31, 2017. Except as otherwise noted for the proceedings described in this Note 13, we have concluded, based on
currently available information, that reasonably possible losses arising directly from the proceedings (i.e., monetary damages or
amounts paid in judgment or settlement) in excess of our recorded accruals are also not material. However, legal and regulatory
proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more matters were resolved against us
in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the impact on our operating results or financial
condition for that reporting period could be material.

Regulatory Proceedings
We are required to comply with U.S. economic and trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office
of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). We have self-reported to OFAC certain transactions that were inadvertently processed but
subsequently identified as possible violations of U.S. economic and trade sanctions. In March 2015, we reached a settlement with
OFAC regarding possible violations arising from our sanctions compliance practices between 2009 and 2013, prior to the
implementation of our real-time transaction scanning program. Subsequently, we have self-reported additional transactions as
possible violations, and we have received new subpoenas from OFAC seeking additional information about certain of these
transactions. Such self-reported transactions could result in claims or actions against us, including litigation, injunctions, damage
awards, fines or penalties, or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could result in a material loss, require
significant management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business

On March 28, 2016, we received a Civil Investigative Demand (“CID”) from the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) as part of its
investigation to determine whether we, through our Venmo service, have been or are engaged in deceptive or unfair practices in
violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The CID requested the production of documents and answers to written questions
related to our Venmo service. We have cooperated with the FTC in connection with the CID.

Legal Proceedings
On January 12, 2017, a putative shareholder derivative action captioned Silverman v. Schulman, et al., Case No. 5:17-cv-00162 (the
“California Derivative Case”) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Court”). The California
Derivative Case was based on substantially similar allegations as the allegations underlying a putative securities class action
captioned Chov.PayPalHoldings,Inc.,etal., Case No. 3:16-cv-07371 (the “Securities Case”), which was filed in the Court and
asserted claims relating to our disclosure in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2016, that
on March 28, 2016, we received a CID from the FTC as part of its investigation to determine whether we, through our Venmo
service, have been or are engaged in deceptive or unfair practices in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act. On February 8,
2017, the Court entered an order formally relating the California Derivative Case to the Securities Case and assigning the case to
the same judge handling the Securities Case. On the same day, the Court also entered an order staying the California Derivative
Case pending resolution of the defendants’ anticipated motions to dismiss the Securities Case. On March 24, 2017, a second
derivative action substantially similar to the California Derivative Case captioned Seemanv.Schulman,etal., Case
No. 1:17-cv-00318-UNA, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (the “Delaware Derivative Case”). On

Part IV

PayPal Holdings, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

April 19, 2017, the Delaware court in the Delaware Derivative Case issued an order adopting a stipulation filed by the parties
transferring the Delaware Derivative Case to the Court so that the Delaware Derivative Case could be consolidated with the
pending California Derivative Case. On April 27 and 28, 2017, two additional shareholder derivative lawsuits substantially similar to
the California Derivative Case and Delaware Derivative Case were filed in the Court. These cases are captioned Simsv.Schulman,et
al., Case No. 1:17-cv-02428-HRL, and Lissv.Schulman,etal., Case No. 1:17-cv-02446-NC (together with the California Derivative
Case and the Delaware Derivative Case, the “Derivative Cases”). The Derivative Cases are purportedly brought on behalf of the
Company and allege that the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, former interim Chief Financial Officer, and
members of its Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company, violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and
were unjustly enriched by, among other things, causing or permitting the Company to issue materially false and misleading
statements or omissions regarding the Company’s compliance with applicable laws and regulations with respect to its Venmo
service, as alleged in the Securities Case, and/or by permitting or causing the Company to engage in unfair trade practices through
its Venmo service. The Derivative Cases seek, among other things, to recover unspecified compensatory damages on behalf of the
Company arising out of the individual defendants’ alleged wrongful conduct. Although plaintiffs in the Derivative Cases do not seek
relief against the Company, we have certain indemnification obligations to the individual defendants. On June 30, 2017, the Court
issued an order approving a stipulation filed by the parties in the Derivative Cases that consolidates these cases and appoints co-
lead plaintiffs’ counsel for the consolidated case, captioned In re PayPal Holdings, Inc. Shareholder Derivative Litigation, Lead Case
No. 5:17-cv-00162-RS (the “Consolidated Derivative Case”). The Court’s order states that it applies to each purported derivative
action that is subsequently filed in, removed to, or transferred to the Court, arising out of the same or substantially the same
transactions or events as the Derivative Cases. On July 31, 2017, plaintiffs’ counsel designated the complaint filed in the Lissaction
as the operative complaint for the Consolidated Derivative Case. On October 5, 2017, another putative shareholder derivative suit
was filed in the Court captioned Iron Workers Local No. 25 Pension Fund v. John J. Donahoe, et al., Case No. 5:17-cv-05741-NC, that
makes similar allegations and advances similar claims against the same defendants as those at issue in the Consolidated Derivative
Case. Pursuant to the Court’s consolidation order, this shareholder derivative suit is part of the Consolidated Derivative Case. On
September 28, 2017, we filed a motion to dismiss the operative complaint on grounds that plaintiffs lack standing to pursue claims
on behalf of the Company because they did not make a pre-suit demand on the Company’s Board of Directors prior to filing the
Derivative Cases and failed to establish that making such a demand would have been futile. That motion was heard by the Court
on December 14, 2017. On January 18, 2018, the Court granted our motion to dismiss with leave to amend and gave plaintiffs 30
days from that date to file an amended complaint.

We have received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) seeking the production of certain information related to
our historical anti-money laundering program. We are cooperating with the DOJ in providing information in response to the
subpoenas. We are unable to predict the outcome of the government’s investigation.

In November 2017, we announced that we had suspended the operations of TIO Networks (“TIO”) as part of an ongoing
investigation of security vulnerabilities of the TIO platform. On December 1, 2017 we announced that we had identified evidence of
unauthorized access to TIO’s network, including locations that stored personal information of some of TIO’s customers and
customers of TIO billers and the potential compromise of personally identifiable information for approximately 1.6 million
customers. We have received a number of governmental inquiries, including from state attorneys general, and we may be subject
to additional governmental inquiries and investigations in the future. In addition, on December 6, 2017, a putative class action
lawsuit captioned Sgarlatav.PayPalHoldings,Inc.,etal., Case No. 3:17-cv-06956 was filed in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer, its Chief Financial Officer and Hamed Shahbazi, the
former chief executive officer of TIO (the “Defendants”) alleging violations of federal securities laws. Specifically, the lawsuit alleges
that Defendants made false or misleading statements or failed to disclose that TIO’s data security program was inadequate to
safeguard the personally identifiable information of its users, those vulnerabilities threatened continued operation of TIO’s
platform, the Company’s revenues derived from TIO services were thus unsustainable, and consequently, the Company overstated
the benefits of the TIO acquisition, and, as a result, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all
relevant times. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of shareholders who acquired shares of the Company’s stock between
February 14, 2017 through December 1, 2017 and seeks damages and attorneys’ fees, among other relief. We may be subject to
additional litigation relating to TIO’s data security platform or the suspension of TIO’s operations in the future. See Note 3
—“Business Combinations” and Note 4—“Goodwill and Intangible Assets” to our consolidated financial statements for additional
disclosure relating to the suspension of operations of TIO.

General Matters
Other third parties have from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual
property rights. We are subject to patent disputes, and expect that we will increasingly be subject to additional patent
infringement claims involving various aspects of our business as our products and services continue to expand in scope and
complexity. Such claims may be brought directly or indirectly against our companies and/or against our customers (who may be

2017 Annual Report

Part IV 93

PayPal Holdings, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

entitled to contractual indemnification under their contracts with us), and we are subject to increased exposure to such claims as a
result of our acquisitions, particularly in cases where we are entering into new lines of business in connection with such
acquisitions. We have in the past been forced to litigate such claims, and we believe that additional lawsuits alleging such claims
will be filed against us. Intellectual property claims, whether meritorious or not, are time consuming and costly to defend and
resolve, could require expensive changes in our methods of doing business or could require us to enter into costly royalty or
licensing agreements on unfavorable terms or make substantial payments to settle claims or to satisfy damages awarded by
courts.

From time to time, we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business, including
suits by our customers (individually or as class actions) alleging, among other things, improper disclosure of our prices, rules or
policies, that our practices, prices, rules, policies or customer/user agreements violate applicable law or that we have acted unfairly
and/or not acted in conformity with such prices, rules, policies or agreements. In addition to these types of disputes and regulatory
inquiries, our operations are also subject to regulatory and/or legal review and/or challenges that tend to reflect the increasing
global regulatory focus to which the payments industry is subject and, when taken as a whole with other regulatory and legislative
action, such actions could result in the imposition of costly new compliance burdens on our business and customers and may lead
to increased costs and decreased transaction volume and revenue. Further, the number and significance of these disputes and
inquiries are increasing as we have grown larger, our business has expanded in scope (both in terms of the range of products and
services that we offer and our geographical operations) and our products and services have increased in complexity. Any claims or
regulatory actions against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, settlement
payments, damage awards (including statutory damages for certain causes of action in certain jurisdictions), fines, penalties,
injunctive relief or increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement, require us to change our business
practices in expensive ways, require significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significant operational
resources or otherwise harm our business.

INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS
We entered into a separation and distribution agreement, a tax matters agreement, an operating agreement and various other
agreements with eBay to govern the separation and relationship of the two companies going forward. These agreements provide
for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us and eBay, which may be significant. In
addition, the indemnity rights we have against eBay under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us, and our indemnity
obligations to eBay may be significant.

In the ordinary course of business, we include limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with
whom we have commercial relationships, including our standard marketing, promotions, and application-programming-interface
license (API) agreements. Under these contracts, we generally indemnify, hold harmless, and agree to reimburse the indemnified
party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claims by any third-party with respect to our
domain names, trademarks, logos, and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are related to the subject
agreement. In a limited number of agreements, we have provided an indemnity for other types of third-party claims, which are
indemnities mainly related to intellectual property rights. We have also provided an indemnity to our payments processors in the
event of certain third-party claims or card association fines against the processor arising out of conduct by us or our customers. It
is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to our limited history of prior
indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular situation. To date, no significant costs
have been incurred, either individually or collectively, in connection with our indemnification provisions.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current
or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources.

PROTECTION PROGRAMS
We provide merchants and consumers with protection programs on substantially all transactions completed through our
Payments Platform, except for transactions using our gateway and Paydiant products. These programs protect both merchants
and consumers from loss primarily due to fraud and counterparty performance. Our Buyer Protection Program provides protection
to consumers for qualifying purchases by reimbursing the consumer for the full amount of the purchase if a purchased item does
not arrive or does not match the seller’s description. Our Seller Protection Programs provide protection to merchants against
claims that a transaction was not authorized by the buyer or claims that an item was not received by covering the seller for the full
amount of the payment on eligible sales.

www.paypal.com

94

Part IV

PayPal Holdings, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

The maximum potential exposure under our protection programs is estimated to be the portion of total eligible transaction
volume (TPV) for which buyer or seller protection claims may be raised under our existing user agreements. Since eligible
transactions are typically completed in a period significantly shorter than the period under which disputes may be opened, and
based on our historical losses to date, we do not believe that the maximum potential exposure is representative of our actual
potential exposure. The actual amount of potential exposure cannot be quantified as we are unable to determine total eligible
transactions where performance by a merchant or customer is incomplete or completed transactions that may result in a claim
under our protection programs. We record a liability with respect to losses under these protection programs when they are
probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

The following table provides management’s estimate of the maximum potential exposure related to our protection programs as of
December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:

Note 14—Related Party Transactions
As of December 31, 2017, there were no material amounts payable to or amounts receivable from related parties. For all periods
subsequent to the distribution, there were no material related party transactions.

Prior to the distribution, our business comprised the Payments segment of eBay and thus our transactions with eBay were
considered related party transactions. In connection with the separation, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement
as well as various other agreements that govern our relationships with eBay going forward, including an operating agreement, tax
matters agreement, employee matters agreement, intellectual property matters agreement and colocation services
agreements. Information included in this Note 14 with respect to eBay is strictly limited to our related party transactions with eBay
prior to the separation (i.e., periods up to July 17, 2015). Following separation, transactions with eBay represent third-party
transactions on an arms-length basis.

We earned net revenues of $59 million from eBay and its subsidiaries during the year ended December 31, 2015. Prior to the
distribution, we recovered certain amounts from eBay related to customer protection programs offered on eligible eBay purchases
made with PayPal. These costs included the actual transaction losses associated with customer-filed claims as well as an allocation
of salary-related expenses for our customer support teams working on customer claims and disputes related to eligible eBay
purchases. Recoveries associated with transaction losses incurred on eligible eBay purchases during the year ended December 31,
2015 were $27 million, which were recorded as a reduction to transaction and loan loss. Other costs recovered from eBay related to
the customer protection programs during the year ended December 31, 2015 were $12 million, and were included as a reduction to
customer support and operations and general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. Following the
distribution, eBay’s customer protection programs are no longer administered by us, and therefore these costs are no longer
reimbursed by eBay.

Prior to the distribution, we incurred user acquisition fees from eBay on payment volume which we processed from purchases
made on eBay’s platform. User acquisition fees during the year ended December 31, 2015 were $64 million. Following the
distribution, pursuant to the operating agreement, we incur referral services fees from eBay based on a fixed rate per new user.

Prior to the distribution, these consolidated financial statements include expenses associated with workplace resources and
information technology that were previously allocated to the Payments segment of eBay, and additional expenses related to

2017 Annual Report

Part IV 95

PayPal Holdings, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

certain corporate functions, including senior management, legal, human resources and finance. These expenses also include
allocations related to share based compensation. These expenses allocated to us by eBay were based on direct usage or benefit
where identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of revenue, headcount, or other systematic measure. We
consider the expense allocation methodology and results to be reasonable for all periods presented. The corporate costs and
allocation of expenses to us from eBay included within customer support and operations, sales and marketing, product
development, and general and administrative expenses were $303 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

In the second and third quarter of 2015, pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement between eBay and us, eBay
transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations of eBay’s payments business to PayPal, which was
completed in June 2015 (the “capitalization”). As part of the capitalization, we received from eBay a contribution of cash of
approximately $3.8 billion, as well as a related estimated deferred tax liability of $236 million associated with the foreign earnings
that are not considered indefinitely reinvested. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we reassessed the measurement of the deferred tax
liability and, based on updated valuation information, reduced the deferred tax liability balance to $172 million as of December 31,
2015. The adjustment to deferred tax liability was recorded as a contribution from eBay and resulted in an increase to net parent
investment within stockholders’ equity. During the second and third quarter of 2015, eBay also contributed property and
equipment with a net book value of approximately $224 million and intangible assets with a net book value of approximately
$18 million. Additionally, we sold certain property and equipment to eBay with a gross carrying amount of $63 million and a net
book value of $15 million for proceeds of approximately $26 million. The proceeds in excess of net book value were recorded as a
contribution from eBay and resulted in an increase to net parent investment within stockholders’ equity.

Note 15—Stock Repurchase Programs
In January 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program that provided for the repurchase of up to $2
billion of our common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. In April 2017, our Board of Directors authorized an
additional stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock, with no expiration
from the date of authorization. This program became effective upon completion of the January 2016 stock repurchase program.
The stock repurchase programs are intended to offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject
to market conditions and other factors, may also be used to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce
outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market
transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems
appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives. However, any stock repurchases are
subject to market conditions and other uncertainties and we cannot predict if or when any stock repurchases will be made.
Moreover, we may terminate our stock repurchase programs at any time without notice.

The stock repurchase activity under our stock repurchase programs during the year ended December 31, 2017 is summarized as

PayPal Holdings, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Note 16 — Stock-Based and Employee Savings Plans

Prior to the separation (i.e., periods up to July 17, 2015), PayPal employees participated in eBay’s equity incentive plans, including
stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance-based restricted stock units (“PBRSUs”). In addition, certain PayPal
employees participated in eBay’s employee stock purchase plan. All awards granted under these plans consisted of eBay common
shares. PayPal’s consolidated statement of income reflected compensation expense for these stock-based plans associated with
the portion of eBay’s equity incentive plans in which PayPal employees participated.

Following separation, outstanding awards granted to PayPal employees under eBay’s equity incentive plans were converted into
PayPal awards under PayPal’s equity incentive plans based on a conversion ratio. This conversion ratio was determined as the
closing per-share price of eBay shares on the last regular trading session prior to separation divided by the opening per-share price
of PayPal shares on the first regular trading session after separation. There was no significant incremental stock-based
compensation expense recorded as a result of the share conversions.

EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS
The Board of Directors adopted the PayPal Holdings, Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Award Plan (the “Plan”) on June 16, 2015. Under the
terms of the Plan, equity awards, including stock options, RSUs, restricted stock awards, PBRSUs, deferred stock units, and stock
payments may be granted to our directors, officers and employees. At December 31, 2017, there were 79 million shares authorized
under our equity incentive plans and 46 million shares were available for future grant. Shares issued as a result of stock option
exercises and the release of stock awards were funded primarily with the issuance of new shares of common stock.

All stock options granted under these plans generally vest 12.5% six months from the date of grant (or 25% one year from the date
of hire for grants to new employees) with the remainder vesting at a rate of 2.08% per month thereafter, and generally
expire seven years from the date of grant. The cost of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model on
the date of grant.

RSUs are granted to eligible employees under our equity incentive plans. In general, RSUs vest in equal annual installments over a
period of three to four years, are subject to an employee’s continuing service to us and do not have an expiration date. The cost of
RSUs granted prior to the separation was determined using the fair value of eBay’s common stock on the date of grant. The cost of
RSUs granted following separation was determined using the fair value of PayPal’s common stock on the date of grant.

Certain of our executives are eligible to receive PBRSUs, which are equity awards that may be earned based on an initial target
number with the final number of PBRSUs that may be vested and settled determined based on the Company’s performance
against pre-established performance metrics over a predefined performance period. PBRSUs granted under eBay’s equity incentive
plans generally had two-year performance periods with one-half of the grant vesting in March following the end of the
performance period and the remaining one-half vesting more than one year following the completion of the performance period. In
the first quarter of 2016, the Compensation Committee approved a revised structure for PBRSUs granted under PayPal’s 2015
Equity Incentive Award Plan to officers and certain employees providing services to the Company. PBRSUs granted under PayPal’s
2015 Equity Incentive Award Plan have one to three-year performance periods with cliff vesting following the completion of the
performance period, subject to the Committee’s approval of the level of achievement against the pre-established performance
targets. Over the performance period, the number of PBRSUs that may be issued and related stock-based compensation expense
that is recognized is adjusted upward or downward based upon the probability of achieving the approved performance targets
against the performance metrics. Depending on the probability of achieving the pre-established performance targets, the PBRSUs
issued could range from 0% to 200% of the target amount.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
Prior to separation, eligible employees participated in eBay’s employee stock purchase plan. Effective July 17, 2015, the Board of
Directors adopted the PayPal Holdings, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). Under the terms of this plan, shares of our
common stock may be purchased over an offering period with a maximum duration of two years at 85% of the lower of the fair
market value on the first day of the applicable offering period or on the last business day of each six-month purchase period within
the offering period. Employees may contribute between 2% and 10% of their gross compensation during an offering period to
purchase shares, but not more than the statutory limitation of $25,000 per year. The company stock purchased through the ESPP

In the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company granted 2.9 million PBRSUs with a one-year performance period and cliff
vesting following the completion of the performance period in February 2018 (one year from the annual incentive award cycle
grant date) and 1.3 million PBRSUs with a three-year performance period.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE
We record stock-based compensation expense for our equity incentive plans in accordance with the provisions of the authoritative
accounting guidance, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense based on estimated fair values.

The impact on our results of operations of recording stock-based compensation expense under the eBay and PayPal equity
incentive plans for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:

As of December 31, 2017, there was approximately $830 million of unearned stock-based compensation estimated to be expensed
from 2018 through 2019. If there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested awards, we may be required to
accelerate, increase or cancel all or a portion of the remaining unearned stock-based compensation expense. Future unearned
stock-based compensation will increase to the extent we grant additional equity awards, change the mix of grants between stock
options and RSUs or assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions.

STOCK OPTION VALUATION ASSUMPTIONS
We calculated the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following
weighted average assumptions were used for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:

Risk-free interest rate
Expected life (in years)

1.6% 1.5% 1.4%

— — —

For periods prior to separation, our computation of expected volatility was based on a combination of historical and market-based
implied volatility from traded options on eBay’s stock. The computation of expected life was determined based on historical
experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock-based awards, vesting schedules, and
expectations of future employee behavior. The interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award was based on the
U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

For periods subsequent to the separation, the risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award was based
upon the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. Due to our limited history of stock option exercises, we
estimated the expected term of options granted based on the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual

term using the “simplified” method under the SEC guidance. The computation of expected volatility for assumed stock option
awards was based on a combination of historical and implied volatility from traded options on PayPal’s stock.

EMPLOYEE SAVING PLANS
Prior to separation, eligible U.S. employees participated in eBay’s savings plan, which qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Code.
Effective July 17, 2015, the Board of Directors adopted the PayPal Holdings, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, which also qualifies
under Section 401(k) of the Code. Under the terms of this plan, participating U.S. employees may contribute up to 50% of their
eligible compensation, but not more than statutory limits. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, under the PayPal and eBay savings plans, eligible
employees received one dollar for each dollar contributed, up to 4% of each employee’s eligible salary, subject to a maximum
employer contribution of $10,800, $10,600 and $10,600, respectively, per employee. Our non-U.S. employees are covered by other
savings plans. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the matching contribution expense for our U.S. and
international savings plans were approximately $47 million, $42 million and $42 million, respectively.

Note 17—Income Taxes
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act includes significant
changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system including: a federal corporate rate reduction from 35% to 21%; limitations on the
deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation; creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”), a new
minimum tax; and the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system.
The change to a modified territorial tax system resulted in a one-time U.S. tax liability on those earnings which have not previously
been repatriated to the U.S. (the “Transition Tax”), with future distributions not subject to U.S. federal income tax when
repatriated. A majority of the provisions in the Tax Act are effective January 1, 2018.

In response to the Tax Act, the SEC staff issued guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. The guidance provides a
one-year measurement period for companies to complete the accounting. We reflected the income tax effects of those aspects of
the Tax Act for which the accounting is complete. To the extent our accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is
incomplete but we are able to determine a reasonable estimate, we recorded a provisional estimate in the financial statements. If a
company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply the
provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the Tax Act.

In connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act, we have recorded a provisional estimate of discrete net tax
expense of $180 million for the period ended December 31, 2017. This discrete expense consists of provisional estimates of
$1,468 million net expense for the Transition Tax payable in installments over eight years, $1,295 million net benefit for the
decrease in our deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings, and $7 million net expense for remeasurement of our deferred
tax assets/liabilities for the corporate rate reduction and changes in our valuation allowance.

We have not completed our accounting for the income tax effects of certain elements of the Tax Act. The Tax Act creates a new
requirement that certain income such as Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) earned by a controlled foreign corporation
(“CFC”) must be included in the gross income of the CFC U.S. shareholder. Because of the complexity of the new GILTI and BEAT
tax rules, we are continuing to evaluate these provisions of the Tax Act and whether taxes due on future U.S. inclusions related to
GILTI or BEAT should be recorded as a current-period expense when incurred, or factored into a company’s measurement of its
deferred taxes. As a result, we have not included an estimate of the tax expense or benefit related to these items for the period
ended December 31, 2017.

For periods ended on or prior to July 17, 2015, we were a member of the eBay consolidated group and our U.S. taxable income was
included in the consolidated U.S. federal income tax return of eBay as well as in returns filed by eBay with certain state and local
taxing jurisdictions. Our foreign income tax returns are filed on a separate company basis. For periods ended on or prior to July 17,
2015, our income tax liability has been computed and presented herein under the “separate return method” as if PayPal were a
separate tax paying entity, as modified by the benefits-for-loss approach. Accordingly, our operating losses and other tax
attributes are characterized as utilized when those attributes have been utilized by other members of the eBay consolidated
group; however, the benefits-for-loss approach does not impact our tax expense. Federal and unitary state income taxes incurred
for periods ended on or prior to July 17, 2015 are remitted to eBay pursuant to a tax sharing agreement between the companies.

In connection with the distribution, eBay and PayPal entered into various agreements that govern the relationship between the
parties going forward, including a tax matters agreement. The tax matters agreement was entered into on the distribution date.
Under the tax matters agreement, eBay is generally responsible for all additional taxes (and will be entitled to all related refunds of

The difference between the effective income tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 35.0% to income before income taxes is
primarily the result of foreign income taxed at different rates and, for the year ended December 31, 2017, the effects of the Tax Act
discussed above.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are
expected to reverse. Significant deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following:

Deferred tax assets:

Net operating loss and credit carryforwards
Accruals and allowances
Partnership investment
Stock-based compensation
Net unrealized (gains) losses
Total deferred tax assets

Valuation allowance

As of December 31, 2017, our federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were
approximately $64 million, $332 million, and $177 million, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are
subject to various limitations under Section 382 of the Code. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin
to expire in 2019, and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2018. Approximately $26 million of the
foreign net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2034 and a majority of the remainder has no expiration date and may be
carried forward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2017, our federal and state tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were
approximately $25 million and $101 million, respectively. The federal tax credits will begin to expire in 2032. Most of the state tax
credits may be carried forward indefinitely.

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that all or some
portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. During the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, we increased our
valuation allowance by $50 million and $11 million, respectively. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we maintained a valuation

allowance with respect to certain of our deferred tax assets relating to operating losses in certain states and foreign jurisdictions
and tax credits in certain states that we believe are not likely to be realized.

Immediately prior to enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017, we had $10.0 billion of undistributed foreign earnings. We
had accrued $1,334 million of deferred U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes on the portion of these earnings that were not
intended to be indefinitely reinvested in our international operations. Upon passage of the Tax Act, all $10.0 billion of
undistributed foreign earnings became subject to U.S. federal tax at a reduced rate payable over an 8-year period. As a result, we
reversed $1,295 million of deferred U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes and recorded a long-term U.S. tax payable of
$1,468 million. Due to the change in U.S. federal tax law, management has decided not to indefinitely reinvest any of our
unremitted foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. We have accrued $39 million of deferred U.S. state and foreign withholding
taxes on the $10.0 billion of undistributed foreign earnings. This is a provisional estimate pending further legislative action from
the states regarding conformity with the Tax Act.

We benefit from tax rulings concluded in several different jurisdictions, most significantly Singapore and Luxembourg. These
rulings result in significantly lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investment and
employment in those jurisdictions. We review our compliance on an annual basis to ensure we continue to meet our obligations
under these tax rulings. These rulings resulted in tax savings of approximately $443 million, $310 million and $285 million in 2017,
2016 and 2015, respectively. The benefit of these tax rulings on our net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.36, $0.25
and $0.23 in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These tax rulings are currently in effect and expire over periods ranging from 2020
to 2021.

The following table reflects changes in unrecognized tax benefits for the periods presented below:

If the remaining balance of unrecognized tax benefits were realized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of
$406 million.

During all years presented, we recognized interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. In 2017
we recognized net interest and penalties of $13 million in income tax expense. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of
December 31, 2017 and 2016 was approximately $75 million and $67 million, respectively.

We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by certain tax
authorities for the 2003 to 2015 tax years. The material jurisdictions in which we are subject to examination by tax authorities for
tax years after 2002 primarily include the U.S. (Federal and California), France, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, and Singapore. We
believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations.
During 2017, a number of audits were closed/settled including one with Israel and another with the United Kingdom.

Although the timing of the resolution of these audits is uncertain, we do not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits
as of December 31, 2017 will materially change in the next 12 months. However, given the number of years remaining subject to
examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the
balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.

In the first quarter of 2017, management approved a plan to implement a strategic reduction of the existing global workforce. The
reduction was substantially completed by the end of 2017. We recognized $40 million of restructuring expenses related to
employee severance and benefits classified in restructuring and other charges in our consolidated statement of income during the

No restructuring expenses were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016.

In January 2015, at a regular meeting of the eBay board of directors (the “eBay Board”), the eBay Board approved a plan to

Stock Performance Graph

Stock Performance Graph

This performance graph shall not be deemed “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”) for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that
Section, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any of our filings under the Security Act of 1933.

The graph below shows the cumulative total stockholder return of any investment of $100 in our common stock during the period
from July 20, 2015 (the date our common stock began “regular way” trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market) through December 31,
2017, in comparison to the NASDAQ Composite Index, the S&P 500 Index and the S&P 500 Information Technology Index. These
indices are included only for comparative purposes as required by the SEC rules and do not necessarily reflect management’s
opinion that such indices are an appropriate measure of the relative performance of our common stock and they are not intended
to forecast possible future performance of our common stock.
