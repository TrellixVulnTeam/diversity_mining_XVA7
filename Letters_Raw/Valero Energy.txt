I am very pleased to report that in 2017, 
Valero set new operational performance 
records for safety, reliability and environmental 
stewardship, exemplifying our commitment to 
premier operations that drive and deliver stable 
earnings.

Turning to the markets, 2017 certainly was a 
tale of two halves. In the first half of the year, 
we saw a gradual but steady improvement in 
margins from the low levels of 2016. The return 
of global economic growth created strong 
product demand.

For the year, excluding a significant benefit 
from the unprecedented tax reform passed in 
December, adjusted net income attributable to 
stockholders was $4.96 per share, compared 
with $3.72 per share in 2016.

In operations, our refineries recorded their 
lowest-ever employee injury rates – far lower 
than the industry average – and best-ever 
process safety event rate. At the same time, 
they achieved their highest-ever mechanical 
availability percentage and lowest-ever number 
of environmental incidents.

They also maintained the lowest refining cash 
operating expense per barrel of throughput 
in our peer group, excluding turnaround and 
depreciation and amortization expenses.

I would be remiss if I didn’t say once again 
how proud I was of our Valero team and the 
energy industry as a whole for the response to 
Hurricane Harvey, whose path touched almost 
all of Valero’s Gulf Coast operations.

It was impressive that the epicenter of the 
refining industry on the Gulf Coast could take 
a direct hit from a Category 4 hurricane and 
keep supply disruptions as short-lived as they 
were. I applaud our employees; our local, state 
and federal government officials; and all of our 
business partners who worked closely with 
us to return the supply of our fuels to affected 
communities.

And on the supply side, our flexibility allowed 
us to optimize our system away from the OPEC 
supply-constrained crudes to capture more 
margin available on Canadian and domestic 
crude supply. In fact, we processed a record 1.4 
million barrels per day of light crude during the 
fourth quarter.

In the second half of the year, the catastrophic 
weather-related events accelerated the decline 
in industry product inventories to below five-
year averages. These events brought national 
attention to the complexity and efficiency of the 
U.S. fuel supply chain and renewed appreciation 
for the critical role our products play in the lives 
of families and communities.

With supply of refined light product inventories 
remaining low and global economic growth 
continuing, we expect good demand in 
domestic and export markets and healthy 
margins in the coming year.

We remain committed to our capital allocation 
framework, which prioritizes maintaining our 
investment-grade credit ratings and non-
discretionary spending to sustain our business 
and pay dividends. Growth investments, 
mergers and acquisitions, and incremental cash 
returns compete for the remaining discretionary 
cash flow. Incremental cash flow resulting from 
tax reform should increase our capacity in this 
area, but will not alter our framework.

5

2017 summary annual report66

We maintained our strong balance sheet, 
investment-grade credit ratings and a low 
debt-to-capital ratio of 23 percent, net of 
$2 billion in cash. Regarding cash returns 
to our stockholders, we paid out 63 percent 
of adjusted net cash provided by operating 
activities, which exceeded our target annual 
payout range of 40 to 50 percent.

Our board in January approved a 14 percent 
increase in the regular quarterly dividend to 
$0.80 per share, or $3.20 annually, further 
demonstrating our commitment to our investors.

Looking ahead, we see strong tailwinds with the 
anticipated reduction in our taxes, regulatory 
changes such as the IMO 2020 standard, and 
continued economic growth. We expect Valero’s 
net cash provided by operating activities to 
benefit significantly.

In closing, with continued solid operational and 
safety performance, as well as our advantaged 
position as a low-cash cost manufacturer with 
flexibility to process a wide range of feedstocks, 
we are optimistic about 2018.

Thank you for your continued support and trust.

Joe Gorder 
Chairman, President and  
Chief Executive Officer

In 2017, we invested $2.4 billion to sustain and 
grow the business. Among our projects:

 y The Diamond Pipeline started up in 

November, connecting the crude-oil hub of 
Cushing, Oklahoma, to our Memphis refinery.

 y A new cogeneration unit went online at 
our Wilmington refinery, helping reduce 
the plant’s operating expenses while also 
increasing the reliability of its power and 
steam supplies.

 y Our expansion of the Diamond Green Diesel 

plant initially is expected to boost annual 
production capacity to 275 million gallons 
from 160 million gallons, with completion 
expected in third-quarter 2018.

 y Construction of a new alkylation unit at the 

Houston refinery remains on track for an 
expected first-half 2019 completion.

 y Our logistics investments in central Texas 
and along the Houston Ship Channel are 
also progressing. Estimated startups are in 
mid-2019 for central Texas pipelines and 
terminals, and early 2020 for a terminal in 
Pasadena.

A new $400 million alkylation unit at  
St. Charles, recently approved by the board, 
also is projected for startup in second-half 
2020.

We also signed a long-term agreement to 
supply product into central Mexico. With recent 
constitutional reform there, Valero may now 
import refined products through a subsidiary at 
the new Port of Veracruz and distribute directly 
into Mexico, including branded sales. This 
transaction will enable us to extend our supply 
chain to efficiently supply gasoline, diesel and 
jet fuel to the growing Mexican market.

2017 summary annual reportmaintaining manufacturing excellence

Safety and reliability are 
imperative for profitability. In 
2017, Valero improved in critical 
benchmarks, which led to 
greater margin capture, lower 
operating expenses and better 
efficiency.

In personnel safety, Valero 
posted its lowest-ever refinery 
employee injury rate, with 0.28 
total recordable incidents per 
200,000 work hours, an industry 
metric, down 20 percent from 
2016 and far below the industry 
average of 0.60. It marked the 
fourth straight year of record-
setting performance.

Our combined refinery 
employee and contractor rate 
stood at 0.32.

lowest-ever
refinery employee 
injury rate in 2017

In 2017, our refineries at 
Memphis and St. Charles 
earned Voluntary Protection 
Program (VPP) Star Site 
designations, the highest plant-
safety recognition by the U.S. 
Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration and affiliated 
state agencies.

Under the program, Valero goes 
beyond regulatory compliance 
in voluntarily submitting to 
rigorous safety audits. Valero 
has the most VPP Star Sites of 
any refiner.

Three of our asphalt terminals 
also hold VPP Stars, as does 
our aviation department.

In addition, company refineries 
in Québec and Wales each hold 
internal Valero VPP Stars after 
passing audits patterned after 
those in the U.S., conducted by 
teams of independent OSHA-
trained inspectors.

St. Charles, in earning the 
Valero Chairman’s Safety 
Award, went two years without 
an employee recordable 
injury and posted a three-year 
contractor incident rate of 0.24.

Valero’s ethanol plants also 
have maintained injury rates 
lower than the industry average, 
in each year of operation.

Our refineries also continue to 
make significant strides in key 
areas of process safety and 
reliability.

We recorded our best-ever 
Process Safety Event Tier 1 
performance, the industry’s 
primary process safety metric, 
representing a 71 percent 
reduction since 2010.

Our proprietary management 
systems allow us to consistently 
deliver predictable and 
desirable operating results. 

Those systems go through 
a continuous improvement 
process that ensures we 
maintain industry-leading 
performance.

Process safety also is a major 
emphasis at our ethanol plants, 
where Valero’s entire fleet of 
11 plants recorded no Tier 1 
process safety events for three 
years. The Hartley plant, winner 
of the Chairman’s Award for 
Renewables Plant Excellence, 
has not recorded a Tier 1 
process safety event in more 
than six years.

Process safety and reliability 
go hand in hand, and there has 
been measurable improvement 
in overall reliability of Valero’s 
refineries. Our reliability 
networks conduct periodic 
comprehensive assessments.

2017 summary annual reportspent billions of dollars on 
environmental upgrades at our 
refineries that have reduced 
emissions and improved the 
environment.

70+%

reduction in flaring 
and emissions over 

the last decade

Six refineries either set or tied 
environmental performance 
records in 2017. And refinery 
flaring events and emissions 
are down more than 70 percent 
over the last decade.

Valero’s commitment to 
manufacturing excellence has 
resulted in improvement in 
industry benchmarks across 
the board – from mechanical 
availability to personnel index, 
maintenance index, non-energy 
cash operating expenses 
and energy intensity index 
– providing for best-in-class 
operations.

In 2017, Valero refineries 
achieved 97.3 percent 
mechanical availability, a 
leading reliability measure 
representing the percentage 
of time our units are available 
to run. That was Valero’s best 
reliability performance ever.

The Jean Gaulin refinery 
in Québec won the Valero 
Chairman’s Award for 
reliability, tops across a broad 
set of measures focused on 
equipment reliability, frequency 
and extent of shutdowns, 
and overall turnaround 
management.

Valero takes a systematic 
approach to reliability, with 
programs maintained within 
a low-cost framework as 
capital investment continues to 
address the largest challenges. 
As a result, we have achieved 
best-in-industry simultaneous 
cost and mechanical 
performance.

Finally, Valero achieved its best-
ever environmental performance 
for a second consecutive year, 
reducing its number of incidents 
by 5 percent from the previous 
year, on top of a 32 percent 
reduction from 2015. And over 
the past decade, performance 
has improved by 71 percent.

We accomplished this by 
strengthening incident 
investigations and taking 
corrective actions to prevent 
recurrence of environmental 
events. We additionally have

2017 summary annual reportallocating capital to deliver results

Disciplined capital allocation is 
a constant in Valero’s strategy, 
with an eye on delivering 
distinctive financial results 
and peer-leading returns to 
stockholders.

Critical to this strategy is 
maintaining a strong balance 
sheet, including sustaining 
investment-grade credit ratings 
and targeting a debt-to-
capitalization ratio of 20 to 30 
percent. Valero finished 2017 
with a ratio of 23 percent, net of 
$2 billion in cash.

Our capital is allocated between 
investments to sustain or grow 
our business, acquisitions and 
cash returns in the form of 
dividends and stock buybacks.

In the first category, 
“sustaining” capital for 
turnarounds, catalysts and 
regulatory compliance is key 
to safe and reliable operations. 
In determining growth capital, 
internal rate of return (IRR) 
must be projected to clear 25 
percent, with a lower hurdle 
rate required for steady cash-
flow midstream projects. Any 
acquisitions for refining projects 

must be evaluated against 
alternative uses of cash. 

For 2018, we project sustaining 
capital of approximately $1.7 
billion, and growth capital of 
about $1.0 billion.

Delivering cash returns to 
our stockholders is one of 
our priorities. We consider 
dividends as a commitment, 
targeting a payout at the 
high end of our peer group 
of independent refiners. Our 
annual dividend per share has 
grown to $3.20 from just $0.30 
in 2011.

We have shown discipline in 
capital allocation through steady 
investments to maintain our 
asset base, improve margins and 
optimize our portfolio.

We also reduced our weighted 
average shares outstanding 
to 78 percent of what it was in 
2011.

Valero has a steady pipeline of 
high-return projects, roughly 
split between refining and 
logistics projects.

Through the combination of 
dividends and stock buybacks, 
we are targeting a payout ratio 
between 40 and 50 percent of 
adjusted net cash provided by 
operating activities for 2018. In 
2017, we exceeded that target, 
at 63 percent.

Overall, we have shown 
discipline in capital allocation 
through steady investments 
to maintain our asset base, 
improve margins and optimize 
our portfolio.

In all, projects either just 
completed, in execution or in 
development are expected to 
contribute from $1.2 billion to 
$1.4 billion in earnings before 
interest, taxes, depreciation and 
amortization (EBITDA).

Projects completed in 2017 
included the Diamond Pipeline 
connecting the crude-oil hub 
of Cushing, Oklahoma, with 
our Memphis refinery, and a 
new cogeneration unit at our 
Wilmington refinery.

Valero Energy 
Partners LP
Valero’s 2 percent general 
partner interest and majority 
limited partner interest in Valero 
Energy Partners LP (NYSE: VLP) 
serves as a primary vehicle to 
grow Valero’s logistics business.

Since Valero formed the master 
limited partnership in 2013, 
it has focused on executing 
from a position of fundamental 
strength, with logistics assets 
serving 10 Valero refineries at 
the end of 2017.

VLP maintains its growth profile 
by targeting “drop-downs” of 
assets from Valero, as well as 
organic projects and midstream 
acquisitions. Its strategy is 
to deliver top-tier distribution 
growth, as well as maintain 
investment-grade credit ratings.

In 2017, the partnership 
delivered peer-leading 
distribution coverage, 
increasing its quarterly cash 
distribution 139 percent over 
minimum quarterly distribution 
(MQD), and grew annualized 
EBITDA attributable to the 
partnership to more than $365 
million.

VLP boosted operating income 
from acquisition of the Red 
River pipeline in Oklahoma, as 
well as from Port Arthur terminal 
assets and Parkway Pipeline, all 
added in 2017.

22

Ethanol demand is expected 
to be strong globally, driven by 
strong demand and attractive 
economics for corn-based 
ethanol exports.

Valero’s share of U.S. ethanol 
exports grew to 22 percent in 
2017.

Ethanol Business
Valero’s 11 ethanol plants in the 
Midwest reached 1.45 billion 
gallons annual production, with 
plants running at 130 percent of 
original design.

The plants are lower-cost 
producers compared with the 
industry, originally purchased 
at 35 percent of replacement 
cost and highly efficient with 
scale and located in the Corn 
Belt. Also, Valero has been able 
to transfer operational best 
practices of its refineries to its 
ethanol plants.

23

2017 summary annual reportfocusing on earnings growth

Valero is focused on earnings 
growth through a combination 
of market expansion, margin 
improvement and operating 
cost control.

Our portfolio of advantaged 
refineries and logistics 
optimizes product exports 
globally. And we’re investing 
to grow export and wholesale 
fuels volume.

For example, Mexico’s refined 
product demand is expected 
to grow, with imports filling a 
large percentage of the supply 
shortage. The proximity, scale 

and flexibility of our U.S. Gulf 
Coast refineries position us well 
to fill the demand.

Valero has supplied fuels to 
Mexico for more than 10 years. 
But an agreement reached 
in 2017 will enable a new 
Valero subsidiary to receive 
imported products at Veracruz 
and distribute wholesale and 
branded fuel to central Mexico’s 
most-populous cities.

Our refineries are advantaged in 
other ways. We have the most 
refining capacity in the U.S. Gulf 
Coast and Mid-Continent of our 

peers, giving us an advantage 
to process a wide variety of 
crude oils – both from the 
region and imported – as well 
as access to a deep pool of 
skilled labor.

Valero’s refineries are capable 
of processing 1.6 million barrels 
per day of light sweet crude 
oil in the U.S. Gulf Coast, in 
addition to having the flexibility 
to process heavy sour, medium/
light sour, residuals and other 
feedstocks. That flexibility is 
key to managing and improving 
margins.

24

In summary, Valero’s premier 
asset portfolio and best-in-
class operations provide a 
solid foundation for value 
creation. And we are investing 
in long-term earnings growth to 
generate distinctive cash flow 
and lower earnings volatility 
across margin cycles.

And our ability to optimize our 
portfolio and improve reliability 
has enabled high utilization and 
lower operating expense. Valero 
is proving that high levels of 
reliability are compatible with 
low cash operating costs.

We once again posted the 
lowest refining cash operating 
expenses per barrel of 
throughput in our peer group, 
at $3.65, excluding turnaround, 
depreciation and amortization 
expenses.

Valero’s premier asset portfolio 
and best-in-class operations 
provide a solid foundation for 
value creation.
