2017 ANNUAL REPORT

Citi’s Value Proposition:
A Mission of Enabling Growth and Progress

What You Can Expect From Us & What We Expect From Ourselves

Citi’s mission is to serve as a trusted partner 
to our clients by responsibly providing 
financial services that enable growth and 
economic progress. Our core activities are 
safeguarding assets, lending money, making 
payments and accessing the capital markets 
on behalf of our clients. We have 200 years of 
experience helping our clients meet the world’s 
toughest challenges and embrace its greatest 
opportunities. We are Citi, the global bank —  
an institution connecting millions of people 
across hundreds of countries and cities.

We protect people’s savings and help them 
make the purchases — from everyday 
transactions to buying a home — that improve 
the quality of their lives. We advise people on 
how to invest for future needs, such as their 
children’s education and their own retirement, 
and help them buy securities such as stocks  
and bonds.

We work with companies to optimize their daily 
operations, whether they need working capital, 
to make payroll or export their goods overseas. 

By lending to companies large and small,  
we help them grow, creating jobs and real 
economic value at home and in communities 
around the world. We provide financing and 
support to governments at all levels, so they 
can build sustainable infrastructure, such as 
housing, transportation, schools and other vital 
public works.

These capabilities create an obligation to act 
responsibly, do everything possible to create the 
best outcomes, and prudently manage risk. If we 
fall short, we will take decisive action and learn 
from our experience.

We strive to earn and maintain the public’s trust 
by constantly adhering to the highest ethical 
standards. We ask our colleagues to ensure that 
their decisions pass three tests: they are in our 
clients’ interests, create economic value, and are 
always systemically responsible. When we do 
these things well, we make a positive financial 
and social impact in the communities we serve 
and show what a global bank can do.

Letter To Shareholders

Chief Executive Officer

Dear Fellow Shareholders:
When we look back at 2017 from the vantage point of a few years from 
now, I am confident we will point to it as a year Citi decisively emerged 
from a prolonged period of simplification and restructuring into a new era 
of sustainable client-led growth. 

7 Michael L. Corbat

The growth we are driving today is sustainable, balanced and less exposed 
to predictable and unpredictable risks than in the past. It is not going to 
come from acquiring competitors, entering new territories, or expanding 
into ancillary businesses that don’t fit our strategy. It is going to come from 
serving our consumer and institutional clients with distinction. It is going 
to come from earning and keeping clients’ trust and safeguarding their 
security. And it is going to come from being seen as an indisputably strong 
and stable company that takes as much justifiable pride in the positive 
impacts we have on society as in our financial achievements.

That is the context in which, on Investor 
Day in July 2017 — our first in nine 
years — I reiterated our conviction that 
with our restructuring complete, we 
had crossed an inflection point. From 
2017 forward, the decisions we made 
to focus our franchise, invest in our 
capabilities and improve our client 
experience are bearing fruit in the form 
of a more compelling value proposition, 
accelerating growth and improved 
returns for shareholders. Our overriding 
goal is to combine the positive impact 
of an improving macroeconomic 
environment with even stronger 
business performance to consistently 
deliver higher returns on capital and 
increased return of capital to our 
shareholders through 2020 and beyond.

On an operating basis, our 2017 financial 
results strongly support the strategy 
we presented on Investor Day. Yet as 
a consequence of the passage of tax 
reform legislation in the U.S. in the fourth 
quarter of 2017, we took a one-time, non-
cash charge of $22.6 billion, resulting in 
a net loss on a reporting basis for the 
year of $6.8 billion. Having put that one-
time charge behind us, however, we can 
now focus on the positive impacts of tax 
reform for us and our clients. A lower tax 
rate leads to higher net income, which, 
combined with a multi-billion-dollar 
reduction in our tangible common equity, 
will have a powerful positive impact on 
our returns. We estimate the impact of 
tax reform should drive our Return on 
Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE) up by 
200 basis points or more. On a symbolic 
level, reducing the value of our Deferred 
Tax Assets (DTA) — our remaining 
remnant of the financial crisis — indelibly

end of an era.

The solid growth we achieved in our core 
consumer and institutional businesses 
came from a more focused country 
presence in consumer and a more 
selective client base in institutional, 
each of which is roughly half the size it 
was at its peak. We have continued to 
execute on investments to streamline 
our infrastructure and drive further 
growth in targeted areas including our 
Mexico, U.S. Cards, Treasury and Trade 
Solutions, Equities and Investment 
Banking franchises.

In Global Consumer Banking, which 
serves more than 100 million consumer 
clients in 19 markets in three regions 
— Asia, Mexico and the U.S. — total 
revenues were up 4 percent over 2016. 
From a product perspective, Global Retail 
Banking grew loans and assets under 
management as we continued to shrink 
our physical footprint. Global Cards also 
delivered good growth, driven by higher 
loan and purchase sales volumes in all 
three regions.

Our Institutional Clients Group delivered 
an impressive performance, driving total 
revenues up 7 percent. Banking revenues 
were higher across our franchise, from 
our backbone Treasury and Trade 
Solutions to Investment Banking, the 
Private Bank and Corporate Lending. 
In our Markets and Securities Services 
segment, a weaker performance in Fixed 
Income and Equities compared to the 
more robust trading environment in 
2016 was offset by growth in Securities 
Services. Once again we demonstrated 
the value of balance across and within 
our businesses. 

Investor Day 2017
Citi hosted our first Investor Day in nine 
years on July 25. It was an opportunity 
to engage directly with investors and 
share the progress we’ve made as a 
firm, as well as our objectives going 
forward. The core message was that 
we’ve crossed an inflection point as a 
firm. Topics included the momentum 
we’re seeing in our businesses, our 
competitive advantages and the 
confidence we have in our strategy.

Excluding the impact of tax reform, our 
2017 net income of $15.8 billion was 
nearly $1 billion — or 6 percent — higher 
than our 2016 net income. On this basis, 
earnings per share rose to $5.33, up 13 
percent over the prior year, including 
a benefit from share repurchases. We 
also made progress toward the targets 
we introduced on Investor Day. Due 
to strong expense management, we 
delivered a full-year Efficiency Ratio of 
58 percent, a more than 150 basis point 
improvement from 2016. We increased 
our Return on Assets to 84 basis points. 
And we achieved a ROTCE of 8.1 percent, 
including the impact of our DTA. And 
excluding the impact of our disallowed 
DTAs, our ROTCE rose to 9.6 from 9 
percent in 2016, showing progress 
toward the 10 percent target we talked 
about on Investor Day.

With regard to improving the return 
of capital to our shareholders, the 
solid results we achieved on our 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and 
Review (CCAR) “stress test” again 
enabled the planned return of $19 
billion during the current CCAR cycle. 
That laid the foundation for us to 

reduce our outstanding share count 
by over 200 million and return over 
$17 billion of capital to shareholders 
in 2017 through common share 
repurchases and dividends. We 
announced our intention to return — 
subject to regulatory approval — at 
least an additional $40 billion of 
capital to shareholders over the next 
two 2018 and 2019 CCAR cycles. 
The Federal Reserve and the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation found 
no deficiencies or shortcomings in our 
2017 Resolution Plan. Both milestones 
underscored the progress we made in 
2017 toward our longstanding goal of 
being an indisputably strong and  
stable institution.

I would like to put these results in the 
broader context of a mindset shift 
we see as critical to sustaining these 
positive trends and trajectories into 
an uncertain future. We cannot control 
the macroeconomic or interest rate 
environment. But we can and must 
control the impacts our decisions  
and actions have on our clients’ 
experience of their interactions  
and engagements with us.

> FEBRUARYLetter To Shareholders
We know our clients’ expectations for 
seamless experiences are rising by the 
day. In response to that reality, our 
consumer bank launched three times as 
many digital features in 2017 as we did 
in 2016, driving double-digit growth in 
digital and mobile clients worldwide. 

In our institutional business, Citi’s online 
banking platform CitiDirect BE® was 
ranked # 1 for the twelfth consecutive 
year in the 2017 Greenwich Associates 
Digital Banking Benchmarking study. We 
partnered with Nasdaq on the rollout of 
a pioneering application of blockchain 
and distributed ledger technology 
to facilitate and automate payment 
processing. Our Treasury and Trade 
Solutions business, which provides cash 
management and trade finance services 
to multinational corporations and public 
sector clients worldwide, also launched 
a host of digital offerings designed to 
make our global network, the world’s 
largest money mover, even more of a 
competitive advantage than it is today.

All the innovations we launched, crucial 
to serving clients with distinction, 
would not have stood a chance of 
gaining traction or acceptance with 
clients if they required reassurance that 
our reputation or values were sound. 
Fortunately, the strong foundation 
we have built, based on a culture of 
competence, compliance and control 
precedes us. On a number of occasions 
in 2017, I had an opportunity to reaffirm 
those core values as events transpired  
to make taking a stand not just right  
but necessary. 

On the third day of January, in response 
to a newly-released Executive Order 
on Immigration in the U.S., I wrote to 
my roughly 210,000 Citi colleagues in 
nearly 100 countries where we open our 
doors every day to remind them that our 
diversity is a value not just fundamental 
to our present and future, but — given 
our globality — a real competitive 
advantage for our firm. 

To accelerate progress on this important 
front, I asked at least one of my direct 
reports to co-lead each of our newly-
established Affinity Groups — including 
Pride, Black Heritage, Asian Heritage, 
and Citi Salutes, dedicated to veterans’ 

support — with another senior Citi leader. 
I wrote and said to my colleagues as I 
made that announcement that while 
I know we have more work to do, our 
track record at getting difficult things 
done makes me confident that we will 
get to where we need to go. 

In honor of our 12th annual Global 
Community Day, I joined my colleagues 
to plant trees, organize the library and 
install computers at a primary school 
outside Mexico City. I felt just as much 
pride in the project as I did in the fact 
that I was joining over 100,000 others 
as they revitalized parks, served and 
collected food to those in need, and

in so many other ways volunteered to 
serve our communities.

Our commitment to support the 
communities we serve was sorely tested 
by the devastation wrought by hurricanes 
Harvey and Irma, which in rapid 
succession swept through Texas, Florida 
and the Caribbean. In those and other 
areas impacted by natural disasters in 
2017, including Mexico City, which suffered 
a massive earthquake, and Southeast 
Asia, hit hard by flooding, hundreds of 
our people went to extraordinary lengths 
to support and protect their colleagues, 
clients and communities. Working closely 
with local and global nonprofits, including 
the American Red Cross, in all those 
stricken communities our rapid response 
efforts provided funds, necessities and 
volunteer contributions to those in urgent 
need of relief. My Citi colleagues delivered 
22 tons of food and supplies to colleagues 
and communities across Puerto Rico in 
the wake of the storms. Over a two-week 
period after Irma and Harvey, we further 
supported the Red Cross by enabling it to 
re-route phone calls to specially trained 
agents in our Hagerstown, Maryland call 
center, who assisted 1,800 individuals  
in search of emergency support or  
family members.

The vast human and property losses 
those destructive storms left in their 
wake were powerful reminders of the 
extreme weather many more places 
are experiencing as a result of global 
warming. With extreme weather events 
becoming more common, enhancing 
resiliency is a key objective of our 
efforts to finance vital infrastructure in 
partnership with public sector agencies 
and entities worldwide.

Three years ago, we established a new

in Pathways is the largest single 
philanthropic commitment in its history.

In conclusion, a word I used more than 
once at our Investor Day to describe 
how I feel about where we are today and 
where we are going is “pride.” The Citi 
of today and tomorrow is a place all our 
colleagues are proud to work for and all 
our clients can be proud to work with. I 
am grateful to you for standing with us. 
Looking back on the decisions we made 
to prudently grow, and the decision you 
made to invest with us, I hope you share 
my conviction and belief that our best 
days and years are to come.

in 19 markets worldwide. 

BCiti’s Global Consumer Bank (GCB), one of the world’s leading digital 
C
G

A global leader in credit cards, wealth management and commercial 
banking, the Global Consumer Bank is a compelling franchise: a globally 
recognized brand; strong competitive positions in a mix of developed and 
emerging markets; best-in-class value propositions; high-quality target 
clients; leading digital capabilities; and disciplined credit and expense 
management. 

GCB drives client-led growth in three priority markets — Asia, Mexico 
and the U.S. — by deploying its global scale, products and capabilities, 
particularly digital, to differentiate locally with high impact and relevance. 

In 2017, we continued to execute on investments in key growth areas, 
especially U.S. Cards, Mexico and technology, fueling the engines of 
future growth. We enhanced our products and expanded premier 
partnerships, igniting growth in revenues, customers and customer 
satisfaction while maintaining risk discipline. Our focus on wealth 
management intensified, and we continued to calibrate our distribution 
network, utilizing a mix of Citi Smart Banking formats, to ensure the right 
mix of “bricks and clicks.” 

With client engagement rapidly shifting to digital channels, mobile 
continues to be at the core of a simpler, better customer experience.  
With an increasingly agile model and mobile first approach, GCB 
dramatically accelerated its speed to market and the number of new 
digital features, up 300 percent versus 2016, driving robust double-digit 
growth in the number of digital and mobile users globally. Innovative 
solutions were launched across lending, wealth management, payments 
and cards, many of which were industry firsts, delivering greater speed, 
ease and convenience. And by partnering with leading digital ecosystems, 
we embedded our services in the platforms our clients use every day, 
driving increased engagement. 

Today, following several years of streamlining and targeted investments, 
GCB comes to market with leading positions in core markets, far 
stronger products and digital capabilities than ever before, and multiple 
engines for future growth. Clients and the industry took note with Citi 
garnering key awards and recognition, including World’s Best Digital Bank 
(Euromoney), Best Digital Bank in six Asia markets (Global Finance), #1 in 

Customer Satisfaction for the second 
consecutive year (American Customer 
Satisfaction Index) and Best Retail Bank 
for High-Net-Worth Families in the U.S. 
(Kiplinger’s).

GCB operates approximately 2,450 
branches and generated $7.2 billion 
in pretax earnings, representing 32 
percent of Citigroup’s total. In 2017, the 
business held $306 billion in average 
deposits, managed $418 billion in 
average assets and included $297 
billion in average loans.

Credit Cards
As the world’s largest credit card 
issuer, Citi is a payments powerhouse, 
with premier partners, more than 142 
million accounts, $499 billion in annual 
purchase sales, and $154 billion in 
average receivables across Citi Branded 
Cards and Citi Retail Services. 

Citi Branded Cards
An important growth engine for GCB, 
Citi Branded Cards provides payment 
and credit solutions to consumers 
and small businesses, with 56 million 
accounts globally. In 2017, the business 
generated annual purchase sales of 
$418 billion and had an average loan 
portfolio of $108 billion.

Building a balanced portfolio across 
proprietary and co-brand products 
coupled with acquiring multi-year 
investments to provide differentiated 
value and experiences are starting to 
bear fruit, with gains in market share, 
acquisitions, purchase sales and loans.

several issuing platforms.

In addition to reaching clients where, 
when and how they want to engage 
with us, technology is enabling smarter, 
more efficient decisions about what 
products and services are best suited 
for them. By deploying machine 
learning and big data platforms, we 
are improving the effectiveness of the

stages, utilizing models that allow us 
to understand each individual’s wallet 
is driving significant improvements in 
response rates, efficiency, and retention 
of balances and spend. In the U.S., for 
example, about half of new credit card 
accounts originate through digital

Global Consumer 
Banking
Citi Retail Services
Citi Retail Services is one of North 
America’s largest providers of private 
label and co-brand credit cards for 
retailers, serving 86 million accounts 
for iconic brands, including Best Buy, 
ExxonMobil, Macy’s, Sears, Shell and 
The Home Depot. 

In 2017, Citi Retail Services strengthened 
its portfolio of leading brands by 
renewing its agreement with Ford 
Motor Company and expanding into 
power sports and equipment through 
agreements with American Honda Motor 
Corp., BRP, Honda Power Equipment and 
Kawasaki Motors Corp., U.S.A. 

In addition to new and expanded 
partnerships, Citi Retail Services utilized 
its multi-channel expertise, advanced 
data analytics and digital solutions 
to help its retail partners grow their 
businesses. These included “Apply and 
Buy,” enabling consumers nationwide 
to apply for the ExxonMobil Smart 
Card credit card directly through the 
app and begin immediately saving on 
fuel purchases and the relaunch of the 
Sears Mastercard with expanded Shop 
Your Way rewards, an industry-leading 
rewards offer in which customers can 
earn rewards points on all purchases 
everywhere they shop.

In 2017, Citi Retail Services saw purchase

Retail Banking
Citibank’s relationship model serves 
clients across the full spectrum of 
consumer banking needs through its 
lean, urban-based branch footprint, 
leading digital capabilities and expanding 
client-centric ecosystem.

A global leader in wealth management, 
Citi provides personalized wealth 
management services, including 
dedicated bankers, fund access, and  
a range of exclusive privileges,  
preferred pricing and benefits to  
clients around the globe through its 
Citigold®, Citigold Private Client and  
Citi Priority client offerings.

In the U.S., Citi’s growing retail bank 
continues to implement a multi-year 
network transformation, reducing its 
branch footprint by nearly a third since 
2013 while upgrading formats and 
concentrating resources in six priority 
markets. With the highest deposits per 
branch versus peers in core markets, 
Citi’s network is increasingly productive 
and convenient. In 2017, Citi nearly 
doubled its fee-free ATM network, 
making it the largest nationwide. 

Sweeping enhancements to its Citigold 
wealth and investment offering, 
introduced in late 2016, drove growth 
in households and balances and 
increased penetration of investment 
products. In 2017, Citi added to the 
number of Relationship Managers and 
Financial Advisors by 18 percent and 
opened a dedicated wealth center in 
Miami and broke ground on another in 
San Francisco to provide clients with 
personalized service, industry-leading 
expertise and a distinctive experience.

Across the U.S., Citi continued to 
fuel the growth of small businesses, 
supporting job creation and thriving 
communities across the country. In 
2017, Citi invested more than $11 billion 
in small business lending in the U.S. 
and also financed over $4.7 billion in 
affordable housing projects.

In Mortgage, Citi announced it would 
effectively exit direct servicing operations 
by the end of 2018. This strategic action 
will enable the business to intensify 
focus on originations and simplify 
operations. CitiMortgage, which provides 
loans for home purchase and refinance 
transactions in the U.S., originated $13.1 
billion in new loans in 2017. 

In Asia, Citi extended its leadership in 
wealth management by refreshing the 
Citigold brand campaign in 13 markets 
and streamlined its branch network in 
key markets, including China and Korea, 
to adapt to consumers’ preference and 
migration to digital channels. In addition, 
partnerships with many of the most 

popular digital ecosystems in the region 
and a host of innovative digital solutions 
were introduced. Digital and mobile 
enhancements include instant lending 
via mobile, simplified authentication 
through a mobile token, fingerprint and 
facial recognition, eFX capabilities and 
two industry firsts: a natural language 
chatbot on Facebook Messenger in 
Singapore and interactive, live video 
banking in India. Citi also introduced 
P2P payments services in Hong Kong 
and Singapore in conjunction with 
government authorities.

In Mexico, Citibanamex enjoys a 
preeminent position as the #1 recognized 
bank brand with leading positions across 
deposits, investments and loan products. 
Following the 2016 announcement of 
a $1 billion investment to upgrade its 
network and technology, Citi continued 
to execute, renovating more than 70 
Smart branches and installing over 
1,600 additional ATMs, sharpening 
client segmentation, enhancing value 

propositions and improving data 
capabilities to enhance both acquisitions 
and the client experience in digital.

Commercial Banking
Citi Commercial Banking brings the 
best of Citi’s institutional and consumer 
franchises to clients, providing global 
banking capabilities and services to mid-
sized, trade-oriented companies within 
Citi’s footprint. As many of these clients 
expand internationally, Citi helps enable 
their growth and ability to access capital 
across multiple countries, one of Citi’s 
core activities. 

In 2017, the business successfully 
deepened client relationships in key 
segments and industries, digitized client 
touch points and sales and service tools, 
and improved client satisfaction. In the 
U.S., Citi Commercial Bank earned a  
Best Brand Award in Middle Market 
Banking by Greenwich Associates 
for embracing digitization, enabling

investment services, working capital 
solutions, commercial card programs 
and trade finance. Based on the belief 
that client experience is the driver of 
sustainable differentiation, TTS has 
focused its efforts on transforming its 
business to deliver a seamless, end-
to-end client experience through the 
development of its capabilities, client 
advocacy, network management and 
service delivery across the entire 
organization. 

In 2017, TTS improved the efficiency of 
its global network by launching API-
driven connectivity services and global 
solutions for payments and receivables. 
The CitiConnect® API allows clients 
to directly connect with Citi across 
96 countries to access services using 
their own Treasury Workstations or 
Enterprise Resource Platform, providing 
convenience, potential cost savings and 
reduced risk. 

Partnering with Nasdaq, Citi participated 
in a pioneering blockchain and global 
banking integration that enabled 
straight-through payment processing 
and automated reconciliation by using a 
distributed ledger to manage payment 
instructions. This collaboration created 
a solution that integrates blockchain 
technology with Citi’s global network-
leveraging API technology. Citi also 
provided the payment processing 
services for Allianz Global Corporate 
& Specialty SE in a successful trial of 
blockchain technology for a global 
captive insurance program, including 
cash transfer between countries. 

TTS continues building integrated global 
solutions to optimize its global payments 
network in an efficient and consistent 
manner. These solutions offer clients 
the ability to participate in commerce in 
new markets, through low-cost payment 
options delivered through digital 
channels. Citi expanded the global reach 

of its services to support the growing 
needs of corporations to receive and 
initiate payments. Citi Payer ID was 
launched in 17 new markets across North 
America and Western Europe, making it 
now available in 44 countries to allow 
institutional clients to manage their 
working capital with greater efficiency. 
Citi’s WorldLink® Payment Services 
capability expanded cross-border ACH 
capabilities to 60 countries, offering a 
simple, global and digital cross-currency 
payments solution with service offered 
across a range of payment options in 135 
currencies and 195 countries. 

Our Trade business continues to help 
our clients with various strategies to 
optimize their working capital around 
the globe. In addition, we continue 
to drive innovation in our back office 
using optical character recognition 
to drive efficiencies and enhance our 
client experience.

Citizenship

Our impact and reach would not be possible without the commitment, 
expertise and resources of partner organizations — from our clients and 
suppliers to non-governmental organizations, the public sector and other 
stakeholders. These partnerships enable us to understand and stay on top of 
the changing social and economic landscape globally and, together, identify 
and implement solutions that help address the world’s toughest challenges. 

by deploying the resources and strengths of our core business and 
operations. The Citi Foundation supports programs in its target focus 
areas that help promote economic progress and improve the lives of 
people in low-income communities around the world. We continually 
look for ways to more effectively achieve our mission of enabling growth 
and progress by serving as collaborative problem solvers in addressing 
social and environmental challenges that impact our work today and for 
future generations. We believe this approach to corporate citizenship 
is fundamental to the long-term success of the communities where we 
operate, our clients and our own company.

Many of these challenges — including achieving financial security for 
low-income communities, tackling youth unemployment and combating 
climate change — are aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs), the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by the 
193 Member States of the United Nations in 2015. As a global bank, Citi 
believes it is important to take a leading role in contributing to the SDGs.

In 2016, Citi released Banking on 2030: 
Citi & the Sustainable Development 
Goals, a report that looks at how 
Citi and the Citi Foundation directly 
contribute to the SDGs, with a focus on 
seven goals where we are particularly 
well-positioned to drive significant 
progress based on our core business 
and specialized Citizenship initiatives. 

Issues core to our Citizenship efforts 
include: 

Jobs and the next generation 
The world of work continues to evolve at 
a rapid pace. The changing job landscape, 
coupled with a persistently high youth 
unemployment rate, requires young 
people to have the power skills necessary 
— like communications, networking 
and problem-solving experiences — to 
compete within high-growth fields, 
including technology and healthcare. 
Through Pathways to Progress, Citi and 
the Citi Foundation are connecting young 
people to jobs, financial education and 
leadership opportunities that prepare 
them for a 21st century job market. 
In February 2017, under Pathways to 
Progress, the Citi Foundation announced 
its largest philanthropic commitment 
ever to invest $100 million to reach 
500,000 youth by 2020. Additionally, 
we are leveraging the time and talents of 
10,000 Citi volunteers to act as mentors 
and coaches who can provide guidance 
to help young people move toward their 
career goals. 

Together with our nonprofit partners 
across the globe, we have reached more 
than 200,000 young people in 2017 and 
helped them gain employability skills and 
connect to new or first job opportunities.

Meet Mery
“When I interviewed with 
companies, they told 
me I didn’t have enough 
experience or that they 
would rather hire a man.”

Mery: Lima, Peru; Laboratoria 

Mery had a degree in computer and information sciences but was 
unable to secure a job in the tech industry. She was then recruited  
by Laboratoria, a nonprofit organization that trains young women  
in Lima, Peru to become web developers. After excelling in her  
pre-admission classes and using the knowledge she acquired during 
the program, Mery secured a full-time job as a front-end developer. 
She is currently building a web platform that will allow companies  
to post job opportunities exclusively for Laboratoria graduates. 

Over 3,500 Citi employees have 
volunteered to support the economic 
aspirations of young people globally.

In 2017, as part of Pathways to Progress, 
the Citi Foundation became the first 
foundation to sign on to the Global 
Initiative on Decent Jobs for Youth, 
which is aligned with the SDGs. The Citi 
Foundation is committed to supporting 
the operationalization of the International 
Labour Organization’s Global Initiative 
and to report the outcomes of its work 
and how it contributes to the provision of 
decent jobs for youth. 

Sustainable cities 
Local governments and community 
organizations are often on the front 
line of complex challenges like strained 
infrastructure, affordable housing 
shortages and unemployment, 
particularly in low-income areas. But 
local leaders, in both the public and 
nonprofit sectors, are continually 

facing budget and resource shortages. 
Increased collaboration and investment 
in innovative, efficient solutions can help 
address old problems in new ways. 

Some of these efforts include supporting 
integral parts of a thriving community, 
including small businesses and affordable 
housing. In 2017, Citi invested more than 
$11 billion in small business lending in the 
U.S. We also financed over $4.7 billion in 
affordable housing projects in 2017.

To further test new ways to drive 
sustainable growth while increasing 
economic opportunity for lower-income 
residents, the Citi Foundation’s City 
Accelerator program, in partnership with 
Living Cities, has worked directly with 
17 municipalities in the U.S. since 2014. 
For example, the city of San Francisco 
used its City Accelerator support to 
develop a financing plan to reinforce 
the city’s coastal seawall, which protects 
vital public transportation assets and 

land designated for affordable housing 
on a parcel adjacent to the Port of 
San Francisco. Participation in the City 
Accelerator program resulted in a cross-
departmental partnership that worked to 
successfully include the seawall project 
in the city’s 10-year capital plan and 
secure millions of capital funding dollars. 

In 2017, the Citi Foundation and Living 
Cities announced the expansion of the City 
Accelerator program to five additional U.S. 
cities — Charlotte, Chicago, Los Angeles, 
Memphis and Milwaukee. These cities will 
work together over the next year to refine 
their approach to procurement spending, 
pursuing at least one new strategy to 
increase the diversity of municipal vendors 
and contractors and direct more spend to 
local minority-owned businesses. 

Citi and the Citi Foundation also work 
with community organizations to 
amplify their impact. Through the 
Community Progress Makers Fund, the 
Citi Foundation is helping to build vibrant, 
sustainable cities that offer economic 
opportunities for low-income residents. 
The $20 million initiative provided multi-
year core operating grant support to 40 
high-impact community organizations in 
six U.S. cities. Over two years, Community 
Progress Makers helped 14,000 people 
build financial assets, including $137 
million in tax credits and savings; 
connected 3,000 youth to jobs; and 
helped 1,000 small businesses expand or 
improve. More than 120 Citi employees 
provided pro bono, volunteer advisory 
services to these community-based 
organizations. In 2017, the Citi Foundation 
announced an additional $20 million 
investment in the Community Progress 
Makers Fund.

Citizenship

Sustainable growth
As part of our ongoing support of the 
Paris Agreement and as the flagship 
initiative of our Sustainable Progress 
Strategy, Citi continues to make 
notable progress on our commitment 
to finance and facilitate $100 billion 
in environmental finance activity such 
as renewable energy, sustainable 
infrastructure and clean technology 
projects that are helping to build a 
more sustainable economy.

In our latest report, Sustainable Growth 
at Citi: Progress and Impacts of Citi’s 
$100 Billion Environmental Finance 
Goal, we share details about our 
progress to date, how we’re measuring 

our environmental and social impacts 
and what we’re learning in partnership 
with our clients.

In the first four years of our 10-year 
commitment, Citi has already financed  
and facilitated $57 billion in environmental 
solutions in partnership with our clients, 
which will help address climate change 
and benefit society. 

In 2017, we also announced an 
ambitious goal to source renewable 
power for 100 percent of our global 
energy needs by 2020. For the 57+ 
million square feet of real estate 
owned or leased globally, Citi will 
consider onsite power generation, 
power purchase agreements for 
energy-intensive properties such as 
data centers, and appropriate use of 
renewable energy credits, as well as

In 2017, Citi provided tax equity 
financing with BHE Renewables 
(a division of Berkshire Hathaway 
Energy) to the Goldwind Americas 
160 megawatt Rattlesnake Wind 
Project in McCulloch County, Texas. 
Citi also provided the long-term 
fixed-price power hedge. Goldwind is 
a subsidiary of China-based Xinjiang 
Goldwind Science & Technology Co. 
Ltd., the largest manufacturer of 
permanent magnet direct-drive wind 
turbines in the world. This project 
will be Goldwind’s largest U.S. project 
to date, utilizing 64 of its turbines. 
The Rattlesnake Wind Project, valued 
at approximately $250 million, will 
bring significant economic benefit 
to the community of McCulloch 
County, and the company estimates 
it will support approximately 250 
well-paying construction and service-
related jobs. For more information on

WORLD, WHAT CAN 
130 MILLION DO?

Malala Yousafzai
Co-founder of Malala Fund

More than 130 million girls are not in school, due to poverty, conflict, and other societal barriers. 
Malala Fund works to provide access to 12 years of free, safe, quality education for all girls.  
To achieve this goal, it offers financial support to education advocates around the world.

Needing a bank with global reach, Malala Fund turned to Citi. With presence in nearly 100 
countries, Citi assures these advocates ready, reliable access to the resources they need and 
enables Malala Fund to expand its efforts with confidence. Education for a girl doesn’t just 
improve her life; Malala is proof that it can help change the world. 

For over 200 years, Citi’s job has been to believe in people and help make their ideas a reality.

OVERVIEW

Citigroup’s history dates back to the founding of the City
Bank of New York in 1812.

Citigroup is a global diversified financial services holding 
company whose businesses provide consumers, corporations, 
governments and institutions with a broad, yet focused, range 
of financial products and services, including consumer 
banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, 
securities brokerage, trade and securities services and wealth 
management. Citi has approximately 200 million customer 
accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and 
jurisdictions.

At December 31, 2017, Citi had approximately 209,000 
full-time employees, compared to approximately 219,000 full-
time employees at December 31, 2016.

Citigroup currently operates, for management reporting 

purposes, via two primary business segments: Global 
Consumer Banking and Institutional Clients Group, with the 
remaining operations in Corporate/Other. For a further 
description of the business segments and the products and 
services they provide, see “Citigroup Segments” below,

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

As described further throughout this Executive Summary, Citi 
reported balanced operating results for full-year 2017, 
reflecting continued momentum across businesses and 
geographies, notably many of those where Citi has been 
making investments. 

During 2017, Citi had revenue and loan growth and 
positive operating leverage as well as operating margin 
expansion in the Institutional Clients Group (ICG) and every 
region in Global Consumer Banking (GCB). Citi also 
continued to demonstrate strong expense discipline, resulting 
in an operating efficiency ratio of 58% in 2017. Results in 
2017 also included an updated estimate for a one-time, non-
cash charge of $22.6 billion related to the impact of the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform), which impacted the tax line 
within Corporate/Other, as well as the tax lines in North 
America GCB and ICG (for additional information on this 
updated estimate, see “Impact of Tax Reform” below).

In 2017, Citi increased the amount of capital returned to 
shareholders, while each of its key regulatory capital metrics 
remained strong (see “Capital” below). During the year, Citi 
returned approximately $17.1 billion in the form of common 
stock repurchases and dividends and repurchased 
approximately 214 million common shares as outstanding 
common shares declined 7% from the prior year. 

Going into 2018, while economic sentiment has improved 
and the macroeconomic environment remains largely positive, 
there continue to be various economic, political and other risks 
and uncertainties that could impact Citi’s businesses and 
future results. For a more detailed discussion of the risks and 
uncertainties that could impact Citi’s businesses, results of 
operations and financial condition during 2018, see each 
respective business’s results of operations, “Risk Factors” and 
“Managing Global Risk” below. Despite these risks and 
uncertainties, Citi intends to continue to build on the progress 
made during 2017 with a focus on further optimizing its 
performance to benefit shareholders.

2017 Summary Results

Citigroup
Citigroup reported a net loss of $6.8 billion, or $2.98 per 
share, compared to net income of $14.9 billion, or $4.72 per 
share, in the prior year. Excluding the impact of Tax Reform, 
Citigroup net income of $15.8 billion increased 6% compared 
to the prior year, reflecting higher revenues, partially offset by 
higher cost of credit, while earnings per share increased 13%, 
including the impact of a 7% reduction in average shares 
outstanding. (Citi’s results of operations excluding the impact 
of Tax Reform are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi 
believes the presentation of its results of operations excluding 
the impact of Tax Reform provides a meaningful depiction for 
investors of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses.) 
For additional information regarding the impact of Tax 
Reform, see “Impact of Tax Reform,” “Risk Factors,” 

6

“Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—
Income Taxes” below and Notes 1 and 9 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

Citigroup revenues of $71.4 billion in 2017 increased 2%, 

driven by 6% aggregate growth in ICG and GCB, partially 
offset by a 40% decrease in Corporate/Other, primarily due to 
the continued wind-down of legacy assets. 

Citigroup’s end-of-period loans increased 7% to $667 

billion versus the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of 
foreign currency translation in U.S. dollars for reporting 
purposes (FX translation), Citigroup’s end-of-period loans 
grew 5%, as 9% growth in ICG and 4% growth in GCB was 
partially offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets in 
Corporate/Other (Citi’s results of operations excluding the 
impact of FX translation are non-GAAP financial measures. 
Citi believes the presentation of its results of operations 
excluding the impact of FX translation provides a meaningful 
depiction for investors of the underlying fundamentals of its 
businesses). Citigroup’s end-of-period deposits increased 3% 
to $960 billion versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of 
FX translation, Citigroup’s deposits were up 1%, as a 2% 
increase in ICG deposits was partially offset by a decline in 
Corporate/ Other deposits, and GCB deposits were largely 
unchanged.

Expenses
Citigroup operating expenses were largely unchanged versus 
the prior year, as the impact of higher volume-related expenses 
and ongoing investments were offset by efficiency savings and 
the wind-down of legacy assets. Year-over-year, ICG operating 
expenses were up 3% and GCB operating expenses increased 
2%, while Corporate/Other operating expenses declined 24%, 
all versus the prior year.

Cost of Credit
Citi’s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and 
claims of $7.5 billion increased 7% from the prior year. The 
increase was mostly driven by a $515 million increase in net 
credit losses, primarily in North America GCB, partially offset 
by a lower provision for benefits and claims due to continued 
legacy asset divestitures within Corporate/Other. The net loan 
loss reserve build of $266 million compared to a net loan loss 
reserve build of $217 million in the prior year. The increase 
was mostly due to volume growth and seasoning, as well as 
the impact of loan loss reserve builds related to forward-
looking net credit loss expectations, all in the North America 
cards portfolios, partially offset by a higher net reserve release 
in ICG.

Net credit losses of $7.1 billion increased 8% versus the 

prior year. Consumer net credit losses increased 11% to
$6.7 billion, mostly reflecting volume growth and seasoning in 
the North America cards portfolios and the impact of acquiring 
the Costco portfolio. The increase in consumer net credit 
losses was partially offset by the continued wind-down of 
legacy assets in Corporate/Other. Corporate net credit losses 

decreased 26% to $379 million, largely driven by 
improvement in the energy sector.

For additional information on Citi’s consumer and 

corporate credit costs and allowance for loan losses, see each 
respective business’s results of operations and “Credit Risk” 
below.

Capital
Citigroup’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital 
ratios, on a fully implemented basis, were 12.4% and 14.1% as 
of December 31, 2017 (based on the Basel III Standardized 
Approach for determining risk-weighted assets), respectively, 
compared to 12.6% and 14.2% as of December 31, 2016 
(based on the Basel III Advanced Approaches for determining 
risk-weighted assets). The decline in regulatory capital 
reflected the return of capital to common shareholders and an 
approximately $6 billion reduction in Common Equity Tier 1 
(CET1) Capital due to the impact of Tax Reform, partially 
offset by earnings growth. Citigroup’s Supplementary 
Leverage ratio as of December 31, 2017, on a fully 
implemented basis, was 6.7%, compared to 7.2% as of 
December 31, 2016. For additional information on Citi’s 
capital ratios and related components, including the impact of 
Tax Reform on its capital ratios, see “Capital Resources” 
below. 

Global Consumer Banking
GCB net income decreased 21%. Excluding the impact of Tax 
Reform, GCB net income decreased 6%, as higher revenues 
were more than offset by higher expenses and higher cost of 
credit. Operating expenses were $17.8 billion, up 2%, as 
higher volume-related expenses and continued investments 
were partially offset by efficiency savings. 

GCB revenues of $32.7 billion increased 4% versus the 

prior year, driven by growth across all regions. North America 
GCB revenues increased 3% to $20.3 billion, driven by higher 
revenues across all businesses. Citi-branded cards revenues of 
$8.6 billion were up 5% versus the prior year, mostly 
reflecting the addition of the Costco portfolio as well as 
modest growth in interest-earning balances, partially offset by 
the continued run-off of non-core portfolios as well as a higher 
cost to fund growth in transactor and promotional balances, 
given higher interest rates. Citi retail services revenues of $6.4 
billion increased 1% versus the prior year, as continued loan 
growth was partially offset by the impact of the renewal and 
extension of certain partnerships, as well as the absence of 
gains on sales of two cards portfolios in 2016. Retail banking 
revenues increased 1% from the prior year to $5.3 billion. 
Excluding mortgage revenues, retail banking revenues of $4.5 
billion were up 9% from the prior year, driven by continued 
growth in loans and assets under management, as well as a 
benefit from higher interest rates.

North America GCB average deposits of $184 billion 
increased 1% year-over-year, average retail loans of $56 
billion grew 3% and assets under management of $60 billion 
grew 14%. Average Citi-branded card loans of $85 billion 
increased 15%, while Citi-branded card purchase sales of $320 
billion increased 28% versus the prior year. Average Citi retail 
services loans of $46 billion increased 4% versus the prior 

7

year, while retail services purchase sales of $81 billion were 
up 2%. For additional information on the results of operations 
of North America GCB for 2017, see “Global Consumer 
Banking—North America GCB” below.

International GCB revenues (consisting of Latin America 
GCB and Asia GCB (which includes the results of operations 
in certain EMEA countries)) increased 6% versus the prior 
year to $12.4 billion. Excluding the impact of FX translation, 
international GCB revenues increased 5% versus the prior 
year. Latin America GCB revenues increased 6% versus the 
prior year, driven by growth in loans and deposits, as well as 
improved deposit spreads. Asia GCB revenues increased 5% 
(4% excluding modest gains on the sales of merchant 
acquiring businesses in the second and fourth quarters of 
2017) versus the prior year, primarily reflecting an increase in 
cards revenues and wealth management revenues, partially 
offset by lower retail lending revenues. For additional 
information on the results of operations of Latin America GCB 
and Asia GCB for 2017, including the impact of FX 
translation, see “Global Consumer Banking—Latin America 
GCB” and “Global Consumer Banking—Asia GCB” below. 
Year-over-year, international GCB average deposits of 

$122 billion increased 5%, average retail loans of $87 billion 
were largely unchanged, assets under management of $101 
billion increased 14%, average card loans of $24 billion 
increased 5% and card purchase sales of $98 billion increased 
7%, all excluding the impact of FX translation.

Institutional Clients Group
ICG net income decreased 5%. Excluding the impact of Tax 
Reform, ICG net income increased 16%, driven by higher 
revenues and a small benefit to cost of credit (compared to a 
$486 million cost of credit in the prior year), partially offset by 
higher operating expenses. ICG operating expenses increased 
3% to $19.6 billion, as higher compensation, investments and 
volume-related expenses were partially offset by efficiency 
savings.

ICG revenues were $35.7 billion in 2017, up 7% from the 

prior year, primarily driven by a 16% increase in Banking 
revenues. Markets and securities services were largely 
unchanged versus the prior year. The increase in Banking 
revenues included the impact of $133 million of losses on loan 
hedges within corporate lending, compared to losses of $594 
million in the prior year.

Banking revenues of $18.7 billion (excluding the impact 
of losses on loan hedges within corporate lending) increased 
12%, driven by solid growth across all products. Investment 
banking revenues of $5.2 billion increased 20% versus the 
prior year, reflecting wallet share gains across all products. 
Advisory revenues increased 11% to $1.1 billion, equity 
underwriting revenues increased 68% to $1.1 billion and debt 
underwriting revenues increased 13% to $3.0 billion, all 
versus the prior year.

Private bank revenues increased 14% from the prior year, 
driven by growth in clients, loans, investments and deposits, 
as well as improved spreads. Corporate lending revenues 
increased 59% to $1.8 billion. Excluding the impact of losses 
on loan hedges, corporate lending revenues increased 12% 
versus the prior year, primarily driven by lower hedging costs, 

as well as the prior-year adjustment to the residual value of a 
lease financing. Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $8.5 
billion increased 7% versus the prior year, reflecting volume 
growth and improved spreads, with balanced growth across 
net interest and fee income.

Markets and securities services revenues of $17.1 billion 

were largely unchanged from the prior year, as a decline in 
fixed income markets and equity markets revenues was offset 
by an increase in securities services revenues as well as a $580 
million gain on the sale of a fixed income analytics business. 
Fixed income markets revenues of $12.1 billion decreased 6% 
from the prior year, reflecting low volatility, as well as the 
comparison to higher revenues from a more robust trading 
environment in the prior year following the vote in the U.K. in 
favor of its withdrawal from the European Union, as well as 
the U.S. election. Equity markets revenues of $2.7 billion 
decreased 2% from the prior year, driven by an episodic loss 
in derivatives of roughly $130 million related to a single client 
event. Excluding this item, equity markets revenues increased 
2% from the prior year, driven by growth in client balances 
and higher investor client revenue. Securities services 
revenues of $2.3 billion increased 8%, driven by growth in 
client volumes and higher interest revenue. For additional 
information on the results of operations of ICG for 2017, see 
“Institutional Clients Group” below.

Corporate/Other
Corporate/Other net loss was $19.7 billion in 2017, compared 
to net income of $498 million in the prior year. Excluding the 
impact of Tax Reform, Corporate/Other net income declined 
69% to $153 million, reflecting lower revenues, partially 
offset by lower operating expenses and lower cost of credit. 
Operating expenses of $3.8 billion declined 24% from the 
prior-year period, reflecting the wind-down of legacy assets 
and lower legal expenses.

Corporate/Other revenues were $3.1 billion, down 40% 

from the prior year, primarily reflecting the wind-down of 
legacy assets as well as the absence of gains related to debt 
buybacks in 2016. 

Corporate/Other end-of-period assets of $77 billion 

decreased 25% from the prior year, reflecting the continued 
wind-down of legacy assets as well as the impact of Tax 
Reform, which reduced assets by approximately $20 billion. 
For additional information on the results of operations of 
Corporate/Other for 2017, see “Corporate/Other” below.

Impact of Tax Reform
Citi’s full-year 2017 results included the updated estimate for 
a one-time, non-cash charge of $22.6 billion, recorded within 
Corporate/Other, North America GCB and ICG related to the 
enactment of Tax Reform, which was signed into law on 
December 22, 2017. This updated estimate resulted in a 
downward adjustment to fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 
financial results, as well as changes in the segments where the 
impact was recorded (previously, the entire charge was 
recorded in Corporate/Other), from those reported on January 
16, 2018, by an aggregate of $594 million due to refinements 
of original estimates. The approximate $6 billion reduction in 
CET1 Capital due to the impact of Tax Reform was 
unchanged.

This charge was composed of a $12.4 billion 

remeasurement of Citi’s deferred tax assets (DTAs) due to the 
reduction to the U.S. corporate tax rate and the change to a 
quasi-territorial tax system (see “Significant Accounting 
Policies and Estimates—Income Taxes” below), a $7.9 billion 
valuation allowance against Citi’s foreign tax credit (FTC) 
carry-forwards and its U.S. residual DTAs related to its non-
U.S. branches, and a $2.3 billion reduction in Citi’s FTC 
carry-forwards related to the deemed repatriation of 
undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries.

The financial results in the table below disclose the as-

reported GAAP results for 2017 and 2016, the impact of Tax 
Reform and the 2017 adjusted results excluding the impact of 
Tax Reform. The charge related to Tax Reform is reflected in 
Citi’s results throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, 
unless otherwise noted. 

The final impact of Tax Reform may differ from the 

estimate due to, among other things, changes in assumptions 

made by Citigroup and additional guidance that may be issued 
by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. For more information 
on possible changes to the estimated impact related to Tax 
Reform, see “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” below and Notes 
1 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

GLOBAL CONSUMER BANKING
Global Consumer Banking (GCB) consists of consumer banking businesses in North America, Latin America (consisting of Citi’s 
consumer banking business in Mexico) and Asia. GCB provides traditional banking services to retail customers through retail banking, 
including commercial banking, and Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services (for additional information on these businesses, see 
“Citigroup Segments” above). GCB is focused on its priority markets in the U.S., Mexico and Asia with 2,451 branches in 19 
countries and jurisdictions as of December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, GCB had approximately $429 billion in assets and 
$307 billion in deposits.
      GCB’s overall strategy is to leverage Citi’s global footprint and be the pre-eminent bank for the emerging affluent and affluent 
consumers in large urban centers. In credit cards and in certain retail markets, Citi serves customers in a somewhat broader set of 
segments and geographies.

NORTH AMERICA GCB
North America GCB provides traditional retail banking, including commercial banking, Citi-branded cards products and Citi retail 
services card products to retail customers and small to mid-size businesses, as applicable, in the U.S. North America GCB’s U.S. cards 
product portfolio includes its proprietary portfolio (including the Citi Double Cash, Thank You and Value cards) and co-branded cards 
(including, among others, American Airlines and Costco) within Citi-branded cards as well as its co-brand and private label 
relationships (including, among others, Sears, The Home Depot, Best Buy and Macy’s) within Citi retail services. 

As previously announced, the Hilton Honors co-brand credit card partnership with Citi was scheduled to terminate as of year-end 
2017. On October 23, 2017, Citi signed an agreement to sell the Hilton credit card portfolio (approximately $1.1 billion in outstanding 
loan balances in Citi-branded cards as of December 31, 2017) to American Express. In connection with the sale agreement, the 
existing partnership was extended through the closing date. The sale was completed on January 30, 2018, resulting in a pretax gain of 
approximately $150 million, which approximates one year of revenues from the portfolio. The sale will impact North America GCB’s 
quarterly comparisons in 2018. 

As of December 31, 2017, North America GCB’s 694 retail bank branches are concentrated in the six key metropolitan areas of 
New York, Chicago, Miami, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and San Francisco. Also as of December 31, 2017, North America GCB 
had approximately 9.2 million retail banking customer accounts, $56.0 billion in retail banking loans and $182.5 billion in deposits. In 
addition, North America GCB had approximately 121 million Citi-branded and Citi retail services credit card accounts with $139.7 
billion in outstanding card loan balances.

2017 vs. 2016 
Net income decreased 37% and was impacted by an estimated 
$750 million non-cash charge recorded in the tax line due to 
the impact of Tax Reform (for additional information, see 
“Impact of Tax Reform” above). Excluding the impact of Tax 
Reform, net income decreased 14% due to higher cost of 
credit and slightly higher expenses, partially offset by higher 
revenues.

Revenues increased 3%, driven by higher revenues across 

all businesses. 

Retail banking revenues increased 1%. Excluding the 

decline in mortgage revenues (down of 32%), retail banking 
revenues were up 9%, driven by growth in checking deposits, 
continued growth in loans (average loans up 3%) and assets 
under management (up 14%) and increased commercial 
banking activity, as well as a benefit from higher interest rates. 
The decline in mortgage revenues was driven by lower 
origination activity and higher cost of funds, reflecting the 
higher interest rate environment, as well as the impact of the 
previously announced sale of a portion of Citi’s mortgage 
servicing rights. 

Cards revenues increased 3%. In Citi-branded cards, 

revenues increased 5%, primarily reflecting the acquisition of 
the Costco portfolio (completed June 17, 2016), as well as 
modest growth in interest-earning balances, partially offset by 
the continued run-off of non-core portfolios and the higher 
cost to fund growth in transactor and promotional balances, 
given the higher interest rates. Average loans grew 15% and 
purchase sales grew 28%. North America GCB expects that 
additional terms in certain partnership contracts that go into 
effect in 2018 will negatively impact Citi-branded cards 
revenues going forward. 

Citi retail services revenues increased 1%, as continued 

loan growth was partially offset by the impact of the 
previously disclosed renewal and extension of certain 
partnerships within the portfolio, as well as the absence of 
gains on sales of two cards portfolios in 2016. Average loans 
grew 4% and purchase sales grew 2%. 

Expenses increased 1%, driven by the addition of the 

Costco portfolio, higher volume-related expenses and 
investments, partially offset by efficiency savings. Also 
included in expenses is an $80 million provision for 
remediation costs related to a Credit Card Accountability 
Responsibility and Disclosure Act (CARD Act) matter (for 
additional information, see “Corporate/Other” below and 
Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

Provisions increased 24% from the prior year, driven by 

higher net credit losses and a higher net loan loss reserve 
build.

Net credit losses increased 22% to $4.8 billion, largely 
driven by higher net credit losses in Citi-branded cards (up 
28% to $2.4 billion) and Citi retail services (up 19% to $2.2 
billion). The increase in net credit losses primarily reflected 
volume growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios, as well 
as the impact of acquiring the Costco portfolio in Citi-branded 
cards. 

The net loan loss reserve build in 2017 was $873 million 
(compared to a build of $659 million in the prior year), driven 
by volume growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios, as 

well as the increase in net flow rates in later delinquency 
buckets leading to higher inherent credit loss expectations, 
primarily in Citi retail services.

For additional information on North America GCB’s retail 

banking portfolios, including commercial banking, and its 
Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services portfolios, see 
“Credit Risk—Consumer Credit” below.

2016 vs. 2015 
Net income decreased by 23% due to significantly higher cost 
of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by higher 
revenues.

Revenues increased 1%, reflecting higher revenues in 

Citi-branded cards, partially offset by lower revenues in retail 
banking and Citi retail services. Retail banking revenues 
decreased 2%. Excluding the previously disclosed $110 
million gain on sale of branches in Texas in the first quarter of 
2015, retail banking revenues were largely unchanged, as 
lower mortgage revenues were offset by continued volume 
growth, including growth in average loans (9%) and average 
checking deposits (9%). 

Cards revenues increased 2%. In Citi-branded cards, 

revenues increased 5%, primarily reflecting the acquisition of 
the Costco portfolio as well as volume growth, partially offset 
by higher investment-related acquisition and rewards costs and 
the impact of higher promotional balances. Citi retail services 
revenues decreased 1%, as the impact of the renewal and 
extension of several partnerships within the portfolio as well 
as the absence of revenues from portfolio exits were partially 
offset by modest growth in average loans. 

Expenses increased 7%, primarily due to the Costco 

acquisition, continued investment spending, volume growth, 
higher repositioning charges and regulatory and compliance 
costs, partially offset by ongoing efficiency savings and lower 
legal and related costs. 

Provisions increased 33%, driven by a net loan loss 

reserve build, compared to a loan loss reserve release in the 
prior year, and higher net credit losses. The net loan loss 
reserve build mostly reflected reserve builds in the cards 
portfolios and was primarily driven by the impact of the 
acquisition of the Costco portfolio, as well as volume growth 
and seasoning of the portfolios and the absence of nearly $400 
million of reserve releases in 2015 as credit normalized. The 
reserve build was also due to the estimated impact of proposed 
regulatory guidelines on third-party debt collections. 

The increase in net credit losses was driven by increases 
in cards and retail banking. In retail banking, net credit losses 
grew 37%, primarily due to an increase related to Citi’s energy 
and energy-related exposures within the commercial banking 
portfolio, which was largely offset by releases of previously 
established loan loss reserves. In Citi-branded cards, net credit 
losses increased 1%, driven by volume growth, including the 
impact of Costco beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, 
seasoning and the impact of the regulatory changes on 
collections. In Citi retail services, net credit losses increased 
6%, primarily due to portfolio growth and seasoning and the 
impact of the regulatory changes on collections.

NM   Not meaningful

The discussion of the results of operations for Latin America GCB below excludes the impact of FX translation for all periods 
presented. Presentations of the results of operations, excluding the impact of FX translation, are non-GAAP financial measures. For a 
reconciliation of certain of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.

2017 vs. 2016 
Net income decreased 5%, primarily driven by higher credit 
costs and expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.

Revenues increased 6%, driven by higher revenues in

retail banking.

Retail banking revenues increased 8%, reflecting 

continued growth in volumes, including an increase in average 
deposits (8%), average loans (6%), reflecting growth across 
most portfolios, an increase in assets under management (6%), 
as well as improved deposit spreads, driven by higher interest 
rates. Cards revenues were largely unchanged, as continued 
improvement in full-rate revolving loans in the second half of 
2017 was offset by a higher cost to fund non-revolving loans. 
Purchase sales grew 8% and average card loans grew 5%. 

Expenses increased 4%, as ongoing investment spending 

and business growth were partially offset by efficiency 
savings. Citi continues to execute on its investment plans for 
Citibanamex (totaling more than $1 billion through 2020), 
including initiatives to modernize the branch network, 
enhance digital capabilities and upgrade core operating 
platforms. 

Provisions increased 12%, primarily driven by higher net 
credit losses (8%) and a $42 million increase in the net loan 
loss reserve build, largely reflecting volume growth and 
seasoning. The increase in the loan loss reserve build was also 
driven by a Mexico earthquake-related loan loss reserve build 
in the third quarter of 2017 (approximately $25 million).

For additional information on Latin America GCB’s retail 

banking portfolios, including commercial banking, and its 
Citi-branded cards portfolio, see “Credit Risk—Consumer 
Credit” below.

For additional information on potential macroeconomic

and geopolitical challenges and other risks facing Latin
America GCB, see “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” below.

2016 vs. 2015 
Net income increased 7%, driven by higher revenues and 
lower expenses, partially offset by higher credit costs.

Revenues increased 1%, driven by overall volume growth, 

largely offset by the absence of a $160 million gain on sale 
related to the sale of the merchant acquiring business in 
Mexico in 2015. Excluding this gain, revenues increased 5%, 
primarily due to higher revenues in retail banking, partially 
offset by lower revenues in cards. Retail banking revenues 
increased 3%. Excluding the gain on sale related to the 
merchant acquiring business, revenues increased 9%, driven 
by volume growth. Cards revenues decreased 4%, driven by 
the impact of higher payment rates, partially offset by 
increased purchase sales. 

Expenses decreased 2%, as lower legal and related 

expenses, the impact of business divestitures and ongoing 
efficiency savings were partially offset by higher repositioning 
charges and ongoing investment spending. 

Provisions increased 1%, driven by a higher net loan loss 

reserve build, partially offset by lower net credit losses. The 
net loan loss reserve build increased $56 million, largely due 
to volume growth. Net credit losses decreased 5%, largely 
reflecting continued lower net credit losses in the cards 
portfolio, partially offset by higher net credit losses in the 
personal loan portfolio.

The discussion of the results of operations for Asia GCB below excludes the impact of FX translation for all periods presented. 
Presentations of the results of operations, excluding the impact of FX translation, are non-GAAP financial measures. For a 
reconciliation of certain of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.

2017 vs. 2016 
Net income increased 15%, reflecting higher revenues and 
lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher expenses.

Revenues increased 5%, driven by improvement in cards 

and wealth management revenues, partially offset by 
continued lower retail lending revenues.

Retail banking revenues increased 3%, primarily due to 
the continued improvement in wealth management revenues, 
partially offset by the repositioning of the retail loan portfolio. 
Wealth management revenues increased due to improvement 
in investor sentiment, stronger equity markets and increases in 
assets under management (18%) and investment sales (38%). 
Average deposits increased 5%. The increase in revenues was 
partially offset by the lower retail lending revenues (down 
4%), reflecting continued lower average loans (1%) due to the 
continued optimization of this portfolio away from lower 
yielding mortgage loans to focus on growing higher-return 
personal loans.

Cards revenues increased 8%, reflecting 5% growth in 

average loans and 7% growth in purchase sales, both of which 
benefited from the previously disclosed portfolio acquisition 
in Australia in 2017, as well as modest gains in 2017 related to 
sales of merchant acquiring businesses in certain countries.
 Expenses increased 2%, resulting from volume growth 

and ongoing investment spending, partially offset by 
efficiency savings.

Provisions decreased 2%, primarily driven by a decrease 

in net credit losses. 

For additional information on Asia GCB’s retail banking 

portfolios, including commercial banking, and its Citi-branded 
cards portfolio, see “Credit Risk—Consumer Credit” below.

2016 vs. 2015 
Net income decreased 9%, reflecting lower revenues and 
higher expenses.

Revenues decreased 1%, reflecting lower retail banking 

revenues, partially offset by higher cards revenues. Retail 
banking revenues decreased 2%, mainly due to a 5% decrease 
in wealth management revenues due to lower client activity, 
modestly lower investment assets under management and a 
decline in average loans. The decline in revenues was partially 
offset by growth in deposit volumes and higher insurance 
revenues. Cards revenues increased 1%, driven by continued 
improvement in yields, modestly abating regulatory 
headwinds and modest volume growth due to continued 
stabilizing payment rates.

Expenses increased 2%, primarily due to higher 

repositioning costs, higher regulatory and compliance costs 
and increased investment spending, partially offset by 
efficiency savings.

Provisions were largely unchanged as lower net loan loss 

reserve releases were offset by lower net credit losses, 
primarily in the commercial portfolio.

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS GROUP
Institutional Clients Group (ICG) includes Banking and Markets and securities services (for additional information on these 
businesses, see “Citigroup Segments” above). ICG provides corporate, institutional, public sector and high-net-worth clients around 
the world with a full range of wholesale banking products and services, including fixed income and equity sales and trading, foreign 
exchange, prime brokerage, derivative services, equity and fixed income research, corporate lending, investment banking and advisory 
services, private banking, cash management, trade finance and securities services. ICG transacts with clients in both cash instruments 
and derivatives, including fixed income, foreign currency, equity and commodity products.

ICG revenue is generated primarily from fees and spreads associated with these activities. ICG earns fee income for assisting 
clients in clearing transactions, providing brokerage and investment banking services and other such activities. Revenue generated 
from these activities is recorded in Commissions and fees and Investment banking. Revenue is also generated from transaction 
processing and assets under custody and administration. Revenue generated from these activities is primarily recorded in 
Administration and other fiduciary fees. In addition, as a market maker, ICG facilitates transactions, including holding product 
inventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. These price 
differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are recorded in Principal transactions (for additional information on 
Principal transactions revenue, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Other primarily includes mark-to-market gains 
and losses on certain credit derivatives, gains and losses on available-for-sale (AFS) securities and other non-recurring gains and 
losses. Interest income earned on assets held, less interest paid to customers on deposits and long- and short-term debt, is recorded as 
Net interest revenue.

The amount and types of Markets revenues are impacted by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in 

market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their 
implied volatilities; investor confidence; and other macroeconomic conditions. Assuming all other market conditions do not change, 
increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in increases in revenues. However, changes in market conditions 
can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and the fair value of product inventory. For example, a decrease in 
market liquidity may increase bid/offer spreads, decrease client activity levels and widen credit spreads on product inventory 
positions. 

ICG’s management of the Markets businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluating of the above factors at the trading desk as 
well as the country level. ICG does not separately track the impact on total Markets revenues of the volume of transactions, bid/offer 
spreads, fair value changes of product inventory positions and economic hedges because, as noted above, these components are 
interrelated and are not deemed useful or necessary individually to manage the Markets businesses at an aggregate level.

In the Markets businesses, client revenues are those revenues directly attributable to client transactions at the time of inception, 
including commissions, interest or fees earned. Client revenues do not include the results of client facilitation activities (for example, 
holding product inventory in anticipation of client demand) or the results of certain economic hedging activities.

ICG’s international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 98 

countries and jurisdictions. At December 31, 2017, ICG had approximately $1.3 trillion of assets and $640 billion of deposits, while 
two of its businesses—securities services and issuer services—managed approximately $17.4 trillion of assets under custody 
compared to $15.2 trillion at the end of the prior-year period.

(1)  Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. Gains (losses) 

on loan hedges includes the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. The fixed premium 
costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. Citigroup’s results of operations excluding the 
impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.

(2)  Excludes CVA/DVA in 2015, consistent with current presentation. For additional information, see Notes 1 and 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
(3)  2017 includes the $580 million gain on the sale of a fixed income analytics business. 2016 includes a charge of approximately $180 million, primarily reflecting 

the write-down of Citi’s net investment in Venezuela as a result of changes in the exchange rate.

(4)    Excludes principal transactions revenues of ICG businesses other than Markets, primarily treasury and trade solutions and the private bank.

The discussion of the results of operations for ICG below excludes the impact of CVA/DVA for 2015. Presentations of the results of 
operations, excluding the impact of CVA/DVA and the impact of gains (losses) on hedges of accrual loans, are non-GAAP financial 
measures. For a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.

2017 vs. 2016 
Net income decreased 5% and was impacted by an estimated 
$2.0 billion non-cash charge recorded in the tax line due to the 
impact of Tax Reform (for additional information, see “Impact 
of Tax Reform” above). Excluding the impact of Tax Reform, 
net income increased 16%, primarily driven by higher 
revenues and lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher 
expenses.
•  Revenues increased 7%, reflecting a 16% increase in 

Banking (including the losses on loan hedges). Excluding 
the impact of the losses on loan hedges, Banking revenues 
increased 12%, driven by solid growth across all products. 
Markets and securities services were largely unchanged, 
as growth in securities services revenues (increase of 8%) 
as well as the $580 million gain on the sale of a fixed 
income analytics business were offset by a 6% decrease in 
fixed income markets and a 2% decrease in equity 
markets revenues.

Within Banking:

• 

• 

Investment banking revenues increased 20%, largely 
reflecting gains in wallet share across products and 
regions as well as an improvement from the industry-wide 
slowdown in activity levels during the first half of 2016, 
particularly in equity underwriting and advisory. Advisory 
revenues increased 11%, driven by North America and 
EMEA, reflecting wallet share gains and the increased 
market activity. Equity underwriting revenues increased 
68%, driven by strength in North America and EMEA, due 
to significant wallet share gains as well as the increase in 
overall market activity. Debt underwriting revenues 
increased 13%, reflecting strength across regions, 
primarily driven by wallet share gains.
Treasury and trade solutions revenues increased 7%, 
reflecting growth across all regions that was balanced 
across both net interest and fee income. The increase was 
primarily due to continued growth in transaction volumes 
with new and existing clients, continued growth in deposit 
balances and improved spreads in certain regions. The 
trade business experienced modest revenue growth, as 
continued focus on high-quality loan growth was largely 
offset by industry-wide tightening of spreads. Average 
deposit balances increased 4%, while average trade loans 
increased 5% (4% excluding the impact of FX 
translation).

•  Corporate lending revenues increased 59%. Excluding 

the impact of losses on loans hedges, revenues increased 
12%, driven by lower hedging costs and the absence of a 
prior-year adjustment to the residual value of a lease 
financing transaction.

•  Private bank revenues increased 14%, reflecting strength 
across all regions and products. The increase in revenues 
was primarily due to higher loan and deposit volumes, 

higher deposit spreads and increased managed 
investments and capital markets activity.

Within Markets and securities services:

•  Fixed income markets revenues decreased 6%, with lower 
revenues in all regions, primarily due to low volatility as 
well as the comparison to higher revenues in the prior 
year from a more robust trading environment following 
the vote in the U.K. in favor of its withdrawal from the 
European Union, as well as the U.S. election. The decline 
in revenues was driven by lower net interest revenue 
(decreased 22%), largely due to higher funding costs and 
a change in the mix of trading positions in support of 
client activity. The decline was partially offset by higher 
principal transactions revenues and commissions and fees 
revenues. 

Rates and currencies revenues decreased 5%, driven 
by lower G10 rates and currencies revenues. Despite the 
challenging trading environment, corporate client 
revenues in rates and currencies across the global network 
remained strong. Spread products and other fixed income 
revenues decreased 6%, due to a difficult trading 
environment in the current year given low volatility, 
driving lower credit markets and commodities revenues, 
particularly in North America, partially offset by higher 
municipals revenues, as well as higher securitized markets 
revenues.

•  Equity markets revenues decreased 2%. Excluding an 

episodic loss in derivatives of approximately $130 million 
in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to a single client 
event, revenues increased 2%, as continued growth in 
prime finance and delta one client balances and higher 
investor client activity (particularly in EMEA and Asia) 
were partially offset by lower episodic activity with 
corporate clients in North America. Excluding the 
episodic loss in derivatives, equity derivatives revenues 
increased, driven by the stronger investor client activity. 
Cash equities revenues were modestly higher as well, 
driven by higher revenues in Asia, partially offset by 
lower cash commissions, as clients continued to move 
toward automated execution platforms across the industry.
Securities services revenues increased 8%. Excluding the 
impact of the prior year’s divestiture of a private equity 
fund services business, revenues increased 12%, 
reflecting strength in all regions, driven by growth in 
client volumes and higher interest revenue due to a more 
favorable rate environment.

• 

Expenses increased 3%, as higher compensation, volume-

related expenses and investments were partially offset by 
efficiency savings. 

Provisions improved $501 million, driven by a net loan 

loss release of $380 million (compared to a net release of $30 
million in the prior year) and a 29% decline in net credit 

27

losses. The increase in net loan loss reserve releases was 
driven by an improvement in the provision for unfunded 
lending commitments in the corporate loan portfolio, as well 
as a favorable credit environment, stability in commodity 
prices and continued improvement in the portfolio. The 
decline in net credit losses was largely driven by improvement 
in the energy sector, partially offset by the impact of the single 
client event in the fourth quarter noted above. 

2016 vs. 2015 
Net income increased 5%, primarily driven by lower expenses 
and lower cost of credit.
•  Revenues were largely unchanged, reflecting higher 

revenues in Markets and securities services (increase of 
6%), driven by fixed income markets, offset by lower 
revenues in Banking (decrease of 4% including the gains 
(losses) on loan hedges). Excluding the impact of the 
gains (losses) on loan hedges, Banking revenues increased 
1%, driven by treasury and trade solutions and the private 
bank. 

Within Banking:
• 

• 

Investment banking revenues decreased 6%, largely 
reflecting the overall industry-wide slowdown in activity 
levels in equity underwriting and advisory during the first 
half of 2016. Advisory revenues decreased 9%, reflecting 
strong performance in 2015. Equity underwriting 
revenues decreased 31%, primarily reflecting the lower 
market activity. Debt underwriting revenues increased 
5%, primarily due to higher market activity reflecting a 
favorable interest rate environment.
Treasury and trade solutions revenues increased 6%. 
Excluding the impact of FX translation, revenues 
increased 8%, reflecting growth across most regions. The 
increase was primarily due to continued growth in 
transaction volumes and deposit balances and improved 
spreads in certain regions. Trade revenues increased 
modestly due to loan growth as well as spread 
improvements. End-of-period deposit balances increased 
5% (6% excluding the impact of FX translation), while 
average trade loans decreased 2% (1% excluding the 
impact of FX translation).

•  Corporate lending revenues decreased 48%. Excluding 

the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, revenues 
decreased 6%. Excluding the impact of gains (losses) on 
loan hedges and FX translation, revenues decreased 1%, 
mostly reflecting the adjustment to the residual value of a 
lease financing transaction, spread compression and 
higher hedging costs, partially offset by higher average 
loans.

•  Private bank revenues increased 5%, reflecting growth in 

loan volumes and improved deposit spreads, partially 
offset by lower capital markets activity and lower 
managed investments revenues.

Within Markets and securities services:
•  Fixed income markets revenues increased 14%, with 
higher revenues in all regions, largely driven by both 
higher principal transactions revenues (up 22%) and other 
revenues (up 79%). The increase in principal transactions 
revenues was primarily due to higher rates and currencies 
revenues and higher spread products revenues. Other 
revenues increased mainly due to foreign currency losses 
in 2015. Rates and currencies revenues grew 22%, 
primarily due to the more favorable trading environment 
and higher client revenues following the vote in the U.K. 
and the U.S. election. Spread products and other fixed 
income revenues decreased 3%, due to lower securitized 
products revenues, driven by the impact of significantly 
lower liquidity in the market in the first quarter of 2016.
•  Equity markets revenues declined 9%. Equity derivatives 
and prime finance revenues declined 13%, reflecting both 
a challenging trading environment across all regions 
driven by lower volatility compared to 2015, and a 
comparison to a more favorable trading environment in 
2015 in Asia. The decline in equity markets revenue was 
also due to lower equity cash commissions driven by a 
continued shift to electronic trading and passive investing 
by clients across the industry. 
Securities services revenues increased 2%. Excluding the
impact of FX translation, revenues increased 5%, driven
by EMEA, primarily reflecting increased client activity, a
modest gain on the sale of a private equity fund services
business in the first quarter of 2016, higher deposit
volumes and improved spreads. The increase in revenues
was partially offset by the absence of revenues from
divestitures. Excluding the impact of FX translation and
divestitures, revenues increased 6%.

• 

Expenses decreased 1% as a benefit from FX translation 

and efficiency savings were partially offset by higher 
compensation expense and higher repositioning charges.
Provisions decreased 49%, driven by a net loan loss 
reserve release of $30 million (compared to a net build of 
$748 million in the prior year). The significant decline in loan 
loss reserve builds was related to energy and energy-related 
exposures and was driven by stabilization of commodities as 
oil prices continued to recover from lows in early 2016. The 
decline in cost of credit was partially offset by higher net 
credit losses of $516 million (compared to $214 million in the 
prior year) mostly related to the energy and energy-related 
exposures, with a vast majority offset by the release of 
previously established loan loss reserves. 

28

CORPORATE/OTHER
Corporate/Other includes certain unallocated costs of global staff functions (including finance, risk, human resources, legal and 
compliance), other corporate expenses and unallocated global operations and technology expenses, Corporate Treasury, certain North 
America and international legacy consumer loan portfolios, other legacy assets and discontinued operations (for additional information 
on Corporate/Other, see “Citigroup Segments” above). At December 31, 2017, Corporate/Other had $77 billion in assets, a decrease 
of 25% year-over-year and 23% from September 30, 2017. The decrease in assets included an approximate $20 billion decline in 
DTAs during the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the impact of Tax Reform.

2017 vs. 2016 
The net loss was $19.7 billion in 2017, compared to net 
income of $498 million in the prior year, primarily driven by 
the estimated $19.8 billion non-cash charge recorded in the tax 
line due to the impact of Tax Reform (for additional 
information, see “Impact of Tax Reform” above). Excluding 
the impact of Tax Reform, net income declined 69% to $153 
million, reflecting lower revenues, partially offset by lower 
expenses and lower cost of credit. 

Revenues declined 40%, primarily reflecting the 

continued wind-down of legacy assets and the absence of 
gains related to debt buybacks in 2016. Revenues included 
approximately $750 million in gains on asset sales in the first 
quarter of 2017, which more than offset a roughly $300 
million charge related to the exit of Citi’s U.S. mortgage 
servicing operations in the quarter.

Expenses declined 24%, reflecting the wind-down of 
legacy assets and lower legal expenses, partially offset by 
approximately $100 million in episodic expenses primarily 
related to the exit of the U.S. mortgage servicing operations. 
Also included in expenses is an approximately $255 million 
provision for remediation costs related to a CARD Act matter 
(for additional information, see “North America GCB” above 
and Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Citi 
believes the aggregate approximately $335 million provision 
(including the $80 million provision in North America GCB) 
to be sufficient for Citi’s planned remediation.

29

 

Provisions decreased $244 million to a net benefit of 
$175 million, primarily due to lower net credit losses and a 
lower provision for benefits and claims, partially offset by a 
lower net loan loss reserve release. Net credit losses declined 
66% to $149 million, primarily reflecting the impact of 
ongoing divestiture activity and the continued wind-down of 
the North America mortgage portfolio. The provision for 
benefits and claims declined by $105 million, primarily due to 
lower insurance activity. The net reserve release declined by 
$147 million to $317 million, and reflected the continued 
wind-down of the legacy North America mortgage portfolio 
and divestitures.

2016 vs. 2015 
Net income was $498 million, compared to net income of $2.0 
billion in 2015, primarily reflecting lower revenues and a 
higher effective tax rate in 2016 due to the absence of certain 
tax benefits in 2015. 

Revenues decreased 52%, primarily driven by the overall 

wind-down of legacy assets and lower net gains on sales, 
particularly the sales of OneMain Financial and the retail 
banking and credit cards businesses in Japan in the fourth 
quarter of 2015. 

Expenses decreased 32%, reflecting the sales and run-off 

of assets, lower legal and related expenses and lower 
repositioning costs.

 Provisions decreased 95% due to lower net credit losses 

and a lower provision for benefits and claims (decrease of 
84%) due to lower insurance activity. Net credit losses 
declined 67%, primarily due to the impact of divestitures and 
continued credit improvements in North America mortgages. 

Payment Protection Insurance (PPI)
The selling of PPI by financial institutions in the U.K. has 
been the subject of intense review and focus by U.K. 
regulators and the U.K. Supreme Court. 

PPI is designed to cover a customer’s loan repayments if 

certain events occur, such as long-term illness or 
unemployment.  The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) 
found certain problems across the industry with how these 
products were sold, including customers not realizing that the 
cost of PPI premiums was being added to their loan or PPI 
being unsuitable for the customer.  Redress generally involves 
the repayment of premiums and the refund of all applicable 
contractual interest, together with compensatory interest of 
8%.  

In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2014, the U.K. 

Supreme Court issued a ruling in a case (Plevin) involving PPI 
pursuant to which the court ruled, independent of the sale of 
the PPI contract, that the PPI contract at issue in the case was 
“unfair” due to the high sales commissions earned and the lack 
of disclosure to the customer thereof.  

In addition, the FCA released a policy statement related to 

PPI that (i) set a deadline of August 29, 2019 by which 
consumers must file PPI claims, (ii) provides for the launch of 
FCA-led marketing campaigns to inform consumers of this 
deadline, (iii) set new rules and guidance for the handling of 
PPI complaints in light of the Supreme Court’s decision on 
Plevin and (iv) requires all firms to contact all previously 
rejected customers who may be able to complain under the 
new “Plevin” rule (the Plevin Customer Contact 
Exercise). Citi completed the Plevin Customer Contact 
Exercise during the fourth quarter of 2017. The FCA-led 
marketing campaigns began in August 2017 and will continue 
through the August 2019 deadline. The level of PPI claims 
also continues to be influenced by the solicitation activity of 
Claims Management Companies (CMCs).

During 2017, Citi increased its PPI reserves by 

approximately $109 million (with $105 million recorded in 
Corporate/Other and $4 million recorded in Discontinued 
operations).  The increase for full-year 2017 compared to an 
increase of $134 million during 2016 and was primarily due to 
the ongoing level of PPI claims.

Citi’s year-end 2017 PPI reserve was $213 million, 

compared to $228 million as of December 31, 2016.
Additional reserving actions, if any, in 2018 will largely 
depend on the level of customer claims in response to the 
FCA-led marketing campaigns and the level of ongoing CMC 
activity.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Citigroup enters into various types of off-balance sheet 
arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Citi’s 
involvement in these arrangements can take many different 
forms, including without limitation:
• 

purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in 
unconsolidated special purpose entities, such as 
mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization 
entities;
holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited 
and general partnerships and equity interests in other 
unconsolidated special purpose entities; 
providing guarantees, indemnifications, loan 
commitments, letters of credit and representations and 
warranties; and

Citi enters into these arrangements for a variety of 

business purposes. For example, securitization arrangements 
offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created 
through the securitization process. Securitization arrangements 
also assist Citi and its customers in monetizing their financial 
assets and securing financing at more favorable rates than Citi 
or the customers could otherwise obtain.

Risk-Based Capital Ratios
The U.S. Basel III rules set forth the composition of regulatory 
capital (including the application of regulatory capital 
adjustments and deductions), as well as two comprehensive 
methodologies (a Standardized Approach and Advanced 
Approaches) for measuring total risk-weighted assets. Total 
risk-weighted assets under the Advanced Approaches, which 
are primarily models based, include credit, market, and 
operational risk-weighted assets. Conversely, the Standardized 
Approach excludes operational risk-weighted assets and 
generally applies prescribed supervisory risk weights to broad 
categories of credit risk exposures. As a result, credit risk-
weighted assets calculated under the Advanced Approaches 
are more risk sensitive than those calculated under the 
Standardized Approach. Market risk-weighted assets are 
derived on a generally consistent basis under both approaches. 

The U.S. Basel III rules establish stated minimum 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total 
Capital ratios for substantially all U.S. banking organizations, 
including Citi and Citibank, N.A. (Citibank). Moreover, these 
rules provide for both a fixed Capital Conservation Buffer and, 
for Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as Citi 
and Citibank, also a discretionary Countercyclical Capital 
Buffer. These capital buffers would be available to absorb 
losses in advance of any potential impairment of regulatory 
capital below the stated minimum risk-based capital ratio 
requirements. In December 2017, the Federal Reserve Board 
voted to affirm the Countercyclical Capital Buffer amount at 
the current level of 0%. 

Further, the U.S. Basel III rules implement the “capital 

floor provision” of the so-called “Collins Amendment” of the 
Dodd-Frank Act, which requires Advanced Approaches 
banking organizations to calculate each of the three risk-based 
capital ratios (Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, 
and Total Capital) under both the U.S. Basel III Standardized 
Approach and the Advanced Approaches and publicly report 
(as well as measure compliance against) the lower of each of 
the resulting risk-based capital ratios.

  
CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Overview
Capital is used principally to support assets in Citi’s 
businesses and to absorb credit, market and operational losses. 
Citi primarily generates capital through earnings from its 
operating businesses. Citi may augment its capital through 
issuances of common stock, noncumulative perpetual 
preferred stock and equity issued through awards under 
employee benefit plans, among other issuances. Further, Citi’s 
capital levels may also be affected by changes in accounting 
and regulatory standards, as well as U.S. corporate tax laws 
and the impact of future events on Citi’s business results, such 
as changes in interest and foreign exchange rates, as well as 
business and asset dispositions.

During 2017, Citi returned a total of $17.1 billion of 

capital to common shareholders in the form of share 
repurchases (approximately 214 million common shares) and 
dividends. 

Capital Management
Citi’s capital management framework is designed to ensure 
that Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries maintain sufficient 
capital consistent with each entity’s respective risk profile, 
management targets and all applicable regulatory standards 
and guidelines. Citi assesses its capital adequacy against a 
series of internal quantitative capital goals, designed to 
evaluate the Company’s capital levels in expected and stressed 
economic environments. Underlying these internal 
quantitative capital goals are strategic capital considerations, 
centered on preserving and building financial strength. The 
Citigroup Capital Committee, with oversight from the Risk 
Management Committee of Citigroup’s Board of Directors, 
has responsibility for Citi’s aggregate capital structure, 
including the capital assessment and planning process, which 
is integrated into Citi’s capital plan. Balance sheet 
management, including oversight of capital adequacy, for 
Citigroup’s subsidiaries is governed by each entity’s Asset and 
Liability Committee, where applicable. For additional 
information regarding Citi’s capital planning and stress testing 
exercises, see “Stress Testing—Component of Capital 
Planning” below.

Current Regulatory Capital Standards
Citi is subject to regulatory capital standards issued by the 
Federal Reserve Board, which constitute the U.S. Basel III 
rules. These rules establish an integrated capital adequacy 
framework, encompassing both risk-based capital ratios and 
leverage ratios.

Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective for 2017 and 2016 was 

3.0% and 3.5%, respectively, as derived under the higher 
method 2 result. Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective for 2018 will 
remain unchanged at 3.0%, as derived under the higher 
method 2 result. Citi expects that its method 2 GSIB surcharge 
will continue to remain higher than its method 1 GSIB 
surcharge, and as such Citi’s GSIB surcharge effective for 
2019 will not exceed 3.0%, and Citi’s GSIB surcharge 
effective for 2020 is not expected to exceed 3.0%. 

     

Transition Provisions
The U.S. Basel III rules contain several differing, largely 
multi-year transition provisions (i.e., “phase-ins” and “phase-
outs”), including with respect to substantially all regulatory 
capital adjustments and deductions, and non-qualifying Tier 1 
and Tier 2 Capital instruments (such as non-grandfathered 
trust preferred securities and certain subordinated debt 
issuances). Moreover, the GSIB surcharge, Capital 
Conservation Buffer, and any Countercyclical Capital Buffer 
(currently 0%), commenced phase-in on January 1, 2016, 
becoming fully effective on January 1, 2019. With the 
exception of the non-grandfathered trust preferred securities, 
which do not fully phase-out until January 1, 2022, and the 
capital buffers and GSIB surcharge, which do not fully phase-
in until January 1, 2019, all other transition provisions will be 
entirely reflected in Citi’s regulatory capital ratios by January 
1, 2018. Citi considers all of these transition provisions as 
being fully implemented on January 1, 2019 (full 
implementation), with the inclusion of the capital buffers and 
GSIB surcharge. 

The following chart sets forth the transitional progression 

from January 1, 2016 to full implementation by January 1, 
2019 of the regulatory capital components (i.e., inclusive of 
the mandatory 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and the 
Countercyclical Capital Buffer at its current level of 0%, as 
well as an estimated 3.0% GSIB surcharge) comprising the 
effective minimum risk-based capital ratios. 

GSIB Surcharge
The Federal Reserve Board imposes a risk-based capital 
surcharge upon U.S. bank holding companies that are 
identified as global systemically important bank holding 
companies (GSIBs), including Citi. The GSIB surcharge 
augments the Capital Conservation Buffer and, if invoked, any 
Countercyclical Capital Buffer, and would result in restrictions 
on earnings distributions (e.g., dividends, equity repurchases, 
and discretionary executive bonuses) should the expanded 
buffer be breached to absorb losses during periods of financial 
or economic stress, with the degree of such restrictions based 
upon the extent to which the expanded buffer is breached.

Under the Federal Reserve Board’s rule, identification of 

a GSIB is based primarily on quantitative measurement 
indicators underlying five equally weighted broad categories 
of systemic importance: (i) size, (ii) interconnectedness, (iii) 
cross-jurisdictional activity, (iv) substitutability, and (v) 
complexity. With the exception of size, each of the other 
categories are composed of multiple indicators also of equal 
weight, and amounting to 12 indicators in total. 

A U.S. bank holding company that is designated a GSIB 
under the established methodology is required, on an annual 
basis, to calculate a surcharge using two methods and will be 
subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. The first 
method (“method 1”) is based on the same five broad 
categories of systemic importance used to identify a GSIB. 
Under the second method (“method 2”), the substitutability 
category is replaced with a quantitative measure intended to 
assess the extent of a GSIB’s reliance on short-term wholesale 
funding. Moreover, method 1 incorporates relative measures 
of systemic importance across certain global banking 
organizations and a year-end spot foreign exchange rate, 
whereas method 2 uses fixed measures of systemic importance 
and application of an average foreign exchange rate over a 
three-year period. Effective for 2017 and thereafter, the GSIB 
surcharges calculated under both method 1 and method 2 are 
based on measures of systemic importance from the year 
immediately preceding that in which the GSIB surcharge 
calculations are being performed (e.g., the method 1 and 
method 2 GSIB surcharges to be calculated by December 31, 
2017 will be based on 2016 systemic indicator data). 
Generally, the surcharge derived under method 2 will result in 
a higher surcharge than derived under method 1.

Should a GSIB’s systemic importance change year-over-

year such that it becomes subject to a higher surcharge, the 
higher surcharge would not become effective for a full year 
(e.g., a higher surcharge calculated by December 31, 2018 
would not become effective until January 1, 2020). However, 
if a GSIB’s systemic importance changes such that the GSIB 
would be subject to a lower surcharge, the GSIB would be 
subject to the lower surcharge beginning with the next 
calendar year (e.g., a lower surcharge calculated by December 
31, 2018 would become effective January 1, 2019).

institutions and MSRs. Goodwill (including goodwill “embedded” in the valuation of significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial 
institutions) is fully deducted in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. The amount of all other intangible assets, aside from MSRs, not deducted in arriving at 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital are risk-weighted at 100%, as are the excess over the 10%/15% limitations for DTAs arising from temporary differences, 
significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions and MSRs through December 31, 2017. Commencing January 1, 2018, the amount 
of temporary difference DTAs, significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions and MSRs not deducted in arriving at Common 
Equity Tier 1 Capital are risk-weighted at 250%.   
Includes the phase-in of the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Additional Tier 1 Capital adjustment for cumulative unrealized net gains (losses) related to 
changes in fair value of financial liabilities attributable to Citi’s own creditworthiness; and the phase-in of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Additional Tier 1 
Capital deductions related to DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards and defined benefit pension plan 
net assets; 
Includes the phase-out from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital of adjustments related to net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities; 
unrealized gains on AFS equity securities; net unrealized gains (losses) on held-to-maturity (HTM) securities included in Accumulated other comprehensive 
income (loss) (AOCI); and defined benefit plans liability adjustment.

Tier 1 Leverage Ratio
Under the U.S. Basel III rules, Citi, as with principally all U.S. 
banking organizations, is also required to maintain a minimum 
Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 4.0%. The Tier 1 Leverage ratio, a 
non-risk-based measure of capital adequacy, is defined as Tier 
1 Capital as a percentage of quarterly adjusted average total 
assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital. 

Supplementary Leverage Ratio
Advanced Approaches banking organizations are additionally 
required to calculate a Supplementary Leverage ratio, which 
significantly differs from the Tier 1 Leverage ratio by also 
including certain off-balance sheet exposures within the 
denominator of the ratio (Total Leverage Exposure). The 
Supplementary Leverage ratio represents end of period Tier 1 
Capital to Total Leverage Exposure, with the latter defined as 
the sum of the daily average of on-balance sheet assets for the 
quarter and the average of certain off-balance sheet exposures 
calculated as of the last day of each month in the quarter, less 
applicable Tier 1 Capital deductions. Effective January 1, 
2018, Advanced Approaches banking organizations are 
required to maintain a stated minimum Supplementary 
Leverage ratio of 3.0%.

Further, U.S. GSIBs, and their subsidiary insured 

depository institutions, including Citi and Citibank, are subject 
to enhanced Supplementary Leverage ratio standards. The 
enhanced Supplementary Leverage ratio standards establish a 
2.0% leverage buffer for U.S. GSIBs in addition to the stated 
3.0% minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio requirement in 
the U.S. Basel III rules. If a U.S. GSIB fails to exceed the 
2.0% leverage buffer, it will be subject to increasingly onerous 
restrictions (depending upon the extent of the shortfall) 
regarding capital distributions and discretionary executive 
bonus payments. Accordingly, U.S. GSIBs are effectively 
subject to a 5.0% minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio 
requirement. Citi is required to be compliant with this higher 
effective minimum ratio requirement on January 1, 2018.

Prompt Corrective Action Framework
The U.S. Basel III rules revised the Prompt Corrective Action 
(PCA) regulations applicable to insured depository institutions 
in certain respects.  

In general, the PCA regulations direct the U.S. banking 

agencies to enforce increasingly strict limitations on the 
activities of insured depository institutions that fail to meet 
certain regulatory capital thresholds. The PCA framework 
contains five categories of capital adequacy as measured by 
risk-based capital and leverage ratios: (i) “well capitalized,” 
(ii) “adequately capitalized,” (iii) undercapitalized,” (iv) 
“significantly undercapitalized,” and (v) “critically 
undercapitalized.”

Accordingly, an insured depository institution, such as 
Citibank, must maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1 
Capital, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital, and Tier 1 Leverage 
ratios of 6.5%, 8.0%, 10.0% and 5.0%, respectively, to be 
considered “well capitalized.” Additionally, insured depository 
institution subsidiaries of U.S. GSIBs, such as Citibank, must 
maintain a minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6.0%, 
effective January 1, 2018, to be considered “well capitalized.”

Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning
Citi is subject to an annual assessment by the Federal Reserve 
Board as to whether Citigroup has effective capital planning 
processes as well as sufficient regulatory capital to absorb 
losses during stressful economic and financial conditions, 
while also meeting obligations to creditors and counterparties 
and continuing to serve as a credit intermediary. This annual 
assessment includes two related programs: 

•  The Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review 
(CCAR) evaluates Citi’s capital adequacy, capital 
adequacy process, and its planned capital distributions, 
such as dividend payments and common stock 
repurchases. As part of CCAR, the Federal Reserve Board 
assesses whether Citi has sufficient capital to continue 
operations throughout times of economic and financial 
market stress and whether Citi has robust, forward-
looking capital planning processes that account for its 
unique risks. The Federal Reserve Board may object to 
Citi’s annual capital plan based on either quantitative or 
qualitative grounds. If the Federal Reserve Board objects 
to Citi’s annual capital plan, Citi may not undertake any 
capital distribution unless the Federal Reserve Board 
indicates in writing that it does not object to the 
distribution. 

•  Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing (DFAST) is a forward-

looking quantitative evaluation of the impact of stressful 
economic and financial market conditions on Citi’s 
regulatory capital. This program serves to inform the 
Federal Reserve Board, the financial companies, and the 
general public, how Citi’s regulatory capital ratios might 
change using a hypothetical set of adverse economic 
conditions as designed by the Federal Reserve Board. In 
addition to the annual supervisory stress test conducted by 
the Federal Reserve Board, Citi is required to conduct 
annual company-run stress tests under the same adverse 
economic conditions designed by the Federal Reserve 
Board, as well as conduct a mid-cycle stress test under 
company-developed scenarios.

Both CCAR and DFAST include an estimate of projected 
revenues, losses, reserves, pro forma regulatory capital ratios, 
and any other additional capital measures deemed relevant by 
Citi. Projections are required over a nine-quarter planning 
horizon under three supervisory scenarios (baseline, adverse 
and severely adverse conditions). All risk-based capital ratios 
reflect application of the Standardized Approach framework 
and the transition arrangements under the U.S. Basel III rules. 
Moreover, the Federal Reserve Board has deferred the use of 
the Advanced Approaches framework indefinitely. Beginning 
in 2018, CCAR incorporates the Supplementary Leverage 
ratio. Accordingly, Advanced Approaches banking 
organizations are required to demonstrate an ability to 
maintain a Supplementary Leverage ratio in excess of the 
stated minimum requirement for all quarters of the 2018 
CCAR planning horizon.

For additional information regarding CCAR, see “Risk 

Factors—Strategic Risks” below.

Citigroup’s Capital Resources Under Current Regulatory 
Standards 
Citi is required to maintain stated minimum Common Equity 
Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios of 4.5%, 
6.0% and 8.0%, respectively. 

Citi’s effective minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, 
Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios during 2017, inclusive 
of the 50% phase-in of both the 2.5% Capital Conservation 
Buffer and the 3.0% GSIB surcharge (all of which is to be 
composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital), are 7.25%, 
8.75% and 10.75%, respectively. Citi’s effective minimum 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total 
Capital ratios during 2016, inclusive of the 25% phase-in of 
both the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and the 3.5% GSIB 
surcharge (all of which is to be composed of Common Equity 
Tier 1 Capital), were 6.0%, 7.5% and 9.5%, respectively.

Furthermore, to be “well capitalized” under current 

federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding
company must have a Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6.0%, a 
Total Capital ratio of at least 10.0%, and not be subject to a 
Federal Reserve Board directive to maintain higher capital 
levels.  

The following tables set forth the capital tiers, total risk-
weighted assets and underlying risk components, risk-based 
capital ratios, quarterly adjusted average total assets, Total 
Leverage Exposure and leverage ratios under current 
regulatory standards (reflecting Basel III Transition 
Arrangements) for Citi as of December 31, 2017 and

Issuance costs of $184 million related to noncumulative perpetual preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are excluded from 
common stockholders’ equity and netted against such preferred stock in accordance with Federal Reserve Board regulatory reporting requirements, which differ 
from those under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). 
In addition, includes the net amount of unamortized loss on held-to-maturity (HTM) securities. This amount relates to securities that were previously transferred 
from AFS to HTM, and non-credit related factors such as changes in interest rates and liquidity spreads for HTM securities with other-than-temporary impairment.  

(3)  The transition arrangements for significant regulatory capital adjustments and deductions impacting Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Additional Tier 1 Capital 

are set forth above in the chart entitled “Basel III Transition Arrangements: Significant Regulatory Capital Adjustments and Deductions.”

(4)  Common Equity Tier 1 Capital is adjusted for accumulated net unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges included in Accumulated other comprehensive 

income (loss) (AOCI) that relate to the hedging of items not recognized at fair value on the balance sheet.

(5)  The cumulative impact of changes in Citigroup’s own creditworthiness in valuing liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected, and own-credit 

valuation adjustments on derivatives, are excluded from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Additional Tier 1 Capital, in accordance with the U.S. Basel III rules. 
Includes goodwill “embedded” in the valuation of significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions. 

(6) 
(7)  Of Citi’s $22.5 billion of net DTAs at December 31, 2017, $10.2 billion were includable in regulatory capital pursuant to the U.S. Basel III rules, while $12.3 

billion were excluded. Excluded from Citi’s regulatory capital at December 31, 2017 was in total $13.1 billion of net DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign 
tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards, of which $10.5 billion were deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and $2.6 billion were deducted 
from Additional Tier 1 Capital, which was reduced by $0.8 billion of net DTLs primarily associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets. Separately, 
under the U.S. Basel III rules, goodwill and these other intangible assets are deducted net of associated DTLs in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. DTAs 
arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards are required to be deducted from both Common Equity Tier 1 Capital 
and Additional Tier 1 Capital under the transition arrangements of the U.S. Basel III rules; whereas DTAs arising from temporary differences are deducted solely 
from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital under these rules, if in excess of 10%/15% limitations.

(8)  Assets subject to 10%/15% limitations include MSRs, DTAs arising from temporary differences and significant common stock investments in unconsolidated 

financial institutions. At December 31, 2017, none of these assets were in excess of the 10%/15% limitations. At December 31, 2016, this deduction related only to 
DTAs arising from temporary differences that exceeded the 10% limitation. 

(9)  Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred securities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules.
(10)  Banking entities are required to be in compliance with the Volcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act which prohibits conducting certain proprietary investment 

activities and limits their ownership of, and relationships with, covered funds. Accordingly, Citi is required by the Volcker Rule to deduct from Tier 1 Capital all 
permitted ownership interests in covered funds that were acquired after December 31, 2013.

(11)  50% of the minimum regulatory capital requirements of insurance underwriting subsidiaries must be deducted from each of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital.
(12)  Effective January 1, 2016, non-grandfathered trust preferred securities are not eligible for inclusion in Tier 1 Capital, but are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital 

subject to full phase-out by January 1, 2022. Non-grandfathered trust preferred securities are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital in an amount up to 50% and 
60% during 2017 and 2016, respectively, of the aggregate outstanding principal amounts of such issuances as of January 1, 2014, in accordance with the transition 
arrangements for non-qualifying capital instruments under the U.S. Basel III rules.

(13)  Under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any 
excess allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Advanced Approaches framework, in which 
eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit 
risk-weighted assets. The total amount of eligible credit reserves in excess of expected credit losses that were eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, subject to 
limitation, under the Advanced Approaches framework was $1.5 billion and $0.7 billion at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.

(1)  General credit risk exposures include cash and balances due from depository institutions, securities, and loans and leases. General credit risk exposures increased 

during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to corporate loan growth.

(2)  Repo-style transactions include repurchase or reverse repurchase transactions and securities borrowing or securities lending transactions.
(3)  Securitization exposures decreased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 principally as a result of certain securitization exposures becoming subject 

to deduction from Tier 1 Capital under the Volcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act.

(4)  OTC derivatives decreased during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to notional decreases.
(5)  Other exposures include cleared transactions, unsettled transactions, and other assets. Other exposures decreased during the three and twelve months ended 

December 31, 2017 primarily due to a reduction in Citi’s deferred tax assets as a result of Tax Reform. For additional information regarding the impact of Tax 
Reform, see “Impact of Tax Reform” above.   

(6)  Off-balance sheet exposures increased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to growth in corporate exposures.
(7)  Risk levels increased during the three months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increases in exposures subject to securitization charges and 

incremental risk charges, partially offset by a decrease in exposures subject to comprehensive risk and Risk Not In the Model. Risk levels increased during the 
twelve months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in exposure levels subject to Stressed Value at Risk, as well as an increase in positions 
subject to securitization charges.

(8)  Risk-weighted assets declined during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as Citi received supervisory approval to remove the Comprehensive Risk 

Measure model surcharge for correlation trading portfolios, commencing with the third quarter of 2017. Further contributing to the decline in risk-weighted assets 
during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were changes in model inputs regarding volatility and the correlation between market risk factors.

(1)  Retail exposures increased during the three months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to increases in qualifying revolving (cards) exposures attributable to 
seasonal holiday spending. Retail exposures decreased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 principally resulting from residential mortgage loan 
sales and repayments, and divestitures of certain legacy assets. 

(2)  Wholesale exposures increased during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to corporate loan growth. The increase in wholesale 

exposures during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was partially offset by annual updates to model parameters.

(3)  Repo-style transactions decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to improved portfolio credit quality. Repo-style transactions 

increased during the  twelve months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to increased activity and a decline in portfolio credit quality.

(4)  Securitization exposures increased during the three months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to increased activity. Securitization exposures decreased 

during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 principally as a result of certain securitization exposures becoming subject to deduction from Tier 1 Capital 
under the Volcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act.

(5)  OTC derivatives decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to decreases in trade volume and changes in fair value. OTC 

derivatives decreased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to changes in fair value and improved portfolio credit quality. 

(6)  Derivatives CVA decreased during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 primarily driven by decreased volatility and exposure reduction.
(7)  Other exposures include cleared transactions, unsettled transactions, assets other than those reportable in specific exposure categories and non-material portfolios. 

Other exposures decreased during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to a reduction in Citi’s deferred tax assets as a result of 
Tax Reform. For additional information regarding the impact of Tax Reform, see “Impact of Tax Reform” above.   

(8)  Supervisory 6% multiplier does not apply to derivatives CVA. 
(9)  Risk levels increased during the three months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increases in exposures subject to securitization charges and 

incremental risk charges, partially offset by a decrease in exposures subject to comprehensive risk and Risk Not In the Model. Risk levels increased during the

Capital Resources of Citigroup’s Subsidiary U.S. 
Depository Institutions Under Current Regulatory Standards 
Citigroup’s subsidiary U.S. depository institutions are also 
subject to regulatory capital standards issued by their 
respective primary federal bank regulatory agencies, which are 
similar to the standards of the Federal Reserve Board. 

During 2017, Citi’s primary subsidiary U.S. depository 
institution, Citibank, N.A. (Citibank), is subject to effective 
minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and 
Total Capital ratios, inclusive of the 50% phase-in of the 2.5% 
Capital Conservation Buffer, of 5.75%, 7.25% and 9.25%, 
respectively. Citibank’s effective minimum Common Equity 
Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios during 
2016, inclusive of the 25% phase-in of the 2.5% Capital 

Conservation Buffer, were 5.125%, 6.625% and 8.625%, 
respectively. Citibank is required to maintain stated minimum 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total 
Capital ratios of 4.5%, 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively. 

The following tables set forth the capital tiers, total risk-
weighted assets and underlying risk components, risk-based 
capital ratios, quarterly adjusted average total assets, Total 
Leverage Exposure and leverage ratios under current 
regulatory standards (reflecting Basel III Transition 
Arrangements) for Citibank, Citi’s primary subsidiary U.S. 
depository institution, as of December 31, 2017 and 
December 31, 2016.

(1)  Under the Advanced Approaches framework eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent the 

excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Standardized Approach in which the allowance for credit losses is 
eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at credit 
risk-weighted assets. 

(2)  As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, Citibank’s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital  ratios were the lower derived under 

the Basel III Standardized Approach. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, Citibank’s reportable Total Capital ratio was the lower derived under the 
Basel III Advanced Approaches framework.

(3)  Tier 1 Leverage ratio denominator. 
(4)  Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator. 

As indicated in the table above, Citibank’s capital ratios at 
December 31, 2017 were in excess of the stated and effective 
minimum requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules. In 
addition, Citibank was also “well capitalized” as of 
December 31, 2017 under the revised PCA regulations. 

Further, Citibank is required to conduct the annual Dodd-

Frank Act Stress Test. The annual stress test consists of a 
forward-looking quantitative evaluation of the impact of 
stressful economic and financial market conditions under 

several scenarios on Citibank’s regulatory capital. This 
program serves to inform the Office of the Comptroller of 
the Currency as to how Citibank’s regulatory capital ratios 
might change during a hypothetical set of adverse economic 
conditions and to ultimately evaluate the reliability of 
Citibank’s capital planning process.

Impact of Changes on Citigroup and Citibank Capital Ratios 
Under Current Regulatory Capital Standards 
The following tables present the estimated sensitivity of 
Citigroup’s and Citibank’s capital ratios to changes of $100 
million in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and 
Total Capital (numerator), and changes of $1 billion in 
Advanced Approaches and Standardized Approach risk-
weighted assets and quarterly adjusted average total assets, as 
well as Total Leverage Exposure (denominator), under current 
regulatory capital standards (reflecting Basel III Transition 
Arrangements), as of December 31, 2017. This information is 

provided for the purpose of analyzing the impact that a change 
in Citigroup’s or Citibank’s financial position or results of 
operations could have on these ratios. These sensitivities only 
consider a single change to either a component of regulatory 
capital, risk-weighted assets, quarterly adjusted average total 
assets or Total Leverage Exposure. Accordingly, an event that 
affects more than one factor may have a larger basis point 
impact than is reflected in these tables.

wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had net capital, 
computed in accordance with the SEC’s net capital rule, of 
$11.0 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement by 
$9.0 billion. 

Moreover, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, a broker-

dealer registered with the United Kingdom’s Prudential 
Regulation Authority (PRA) that is also an indirect wholly 
owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had total capital of $18.1 
billion at December 31, 2017, which exceeded the PRA's 
minimum regulatory capital requirements. 

In addition, certain of Citi’s other broker-dealer 

subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the countries in which 
they do business, including requirements to maintain specified 
levels of net capital or its equivalent. Citigroup’s other broker-
dealer subsidiaries were in compliance with their capital 
requirements at December 31, 2017.

Citigroup’s Capital Resources Under Basel III  
(Full Implementation)
Citi currently estimates that its effective minimum Common 
Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratio 
requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules, on a fully 
implemented basis, inclusive of the 2.5% Capital Conservation 
Buffer and the Countercyclical Capital Buffer at its current 
level of 0%, as well as an expected 3.0% GSIB surcharge, may 
be 10.0%, 11.5% and 13.5%, respectively. 

Further, under the U.S. Basel III rules, Citi must also 

comply with a 4.0% minimum Tier 1 Leverage ratio 
requirement and an effective 5.0% minimum Supplementary 
Leverage ratio requirement.

The following tables set forth the capital tiers, total risk-
weighted assets and underlying risk components, risk-based 
capital ratios, quarterly adjusted average total assets, Total 
Leverage Exposure and leverage ratios, assuming full 
implementation under the U.S. Basel III rules, for Citi as of 
December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

At December 31, 2017, Citi’s constraining Common 
Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were those 
derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach, whereas 
Citi’s binding Total Capital ratio was that resulting from 
application of the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework. 
Further, each of Citi’s risk-based capital ratios was constrained 
by the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework for all 
periods prior to June 30, 2017.

(1)  As of December 31, 2017, Citi’s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were the lower derived under the Basel III Standardized 

Approach, whereas the reportable Total Capital ratio was the lower derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework. As of December 31, 2016, Citi’s 
reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, and Total Capital ratios were the lower derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework.

(2)  Citi’s Basel III risk-based capital and leverage ratios and related components, on a fully implemented basis, are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes these 

ratios and the related components provide useful information to investors and others by measuring Citi’s progress against future regulatory capital standards.

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio  
Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio was 12.4% at 
December 31, 2017, compared to 13.0% at September 30, 
2017 and 12.6% at December 31, 2016. The ratio declined 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily due to a 
reduction in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital resulting from the 
return of capital to common shareholders as well as the impact 
of Tax Reform.

(1) 

Issuance costs of $184 million related to noncumulative perpetual preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are excluded from 
common stockholders’ equity and netted against such preferred stock in accordance with Federal Reserve Board regulatory reporting requirements, which differ 
from those under U.S. GAAP. 

(2)  Common Equity Tier 1 Capital is adjusted for accumulated net unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges included in AOCI that relate to the hedging of items 

not recognized at fair value on the balance sheet.

(3)  The cumulative impact of changes in Citigroup’s own creditworthiness in valuing liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected, and own-credit 

valuation adjustments on derivatives, are excluded from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, in accordance with the U.S. Basel III rules. 
Includes goodwill “embedded” in the valuation of significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions.

(5)  Of Citi’s $22.5 billion of net DTAs at December 31, 2017, $10.2 billion were includable in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital pursuant to the U.S. Basel III rules, 

while $12.3 billion were excluded. Excluded from Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital as of December 31, 2017 was $13.1 billion of net DTAs arising from net 
operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards, which was reduced by $0.8 billion of net DTLs primarily associated with goodwill 
and certain other intangible assets. Separately, under the U.S. Basel III rules, goodwill and these other intangible assets are deducted net of associated DTLs in 
arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards are required to be 
entirely deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital under full implementation of the U.S. Basel III rules; whereas DTAs arising from temporary differences are 
deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital if in excess of 10%/15% limitations.  

(6)  Assets subject to 10%/15% limitations include MSRs, DTAs arising from temporary differences and significant common stock investments in unconsolidated 

financial institutions. At December 31, 2017, none of these assets were in excess of the 10%/15% limitations. At December 31, 2016, this deduction related only to 
DTAs arising from temporary differences that exceeded the 10% limitation. 

(7)  Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred securities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules. 
(8)  Banking entities are required to be in compliance with the Volcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act which prohibits conducting certain proprietary investment 

activities and limits their ownership of, and relationships with, covered funds. Accordingly, Citi is required by the Volcker Rule to deduct from Tier 1 Capital all 
permitted ownership interests in covered funds that were acquired after December 31, 2013.

(9)  50% of the minimum regulatory capital requirements of insurance underwriting subsidiaries must be deducted from each of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital.
(10)  Represents the amount of non-grandfathered trust preferred securities eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules, which will be fully 

phased-out of Tier 2 Capital by January 1, 2022. 

(11)  Under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any 
excess allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Advanced Approaches framework, in which 
eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit 
risk-weighted assets. The total amount of eligible credit reserves in excess of expected credit losses that were eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, subject to 
limitation, under the Advanced Approaches framework was $1.5 billion and $0.7 billion at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.

Total risk-weighted assets under the Basel III 

Standardized Approach increased from year-end 2016 
substantially due to higher credit risk-weighted assets, 
primarily resulting from corporate loan growth and increased 
repo-style transaction activity, partially offset by a decrease in 
OTC derivative trade activity and a reduction in Citi’s deferred 
tax assets as a result of Tax Reform.

Total risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Advanced 

Approaches decreased from year-end 2016, driven by 
substantially lower credit and operational risk-weighted assets. 
The decrease in credit risk-weighted assets was primarily due 
to a reduction in Citi’s deferred tax assets as a result of Tax 
Reform, changes in fair value and improved portfolio credit 
quality of OTC derivatives, residential mortgage loan sales 
and repayments, and divestitures of certain legacy assets. 
Operational risk-weighted assets decreased from year-end 
2016 primarily due to assessed improvements in the business 
environment and risk controls, as well as changes in 
operational loss severity and frequency.

Supplementary Leverage Ratio
Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio was 6.7% for the 
fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 7.1% for the third quarter 
of 2017 and 7.2% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The decline 
in the ratio quarter-over-quarter was principally driven by a 
reduction in Tier 1 Capital resulting from the return of $6.3 
billion of capital to common shareholders as well as the 
impact of Tax Reform. The decline in the ratio from the fourth 
quarter of 2016 was largely attributable to a reduction in Tier 1 
Capital resulting from the return of $17.1 billion of capital to 

common shareholders as well as the impact of Tax Reform, in 
conjunction with an increase in Total Leverage Exposure 
primarily due to growth in average on-balance sheet assets.

The following table sets forth Citi’s Supplementary 

Leverage ratio and related components, assuming full 
implementation under the U.S. Basel III rules, for the three 
months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

exposures permitted if certain conditions are met. 

(4)  Repo-style transactions include repurchase or reverse repurchase transactions and securities borrowing or securities lending transactions.

Citibank’s Supplementary Leverage ratio, assuming full 
implementation under the U.S. Basel III rules, was 6.6% for 
the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 6.7% for the third 
quarter of 2017 and 6.6% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The 
quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily driven by a 
reduction in Tier 1 Capital resulting from the impact of Tax 
Reform, partially offset by capital contributions from 
Citibank’s parent, Citicorp, as well as a decrease in Total 
Leverage Exposure primarily due to a decline in potential 
future exposure on derivative contracts. The ratio remained 
unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2016, as an increase in 
Tier 1 Capital was offset by an increase in Total Leverage 
Exposure.

Regulatory Capital Standards Developments
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel 
Committee) issued several proposed and final rules during 
2017, the most significant of which was designed to address 
final revisions or enhancements to the Basel III capital 
framework.   

Basel III: Finalizing Post-Crisis Regulatory Capital Reforms
In December 2017, the Basel Committee issued a rule that 
finalizes several outstanding Basel III post-crisis regulatory 
capital reforms. The reforms, which generally become 
effective in 2022, relate to the methodologies in deriving 
credit and operational risk-weighted assets, the imposition of a 
new aggregate output floor for risk-weighted assets, and 
revisions to the leverage ratio framework. 

The final rule, in part, revises the Standardized Approach 
in measuring credit risk-weighted assets with respect to certain 
on-balance sheet assets, such as in relation to the risk-
weighting methodologies employed with respect to bank, 
corporate, and real estate (both residential and commercial) 
exposures; the treatment of off-balance sheet commitments; 
and aspects of the credit risk mitigation framework. Moreover, 
the final rule permits the use of external credit ratings 
combined with due diligence requirements in the calculation 
of credit risk-weighted assets for exposures to banks and 
corporates, while also providing alternative approaches for 
jurisdictions that do not allow the use of external credit ratings 
for risk-based capital purposes, such as the U.S.

The final rule also revises the internal ratings-based (IRB) 
approaches, in part, by prohibiting the use of such approaches 
for so-called “low default” exposures, including those to banks 
and other financial institutions, as well as large corporations. 
Further, the final rule also prohibits the use of the IRB 
approaches for equity exposures in the banking book. 
Additionally, for other exposures where the IRB approaches 
are still permissible, the final rule establishes floors by 
exposure type regarding the estimation of certain model 
parameters used in the derivation of credit risk-weighted 
assets, and also provides greater specification as to permissible 
parameter estimation practices under the IRB approaches.

Apart from credit risk, the final rule substantially revises 

the operational risk capital framework applicable to the 
Advanced Approaches for calculating risk-weighted assets by 
introducing the Standardized Measurement Approach (SMA). 
Operational risk capital is derived under the SMA through the 
combination of two components: a so-called “Business 
Indicator Component” and a “Loss Component.” The Business 
Indicator Component, primarily reflective of various income 
statement elements (i.e., a modified gross income indicator), is 
calculated as the sum of the three-year average of its 
components. The Loss Component reflects the operational loss 
exposure of a banking organization that can be inferred from 
internal loss experience, and is based on a 10-year average.

To reduce excessive variability with respect to risk-

weighted assets, and to therefore enhance the comparability of 
risk-based capital ratios, the final rule establishes a floor 
requirement that is to be applied to total risk-weighted assets. 
More specifically, the risk-weighted assets that banks must use 
to determine compliance with risk-based capital requirements 

must be calculated as the maximum of (i) total risk-weighted 
assets calculated using the approaches that the bank has 
supervisory approval to use in accordance with the Basel III 
capital framework (including both standardized and internally-
modeled based approaches), and (ii) 72.5% of the total risk-
weighted assets, calculated using only standardized 
approaches.

Lastly, the final rule revises the design and calibration of 

the Basel III leverage ratio (similar to the U.S. Basel III 
Supplementary Leverage ratio). Among the revisions are those 
with respect to the exposure measure (i.e., the denominator of 
the ratio) in relation to the treatment of derivative exposures, 
provisions, and off-balance sheet exposures. 

Although the U.S. banking agencies subsequently issued a 

statement announcing support for these finalized Basel III 
reforms, further indicating that they will “consider how to 
appropriately apply these revisions,” significant uncertainty 
nonetheless currently exists with regard to the manner and 
timeframe in which these Basel III capital reforms will be 
implemented in the U.S. 

Pillar 3 Disclosure Requirements—Consolidated and 
Enhanced Framework
In March 2017, the Basel Committee issued a final rule
that adopts further revisions arising from the second phase of 
its review of the “Pillar 3” disclosure requirements, and which 
builds on the initial revisions from phase one of the review, 
which were finalized in January 2015. 

The final rule consolidates all existing Basel Committee 

disclosure requirements into the Pillar 3 framework, with these 
constituting the disclosure requirements regarding the 
composition of capital, leverage ratio, Liquidity Coverage 
Ratio, Net Stable Funding Ratio, indicators for measuring the 
global systemic importance of banks, Countercyclical Capital 
Buffer, interest rate risk in the banking book, and 
remuneration. Moreover, the final rule introduces 
enhancements to the Pillar 3 framework, in part, by 
incorporating a “dashboard” of a banking organization’s key 
regulatory capital and liquidity metrics. The final rule also sets 
forth revisions and additions to the Pillar 3 framework 
resulting from ongoing reforms to the regulatory capital 
framework, including incorporating disclosure requirements 
arising from the Financial Stability Board’s total loss-
absorbing capacity (TLAC) regime applicable to global 
systemically important banks (GSIBs), and revised disclosure 
requirements for market risk attributable to the revised market 
risk framework.

The Basel Committee announced in the final rule that it 

had commenced the third phase of its review of “Pillar 3” 
disclosure requirements, which will build further upon the 
revisions arising from the second phase of its review. Among 
other requirements, the third phase will include development 
of any disclosure requirements arising from the finalization of 
the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms.

Citi is currently subject to the Advanced Approaches 
disclosure requirements, as well as those with respect to 
market risk, under the U.S. Basel III rules. The U.S. banking 
agencies may revise the nature and extent of these disclosure 

52

requirements in the future, as a result of the Basel 
Committee’s revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements.

Regulatory Treatment of Accounting Provisions for 
Expected Credit Losses—Interim Approach and Transitional 
Arrangements
In March 2017, the Basel Committee issued a final rule that 
retains, for an interim period, the current Basel III treatment, 
under both the Standardized Approach and Internal Ratings-
Based Approaches, applicable to accounting provisions for 
credit losses. Such measure is in recognition of the 
promulgation by both the International Accounting Standards 
Board and more recently the U.S. Financial Accounting 
Standards Board of new accounting pronouncements (IFRS 9, 
“Financial Instruments,” and ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial 
Instruments—Credit Losses,” respectively) regarding the 
impairment of financial assets and adoption of provisioning 
standards which incorporate forward-looking assessments in 
the estimation of expected credit losses, which represents a 
substantial departure from the recognition of credit losses 
under the current incurred loss model. Measuring the 
impairment of loans and other financial assets under expected 
credit loss models may result in earlier recognition of, and 
higher accounting provisions for, credit losses, and 
consequently may increase volatility in regulatory capital. The 
current Basel III treatment is being retained so as to afford the 
Basel Committee additional time in which to thoroughly 
consider and develop a permanent regulatory capital treatment 
with respect to accounting provisions for expected credit 
losses.  

Moreover, the final rule provides for optional transitional 

arrangements, which may be availed by jurisdictions, that 
would permit banking organizations to more evenly absorb the 
potentially significant adverse impact on regulatory capital 
arising from the recognition of higher expected credit loss 
provisions. The final rule also establishes standards with 
which these transitional arrangements must comply.   

The U.S. banking agencies may revise the Basel III rules 
in the future in conjunction with the adoption by U.S. banking 
organizations of the current expected credit loss model as set 
forth under ASU 2016-13.  

Revised Assessment Framework for Global Systemically 
Important Banks
In March 2017, the Basel Committee issued a consultative 
document which proposes revisions to the framework for 
assessing the global systemic importance of banks. The 
current framework employed by the Basel Committee as to the 
identification of GSIBs and the assessment of a surcharge is 
based primarily on quantitative measurement indicators 
underlying five equally weighted broad categories of systemic 
importance: (i) size, (ii) interconnectedness, (iii) cross-
jurisdictional activity, (iv) substitutability/financial institution 
infrastructure, and (v) complexity. With the exception of size, 
each of the other categories is composed of multiple 
indicators, amounting to 12 indicators in total. 

The proposal, which reflects the results of the Basel 

Committee’s planned initial review, sets forth several 
modifications to its GSIB framework, the most significant of 

which for Citi would be the removal of the existing cap on the 
substitutability/financial institution infrastructure category. 
Among the other changes proposed by the Basel Committee 
and estimated to be of lesser impact to Citi, would be the 
introduction within the substitutability/financial institution 
infrastructure category of a trading volume indicator, 
accompanied by an equivalent reduction in the current 
weighting of the existing underwriting indicator. Moreover, 
the Basel Committee’s proposed requirement to expand the 
scope of consolidation to include exposures of insurance 
subsidiaries within the size, interconnectedness, and 
complexity categories would raise the global aggregate of 
these respective measures of systemic importance to which all 
GSIBs are subject, and as a result it is estimated that Citi 
would benefit on a relative basis vis-a-vis certain other GSIBs, 
given that its insurance subsidiaries are presently consolidated 
under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and for 
regulatory purposes. Aside from these proposed modifications, 
the Basel Committee is also separately seeking feedback on 
the potential for a new indicator regarding short-term 
wholesale funding.   

In contrast, a U.S. bank holding company that is 

designated a GSIB under the Federal Reserve Board’s rule is 
required, on an annual basis, to calculate a surcharge using 
two methods, and is subject to the higher of the resulting two 
surcharges. The first method (“method 1”) is based on the 
same five broad categories of systemic importance resident 
under the Basel Committee’s framework to identify a GSIB 
and derive a surcharge. Under the second method (“method 
2”), the substitutability category is replaced with a quantitative 
measure intended to assess the extent of a GSIB’s reliance on 
short-term wholesale funding. 

Accordingly, if the Federal Reserve Board were to adopt 
the Basel Committee’s proposed revisions with respect to the 
U.S. GSIB framework, Citi’s method 1 GSIB surcharge could 
potentially increase, while its method 2 GSIB surcharge would 
remain unchanged. Further, while it is currently estimated that 
under these circumstances method 2 would remain Citi’s 
binding constraint for GSIB surcharge purposes, nonetheless 
an increase in Citi’s method 1 GSIB surcharge could impact 
the extent to which Citi satisfies certain TLAC minimum 
requirements in the future. 

Revisions to the Securitization Framework
In July 2017, the Basel Committee issued two consultative 
documents: one which establishes criteria for identifying 
“simple, transparent, and comparable” (STC) short-term 
securitizations, and another which provides for an alternative, 
and potentially preferential, regulatory capital treatment for 
short-term securitizations identified as STC. The Basel 
Committee had previously issued criteria solely for identifying 
STC securitizations in July 2015, and also previously issued 
an alternative regulatory capital treatment for STC 
securitizations in July 2016. The July 2017 consultative 
documents, however, introduce identification criteria and 
regulatory capital treatments that are uniquely tailored to 
short-term securitizations, with a focus on exposures related to 
asset-backed commercial paper conduits. 

53

The U.S. banking agencies may revise the regulatory 
capital treatment of STC short-term securitizations in the 
future, based upon any revisions adopted by the Basel 
Committee.

Identification and Management of Step-in Risk
In October 2017, the Basel Committee issued final guidelines 
regarding the identification and management of so-called 
“step-in risk,” which is defined as “the risk that a bank decides 
to provide financial support to an unconsolidated entity that is 
facing stress, in the absence of, or in excess of, any contractual 
obligations to provide such support.” The guidelines establish 
a framework to be used by banks for conducting a self-
assessment of step-in risk, which would also be reported to 
each bank’s respective national supervisors. The self-
assessment of step-in risk should consider the risk 
characteristics of certain unconsolidated entities, as well as the 
bank’s relationship to such entities. The framework, however, 
does not require any additional regulatory capital or liquidity 
charges beyond the current Basel III rules. 

The Basel Committee expects the guidelines to be enacted 
by member jurisdictions no later than 2020. The U.S. banking 
agencies may issue guidelines regarding the identification and 
measurement of step-in risk in the future, as a result of the 
Basel Committee’s guidelines.

Tangible Common Equity, Tangible Book Value Per Share, 
Book Value Per Share and Returns on Equity
Tangible common equity (TCE), as defined by Citi, represents 
common equity less goodwill and other intangible assets 
(other than MSRs). Other companies may calculate TCE in a 
different manner. TCE, tangible book value per share and 
returns on average TCE are non-GAAP financial measures. 
Citi believes these capital metrics provide alternative measures 
of capital strength and performance and are commonly used 
by investors and industry analysts.

RISK FACTORS

The following discussion sets forth what management 
currently believes could be the most significant risks and 
uncertainties that could impact Citi’s businesses, results of 
operations and financial condition. Other risks and 
uncertainties, including those not currently known to Citi or its 
management, could also negatively impact Citi’s businesses, 
results of operations and financial condition. Thus, the 
following should not be considered a complete discussion of 
all of the risks and uncertainties Citi may face.

STRATEGIC RISKS

Citi’s Ability to Return Capital to Common Shareholders 
Consistent with Its Capital Optimization Efforts 
Substantially Depends on the CCAR Process and the Results 
of Regulatory Stress Tests.
In addition to Board of Director approval, Citi’s ability to 
return capital to its common shareholders consistent with its 
capital optimization efforts, whether through its common stock 
dividend or through a share repurchase program, substantially 
depends on regulatory approval, including through the CCAR 
process required by the Federal Reserve Board and the 
supervisory stress tests required under the Dodd-Frank Act. 
For additional information on Citi’s return of capital to 
common shareholders in 2017 as well as the CCAR process 
and supervisory stress test requirements, see “Capital 
Resources—Overview” and “Capital Resources—Stress 
Testing Component of Capital Planning” above.

Citi’s ability to accurately predict, interpret or explain to 

stakeholders the outcome of the CCAR process, and thus 
address any such market or investor perceptions, is difficult as 
the Federal Reserve Board’s assessment of Citi’s capital 
adequacy is conducted using the Board’s proprietary stress test 
models, as well as a number of qualitative factors, including a 
detailed assessment of Citi’s “capital adequacy process,” as 
defined by the Board. The Federal Reserve Board has stated 
that it expects leading capital adequacy practices will continue 
to evolve and will likely be determined by the Board each year 
as a result of its cross-firm review of capital plan submissions. 
Similarly, the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that, as part 
of its stated goal to continually evolve its annual stress testing 
requirements, several parameters of the annual stress testing 
process may be altered from time to time, including the 
severity of the stress test scenario, the Federal Reserve Board 
modeling of Citi’s balance sheet and the addition of 
components deemed important by the Federal Reserve Board 
(e.g., additional macroprudential considerations such as 
funding and liquidity shocks). 

Moreover, in 2016, senior officials at the Federal Reserve 
Board indicated that the Board was considering integration of 
the annual stress testing requirements with ongoing regulatory 
capital requirements. While there has been no formal proposal 
from the Federal Reserve Board to date, changes to the stress 
testing regime being discussed, among others, include 
introduction of a firm-specific “stress capital buffer” (SCB), 
which would be equal to the maximum decline in a firm’s 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio under a severely adverse 

56

scenario over a nine-quarter CCAR measurement period, 
subject to a minimum requirement of 2.5%. Accordingly, a 
firm’s SCB would change annually based on its stress test 
results in the prior year. Officials discussed the idea that the 
SCB would replace the capital conservation buffer in both the 
firm’s ongoing regulatory capital requirements and as part of 
the floor for capital distributions in the CCAR process. 
Federal Reserve Board senior officials also noted that 
introduction of the SCB would have the effect of incorporating 
a firm’s then-effective GSIB surcharge into its post-stress test 
minimum capital requirements, which the Board has 
previously indicated it is considering.

Although various uncertainties exist regarding the extent 
of, and the ultimate impact to Citi from, these changes to the 
Federal Reserve Board’s stress testing and CCAR regimes, 
these changes would likely increase the level of capital Citi is 
required to hold, thus potentially impacting the extent to 
which Citi is able to return capital to shareholders.

Citi, Its Management and Businesses Must Continually 
Review, Analyze and Successfully Adapt to Ongoing 
Regulatory and Other Uncertainties and Changes in the U.S. 
and Globally.
Despite the adoption of final regulations in numerous areas 
impacting Citi and its businesses over the past several years, 
Citi, its management and businesses continually face ongoing 
regulatory uncertainties and changes, both in the U.S. and 
globally. While the areas of ongoing regulatory uncertainties 
and changes facing Citi are too numerous to list completely, 
various examples include, but are not limited to (i) 
uncertainties and potential fiscal, monetary and regulatory 
changes arising from the U.S. Presidential administration and 
Congress; (ii) potential changes to various aspects of the 
regulatory capital framework applicable to Citi (see the CCAR 
risk factor and “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital 
Standards Developments” above); and (iii) the terms of and 
other uncertainties resulting from the U.K.’s potential exit 
from the European Union (EU) (see the macroeconomic 
challenges and uncertainties risk factor below).

Ongoing regulatory uncertainties and changes make Citi’s 

and its management’s long-term business, balance sheet and 
budget planning difficult or subject to change. For example, 
the U.S. Presidential administration has discussed various 
changes to certain regulatory requirements, which would 
require ongoing assessment by management as to the impact 
to Citi, its businesses and business planning. Business 
planning is required to be based on possible or proposed rules 
or outcomes, which can change dramatically upon finalization, 
or upon implementation or interpretive guidance from 
numerous regulatory bodies worldwide, and such guidance 
can change.

Moreover, U.S. and international regulatory initiatives 

have not always been undertaken or implemented on a 
coordinated basis, and areas of divergence have developed and 
continue to develop with respect to the scope, interpretation, 
timing, structure or approach, leading to inconsistent or even 
conflicting regulations, including within a single jurisdiction. 
For example, in 2016, the European Commission proposed to 
introduce a new requirement for major banking groups 

headquartered outside the EU (which would include Citi) to 
establish an intermediate EU holding company where the 
foreign bank has two or more institutions (broadly meaning 
banks, broker-dealers and similar financial firms) established 
in the EU. While the proposal mirrors an existing U.S. 
requirement for non-U.S. banking organizations to form U.S. 
intermediate holding companies, if adopted, it could lead to 
additional complexity with respect to Citi’s resolution 
planning, capital and liquidity allocation and efficiency in 
various jurisdictions. Regulatory changes have also 
significantly increased Citi’s compliance risks and costs (see 
the implementation and interpretation of regulatory changes 
risk factor below).

Citi’s Ability to Utilize Its DTAs, and Thus Reduce the 
Negative Impact of the DTAs on Citi’s Regulatory Capital, 
Will Be Driven by Its Ability to Generate U.S. Taxable 
Income and by the Provisions of and Guidance Issued in 
Connection with Tax Reform.
At December 31, 2017, after the $22.6 billion remeasurement 
of DTAs due to the impact of Tax Reform, Citi’s net DTAs 
were $22.5 billion, net of a valuation allowance of $9.4 
billion, of which $12.3 billion was excluded from Citi’s 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, on a fully implemented basis, 
under the U.S. Basel III rules (for additional information, see 
“Capital Resources—Components of Citigroup Capital Under 
Basel III (Advanced Approaches with Full Implementation)” 
above). Of the net DTAs at December 31, 2017, $7.6 billion 
related to foreign tax credit carry-forwards (FTCs), net of a 
valuation allowance. The carry-forward utilization period for 
FTCs is 10 years and represents the most time-sensitive 
component of Citi’s DTAs. The FTC carry-forwards at 
December 31, 2017 expire over the period of 2018–2027. Citi 
must utilize any FTCs generated in the then-current year tax 
return prior to utilizing any carry-forward FTCs.

The accounting treatment for realization of DTAs, 

including FTCs, is complex and requires significant judgment 
and estimates regarding future taxable earnings in the 
jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise and available tax 
planning strategies. Citi’s ability to utilize its DTAs, including 
the FTC components, will be dependent upon Citi’s ability to 
generate U.S. taxable income in the relevant tax carry-forward 
periods. Failure to realize any portion of the DTAs would also 
have a corresponding negative impact on Citi’s net income.

Citi expects transitional guidance from the U.S. 

Department of the Treasury (U.S. Treasury) in 2018 regarding 
the required allocation of existing FTC carry-forwards to the 
appropriate FTC baskets as redefined by Tax Reform. The 
U.S. Treasury is also expected to provide transitional guidance 
that addresses the allocation of the overall domestic loss 
(ODL) to these FTC baskets. An ODL allows a company to 
recharacterize domestic income as income from sources 
outside the U.S., which enables a taxpayer to use FTC carry-
forwards and FTCs generated in future years, assuming the 
generation of sufficient U.S. taxed income. If the guidance 
issued by the U.S. Treasury differs from Citi’s assumptions, 
the valuation allowance against Citi’s FTC carry-forwards 
would increase or decrease, depending upon the guidance 
received. Citi’s net income would change by a corresponding 

amount. However, a change in recognized FTC carry-forwards 
would not impact Citi’s regulatory capital, given that such 
amounts are already fully disallowed. 

Citi does not expect to be subject to the Base Erosion 

Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) added by Tax Reform. However, U.S. 
Treasury guidance regarding BEAT could affect Citi’s 
decisions as to how to structure its non-U.S. operations, 
possibly in a less cost efficient manner. In addition, if BEAT 
were to be applicable to Citi in any given year, it could have a 
significantly adverse effect on both Citi’s net income and 
regulatory capital.

For additional information on the impact of Tax Reform 

and on Citi’s DTAs, including the FTCs, see “Significant 
Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—Income 
Taxes” below and Notes 1 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.

Citi’s Interpretation or Application of the Complex Tax Laws 
to Which It Is Subject Could Differ from Those of the 
Relevant Governmental Authorities, Which Could Result in 
the Payment of Additional Taxes, Penalties or Interest.
Citi is subject to the various tax laws of the U.S. and its states 
and municipalities, as well as the numerous non-U.S. 
jurisdictions in which it operates. These tax laws are 
inherently complex and Citi must make judgments and 
interpretations about the application of these laws, including 
Tax Reform as mentioned above, to its entities, operations and 
businesses. Citi’s interpretations and application of the tax 
laws, including with respect to Tax Reform, withholding tax 
obligations and stamp and other transactional taxes, could 
differ from that of the relevant governmental taxing authority, 
which could result in the payment of additional taxes, 
penalties or interest, which could be material. 

Citi’s Ongoing Investments and Efficiency Initiatives May 
Not Be as Successful as It Projects or Expects.
Citi continues to make important investments to streamline its 
infrastructure and improve its client experience. For example, 
Citi has been investing in higher return businesses, including 
the U.S. cards and wealth management businesses in Global 
Consumer Banking as well as certain businesses in 
Institutional Clients Group, such as equities. Citi continues to 
invest in its technology systems to enhance its digital 
capabilities across the franchise. In addition, in 2016, Citi 
announced a more than $1 billion investment in Citibanamex 
that is expected to be completed by 2020. Citi’s investment 
strategy will likely continue to evolve and change as its 
business strategy and priorities change. Citi also has been 
pursuing efficiency savings through its technology and digital 
initiatives, location strategy and organizational simplification. 

These investments and efficiency initiatives are being 

undertaken as part of Citi’s overall strategy to meet 
operational and financial objectives and targets, including 
earnings growth expectations. There is no guarantee that these 
or other initiatives Citi may pursue in its businesses or 
operations will be as productive or effective as Citi expects, or 
at all. Further, Citi’s ability to achieve expected returns on its 
investments and costs savings depends, in part, on factors that 
it cannot control, such as macroeconomic conditions, customer 

57

and client reactions and ongoing regulatory changes, among 
others.

Citi Has Co-Branding and Private Label Credit Card 
Relationships with Various Retailers and Merchants and the 
Failure to Maintain These Relationships Could Have a 
Negative Impact on Citi’s Results of Operations or Financial 
Condition.
Citi has co-branding and private label relationships through its 
Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services credit card 
businesses with various retailers and merchants globally in the 
ordinary course of business whereby Citi issues credit cards to 
customers of the retailers or merchants. Citi’s co-branding and 
private label agreements provide for shared economics 
between the parties and generally have a fixed term. The five 
largest relationships constituted an aggregate of approximately 
11% of Citi’s revenues for 2017.

These relationships could be negatively impacted due to, 

among other things, declining sales and revenues or other 
difficulties of the retailer or merchant, termination due to a 
breach by Citi, the retailer or merchant of its responsibilities, 
or external factors, including bankruptcies, liquidations, 
restructurings, consolidations and other similar events. Over 
the last several years, a number of retailers in the U.S. have 
continued to experience declining sales, which has resulted in 
significant numbers of store closures and, in a number of 
cases, bankruptcies, as retailers attempt to cut costs and 
compete with online retailers. In addition, as has been widely 
reported, competition among card issuers, including Citi, for 
these relationships is significant, and it has become 
increasingly difficult in recent years to maintain such 
relationships on the same terms or at all. While various 
mitigating factors could be available to Citi if any of these 
events were to occur—such as by replacing the retailer or 
merchant or offering other card products—such events could 
negatively impact Citi’s results of operations or financial 
condition, including as a result of loss of revenues, higher cost 
of credit, impairment of purchased credit card relationships 
and contract-related intangibles or other losses (for 
information on Citi’s credit card related intangibles generally, 
see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Challenges and 
Uncertainties Globally Could Have a Negative Impact on 
Citi’s Businesses and Results of Operations.
Citi has experienced, and could experience in the future, 
negative impacts to its businesses and results of operations as 
a result of macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges, 
uncertainties and volatility. As a result of a 2016 U.K. 
referendum, the U.K. triggered Article 50 in March 2017, 
beginning the two-year period in which the U.K. will negotiate 
its exit from the EU. Since then, numerous uncertainties have 
arisen, including, among others, (i) potential changes to Citi’s 
legal entity and booking model strategy and/or structure in 
both the U.K. and the EU based on the outcome of 
negotiations relating to the regulation of financial services; (ii) 
the potential impact of the exit to the U.K. and European 
economies and other financial markets; and (iii) the potential 

58

impact to Citi’s exposures to counterparties as a result of any 
economic slowdown in the U.K. or Europe. 

In addition, governmental fiscal and monetary actions, or 
expected actions, such as changes in the federal funds rate and 
any balance sheet normalization program implemented by the 
Federal Reserve Board or other central banks, could impact 
interest rates, economic growth rates, the volatilities of global 
financial markets, foreign exchange rates and capital flows 
among countries. Although Citi estimates its overall net 
interest revenue would generally increase due to higher 
interest rates, higher rates could adversely affect Citi’s funding 
costs, levels of deposits in its consumer and institutional 
businesses and certain business or product revenues. Also, the 
U.S. Presidential administration has indicated it may pursue 
protectionist trade and other policies, which could result in 
additional macroeconomic and/or geopolitical challenges, 
uncertainties and volatilities. Further, the economic and fiscal 
situations of certain European countries have remained fragile, 
and concerns and uncertainties remain in Europe over the 
potential exit of additional countries from the EU. 

These and other global macroeconomic and geopolitical 

challenges, uncertainties and volatilities have negatively 
impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, Citi’s 
businesses, results of operations and financial condition, 
including its credit costs, revenues in its Markets and 
securities services and other businesses, and AOCI (which 
would in turn negatively impact Citi’s book and tangible book 
value).

Citi’s Presence in the Emerging Markets Subjects It to 
Various Risks as well as Increased Compliance and 
Regulatory Risks and Costs.
During 2017, emerging markets revenues accounted for 
approximately 36% of Citi’s total revenues (Citi generally 
defines emerging markets as countries in Latin America, Asia 
(other than Japan, Australia and New Zealand), Central and 
Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa).

Citi’s presence in the emerging markets subjects it to a 

number of risks, including sovereign volatility, political 
events, foreign exchange controls, limitations on foreign 
investment, sociopolitical instability (including from hyper-
inflation), fraud, nationalization or loss of licenses, business 
restrictions, sanctions or asset freezes, potential criminal 
charges, closure of branches or subsidiaries and confiscation 
of assets. For example, Citi operates in several countries that 
have, or have had in the past, strict foreign exchange controls, 
such as Argentina, that limit its ability to convert local 
currency into U.S. dollars and/or transfer funds outside the 
country. In prior years, Citi has also discovered fraud in 
certain emerging markets in which it operates. Political 
turmoil and other instability have occurred in certain regions 
and countries, including Asia, the Middle East and Latin 
America, which have required management time and attention 
in prior years (e.g., monitoring the impact of sanctions on the 
Venezuelan and other countries’ economies as well as Citi’s 
businesses and results of operations).

Citi’s emerging markets presence also increases its 

compliance and regulatory risks and costs. For example, Citi’s 
operations in emerging markets, including facilitating cross-

border transactions on behalf of its clients, subject it to higher 
compliance risks under U.S. regulations primarily focused on 
various aspects of global corporate activities, such as anti-
money laundering regulations and the Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act. These risks can be more acute in less-developed 
markets and thus require substantial investment in compliance 
infrastructure or could result in a reduction in certain of Citi’s 
business activities. Any failure by Citi to comply with 
applicable U.S. regulations, as well as the regulations in the 
countries and markets in which it operates as a result of its 
global footprint, could result in fines, penalties, injunctions or 
other similar restrictions, any of which could negatively 
impact Citi’s results of operations and reputation.

Citi’s Inability in Its Resolution Plan Submissions to Address 
Any Deficiencies Identified or Future Guidance Provided by 
the Federal Reserve Board and FDIC Could Subject Citi to 
More Stringent Capital, Leverage or Liquidity Requirements, 
or Restrictions on Its Growth, Activities or Operations, and 
Could Eventually Require Citi to Divest Assets or 
Operations.
Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act requires Citi to prepare and 
submit a plan to the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC for 
the orderly resolution of Citigroup (the bank holding 
company) and its significant legal entities, under the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code in the event of future material financial 
distress or failure. Citi submitted its most recent resolution 
plan in July 2017. On December 19, 2017, the Federal Reserve 
and the FDIC informed Citi that (i) the agencies jointly 
decided that Citi’s 2017 resolution plan submission 
satisfactorily addressed the shortcomings identified in the 
2015 resolution plan submission, and (ii) the agencies did not 
identify any deficiencies in the 2017 resolution plan 
submission. Citi’s next resolution plan submission is due July 
1, 2019. For additional information on Citi’s 2017 resolution 
plan submission, see “Managing Global Risk—Liquidity 
Risk” below.

Under Title I, if the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC 

jointly determine that Citi’s resolution plan is not 
“credible” (which, although not defined, is generally believed 
to mean the regulators do not believe the plan is feasible or 
would otherwise allow the regulators to resolve Citi in a way 
that protects systemically important functions without severe 
systemic disruption), or would not facilitate an orderly 
resolution of Citi under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and Citi 
fails to resubmit a resolution plan that remedies any identified 
deficiencies, Citi could be subjected to more stringent capital, 
leverage or liquidity requirements, or restrictions on its 
growth, activities or operations. If within two years from the 
imposition of any requirements or restrictions Citi has still not 
remediated any identified deficiencies, then Citi could 
eventually be required to divest certain assets or operations. 
Any such restrictions or actions would negatively impact 
Citi’s reputation, market and investor perception, operations 
and strategy.

Citi’s Performance and the Performance of Its Individual 
Businesses Could Be Negatively Impacted if Citi Is Not Able 
to Hire and Retain Highly Qualified Employees for Any 
Reason.
Citi’s performance and the performance of its individual 
businesses largely depends on the talents and efforts of its 
highly skilled employees. Specifically, Citi’s continued ability 
to compete in its businesses, to manage its businesses 
effectively and to continue to execute its overall global 
strategy depends on its ability to attract new employees and to 
retain and motivate its existing employees. If Citi is unable to 
continue to attract and retain the most highly qualified 
employees for any reason, Citi’s performance, including its 
competitive position, the successful execution of its overall 
strategy and its results of operations could be negatively 
impacted.

Citi’s ability to attract and retain employees depends on 

numerous factors, some of which are outside of its control. For 
example, the banking industry generally is subject to more 
stringent regulation of executive and employee compensation 
than other industries, including deferral and clawback 
requirements for incentive compensation. Citi often competes 
in the market for talent with entities that are not subject to 
such significant regulatory restrictions on the structure of 
incentive compensation. Other factors that could impact Citi’s 
ability to attract and retain employees include its culture, 
compensation, and the management and leadership of the 
company as well as its individual businesses, presence in the 
particular market or region at issue and the professional 
opportunities it offers. 

U.S. and Non-U.S. Financial Services Companies and 
Others Pose Increasingly Competitive Challenges to Citi.
Citi operates in an increasingly competitive environment, 
which includes both financial and non-financial services firms. 
These companies compete on the basis of, among other 
factors, quality and type of products and services offered, 
price, technology and reputation. Citi competes with financial 
services companies in the U.S. and globally, which continually 
develop and introduce new products and services. In addition, 
in recent years, non-financial services firms, such as financial 
technology firms, have begun to offer services traditionally 
provided by financial institutions, such as Citi. These firms 
attempt to use technology and mobile platforms to enhance the 
ability of companies and individuals to borrow money, save 
and invest. To the extent it is not able to effectively compete 
with these and other firms, Citi could be placed at a 
competitive disadvantage, which could result in loss of 
customers and market share, and its businesses, results of 
operations and financial condition could suffer. For additional 
information on Citi’s competitors, see the co-brand and private 
label cards risk factor above and “Supervision, Regulation and 
Other—Competition” below.

CREDIT RISKS

Concentrations of Risk Can Increase the Potential for Citi to 
Incur Significant Losses.
Concentrations of risk, particularly credit and market risk, can 
increase Citi’s risk of significant losses. As of year-end 2017, 
Citi’s most significant concentration of credit risk was with the 
U.S. government and its agencies, which primarily results 
from trading assets and investments issued by the U.S. 
government and its agencies (for additional information, 
including concentrations of credit risk to other public sector 
entities, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements). Citi also routinely executes a high volume of 
securities, trading, derivative and foreign exchange 
transactions with counterparties in the financial services 
industry, including banks, insurance companies, investment 
banks, governments, central banks and other financial 
institutions.

As regulatory or market developments continue to lead to 
increased centralization of trading activity through particular 
clearing houses, central agents, exchanges or other financial 
market utilities, Citi could also experience an increase in 
concentration of risk to these industries. These concentrations 
of risk as well as the risk of failure of a large counterparty, 
central counterparty clearing house or financial market utility 
could limit the effectiveness of Citi’s hedging strategies and 
cause Citi to incur significant losses.

LIQUIDITY RISKS

The Maintenance of Adequate Liquidity and Funding 
Depends on Numerous Factors, Including Those Outside of 
Citi’s Control, Such as Market Disruptions and Increases in 
Citi’s Credit Spreads.
As a global financial institution, adequate liquidity and 
sources of funding are essential to Citi’s businesses. Citi’s 
liquidity and sources of funding can be significantly and 
negatively impacted by factors it cannot control, such as 
general disruptions in the financial markets, governmental 
fiscal and monetary policies, regulatory changes or negative 
investor perceptions of Citi’s creditworthiness.

In addition, Citi’s costs to obtain and access secured 

funding and long-term unsecured funding are directly related 
to its credit spreads. Changes in credit spreads constantly 
occur and are market driven, including both external market 
factors and factors specific to Citi, and can be highly volatile. 

Moreover, Citi’s ability to obtain funding may be 

impaired if other market participants are seeking to access the 
markets at the same time, or if market appetite is reduced, as is 
likely to occur in a liquidity or other market crisis. A sudden 
drop in market liquidity could also cause a temporary or 
lengthier dislocation of underwriting and capital markets 
activity. In addition, clearing organizations, regulators, clients 
and financial institutions with which Citi interacts may 
exercise the right to require additional collateral based on 
these market perceptions or market conditions, which could 
further impair Citi’s access to and cost of funding.

As a holding company, Citi relies on interest, dividends, 
distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund 

dividends as well as to satisfy its debt and other obligations. 
Several of Citi’s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries are or may be 
subject to capital adequacy or other regulatory or contractual 
restrictions on their ability to provide such payments, 
including any local regulatory stress test requirements. 
Limitations on the payments that Citi receives from its 
subsidiaries could also impact its liquidity.
 
The Credit Rating Agencies Continuously Review the Credit 
Ratings of Citi and Certain of Its Subsidiaries, and Ratings 
Downgrades Could Have a Negative Impact on Citi’s 
Funding and Liquidity Due to Reduced Funding Capacity 
and Increased Funding Costs, Including Derivatives 
Triggers That Could Require Cash Obligations or Collateral 
Requirements.
The credit rating agencies, such as Fitch, Moody’s and S&P, 
continuously evaluate Citi and certain of its subsidiaries, and 
their ratings of Citi and its more significant subsidiaries’ long-
term/senior debt and short-term/commercial paper, as 
applicable, are based on a number of factors, including 
standalone financial strength, as well as factors not entirely 
within the control of Citi and its subsidiaries, such as the 
agencies’ proprietary rating agency methodologies and 
assumptions and conditions affecting the financial services 
industry and markets generally.

Citi and its subsidiaries may not be able to maintain their 

current respective ratings. Ratings downgrades could 
negatively impact Citi’s ability to access the capital markets 
and other sources of funds as well as the costs of those funds, 
and its ability to maintain certain deposits. A ratings 
downgrade could also have a negative impact on Citi’s 
funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, as well 
as the impact of derivative triggers, which could require Citi to 
meet cash obligations and collateral requirements. In addition, 
a ratings downgrade could also have a negative impact on 
other funding sources, such as secured financing and other 
margined transactions for which there may be no explicit 
triggers, as well as on contractual provisions and other credit 
requirements of Citi’s counterparties and clients, which may 
contain minimum ratings thresholds in order for Citi to hold 
third-party funds.

Moreover, credit ratings downgrades can have impacts 

that may not be currently known to Citi or are not possible to 
quantify. For example, some entities may have ratings 
limitations as to their permissible counterparties, of which Citi 
may or may not be aware. In addition, certain of Citi’s 
corporate customers and trading counterparties, among other 
clients, could re-evaluate their business relationships with Citi 
and limit the trading of certain contracts or market instruments 
with Citi in response to ratings downgrades. Changes in 
customer and counterparty behavior could impact not only 
Citi’s funding and liquidity but also the results of operations of 
certain Citi businesses. For additional information on the 
potential impact of a reduction in Citi’s or Citibank’s credit 
ratings, see “Managing Global Risk—Liquidity Risk” below.

OPERATIONAL RISKS

A Disruption of Citi’s Operational Systems Could Negatively 
Impact Citi’s Reputation, Customers, Clients, Businesses or 
Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
A significant portion of Citi’s operations relies heavily on the 
secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential 
and other information as well as the monitoring of a large 
number of complex transactions on a minute-by-minute basis. 
For example, through its Global Consumer Banking and credit 
card and securities services businesses in Institutional Clients 
Group, Citi obtains and stores an extensive amount of personal 
and client-specific information for its retail, corporate and 
governmental customers and clients and must accurately 
record and reflect their extensive account transactions.

With the evolving proliferation of new technologies and 
the increasing use of the Internet, mobile devices and cloud 
technologies to conduct financial transactions, large global 
financial institutions such as Citi have been, and will continue 
to be, subject to an increasing risk of operational disruption or 
cyber or information security incidents from these activities 
(for additional information on cybersecurity risk, see the 
discussion below). These incidents are unpredictable and can 
arise from numerous sources, not all of which are in Citi’s 
control, including among others human error, fraud or malice 
on the part of employees, accidental technological failure, 
electrical or telecommunication outages, failures of computer 
servers or other similar damage to Citi’s property or assets. 
These issues can also arise as a result of failures by third 
parties with which Citi does business, such as failures by 
Internet, mobile technology and cloud service providers or 
other vendors to adequately safeguard their systems and 
prevent system disruptions or cyber attacks.

Such events could cause interruptions or malfunctions in 

the operations of Citi (such as the temporary loss of 
availability of Citi’s online banking system or mobile banking 
platform), as well as the operations of its clients, customers or 
other third parties. Given Citi’s global footprint and the high 
volume of transactions processed by Citi, certain errors or 
actions may be repeated or compounded before they are 
discovered and rectified, which would further increase these 
costs and consequences. Any such events could also result in 
financial losses as well as misappropriation, corruption or loss 
of confidential and other information or assets, which could 
negatively impact Citi’s reputation, customers, clients, 
businesses or results of operations and financial condition, 
perhaps significantly.

Citi’s and Third Parties’ Computer Systems and Networks 
Have Been, and Will Continue to Be, Subject to an 
Increasing Risk of Continually Evolving, Sophisticated 
Cybersecurity Risks That Could Result in the Theft, Loss, 
Misuse or Disclosure of Confidential Client or Customer 
Information, Damage to Citi’s Reputation, Additional Costs 
to Citi, Regulatory Penalties, Legal Exposure and Financial 
Losses.
Citi’s computer systems, software and networks are subject to 
ongoing cyber incidents such as unauthorized access, loss or 
destruction of data (including confidential client information), 

61

account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses 
or other malicious code, cyber attacks and other similar 
events. These threats can arise from external parties, including 
criminal organizations, extremist parties and certain foreign 
state actors that engage in cyber activities. 

Third parties with which Citi does business, as well as 

retailers and other third parties with which Citi’s customers do 
business, may also be sources of cybersecurity risks, 
particularly where activities of customers are beyond Citi’s 
security and control systems. For example, Citi outsources 
certain functions, such as processing customer credit card 
transactions, uploading content on customer-facing websites, 
and developing software for new products and services. These 
relationships allow for the storage and processing of customer 
information by third-party hosting of or access to Citi 
websites, which could result in compromise or the potential to 
introduce vulnerable or malicious code, resulting in security 
breaches impacting Citi customers. Furthermore, because 
financial institutions are becoming increasingly interconnected 
with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses, including 
as a result of the derivatives reforms over the last few years, 
Citi has increased exposure to cyber attacks through third 
parties.

As further evidence of the increasing and potentially 

significant impact of cyber incidents, in 2017, a credit bureau 
reported a cyber incident that impacted sensitive information 
of an estimated 143 million consumers. In addition, in recent 
years, several U.S. retailers and financial institutions and other 
multinational companies reported cyber incidents that 
compromised customer data or resulted in theft of funds or 
theft or destruction of corporate information or other assets. 
Moreover, the U.S. government as well as several 
multinational companies reported cyber incidents in prior 
years that affected their computer systems resulting in the data 
of millions of customers and employees being compromised. 
These incidents have resulted in increased legislative and 
regulatory scrutiny of firms’ cybersecurity protection services 
and calls for additional laws and regulations to further enhance 
protection of consumers’ personal data.

While Citi has not been materially impacted by these 

reported or other cyber incidents, Citi has been subject to other 
intentional cyber incidents from external sources over the last 
several years, including (i) denial of service attacks, which 
attempted to interrupt service to clients and customers, (ii) 
data breaches, which obtained unauthorized access to 
customer account data and (iii) malicious software attacks on 
client systems, which attempted to allow unauthorized 
entrance to Citi’s systems under the guise of a client and the 
extraction of client data. While Citi’s monitoring and 
protection services were able to detect and respond to the 
incidents targeting its systems before they became significant, 
they still resulted in limited losses in some instances as well as 
increases in expenditures to monitor against the threat of 
similar future cyber incidents. There can be no assurance that 
such cyber incidents will not occur again, and they could 
occur more frequently and on a more significant scale.

Further, although Citi devotes significant resources to 

implement, maintain, monitor and regularly upgrade its 
systems and networks with measures such as intrusion 

detection and prevention and firewalls to safeguard critical 
business applications, there is no guarantee that these 
measures or any other measures can provide absolute security. 
Because the methods used to cause cyber attacks change 
frequently or, in some cases, are not recognized until 
launched, Citi may be unable to implement effective 
preventive measures or proactively address these methods 
until they are discovered. In addition, while Citi engages in 
certain actions to reduce the exposure resulting from 
outsourcing, such as performing onsite security control 
assessments and limiting third-party access to the least 
privileged level necessary to perform job functions, these 
actions cannot prevent all external cyber attacks, information 
breaches or similar losses.

Cyber incidents can result in the disclosure of personal, 

confidential or proprietary customer or client information, 
damage to Citi’s reputation with its clients and the market, 
customer dissatisfaction, additional costs (including credit 
costs) to Citi (such as repairing systems, replacing customer 
payment cards or adding new personnel or protection 
technologies), regulatory penalties, loss of revenues, exposure 
to litigation and other financial losses, including loss of funds, 
to both Citi and its clients and customers (for additional 
information on the potential impact from cyber incidents, see 
the operational systems risk factor above).

While Citi maintains insurance coverage that may, 

subject to policy terms and conditions including significant 
self-insured deductibles, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, 
such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all 
losses.

Incorrect Assumptions or Estimates in Citi’s Financial 
Statements Could Cause Significant Unexpected Losses in 
the Future, and Changes to Financial Accounting and 
Reporting Standards or Interpretations Could Have a 
Material Impact on How Citi Records and Reports Its 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
U.S. GAAP requires Citi to use certain assumptions and 
estimates in preparing its financial statements, including 
reserves related to litigation and regulatory exposures, 
valuation of DTAs, the estimate of the allowance for credit 
losses and the fair values of certain assets and liabilities, 
among other items. If Citi’s assumptions or estimates 
underlying its financial statements are incorrect or differ from 
actual future events, Citi could experience unexpected losses, 
some of which could be significant.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has 
issued several financial accounting and reporting standards 
that will govern key aspects of Citi’s financial statements or 
interpretations thereof when those standards become effective, 
including those areas where Citi is required to make 
assumptions or estimates. For example, the FASB’s new 
accounting standard on credit losses, which will become 
effective for Citi on January 1, 2020, will require earlier 
recognition of credit losses on financial assets. The new 
accounting model requires that lifetime “expected credit 
losses” on financial assets not recorded at fair value through 
net income, such as loans and held-to-maturity securities, be 
recorded at inception of the financial asset, replacing the 

62

multiple existing impairment models under U.S. GAAP that 
generally require that a loss be “incurred” before it is 
recognized (for additional information on this and other 
accounting standards, see “Significant Accounting Policies 
and Significant Estimates” below).

Changes to financial accounting or reporting standards or 
interpretations, whether promulgated or required by the FASB 
or other regulators, could present operational challenges and 
could require Citi to change certain of the assumptions or 
estimates it previously used in preparing its financial 
statements, which could negatively impact how it records and 
reports its financial condition and results of operations 
generally and/or with respect to particular businesses. For 
additional information on the key areas for which assumptions 
and estimates are used in preparing Citi’s financial statements, 
see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant 
Estimates” below and Notes 1 and 27 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

Citi May Incur Significant Losses and Its Regulatory Capital 
and Capital Ratios Could be Negatively Impacted if Its Risk 
Management Process, Strategies or Models Are Deficient or 
Ineffective.
Citi utilizes a broad and diversified set of risk management 
and mitigation processes and strategies, including the use of 
various risk models in analyzing and monitoring the various 
risks Citi assumes in conducting its activities. For example, 
Citi uses models as part of its various stress testing initiatives 
across Citi. Citi also relies on data to aggregate, assess and 
manage various risk exposures. Management of these risks is 
made even more challenging within a global financial 
institution such as Citi, particularly given the complex, diverse 
and rapidly changing financial markets and conditions in 
which Citi operates.

These processes, strategies and models are inherently 

limited because they involve techniques, including the use of 
historical data in many circumstances, and judgments that 
cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the 
markets in which Citi operates, nor can they anticipate the 
specifics and timing of such outcomes. Citi could incur 
significant losses and its regulatory capital and capital ratios 
could be negatively impacted, if Citi’s risk management 
processes, including its ability to manage and aggregate data 
in a timely and accurate manner, strategies or models are 
deficient or ineffective. Such deficiencies or ineffectiveness 
could also result in inaccurate financial, regulatory or risk 
reporting.

Moreover, Citi’s Basel III regulatory capital models, 
including its credit, market and operational risk models, 
currently remain subject to ongoing regulatory review and 
approval, which may result in refinements, modifications or 
enhancements (required or otherwise) to these models. 
Modifications or requirements resulting from these ongoing 
reviews, as well as any future changes or guidance provided 
by the U.S. banking agencies regarding the regulatory capital 
framework applicable to Citi, have resulted in, and could 
continue to result in, significant changes to Citi’s risk-
weighted assets. These changes can negatively impact Citi’s 

capital ratios and its ability to achieve its regulatory capital 
requirements as it projects or as required.

COMPLIANCE, CONDUCT AND LEGAL RISKS

Ongoing Implementation and Interpretation of Regulatory 
Changes and Requirements in the U.S. and Globally Have 
Increased Citi’s Compliance Risks and Costs.
As referenced above, over the past several years, Citi has been 
required to implement a significant number of regulatory 
changes across all of its businesses and functions, and these 
changes continue. In some cases, Citi’s implementation of a 
regulatory requirement is occurring simultaneously with 
changing or conflicting regulatory guidance, legal challenges 
or legislative action to modify or repeal existing rules or enact 
new rules. Moreover, in many cases, these are entirely new 
regulatory requirements or regimes, resulting in much 
uncertainty regarding regulatory expectations as to what is 
definitely required in order to be in compliance. 
Accompanying this compliance uncertainty is heightened 
regulatory scrutiny and expectations in the U.S. and globally 
for the financial services industry with respect to governance 
and risk management practices, including its compliance and 
regulatory risks (for a discussion of heightened regulatory 
expectations on “conduct risk” at, and the overall “culture” of, 
financial institutions such as Citi, see the legal and regulatory 
proceedings risk factor below). All of these factors have 
resulted in increased compliance risks and costs for Citi.

Examples of regulatory changes that have resulted in 

increased compliance risks and costs include (i) the Federal 
Reserve Board’s “total loss absorbing capacity” (TLAC) 
requirements, including consequences of a breach of the 
external long-term debt (LTD) requirement and the clean 
holding company requirements, given there are no cure 
periods for the requirements, and the new “anti-evasion” 
provision that authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to exclude 
from a bank holding company’s outstanding external LTD any 
debt having certain features that would, in the Board’s view, 
“significantly impair” the debt’s ability to absorb losses; (ii) 
the Volcker Rule, which requires Citi to maintain an extensive 
global compliance regime, including significant 
documentation to support the prohibition against proprietary 
trading; and (iii) a proliferation of laws relating to the 
limitation of cross-border data movement, including data 
localization and protection and privacy laws, which can 
conflict with or increase compliance complexity with respect 
to anti-money laundering laws.

Extensive compliance requirements can result in 

increased reputational and legal risks, as failure to comply 
with regulations and requirements, or failure to comply as 
expected, can result in enforcement and/or regulatory 
proceedings (for additional discussion, see the legal and 
regulatory proceedings risk factor below). In addition, 
increased and ongoing compliance requirements and 
uncertainties have resulted in higher costs for Citi. For 
example, Citi employed roughly 30,000 risk, regulatory and 
compliance staff as of year-end 2017, out of a total employee 
population of 209,000, compared to approximately 14,000 as 
of year-end 2008 with a total employee population of 323,000. 

These higher regulatory and compliance costs can impede 
Citi’s ongoing, business-as-usual cost reduction efforts, and 
can also require management to reallocate resources, including 
potentially away from ongoing business investment initiatives, 
as discussed above.

Citi Is Subject to Extensive Legal and Regulatory 
Proceedings, Investigations and Inquiries That Could Result 
in Significant Penalties and Other Negative Impacts on Citi, 
Its Businesses and Results of Operations.
At any given time, Citi is defending a significant number of 
legal and regulatory proceedings and is subject to numerous 
governmental and regulatory examinations, investigations and 
other inquiries. Over the last several years, the frequency with 
which such proceedings, investigations and inquiries are 
initiated have increased substantially, and the global judicial, 
regulatory and political environment has generally been 
unfavorable for large financial institutions. The complexity of 
the federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes in 
the U.S., coupled with the global scope of Citi’s operations, 
also means that a single event or issue may give rise to a large 
number of overlapping investigations and regulatory 
proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies in 
the U.S. or by multiple regulators and other governmental 
entities in different jurisdictions.

Moreover, U.S. and non-U.S. regulators have been 

increasingly focused on “conduct risk,” a term used to 
describe the risks associated with behavior by employees and 
agents, including third-party vendors utilized by Citi, that 
could harm clients, customers, investors or the markets, such 
as improperly creating, selling, marketing or managing 
products and services or improper incentive compensation 
programs with respect thereto, failures to safeguard a party’s 
personal information, or failures to identify and manage 
conflicts of interest. In addition to increasing Citi’s 
compliance and reputational risks, this focus on conduct risk 
could lead to more regulatory or other enforcement 
proceedings and civil litigation, including for practices which 
historically were acceptable but are now receiving greater 
scrutiny. Further, while Citi takes numerous steps to prevent 
and detect conduct by employees and agents that could 
potentially harm clients, customers, investors or the markets, 
such behavior may not always be deterred or prevented. 
Banking regulators have also focused on the overall culture of 
financial services firms, including Citi. In addition to 
regulatory restrictions or structural changes that could result 
from perceived deficiencies in Citi’s culture, such focus could 
also lead to additional regulatory proceedings.

Further, the severity of the remedies sought in legal and 
regulatory proceedings to which Citi is subject has increased 
substantially in recent years. U.S. and certain international 
governmental entities have increasingly brought criminal 
actions against, or have sought criminal convictions from, 
financial institutions, and criminal prosecutors in the U.S. 
have increasingly sought and obtained criminal guilty pleas or 
deferred prosecution agreements against corporate entities and 
other criminal sanctions from those institutions. For example, 
in 2015, an affiliate of Citi pleaded guilty to an antitrust 
violation and paid a substantial fine to resolve a U.S. 

63

Department of Justice investigation into Citi’s foreign 
exchange business practices. These types of actions by U.S. 
and international governmental entities may, in the future, 
have significant collateral consequences for a financial 
institution, including loss of customers and business, and the 
inability to offer certain products or services and/or operate 
certain businesses. Citi may be required to accept or be subject 
to similar types of criminal remedies, consent orders, 
sanctions, substantial fines and penalties, remediation and 
other financial costs or other requirements in the future, 
including for matters or practices not yet known to Citi, any of 
which could materially and negatively affect Citi’s businesses, 
business practices, financial condition or results of operations, 
require material changes in Citi’s operations or cause Citi 
reputational harm.

 Further, many large claims—both private civil and 

regulatory—asserted against Citi are highly complex, slow to 
develop and may involve novel or untested legal theories. The 
outcome of such proceedings is difficult to predict or estimate 
until late in the proceedings. Although Citi establishes accruals 
for its legal and regulatory matters according to accounting 
requirements, Citi’s estimates of, and changes to, these 
accruals involve significant judgment and may be subject to 
significant uncertainty, and the amount of loss ultimately 
incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially 
higher than the amounts accrued. In addition, certain 
settlements are subject to court approval and may not be 
approved.

For additional information relating to Citi’s legal and 

regulatory proceedings and matters, including Citi’s policies 
on establishing legal accruals, see Note 27 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

MANAGING GLOBAL RISK

Overview
For Citi, effective risk management is of primary importance 
to its overall operations. Accordingly, Citi’s risk management 
process has been designed to monitor, evaluate and manage 
the principal risks it assumes in conducting its activities. 
Specifically, the activities that Citi engages in, and the risks 
those activities generate, must be consistent with Citi’s 
mission and value proposition, the key principles that guide it, 
and Citi's risk appetite.

Risk management must be built on a foundation of ethical 

culture. Under Citi’s mission and value proposition, which 
was developed by Citi’s senior leadership and distributed 
throughout the Company, Citi strives to serve its clients as a 
trusted partner by responsibly providing financial services that 
enable growth and economic progress while earning and 
maintaining the public’s trust by constantly adhering to the 
highest ethical standards. As such, Citi asks all employees to 
ensure that their decisions pass three tests: they are in our 
clients’ interests, create economic value and are always 
systemically responsible. Additionally, Citi evaluates 
employees’ performance against behavioral expectations set 
out in Citi’s leadership standards, which were designed in part 
to effectuate Citi’s mission and value proposition. Other 
culture-related efforts in connection with conduct risk, ethics 
and leadership, escalation, and treating customers fairly help 
Citi to execute its mission and value proposition.

Citi’s Company-wide risk governance framework consists 

of the policies, procedures, and processes through which Citi 
identifies, measures, manages, monitors, reports and controls 
risks across the Company. It also emphasizes Citi’s risk 
culture and lays out standards, procedures and programs that 
are designed and undertaken to enhance the Company’s risk 
culture, embed this culture deeply within the organization, and 
give employees tools to make sound and ethical risk decisions 
and to escalate issues appropriately. The risk governance 
framework has been developed in alignment with the 
expectations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
(OCC) Heightened Standards. It is also aligned with the 
relevant components of the Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision’s corporate governance principles for banks and 
relevant components of the Federal Reserve’s Enhanced 
Prudential Standards for Bank Holding Companies and 
Foreign Banking Organizations.

Four key principles—common purpose, responsible 

finance, ingenuity and leadership—guide Citi as it performs its 
mission. Citi’s risk appetite, which is approved by the 
Citigroup Board of Directors, specifies the aggregate levels 
and types of risk the Board and management are willing to 
assume to achieve Citi’s strategic objectives and business plan, 
consistent with applicable capital, liquidity and other 
regulatory requirements.

Citi selectively takes risks in support of its underlying 

business strategy, while striving to ensure it operates within its 
mission and value proposition and risk appetite.

Citi’s risks are generally categorized and summarized as 

follows:

• 

•  Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the decline in 
credit quality or failure of a borrower, counterparty, third 
party or issuer to honor its financial or contractual 
obligations.
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able 
to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected current 
and future cash flow and collateral needs without 
adversely affecting either daily operations or financial 
condition of the Company. The risk may be exacerbated 
by the inability of the Company to access funding sources 
or monetize assets and the composition of liability 
funding and liquid assets.

•  Market risk is the risk of loss arising from changes in the 
value of Citi’s assets and liabilities resulting from changes 
in market variables, such as interest rates, exchange rates 
or credit spreads. Losses can be exacerbated by the 
presence of basis or correlation risks.

•  Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from 

inadequate or failed internal processes, systems, human 
factors, or from external events. It includes risk of failing 
to comply with applicable laws and regulations, but 
excludes strategic risk (see below). It also includes the 
reputation and franchise risk associated with business 
practices or market conduct in which Citi is involved as 
well as compliance, conduct and legal risks. Operational 
risk is inherent in Citi’s global business activities, as well 
as related support, and can result in losses arising from 
events related to fraud, theft and unauthorized activity; 
employment practices and workplace environment; 
clients, products and business practices; physical assets 
and infrastructure; and execution, delivery and process 
management. 

•  Compliance risk is the risk arising from violations of, or 

non-conformance with, local, national or cross-border 
laws, rules or regulations, Citi’s internal policies or other 
relevant standards of conduct or risk of harming 
customers, clients or the integrity of the market.

•  Conduct risk is the risk that Citi’s employees or agents 

may (intentionally or through negligence) harm 
customers, clients or the integrity of the markets, and 
thereby the integrity of Citi.
Legal risk includes the risk from uncertainty due to legal 
or regulatory actions, proceedings or investigations, or 
uncertainty in the applicability or interpretation of 
contracts, laws or regulations.

• 

•  Reputational risk is the risk to current or anticipated 

earnings, capital, or franchise or enterprise value arising 
from negative public opinion.
Strategic risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, 
capital, or franchise or enterprise value arising from poor, 
but authorized business decisions, an inability to adapt to 
changes in the operating environment or other external 
factors that may impair the ability to carry out a business 
strategy. Strategic risk also includes:
•  Country risk which is the risk that an event in a 
country (precipitated by developments within or 
external to a country) will impair the value of Citi’s 
franchise or will adversely affect the ability of 
obligors within that country to honor their 

• 

66

obligations. Country risk events may include 
sovereign defaults, banking crises, currency crises, 
currency convertibility and/or transferability 
restrictions, or political events.

Citi manages its risks through each of its three lines of 
defense: (i) business management, (ii) independent control 
functions and (iii) internal audit. The three lines of defense 
collaborate with each other in structured forums and processes 
to bring various perspectives together and to lead the 
organization toward outcomes that are in clients’ interests, 
create economic value and are systemically responsible.

First Line of Defense: Business Management
Each of Citi’s businesses owns its risks and is responsible for 
assessing and managing its risks. Each business is also 
responsible for establishing and operating controls to mitigate 
key risks, assessing internal controls and promoting a culture 
of compliance and control. In doing so, a business is required 
to maintain appropriate staffing and implement appropriate 
procedures to fulfill its risk governance responsibilities.
The CEOs of each region and business report to the 

Citigroup CEO. The Head of Operations and Technology and 
the Head of Productivity, who are considered part of the first 
line of defense, also report to the Citigroup CEO.

Businesses at Citi organize and chair committees and 

councils that cover risk considerations with participation from 
independent control functions, including committees or 
councils that are designed to consider matters related to 
capital, assets and liabilities, business practices, business risks 
and controls, mergers and acquisitions, the Community 
Reinvestment Act and fair lending and incentives.

Second Line of Defense: Independent Control Functions
Citi’s independent control functions, including Risk, 
Independent Compliance Risk Management, Human 
Resources, Legal, Finance and Finance & Risk Infrastructure, 
set standards by which Citi and its businesses manage and 
oversee risks, including compliance with applicable laws, 
regulatory requirements, policies and other relevant standards 
of conduct. Additionally, among other responsibilities, the 
independent control functions provide advice and training to 
Citi’s businesses and establish tools, methodologies, processes 
and oversight for controls used by the businesses to foster a 
culture of compliance and control.

Risk
The Risk organization is designed to act as an independent 
partner of the business to manage market, credit and 
operational risk in a manner consistent with Citi’s risk 
appetite. Risk establishes policies and guidelines for risk 
assessments and risk management and contributes to controls 
and tools to manage, measure and mitigate risks taken by the 
Company.

The Chief Risk Officer reports to the Citigroup CEO and 

the Risk Management Committee of the Citigroup Board of 
Directors. The Chief Risk Officer has regular and unrestricted 
access to the Risk Management Committee of the Board and 

also to the Citigroup Board of Directors to address risks and 
issues identified through Risk’s activities.

Independent Compliance Risk Management
The Independent Compliance Risk Management (ICRM) 
organization is designed to protect Citi by overseeing senior 
management, the businesses, and other control functions in 
managing compliance risk, as well as promoting business 
conduct and activity that is consistent with Citi’s mission and 
value proposition. Citi’s objective is to embed an enterprise-
wide compliance risk management framework and culture that 
identifies, measures, monitors, mitigates and controls 
compliance risk across the three lines of defense. For further 
information on Citi’s compliance risk framework, see 
“Compliance Risk” below.

The Chief Compliance Officer reports to the Citigroup 

CEO and has regular and unrestricted access to the committees 
of the Citigroup Board of Directors, including the Audit 
Committee and the Ethics and Culture Committee.

Human Resources
The Human Resources organization provides personnel 
support and governance in connection with, among other 
things: recognizing and rewarding employees who 
demonstrate Citi’s values and excel in their roles and 
responsibilities; setting ethical- and performance-related 
expectations and developing and promoting employees who 
meet those expectations; and searching for, assessing and 
hiring staff who exemplify Citi’s leadership standards, which 
outline Citi’s expectations of its employees’ behavior.

The Head of Human Resources reports to the Citigroup 

CEO and interacts regularly with the Personnel and 
Compensation Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors.

Legal
The Legal organization is involved in a number of activities 
designed to promote the appropriate management of Citi’s 
exposure to legal risk, which includes the risk of loss, whether 
financial or reputational, due to legal or regulatory actions, 
proceedings or investigations, or uncertainty in the 
applicability or interpretation of contracts, laws or regulations.  
Activities designed to promote appropriate management of 
legal risk include, among others: promoting and supporting 
Citigroup’s governance processes; advising business 
management, other independent control functions, the 
Citigroup Board of Directors and committees of the Board 
regarding analysis of laws and regulations, regulatory matters, 
disclosure matters, and potential risks and exposures on key 
litigation and transactional matters, among other things; 
advising other independent control functions in their efforts to 
ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations as 
well as internal standards of conduct; serving on key 
management committees; reporting and escalating key legal 
issues to senior management or other independent control 
functions; participating in internal investigations and 
overseeing regulatory investigations; and advising businesses 
on a day-to-day basis on legal, regulatory and contractual 
matters.

67

The General Counsel reports to the Citigroup CEO and is 
responsible to the full Citigroup Board. In addition to having 
regular and unrestricted access to the full Citigroup Board of 
Directors, the General Counsel or his/her delegates regularly 
attend meetings of the Risk Management Committee, Audit 
Committee, Personnel and Compensation Committee, Ethics 
and Culture Committee, Operations and Technology 
Committee, and Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs 
Committee, as well as other ad hoc committees of the 
Citigroup Board of Directors.

Finance
The Finance organization is primarily composed of the 
following disciplines: treasury, controllers, tax and financial 
planning and analysis. These disciplines partner with the 
businesses, providing key data and consultation to facilitate 
sound decisions in support of the businesses’ objectives. 
Through these activities, Finance serves as an independent 
control function advising business management, escalating 
identified risks and establishing policies or processes to 
manage risk.

Through the treasury discipline, Finance has overall 

responsibility for managing Citi’s balance sheet and 
accordingly partners with the businesses to manage Citi’s 
liquidity and interest rate risk (price risk for non-trading 
portfolios). Treasury works with the businesses to establish 
balance sheet targets and limits, as well as sets policies on 
funding costs charged for business assets based on their 
liquidity and duration.

Principally through the controllers discipline, Finance is 
responsible for establishing a strong control environment over 
Citi’s financial reporting processes consistent with the 2013 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission, or COSO, Internal Control-Integrated 
Framework.

Finance is led by Citi’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO), 

who reports directly to the Citigroup CEO. The CFO chairs or 
co-chairs several management committees that serve as key 
governance and oversight forums for business activities. In 
addition, the CFO has regular and unrestricted access to the 
full Citigroup Board of Directors as well as to the Audit 
Committee of the Board of Directors.

Finance & Risk Infrastructure
Finance & Risk Infrastructure (FRI) is a Citi global function 
that was formed in April 2016 from groups within the Finance 
and Risk global functions. FRI was established to globally 
implement common data and data standards, common 
processes and integrated technology platforms as well as 
integrate infrastructure activities across both Finance and 
Risk. FRI works to drive straight through data processing and 
produce more effective and efficient processes and governance 
aimed at supporting both the Finance and Risk organizations.
      The head of the FRI global function reports jointly to 
Citi’s CFO and Chief Risk Officer.

Third Line of Defense: Internal Audit
Citi’s Internal Audit function independently reviews activities 
of the first two lines of defense based on a risk-based audit 
plan and methodology approved by the Audit Committee of 
the Citigroup Board of Directors. Internal Audit also provides 
independent assurance to the Citigroup Board of Directors, the 
Audit Committee of the Board, senior management and 
regulators regarding the effectiveness of Citi’s governance and 
controls designed to mitigate Citi’s exposure to risks and to 
enhance Citi’s culture of compliance and control.

The Chief Auditor reports functionally to the Chairman of 

the Citigroup Audit Committee and administratively to the 
CEO of Citigroup. Internal Audit’s responsibilities are carried 
out independently under the oversight of the Audit Committee. 
Internal Audit’s employees accordingly report to the Chief 
Auditor and do not have reporting lines to front-line units or 
senior management. Internal Audit’s staff members are not 
permitted to provide internal-audit services for a business line 
or function in which they had business line or function 
responsibilities within the previous 12 months.

68

Three Lines of Defense

Citigroup Board of Directors and Committees of the Board
Citigroup’s Board of Directors oversees Citi’s risk-taking 
activities and holds management accountable for adhering to 
the risk governance framework. To do so, directors review 
reports prepared by the businesses, Risk, Independent 
Compliance Risk Management, Internal Audit and others, and 
exercise sound independent judgment to question, probe and 
challenge recommendations and decisions made by 
management.

The standing committees of the Citigroup Board of 

Directors are the Executive Committee, Risk Management 
Committee, Audit Committee, Personnel and Compensation 
Committee, Ethics and Culture Committee, Operations and 
Technology Committee and Nomination, Governance and 
Public Affairs Committee. In addition to the standing 
committees, the Board creates ad hoc committees from time to 
time in response to regulatory, legal or other requirements.

CREDIT RISK

Overview
Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the decline in 
credit quality or the failure of a borrower, counterparty, third 
party or issuer to honor its financial or contractual obligations. 
Credit risk arises in many of Citigroup’s business activities, 
including:
• 
• 
• 
• 

consumer, commercial and corporate lending; 
capital markets derivative transactions; 
structured finance; and 
securities financing transactions (repurchase and reverse 
repurchase agreements, securities loaned and borrowed).

Credit risk also arises from settlement and clearing 

activities, when Citi transfers an asset in advance of receiving 
its counter-value or advances funds to settle a transaction on 
behalf of a client. Concentration risk, within credit risk, is the 
risk associated with having credit exposure concentrated 
within a specific client, industry, region or other category.

Credit risk is one of the most significant risks Citi faces as 

an institution. As a result, Citi has a well-established 
framework in place for managing credit risk across all 
businesses. This includes a defined risk appetite, credit limits 
and credit policies, both at the business level as well as at the 
company-wide level. Citi’s credit risk management also 
includes processes and policies with respect to problem 
recognition, including “watch lists,” portfolio reviews, stress 
tests, updated risk ratings and classification triggers. 

With respect to Citi’s settlement and clearing activities, 
intra-day client usage of lines is monitored against limits, as 
well as against usage patterns. To the extent a problem 
develops, Citi typically moves the client to a secured 
(collateralized) operating model. Generally, Citi’s intra-day 
settlement and clearing lines are uncommitted and cancelable 
at any time.

To manage concentration of risk within credit risk, Citi 
has in place a correlation framework consisting of industry 
limits, an idiosyncratic framework consisting of single name 
concentrations for each business and across Citigroup and a 
specialized framework consisting of product limits.

Credit exposures are generally reported in notional terms 

for accrual loans, reflecting the value at which the loans as 
well as loan and other off-balance sheet commitments are 
carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Credit exposure 
arising from capital markets activities is generally expressed 
as the current mark-to-market, net of margin, reflecting the net 
value owed to Citi by a given counterparty. 

The credit risk associated with these credit exposures is a 
function of the idiosyncratic creditworthiness of the obligor, as 
well as the terms and conditions of the specific obligation. Citi 
assesses the credit risk associated with its credit exposures on 
a regular basis through its loan loss reserve process (see 
“Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—
Allowance for Credit Losses” below and Notes 1 and 15 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements), as well as through regular 
stress testing at the company, business, geography and product 
levels. These stress-testing processes typically estimate 

potential incremental credit costs that would occur as a result 
of either downgrades in the credit quality or defaults of the 
obligors or counterparties.

There is an independent Chief Risk Officer for each of 

Citi’s consumer, commercial and corporate lending businesses 
within ICG and GCB (Business CROs). Each of these 
Business CROs reports directly to Citi’s Chief Risk Officer. 
The Business CROs are the focal point for most day-to-day 
risk decisions, such as setting risk limits and approving 
transactions within the businesses. In addition there are 
Regional and Legal Entity Chief Risk Officers. There is an 
independent Chief Risk Officer for Asia, EMEA and Latin 
America, including Mexico (Regional CROs). Each of these 
Regional CROs reports directly to Citi’s Chief Risk Officer. 
The Regional CROs are accountable for overseeing the 
management of all risks in their geographic areas and across 
businesses, and are the primary risk contacts for the Regional 
Chief Executive Officers and local regulators. Legal Entity 
Chief Risk Officers are responsible for identifying and 
managing risks in Citibank as well as other specific legal 
entities, with Citibank’s Chief Risk Officer reporting directly 
to Citi’s Chief Risk Officer.

For additional information on Citi’s credit risk 

management, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.

Consumer Credit
Citi provides traditional retail banking, including commercial 
banking, and credit card products in 19 countries and 
jurisdictions through North America GCB, Latin America 
GCB and Asia GCB. The retail banking products include 
consumer mortgages, home equity, personal and commercial 
loans and lines of credit and similar related products with a 
focus on lending to prime customers. Citi uses its risk appetite 
framework to define its lending parameters. In addition, Citi 
uses proprietary scoring models for new customer approvals. 
As stated in “Global Consumer Banking” above, GCB’s 
overall strategy is to leverage Citi’s global footprint and be the 
pre-eminent bank for the affluent and emerging affluent 
consumers in large urban centers. In credit cards and in certain 
retail markets, Citi serves customers in a somewhat broader 
set of segments and geographies. GCB’s commercial banking 
business focuses on small to mid-sized businesses.

Overall Consumer Credit Trends
The following charts show the quarterly trends in 
delinquencies and net credit losses across both retail banking, 
including commercial banking, and cards for total GCB and by 
region. 

Global Consumer Banking

Latin America

Latin America GCB operates in Mexico through 

Citibanamex, one of Mexico’s largest banks, and provides 
credit cards, consumer mortgages, personal loans and 
commercial banking products. Latin America GCB serves a 
more mass market segment in Mexico and focuses on 
developing multi-product relationships with customers.
As set forth in the chart above, 90+ days past due

delinquency rates improved year-over-year and quarter-over-
quarter, largely driven by the commercial portfolio.  The 
improvement year-over-year was partially offset by a higher 
delinquency rate in cards due to the seasoning of the 
portfolio. The net credit loss rate increased in Latin America 
GCB year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter as of the fourth 
quarter of 2017, primarily due to an episodic charge-off in the 
commercial portfolio as well as seasoning in the cards 
portfolio.

Asia(1)

(1)  Asia includes GCB activities in certain EMEA countries for all 

periods presented.

Asia GCB operates in 17 countries in Asia and EMEA 

and provides credit cards, consumer mortgages, personal loans 
and commercial banking products. As shown in the chart 
above, 90+ days past due delinquency and net credit loss rates 
were largely stable in Asia GCB year-over-year and quarter-
over-quarter as of the fourth quarter of 2017. This stability 
reflects the strong credit profiles in Asia GCB’s target 
customer segments. In addition, regulatory changes in many 
markets in Asia over the past few years have resulted in stable 
or improved portfolio credit quality, despite weaker 
macroeconomic conditions in several countries.

For additional information on cost of credit, loan 

delinquency and other information for Citi’s consumer loan 
portfolios, see each respective business’s results of operations 
above and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

North America

North America GCB provides mortgages, home equity 

loans, personal loans and commercial banking products 
through Citi’s retail banking network and card products 
through Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services businesses. 
The retail bank is concentrated in six major metropolitan cities 
in the United States (for additional information on the U.S. 
retail bank, see “North America GCB” above).

As of December 31, 2017, approximately 71% of North 
America GCB consumer loans consisted of Citi-branded and 
Citi retail services cards, which generally drives the overall 
credit performance of North America GCB, including the 
credit performance year-over-year as of the fourth quarter of 
2017 (for additional information on North America GCB’s 
cards portfolios, including delinquency and net credit loss 
rates, see “Credit Card Trends” below). 

Quarter-over-quarter, 90+ days past due delinquency 

rates increased, primarily due to seasonality in the cards 
portfolios and the hurricane-related impact to the mortgage 
portfolio. The net credit loss rate decreased quarter-over-
quarter, primarily reflecting the absence of an episodic charge-
off in the commercial portfolio that occurred in the third 
quarter of 2017. The net credit loss rate increased year-over-
year primarily due to seasoning in both cards portfolios. 

72

Credit Card Trends 
The following charts show the quarterly trends in 
delinquencies and net credit losses for total GCB cards, Citi’s 
North America Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services 
portfolios as well as for Citi’s Latin America and Asia Citi-
branded cards portfolios.

Total Cards

North America Citi Retail Services

North America Citi-Branded Cards

North America GCB’s Citi-branded cards portfolio issues 

proprietary and co-branded cards. As shown in the chart 
above, the 90+ days past due delinquency rate in Citi-branded 
cards was stable year-over-year and seasonally higher quarter-
over-quarter. The net credit loss rate increased year-over-year 
primarily due to seasoning, and decreased quarter-over-quarter 
primarily due to seasonality as well as higher asset sales.

Citi retail services partners directly with more than 20 
retailers and dealers to offer private-label and co-branded 
consumer and commercial cards. Citi retail services’ target 
market is focused on select industry segments such as home 
improvement, specialty retail, consumer electronics and fuel. 
Citi retail services continually evaluates opportunities to add 
partners within target industries that have strong loyalty, 
lending or payment programs and growth potential. 

Citi retail services’ delinquency and net credit loss rates 

increased year-over-year, primarily due to seasoning as well as 
softness in the collections rates experienced once an account 
reaches mid-stage delinquency. The quarter-over-quarter 
increase in both loss and delinquency rates is also due to the 
seasonal movements observed in Citi retail services. 

Latin America Citi-Branded Cards

Latin America GCB issues proprietary and co-branded 
cards. As set forth in the chart above, the net credit loss and 
delinquency rates increased year-over-year due to seasoning. 
The decrease quarter-over-quarter of the net credit loss and 
delinquency rates was primarily driven by higher payment 
rates reflecting the payment of year-end bonuses.

Home Equity Loans—Revolving HELOCs
As set forth in the table above, Citi had $14.8 billion of home 
equity loans as of December 31, 2017, of which $3.4 billion 
are fixed-rate home equity loans and $11.4 billion are 
extended under home equity lines of credit (Revolving 
HELOCs). Fixed-rate home equity loans are fully amortizing. 
Revolving HELOCs allow for amounts to be drawn for a 
period of time with the payment of interest only and then, at 
the end of the draw period, the outstanding amount is 
converted to an amortizing loan, or “reset” (the interest-only 
payment feature during the revolving period is standard for 
this product across the industry). Upon reset, these borrowers 
will be required to pay both interest, usually at a variable rate, 
and principal that amortizes typically over 20 years, rather 
than the standard 30-year amortization.
 
Of the Revolving HELOCs at December 31, 2017, $6.8 
billion had reset (compared to $6.2 billion at December 31, 
2016) and $4.6 billion were still within their revolving period 
and had not reset (compared to $7.8 billion at December 31, 
2016). The following chart indicates the FICO and combined 
loan-to-value (CLTV) characteristics of Citi’s Revolving 
HELOCs portfolio and the year in which they reset:

75

Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding.

Approximately 59% of Citi’s total Revolving HELOCs 

portfolio had reset as of December 31, 2017 (compared to 
44% as of December 31, 2016). Of the remaining Revolving 
HELOCs portfolio, approximately 29% will reset during 2018. 
Citi’s customers with Revolving HELOCs that reset could 

experience “payment shock” due to the higher required 
payments on the loans. Citi currently estimates that the 
monthly loan payment for its Revolving HELOCs that reset 
during 2018 could increase on average by approximately 
$308, or 118%. Increases in interest rates could further 
increase these payments given the variable nature of the 
interest rates on these loans post-reset. Of the Revolving 
HELOCs that will reset during 2018, approximately $10 
million, or 1%, of the loans have a CLTV greater than 100% 
as of December 31, 2017. Borrowers’ high loan-to-value 
positions, as well as the cost and availability of refinancing 
options, could limit borrowers’ ability to refinance their 
Revolving HELOCs as these loans reset.

Approximately 5.9% of the Revolving HELOCs that have 

reset as of December 31, 2017 were 30+ days past due, 
compared to 3.9% of the total outstanding home equity loan 
portfolio (amortizing and non-amortizing). This compared to 
6.7% and 3.9%, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. As 
newly amortizing loans continue to season, the delinquency 
rate of Citi’s total home equity loan portfolio could increase. 
In addition, resets to date have generally occurred during a 
period of historically low interest rates, which Citi believes 
has likely reduced the overall “payment shock” to the 
borrower. 

Citi monitors this reset risk closely and will continue to 

consider any potential impact in determining its allowance for 
loan loss reserves. In addition, management continues to 
review and take additional actions to offset potential reset risk, 
such as a borrower outreach program to provide reset risk 
education and proactively working with high-risk borrowers 
through a specialized single point of contact unit.

(1)  End-of-period (EOP) loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2)  The ratios of 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due are calculated based on EOP loans, net of unearned income.
(3)  The 90+ days past due balances for North America—Citi-branded and North America—Citi retail services are generally still accruing interest. Citigroup’s policy 

is generally to accrue interest on credit card loans until 180 days past due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been received earlier.

(4)  The 90+ days and 30–89 days past due and related ratios for GCB North America retail banking exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are guaranteed by U.S. 

government-sponsored entities since the potential loss predominantly resides within the U.S. government-sponsored entities. The amounts excluded for loans 90+ 
days past due and (EOP loans) were $298 million ($0.7 billion), $327 million ($0.7 billion) and $491 million ($1.1 billion) at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 
respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (EOP loans have the same adjustment as above) were $88 million, $70 million and $87 million 
at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

(5)  Asia includes delinquencies and loans in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.
(6)  The 90+ days and 30–89 days past due and related ratios for Corporate/Other—Consumer North America exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are guaranteed by 

U.S. government-sponsored entities since the potential loss predominantly resides within the U.S. government-sponsored entities. The amounts excluded for loans 
90+ days past due (and EOP loans) were $0.6 billion ($1.1 billion), $0.9 billion ($1.4 billion) and $1.5 billion ($2.2 billion) at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 
respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (EOP loans have the same adjustment as above) for each period were $0.1 billion, $0.2 billion 
and $0.2 billion at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

(7)  The December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, loans 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios for North America exclude $4 million, $7 million and 

$11 million, respectively, of loans that are carried at fair value.

(2)  The ratios of net credit losses are calculated based on average loans, net of unearned income.
(3)  As a result of Citigroup's entry into agreements in October 2016 to sell its Argentina and Brazil consumer banking businesses, these businesses were classified as 
HFS at the end of the fourth quarter 2016. Loans HFS are excluded from this table as they are recorded in Other assets. In addition, as a result of HFS accounting 
treatment, approximately $128 million and $42 million of net credit losses (NCLs) were recorded as a reduction in revenue (Other revenue) during 2017 and 2016, 
respectively. Accordingly, these NCLs are not included in this table. The sales of the Argentina and Brazil consumer banking businesses were completed in the 
first and fourth quarters of 2017, respectively. 

(4)  As a result of the entry into an agreement to sell OneMain Financial (OneMain), OneMain was classified as HFS beginning March 31, 2015. Loans HFS are 
excluded from this table as they are recorded in Other assets. In addition, as a result of HFS accounting treatment, approximately $350 million of NCLs were 
recorded as a reduction in revenue (Other revenue) during 2015. Accordingly, these NCLs are not included in this table. The OneMain sale was completed on 
November 15, 2015. 

(5)  Asia includes average loans and NCLs in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.
(6)  2017 NCLs represent a recovery related to legacy assets.

Corporate Credit 
Consistent with its overall strategy, Citi’s corporate clients are 
typically large, multinational corporations that value Citi’s 
global network. Citi aims to establish relationships with these 
clients that encompass multiple products, consistent with 
client needs, including cash management and trade services, 
foreign exchange, lending, capital markets and M&A advisory.

The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings 

across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison 
of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographic 
regions and products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an 
estimated probability of default for a counterparty and are 
derived primarily through the use of validated statistical 
models, scorecard models and external agency ratings (under 
defined circumstances), in combination with consideration of 
factors specific to the obligor or market, such as management 
experience, competitive position, regulatory environment and 
commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect 
the probability of default of the obligor and factors that affect 
the loss-given-default of the facility, such as support or 
collateral. Internal obligor ratings that generally correspond to 
BBB and above are considered investment grade, while those 
below are considered non-investment grade.

79

Citigroup also has incorporated climate risk assessment 

and reporting criteria for certain obligors, as necessary. 
Factors evaluated include consideration of climate risk to an 
obligor’s business and physical assets and, when relevant, 
consideration of cost-effective options to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions.

by facility risk rating as a percentage of the total corporate

Credit Risk Mitigation
As part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup 
uses credit derivatives and other risk mitigants to hedge 
portions of the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio, in 
addition to outright asset sales. The results of the mark-to-
market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives 
are reflected primarily in Other revenue on the Consolidated 
Statement of Income.

As of December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and 

December 31, 2016, $16.3 billion, $22.2 billion and 
$29.5 billion, respectively, of the corporate credit portfolio 
was economically hedged. Citigroup’s expected loss model 
used in the calculation of its loan loss reserve does not include 
the favorable impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants 
that are marked-to-market. In addition, the reported amounts 
of direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in 
the tables above do not reflect the impact of these hedging 
transactions. The credit protection was economically hedging 
underlying corporate credit portfolio exposures with the 
following risk rating distribution:

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets and Renegotiated Loans
There is a certain amount of overlap among non-accrual loans 
and assets and renegotiated loans. The following summary 
provides a general description of each category:

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets:
•  Corporate and consumer (including commercial banking) 

non-accrual status is based on the determination that 
payment of interest or principal is doubtful.

•  A corporate loan may be classified as non-accrual and still 

be performing under the terms of the loan structure. 
Payments received on corporate non-accrual loans are 
generally applied to loan principal and not reflected as 
interest income. Approximately 74%, 69% and 64% of 
Citi’s corporate non-accrual loans were performing at 
December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 
31, 2016, respectively.

•  Consumer non-accrual status is generally based on aging, 

i.e., the borrower has fallen behind on payments.

•  Consumer mortgage loans, other than Federal Housing 
Administration (FHA) insured loans, are classified as 
non-accrual within 60 days of notification that the 
borrower has filed for bankruptcy. In addition, home 
equity loans are classified as non-accrual if the related 
residential first mortgage loan is 90 days or more past 
due.

•  North America Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services 
are not included because, under industry standards, credit 
card loans accrue interest until such loans are charged off, 
which typically occurs at 180 days of contractual 
delinquency.

Renegotiated Loans:
• 

Includes both corporate and consumer loans whose terms 
have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring 
(TDR).
Includes both accrual and non-accrual TDRs.

• 

86

Non-Accrual Loans
The table below summarizes Citigroup’s non-accrual loans as 
of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be 
current on interest payments. In situations where Citi 
reasonably expects that only a portion of the principal owed 

will ultimately be collected, all payments received are 
reflected as a reduction of principal and not as interest income. 
For all other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are 
generally recorded as revenue.

million at December 31, 2016, $250 million at December 31, 2015, $421 million at December 31, 2014 and $703 million at December 31, 2013.

(2)  The increase in corporate non-accrual loans from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 was primarily related to Citi’s North America and EMEA energy and 

energy-related corporate credit exposure during 2016.

(3)    2015 decline includes the impact related to the transfer of approximately $8 billion of mortgage loans to Loans HFS (included within Other assets).

In addition to modifications reflected as TDRs at December 31, 2017 
and December 31, 2016, Citi also modified $51 million and $257 
million, respectively, and $95 million and $217 million, respectively, of 
commercial loans risk rated “Substandard Non-Performing” or worse 
(asset category defined by banking regulators) in offices inside and 
outside the U.S. These modifications were not considered TDRs because 
the modifications did not involve a concession (a required element of a 
TDR for accounting purposes).

times of stress. The liquidity risk management framework 
provides that in addition to the aggregate requirements, certain 
entities be self-sufficient or net providers of liquidity, 
including in conditions established under their designated 
stress tests.

Citi’s primary sources of funding include (i) deposits via 

Citi’s bank subsidiaries, which are Citi’s most stable and 
lowest cost source of long-term funding, (ii) long-term debt 
(primarily senior and subordinated debt) primarily issued at 
the parent and certain bank subsidiaries, and (iii) stockholders’ 
equity. These sources may be supplemented by short-term 
borrowings, primarily in the form of secured funding 
transactions.

As referenced above, Citi works to ensure that the tenor 
of these funding sources is sufficiently long in relation to the 
tenor of its asset base. The goal of Citi’s asset/liability 
management is to ensure that there is excess liquidity and 
tenor in the liability structure relative to the liquidity profile of 
the assets. This reduces the risk that liabilities will become due 
before asset maturities or monetizations through sale. This 
excess liquidity is held primarily in the form of high-quality 
liquid assets (HQLA), as set forth in the table below. 

Citi’s Treasurer has overall responsibility for management 

of Citi’s HQLA. Citi’s liquidity is managed via a centralized 
treasury model by Corporate Treasury, in conjunction with 
regional and in-country treasurers. Pursuant to this approach, 
Citi’s HQLA is managed with emphasis on asset-liability 
management and entity-level liquidity adequacy throughout 
Citi.

Citi’s Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the overall 

liquidity risk profile of Citi. The Chief Risk Officer and Citi’s 
CFO co-chair Citi’s Asset Liability Management Committee 
(ALCO), which includes Citi’s Treasurer and other senior 
executives. ALCO sets the strategy of the liquidity portfolio 
and monitors its performance. Significant changes to portfolio 
asset allocations need to be approved by ALCO.

LIQUIDITY RISK
Overview
Adequate and diverse sources of funding and liquidity are 
essential to Citi’s businesses.  Funding and liquidity risks arise 
from several factors, many of which are mostly or entirely 
outside Citi’s control, such as disruptions in the financial 
markets, changes in key funding sources, credit spreads, 
changes in Citi’s credit ratings and geopolitical and 
macroeconomic conditions. For additional information, see 
“Risk Factors” above.

Citi’s funding and liquidity objectives are aimed at (i) 

funding its existing asset base, (ii) growing its core businesses, 
(iii) maintaining sufficient liquidity, structured appropriately, 
so that Citi can operate under a variety of adverse 
circumstances, including potential Company-specific and/or 
market liquidity events in varying durations and severity, and 
(iv) satisfying regulatory requirements, including, among 
other things, those related to resolution and resolution 
planning (for additional information, see “Resolution Plan” 
and “Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)” below). 
Citigroup’s primary liquidity objectives are established by 
entity, and in aggregate, across two major categories:
•  Citibank (including Citibank Europe plc, Citibank 

 

Singapore Ltd. and Citibank (Hong Kong) Ltd.); and
the non-bank and other, which includes the parent holding 
company (Citigroup), Citi’s primary intermediate holding 
company (Citicorp LLC), Citi’s broker-dealer subsidiaries 
(including Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Citigroup 
Global Markets Ltd. and Citigroup Global Markets Japan 
Inc.) and other bank and non-bank subsidiaries that are 
consolidated into Citigroup (including Citibanamex).

• 

At an aggregate level, Citigroup’s goal is to maintain 

sufficient funding in amount and tenor to fully fund customer 
assets and to provide an appropriate amount of cash and high-
quality liquid assets (as discussed further below), even in

Note: The amounts set forth in the table above are presented on an average basis. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be 
realized and, therefore, exclude any securities that are encumbered and incorporate any haircuts that would be required for securities financing transactions. 
(1)   Foreign government debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by foreign sovereigns, agencies and multilateral development banks. Foreign government debt 

securities are held largely to support local liquidity requirements and Citi’s local franchises and primarily include government bonds from Hong Kong, Singapore, 
Korea, India and Mexico. 

As set forth in the table above, Citi’s total HQLA increased 
year-over-year, primarily driven by an increase in cash related 
to resolution planning. Sequentially, Citi’s HQLA decreased 
modestly, primarily driven by loan growth, partially offset by 
growth in deposits.
 
Citi’s HQLA as set forth above does not include Citi’s 
available borrowing capacity from the Federal Home Loan 
Banks (FHLB) of which Citi is a member, which was 
approximately $10 billion as of December 31, 2017 (compared 
to $16 billion as of September 30, 2017 and $21 billion as of 
December 31, 2016) and maintained by eligible collateral 
pledged to such banks. The HQLA also does not include Citi’s 
borrowing capacity at the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank discount 
window or other central banks, which would be in addition to 
the resources noted above.
 
within its bank group. Citi’s bank subsidiaries, including 
Citibank, can lend to the Citi parent and broker-dealer entities 
in accordance with Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. As 
of December 31, 2017, the capacity available for lending to 
these entities under Section 23A was approximately $15 
billion, unchanged from both September 30, 2017 and 
December 31, 2016, subject to certain eligible non-cash 
collateral requirements. 

In general, Citi’s liquidity is fungible across legal entities 

Loans
As part of its funding and liquidity objectives, Citi seeks to 
fund its existing asset base appropriately as well as maintain 
sufficient liquidity to grow its GCB and ICG businesses, 
including its loan portfolio. Citi maintains a diversified

Excluding the impact of FX translation, average loans 

increased 3% year-over-year, driven by 5% aggregate across 
GCB and ICG. Within GCB, loans grew 4%, with growth 
across all regions. 

Average ICG loans increased 6% year-over-year, driven 
primarily by client-led growth in the private bank. Treasury

4%, respectively, both driven by growth in Asia and EMEA.

Average Corporate/Other loans decreased 32% year-over-

End-of-period deposits increased 3% year-over-year and 
remained unchanged sequentially in the fourth quarter. On an 
average basis, deposits increased 4% year-over-year and 1% 
sequentially.

Excluding the impact of FX translation, average deposits 
increased 3% year-over-year, driven primarily by 6% growth 
in TTS, as well as 4% aggregate growth in Asia GCB and 
Latin America GCB. North America GCB deposits declined 
2% year-over-year, with half of the decline coming from lower 
escrow balances as a result of lower mortgage activity. Growth 
in checking deposits was more than offset by a reduction in 
money market balances, as clients transferred cash to 
investment accounts.

Long-Term Debt 
Long-term debt (generally defined as debt with original 
maturities of one year or more) represents the most significant 
component of Citi’s funding for the parent entities and is a 
supplementary source of funding for the bank entities. 

Long-term debt is an important funding source due in part 
to its multi-year contractual maturity structure. The weighted-
average maturity of unsecured long-term debt issued by 
Citigroup and its affiliates (including Citibank) with a 
remaining life greater than one year (excluding remaining trust 
preferred securities outstanding) was approximately 6.8 years 
as of December 31, 2017, unchanged sequentially and a 
modest decline from 7.0 years from the prior year.

Citi’s long-term debt outstanding at the parent includes 

senior and subordinated debt and what Citi refers to as 
customer-related debt, consisting of structured notes, such as 
equity- and credit-linked notes, as well as non-structured 
notes. Citi’s issuance of customer-related debt is generally 
driven by customer demand and supplements benchmark debt 
issuance as a source of funding for Citi’s parent entities. Citi’s 
long-term debt at the bank also includes benchmark senior 
debt, FHLB advances and securitizations.

Note: Amounts represent the current value of long-term debt on Citi’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet which, for certain debt instruments, includes 
consideration of fair value, hedging impacts and unamortized discounts and 
premiums.
(1)  “Parent and other” includes long-term debt issued to third parties by the 

parent holding company (Citigroup) and Citi’s non-bank subsidiaries 
(including broker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated into 
Citigroup. As of December 31, 2017 “parent and other” included $18.7 
billion of long-term debt issued by Citi’s broker-dealer subsidiaries.

(2)  Local country debt includes debt issued by Citi’s affiliates in support of 

their local operations.

(3)  Predominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by Citi-

branded credit card receivables.

Citi’s total long-term debt outstanding increased both 
year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. The increase year-
over-year was primarily driven by an increase in senior debt at 

92

the parent, as well as increases in both Citibank benchmark 
senior debt and securitizations at the bank. In addition, the 
year-over-year increase in outstanding customer-related debt 
was driven by stronger customer demand and fewer maturities 
and redemptions. Sequentially, the increase was driven 
primarily by an increase in Citibank benchmark debt and 
securitizations at the bank.

As part of its liability management, Citi has considered, 
and may continue to consider, opportunities to repurchase its 
long-term debt pursuant to open market purchases, tender 
offers or other means. Such repurchases help reduce Citi’s 
overall funding costs and assist it in meeting regulatory 
changes and requirements. During 2017, Citi repurchased an 
aggregate of approximately $2.6 billion of its outstanding 
long-term debt, including early redemptions of FHLB 
advances.

Resolution Plan
Under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act), 
Citigroup has developed a “single point of entry” resolution 
strategy and plan under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On July 1, 
2017, Citi submitted its 2017 resolution plan to the Federal 
Reserve and FDIC. On December 19, 2017, the Federal 
Reserve and FDIC informed Citi that (i) the agencies jointly 
decided that Citi’s 2017 resolution plan submission 
satisfactorily addressed the shortcomings identified in the 
2015 resolution plan submission, and (ii) the agencies together 
did not identify any shortcomings or deficiencies in the 2017 
resolution plan submission. Citi’s next resolution plan 
submission is due July 1, 2019. For additional information on 
Citi’s resolution plan submissions, see “Risk Factors—
Strategic Risks” above.

Under Citi’s resolution plan, only Citigroup, the parent 

holding company, would enter into bankruptcy, while 
Citigroup’s material legal entities (as defined in the public 
section of its 2017 resolution plan, which can be found on the 
Federal Reserve and FDIC websites) would remain 
operational and outside of any resolution or insolvency 
proceedings. Citigroup believes its resolution plan has been 
designed to minimize the risk of systemic impact to the U.S. 
and global financial systems, while maximizing the value of 
the bankruptcy estate for the benefit of Citigroup’s creditors, 
including its unsecured long-term debt holders. In addition, in 
line with the Federal Reserve’s final total loss-absorbing 
capacity (TLAC) rule, Citigroup believes it has developed the 
resolution plan so that Citigroup’s shareholders and unsecured 
creditors—including its unsecured long-term debt holders—
bear any losses resulting from Citigroup’s bankruptcy.
In response to feedback received from the Federal 
Reserve and FDIC on Citigroup’s 2015 resolution plan, 
Citigroup took the following actions in connection with its 
2017 resolution plan submission (which, as noted above, did 
not contain any shortcomings or deficiencies):

(i)  Citicorp LLC (Citicorp), an existing wholly owned 

subsidiary of Citigroup, was established as an 
intermediate holding company (an IHC) for certain of 
Citigroup’s operating material legal entities;

(ii)  Citigroup executed an inter-affiliate agreement with 
Citicorp, Citigroup’s operating material legal entities 
and certain other affiliated entities pursuant to which 
Citicorp is required to provide liquidity and capital 
support to Citigroup’s operating material legal entities 
in the event Citigroup were to enter bankruptcy 
proceedings (Citi Support Agreement); 
(iii) pursuant to the Citi Support Agreement:

•  Citigroup made an initial contribution of assets, 
including certain high-quality liquid assets and 
inter-affiliate loans (Contributable Assets), to 
Citicorp, and Citicorp became the business as usual 
funding vehicle for Citigroup’s operating material 
legal entities;

•  Citigroup will be obligated to continue to transfer 
Contributable Assets to Citicorp over time, subject 
to certain amounts retained by Citigroup to, among 

94

• 

other things, meet Citigroup’s near-term cash 
needs; 
in the event of a Citigroup bankruptcy, Citigroup 
will be required to contribute most of its remaining 
assets to Citicorp; and

(iv) the obligations of both Citigroup and Citicorp under the 

Citi Support Agreement, as well as the Contributable 
Assets, are secured pursuant to a security agreement.

The Citi Support Agreement provides two mechanisms, 
besides Citicorp’s issuing of dividends to Citigroup, pursuant 
to which Citicorp will be required to transfer cash to Citigroup 
during business as usual so that Citigroup can fund its debt 
service as well as other operating needs: (i) one or more 
funding notes issued by Citicorp to Citigroup and (ii) a 
committed line of credit under which Citicorp may make loans 
to Citigroup. 

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)
In 2016, the Federal Reserve Board released a final rule that 
imposes minimum external loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) 
and long-term debt (LTD) requirements on U.S. global 
systemically important bank holding companies (GSIBs), 
including Citi. The intended purpose of the final rule is to 
facilitate the orderly resolution of U.S. GSIBs under the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act. The 
effective date for all requirements under the final rule is 
January 1, 2019. While Citi believes that it meets the final 
minimum TLAC and LTD requirements as of December, 31, 
2017, there are uncertainties regarding certain key aspects of 
the final rule. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—
Compliance, Conduct and Legal Risks” above. For additional 
discussion of the method 1 and method 2 GSIB capital 
surcharge methodology, see “Capital Resources—Current 
Regulatory Capital Standards” above. 

Under the Federal Reserve Board’s final rule, U.S. GSIBs 

will be required to maintain minimum levels of TLAC and 
eligible LTD, each set by reference to the GSIB’s consolidated 
risk-weighted assets (RWA) and total leverage exposure and as 
described further below.

Minimum TLAC Requirements
The minimum TLAC requirement is the greater of (i) 18% of 
the GSIB’s RWA plus the then-applicable RWA-based TLAC 
buffer (see below) and (ii) 7.5% of the GSIB’s total leverage 
exposure plus a leveraged-based TLAC buffer of 2% (i.e., 
9.5%). The RWA-based TLAC buffer equals the 2.5% capital 
conservation buffer, plus any applicable countercyclical 
capital buffer (currently 0%), plus the GSIB’s capital 
surcharge as determined under method 1 of the GSIB 
surcharge rule (2.0% for Citi as of January 1, 2018). 
Accordingly, Citi estimates its total current minimum TLAC 
requirement is 22.5% of RWA under the final rule. Pursuant to 
the final rule, TLAC may generally only consist of the GSIB’s 
(i) Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Additional Tier 1 
Capital issued directly by the bank holding company 
(excluding qualifying trust preferred securities) plus (ii) 
eligible LTD (as discussed below). Breach of either the RWA- 

or leveraged-based TLAC buffer would result in restrictions 
on distributions and discretionary bonus payments. 

Minimum Eligible LTD Requirements
The minimum LTD requirement is the greater of (i) 6% of the 
GSIB’s RWA plus its capital surcharge as determined under 
method 2 of the GSIB surcharge rule (3.0% for Citi as of 
January 1, 2018), for a total current requirement of 9% of 
RWA for Citi, and (ii) 4.5% of the GSIB’s total leverage 
exposure. 

Generally, under the final rule, eligible LTD is defined as 
the unpaid principal balance of unsecured, “plain vanilla” debt 
securities (i.e., would not include certain of Citi’s customer-
related debt) issued directly by the bank holding company, 
governed by U.S. law, with a remaining maturity greater than 
one year and which provides for acceleration only upon the 
occurrence of insolvency or non-payment of principal or 
interest for 30 days or more. Further, pursuant to what has 
been referred to as the “haircut” provision, otherwise eligible 
LTD with a remaining maturity between one and two years is 
subject to a 50% haircut for purposes of meeting the minimum 
LTD requirement (although such LTD would continue to count 
at full value for purposes of the minimum TLAC requirement; 
eligible LTD with a remaining maturity of less than one year 
would not count toward either the minimum TLAC or eligible 
LTD requirement). The final rule provides that debt issued 
prior to December 31, 2016 with acceleration provisions other 
than those summarized above or governed by non-U.S. law is 
permanently grandfathered and may count as eligible LTD, 
assuming it otherwise meets the requirements of eligible LTD. 

Clean Holding Company Requirements
The final rule prohibits or limits certain financial 
arrangements at the bank holding company level, or what are 
referred to as “clean holding company” requirements. 
Pursuant to these requirements, Citi, as the bank holding 
company, is prohibited from having certain types of third-
party liabilities, including short-term debt, certain derivatives 
and other qualified financial contracts, liabilities guaranteed 
by a subsidiary (i.e., upstream guarantees) and guarantees of 
subsidiary liabilities or similar arrangements, if the liability or 
guarantee includes a default right linked to the insolvency of 
the bank holding company (i.e., downstream guarantees with 
cross default provisions). In addition, the final rule limits 
third-party, non-contingent liabilities of the bank holding 
company (other than those related to TLAC or eligible LTD) 
to 5% of the U.S. GSIB’s outstanding TLAC. Examples of the 
types of liabilities subject to this 5% limit include structured 
notes and various operating liabilities, such as rent and 
obligations to employees, as well as litigation and similar 
liabilities.

95

Secured Funding Transactions and Short-Term 
Borrowings
As referenced above, Citi supplements its primary sources of 
funding with short-term borrowings. Short-term borrowings 
generally include (i) secured funding transactions (securities 
loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, or repos) and 
(ii) to a lesser extent, short-term borrowings consisting of 
commercial paper and borrowings from the FHLB and other 
market participants (see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements for further information on Citigroup’s and its 
affiliates’ outstanding short-term borrowings). 

Outside of secured funding transactions, Citi’s short-term 

borrowings increased both year-over-year (a 45% increase) 
and sequentially (a 17% increase), driven by an increase in 
FHLB borrowing, as Citi continued to optimize liquidity 
across its legal vehicles.

Secured Funding
Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi’s broker-
dealer subsidiaries to fund efficiently both secured lending 
activity and a portion of securities inventory held in the 
context of market making and customer activities. Citi also 
executes a smaller portion of its secured funding transactions 
through its bank entities, which is typically collateralized by 
foreign government debt securities. Generally, daily changes 
in the level of Citi’s secured funding are primarily due to 
fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book 
(as described below) and securities inventory. 

Secured funding of $156 billion as of December 31, 2017 

increased 10% from the prior-year period and declined 3% 
sequentially. Excluding the impact of FX translation, secured 
funding increased 5% from the prior-year period and 
decreased 3% sequentially, both driven by normal business 
activity. Average balances for secured funding were 
approximately $163 billion for the quarter ended December 
31, 2017.

The portion of secured funding in the broker-dealer 

subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred 
to as “matched book” activity. The majority of this activity is 
secured by high-quality liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury 
securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign government debt 
securities. Other secured funding is secured by less-liquid 
securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and 
asset-backed securities. The tenor of Citi’s matched book 
liabilities is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the 
corresponding matched book assets.

The remainder of the secured funding activity in the 

broker-dealer subsidiaries serves to fund securities inventory 
held in the context of market making and customer activities. 
To maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market 
conditions, including under periods of stress, Citi manages 
these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the 
underlying collateral, and stipulating financing tenor. The 
weighted average maturity of Citi’s secured funding of less-
liquid securities inventory was greater than 110 days as of 
December 31, 2017.

Citi manages the risks in its secured funding by 

conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in 
capacity, tenors, haircut, collateral profile and client actions. 

Additionally, Citi maintains counterparty diversification by 
establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty 
reliability and stability under stress. Citi generally sources 
secured funding from more than 150 counterparties.

Liquidity Monitoring and Measurement

Stress Testing 
Liquidity stress testing is performed for each of Citi’s major 
entities, operating subsidiaries and/or countries. Stress testing 
and scenario analyses are intended to quantify the potential 
impact of an adverse liquidity event on the balance sheet and 
liquidity position, and to identify viable funding alternatives 
that can be utilized. These scenarios include assumptions 
about significant changes in key funding sources, market 
triggers (such as credit ratings), potential uses of funding and 
geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions. These conditions 
include expected and stressed market conditions as well as 
Company-specific events.

Liquidity stress tests are conducted to ascertain potential 
mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety 
of time horizons and over different stressed conditions. 
Liquidity limits are set accordingly. To monitor the liquidity of 
an entity, these stress tests and potential mismatches are 
calculated with varying frequencies, with several tests 
performed daily.

Given the range of potential stresses, Citi maintains 

contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for 
individual entities. These plans specify a wide range of readily 
available actions for a variety of adverse market conditions or 
idiosyncratic stresses.

Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage 
Ratio (LCR)
In addition to internal liquidity stress metrics that Citi has 
developed for a 30-day stress scenario, Citi also monitors its 
liquidity by reference to the LCR, as calculated pursuant to the 
U.S. LCR rules.

Generally, the LCR is designed to ensure that banks 

maintain an adequate level of HQLA to meet liquidity needs 
under an acute 30-day stress scenario. The LCR is calculated 
by dividing HQLA by estimated net outflows over a stressed 
30-day period, with the net outflows determined by applying 
prescribed outflow factors to various categories of liabilities, 
such as deposits, unsecured and secured wholesale 
borrowings, unused lending commitments and derivatives-
related exposures, partially offset by inflows from assets 
maturing within 30 days. Banks are required to calculate an 
add-on to address potential maturity mismatches between 
contractual cash outflows and inflows within the 30-day 
period in determining the total amount of net outflows. The 
minimum LCR requirement is 100%, effective January 2017.

Pursuant to the Federal Reserve Board’s final rule 

regarding LCR disclosures, effective April 1, 2017, Citi began 
to disclose LCR in the prescribed format. 

The table below sets forth the components of Citi’s LCR 

calculation and HQLA in excess of net outflows for the 
periods indicated:

Note: Amounts set forth in the table above are presented on an average basis.

As set forth in the table above, Citi’s LCR increased year-

over-year, as the increase in the HQLA (as discussed above) 
more than offset an increase in modeled net outflows. The 
increase in modeled net outflows was primarily driven by 
changes in assumptions, including changes in methodology to 
better align Citi’s outflow assumptions with those embedded 
in its resolution planning. Sequentially, Citi’s LCR remained 
unchanged. 

Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding 
Ratio (NSFR)
In 2016, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OCC 
issued a proposed rule to implement the Basel III NSFR 
requirement. 

  The U.S.-proposed NSFR is largely consistent with the 
Basel Committee’s final NSFR rules. In general, the NSFR 
assesses the availability of a bank’s stable funding against a 
required level. A bank’s available stable funding would 
include portions of equity, deposits and long-term debt, while 
its required stable funding would be based on the liquidity 
characteristics of its assets, derivatives and commitments. 
Prescribed factors would be required to be applied to the 
various categories of asset and liabilities classes. The ratio of 
available stable funding to required stable funding would be 
required to be greater than 100%. While Citi believes that it is 
compliant with the proposed U.S. NSFR rules as of December 
31, 2017, it will need to evaluate a final version of the rules, 
which are expected to be released during 2018. Citi expects 
that the NSFR final rules implementation period will be 
communicated along with the final version of the rules.

Credit Ratings
Citigroup’s funding and liquidity, funding capacity, ability to 
access capital markets and other sources of funds, the cost of 
these funds and its ability to maintain certain deposits are 
partially dependent on its credit ratings. 

The table below sets forth the ratings for Citigroup and 
Citibank as of December 31, 2017. While not included in the 
table below, the long-term and short-term ratings of Citigroup 
Global Markets Inc. (CGMI) were “A2/P-1” at Moody’s, “A+/
A-1” at Standard & Poor’s and “A+/F1” at Fitch as of 
December 31, 2017. The long-term and short-term ratings of 
CGMHI were “BBB+/A-2” at Standard & Poor’s and “A/F1” 
at Fitch as of December 31, 2017.

Recent Credit Rating Developments
As of November 14, 2017, Moody's Investors Service has 
placed Citi on "Positive" outlook, citing Citi’s durable 
business model with a narrower geographic footprint and 
refined customer base targets, and the ability to demonstrate a 
strengthened risk asset profile as well as improved earnings 
stability.

Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades
Ratings downgrades by Moody’s, Fitch or S&P could 
negatively impact Citigroup’s and/or Citibank’s funding and 
liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, including 
derivatives triggers, which could take the form of cash 
obligations and collateral requirements.

The following information is provided for the purpose of 

analyzing the potential funding and liquidity impact to 
Citigroup and Citibank of a hypothetical, simultaneous 
ratings downgrade across all three major rating agencies. This 
analysis is subject to certain estimates, estimation 
methodologies, judgments and uncertainties. Uncertainties 
include potential ratings limitations that certain entities may 
have with respect to permissible counterparties, as well as 
general subjective counterparty behavior. For example, certain 
corporate customers and markets counterparties could re-
evaluate their business relationships with Citi and limit 
transactions in certain contracts or market instruments with 
Citi. Changes in counterparty behavior could impact Citi’s 
funding and liquidity, as well as the results of operations of 
certain of its businesses. The actual impact to Citigroup or 
Citibank is unpredictable and may differ materially from the 
potential funding and liquidity impacts described below. For 
additional information on the impact of credit rating changes 
on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see “Risk Factors—
Liquidity Risks” above.

98

 Citigroup Inc. and Citibank—Potential Derivative Triggers
As of December 31, 2017, Citi estimates that a hypothetical 
one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of 
Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could 
impact Citigroup’s funding and liquidity due to derivative 
triggers by approximately $0.8 billion, compared to 
$1.0 billion as of September 30, 2017. Other funding sources, 
such as securities financing transactions and other margin 
requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could 
also be adversely affected.

As of December 31, 2017, Citi estimates that a 

hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-
term rating of Citibank across all three major rating agencies 
could impact Citibank’s funding and liquidity by 
approximately $0.4 billion, compared to $0.5 billion as of 
September 30, 2017, due to derivative triggers.

In total, Citi estimates that a one-notch downgrade of 

Citigroup and Citibank, across all three major rating agencies, 
could result in increased aggregate cash obligations and 
collateral requirements of approximately $1.2 billion, 
compared to $1.5 billion as of September 30, 2017 (see also 
Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). As set 
forth under “High-Quality Liquid Assets” above, the liquidity 
resources of Citibank were approximately $369 billion and the 
liquidity resources of Citi’s non-bank and other entities were 
approximately $77 billion, for a total of approximately 
$446 billion as of December 31, 2017. These liquidity 
resources are available in part as a contingency for the 
potential events described above.

In addition, a broad range of mitigating actions are 

currently included in Citigroup’s and Citibank’s contingency 
funding plans. For Citigroup, these mitigating factors include, 
but are not limited to, accessing surplus funding capacity from 
existing clients, tailoring levels of secured lending and 
adjusting the size of select trading books and collateralized 
borrowings from certain Citibank subsidiaries. Mitigating 

actions available to Citibank include, but are not limited to, 
selling or financing highly liquid government securities, 
tailoring levels of secured lending, adjusting the size of select 
trading assets, reducing loan originations and renewals, raising 
additional deposits or borrowing from the FHLB or central 
banks. Citi believes these mitigating actions could 
substantially reduce the funding and liquidity risk, if any, of 
the potential downgrades described above.

Citibank—Additional Potential Impacts
In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a 
potential one-notch downgrade of Citibank’s senior debt/long-
term rating by S&P could also have an adverse impact on the 
commercial paper/short-term rating of Citibank. As of 
December 31, 2017, Citibank had liquidity commitments of 
approximately $9.9 billion to consolidated asset-backed 
commercial paper conduits, compared to $10.0 billion as of 
September 30, 2017 (as referenced in Note 21 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements).

In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of 

certain Citibank and Citibanamex entities, Citibank could 
reduce the funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential 
downgrades described above through mitigating actions, 
including repricing or reducing certain commitments to 
commercial paper conduits. In the event of the potential 
downgrades described above, Citi believes that certain 
corporate customers could re-evaluate their deposit 
relationships with Citibank. This re-evaluation could result in 
clients adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing 
their depository institution, which could potentially reduce 
certain deposit levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose 
to adjust pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its 
existing customers or seek to attract deposits from new 
customers, in addition to the mitigating actions referenced 
above.

MARKET RISK

Overview
Market risk is the potential for losses arising from changes in 
the value of Citi’s assets and liabilities resulting from changes 
in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange 
rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as 
well as their implied volatilities. 

Each business is required to establish, with approval from 
Citi’s market risk management, a market risk limit framework 
for identified risk factors that clearly defines approved risk 
profiles and is within the parameters of Citi’s overall risk 
appetite. These limits are monitored by the Risk organization, 
Citi’s country and business Asset and Liability Committees 
and the Citigroup Asset and Liability Committee. In all cases, 
the businesses are ultimately responsible for the market risks 
taken and for remaining within their defined limits.

Market risk emanates from both Citi’s trading and non-
trading portfolios. Trading portfolios comprise all assets and 
liabilities marked-to-market, with results reflected in earnings. 
Non-trading portfolios include all other assets and liabilities.

Market Risk of Non-Trading Portfolios   
Market risk from non-trading portfolios stems from the 
potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign 
exchange rates on Citi’s net interest revenues, the changes in 
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) from 
its investment portfolios and capital invested in foreign 
currencies. 

Net Interest Revenue at Risk
Net interest revenue, for interest rate exposure purposes, is the 
difference between the yield earned on the non-trading 
portfolio assets (including customer loans) and the rate paid on 
the liabilities (including customer deposits or company 
borrowings). Net interest revenue is affected by changes in the 
level of interest rates, as well as the amounts and mix of assets 
and liabilities, and the timing of contractual and assumed 
repricing of assets and liabilities to reflect market rates.      

 Citi’s principal measure of risk to net interest revenue is 

interest rate exposure (IRE). IRE measures the change in 
expected net interest revenue in each currency resulting solely 
from unanticipated changes in forward interest rates. 
 
Citi’s estimated IRE incorporates various assumptions 
including prepayment rates on loans, customer behavior and 
the impact of pricing decisions. For example, in rising interest 
rate scenarios, portions of the deposit portfolio may be 
assumed to experience rate increases that are less than the 
change in market interest rates.  In declining interest rate 
scenarios, it is assumed that mortgage portfolios experience 
higher prepayment rates. IRE assumes that businesses and/or 
Citi Treasury make no additional changes in balances or 
positioning in response to the unanticipated rate changes.

In order to manage changes in interest rates effectively, 

Citi may modify pricing on new customer loans and deposits, 
purchase fixed-rate securities, issue debt that is either fixed or 
floating or enter into derivative transactions that have the 
opposite risk exposures. Citi regularly assesses the viability of 
these and other strategies to reduce its interest rate risks and 

implements such strategies when it believes those actions are 
prudent. 

Citi manages interest rate risk as a consolidated company-

wide position. Citi’s client-facing businesses create interest-
rate sensitive positions, including loans and deposits, as part of 
their ongoing activities. Citi Treasury aggregates these risk 
positions and manages them centrally. Operating within 
established limits, Citi Treasury makes positioning decisions 
and uses tools, such as Citi’s investment securities portfolio, 
company-issued debt and interest rate derivatives, to target the 
desired risk profile. Changes in Citi’s interest rate risk position 
reflect the accumulated changes in all non-trading assets and 
liabilities, with potentially large and offsetting impacts, as well 
as in Citi Treasury’s positioning decisions.

Citigroup employs additional measurements, including 

stress testing the impact of non-linear interest rate movements 
on the value of the balance sheet; the analysis of portfolio 
duration and volatility, particularly as they relate to mortgage 
loans and mortgage-backed securities; and the potential impact 
of the change in the spread between different market indices.

Interest Rate Risk of Investment Portfolios—Impact on 
AOCI
Citi also measures the potential impacts of changes in interest 
rates on the value of its AOCI, which can in turn impact Citi’s 
common equity and tangible common equity.  This will impact 
Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 and other regulatory capital 
ratios. Citi’s goal is to benefit from an increase in the market 
level of interest rates, while limiting the impact of changes in 
AOCI on its regulatory capital position.

AOCI at risk is managed as part of the company-wide 
interest rate risk position. AOCI at risk considers potential 
changes in AOCI (and the corresponding impact on the 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio) relative to Citi’s capital 
generation capacity.

(1)  Certain trading-oriented businesses within Citi have accrual-accounted positions that are excluded from the estimated impact to net interest revenue in the table 

since these exposures are managed economically in combination with mark-to-market positions. The U.S. dollar interest rate exposure associated with these 
businesses was $(182) million for a 100 bps instantaneous increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2017.
Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

(2) 
(3)  Results as of December 31, 2017 reflect the impact of Tax Reform, including the lower expected effective tax rate and the impact to Citi’s DTA position. Prior 
periods have not been restated. The estimated initial impact on Common Equity Tier I Capital ratio (bps) is calculated on a pre-tax basis prior to December 31, 
2017. 

The 2017 decrease in the estimated impact to net interest 

revenue primarily reflected changes in Citi’s balance sheet 
composition, including increases in loan balances and 
increased sensitivity in deposits, net of Citi Treasury 
positioning. The 2017 changes in the estimated impact to 
AOCI and the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio primarily 
reflected the impact of Tax Reform, including the lower 
expected effective tax rate and the impact to Citi’s DTA 
position, net of changes in the composition of Citi Treasury’s 
investment and derivatives portfolio.

In the event of an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 

bps increase in interest rates, Citi expects that the negative 
impact to AOCI would be offset in shareholders’ equity 
through the combination of expected incremental net interest 

revenue and the expected recovery of the impact on AOCI 
through accretion of Citi’s investment portfolio over a period 
of time. As of December 31, 2017, Citi expects that the 
negative $4.9 billion impact to AOCI in such a scenario could 
potentially be offset over approximately 21 months.

The following table sets forth the estimated impact to 
Citi’s net interest revenue, AOCI and the Common Equity 
Tier 1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis) under four 
different changes in interest rate scenarios for the U.S. dollar 
and Citi’s other currencies. While Citi also monitors the 
impact of a parallel decrease in interest rates, a 100 bps 
decrease in short-term rates is not meaningful, as it would 
imply negative interest rates in many of Citi’s markets.

Note: Each scenario in the table above assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously. Changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and 
the 10-year rate are interpolated.

(2)  Results as of December 31, 2017 reflect the impact of Tax Reform, including the lower expected effective tax rate and the impact to Citi’s DTA position. 

Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

As shown in the table above, the magnitude of the impact 

to Citi’s net interest revenue and AOCI is greater under 
scenario 2 as compared to scenario 3. This is because the 
combination of changes to Citi’s investment portfolio, 
partially offset by changes related to Citi’s pension liabilities, 
results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at shorter 
and intermediate term maturities.

The effect of Citi’s ongoing management strategies with 
respect to changes in foreign exchange rates and the impact of 
these changes on Citi’s TCE and Common Equity Tier 1 
Capital ratio are shown in the table below. For additional 
information on the changes in AOCI, see Note 19 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates—Impacts on AOCI 
and Capital
As of December 31, 2017, Citi estimates that an unanticipated 
parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar 
against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested 
capital could reduce Citi’s tangible common equity (TCE) by 
approximately $1.6 billion, or 1.0%, as a result of changes to 
Citi’s foreign currency translation adjustment in AOCI, net of 
hedges. This impact would be primarily due to changes in the 
value of the Mexican peso, the Euro and the British pound 
sterling.

This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may 

take, including ongoing management of its foreign currency 
translation exposure. Specifically, as currency movements 
change the value of Citi’s net investments in foreign currency-
denominated capital, these movements also change the value 
of Citi’s risk-weighted assets denominated in those currencies. 
This, coupled with Citi’s foreign currency hedging strategies, 
such as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency 
forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens the 
impact of foreign currency movements on Citi’s Common 
Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio. Changes in these hedging 
strategies, as well as hedging costs, divestitures and tax 
impacts, can further affect the actual impact of changes in 
foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital as compared to an 
unanticipated parallel shock, as described above.

Note:  All interest expense amounts include FDIC deposit insurance assessments.
(1)  Net interest revenue includes the taxable equivalent adjustments related to the tax-exempt bond portfolio (based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%) of 

$496 million, $462 million and $489 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Interest expense associated with certain hybrid financial instruments, which are classified as Long-term debt and accounted for at fair value, is reported together

(2) 
         with any changes in fair value as part of Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statements of Income and is therefore not reflected in Interest expense in the     

table above.

(3)    Citi’s net interest margin (NIM) is calculated by dividing gross interest revenue less gross interest expense by average interest-earning assets.

Citi’s net interest revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 
remained largely unchanged versus the prior-year period at 
$11.2 billion ($11.4 billion on a taxable equivalent basis). 
Excluding the impact of FX translation, Citi’s net interest 
revenue was down slightly versus the prior-year period (down 
$50 million), as higher core accrual net interest revenue ($10.4 
billion, up approximately 5% or $0.5 billion) was offset by 
lower trading-related net interest revenue ($0.5 billion, down 
approximately 46% or $0.4 billion) and lower net interest 
revenue associated with legacy assets in Corporate/Other 
($0.3 billion, down approximately 34% or $0.1 billion). The 
increase in core accrual net interest revenue was driven mainly 
by the benefit of the December 2016, March 2017 and June 
2017 interest rate increases and volume growth.  

Citi’s net interest revenue for the full-year remained 

largely unchanged versus the prior-year at $44.7 billion ($45.2 
billion on a taxable equivalent basis). Excluding the impact of 
FX translation, Citi’s net interest revenue declined by 
approximately $0.5 billion, as higher core accrual net interest 
revenue (approximately $40.5 billion, up 5%, or $2.0 billion) 
was offset by lower trading-related net interest revenue 
(approximately $2.9 billion, down 37%, or $1.7 billion), 
largely driven by higher wholesale funding costs, and lower 
net interest revenue associated with legacy assets in 
Corporate/Other (approximately $1.2 billion, down 40%, or 
$0.8 billion). The increase in core accrual net interest revenue 
was primarily due to the benefit of the interest rate increases 
and volume growth.

103

Citi’s NIM was 2.63% on a taxable equivalent basis in the 

fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of 9 bps from the third 
quarter of 2017, driven primarily by lower trading-related 
NIM. On a full-year basis, Citi’s NIM was 2.70% on a taxable 
equivalent basis, compared to 2.86% in 2016, a decrease of 16 
bps. Citi’s full-year core accrual NIM was 3.45%, a decline of 
5 bps from the prior year, as higher core accrual net interest 
revenue was more than offset by balance sheet growth. (Citi’s 
core accrual net interest revenue and core accrual NIM are 
non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes these measures 
provide a more meaningful depiction for investors of the 
underlying fundamentals of its business results.)

Market Risk of Trading Portfolios
Trading portfolios include positions resulting from market 
making activities, hedges of certain available-for-sale (AFS) 
debt securities, the CVA relating to derivative counterparties 
and all associated hedges, fair value option loans, hedges to 
the loan portfolio and the leverage finance pipeline within 
capital markets origination within ICG.

The market risk of Citi’s trading portfolios is monitored 
using a combination of quantitative and qualitative measures, 
including, but not limited to:
• 
• 
• 

factor sensitivities; 
value at risk (VAR); and 
stress testing.

Each trading portfolio across Citi’s businesses has its own 
market risk limit framework encompassing these measures and 
other controls, including trading mandates, permitted product 

lists and a new product approval process for complex 
products.

The following chart of total daily trading-related revenue 
(loss) captures trading volatility and shows the number of days 
in which revenues for Citi’s trading businesses fell within 
particular ranges. Trading-related revenue includes trading, net 
interest and other revenue associated with Citi’s trading 
businesses. It excludes DVA, FVA and CVA adjustments 
incurred due to changes in the credit quality of counterparties, 
as well as any associated hedges to that CVA. In addition, it 
excludes fees and other revenue associated with capital 
markets origination activities. Trading-related revenues are 
driven by both customer flows and the changes in valuation of 
the trading inventory. As shown in the chart, positive trading-
related revenue was achieved for 99.6% of the trading days in 
2017.

HTM. For information on these securities, see Note 13 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated 

to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term 
(approximately the most recent month) and long-term (three 
years) market volatility. The Monte Carlo simulation involves 
approximately 350,000 market factors, making use of 
approximately 200,000 time series, with sensitivities updated 
daily, volatility parameters updated daily to weekly and 
correlation parameters updated monthly. The conservative 
features of the VAR calibration contribute an approximate 
20% add-on to what would be a VAR estimated under the 
assumption of stable and perfectly, normally distributed 
markets. 

As set forth in the table below, Citi’s average trading VAR 

increased from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, 
mainly due to changes in interest rate exposures from mark-to-
market hedging activity against non-trading positions in the 
Markets and securities services businesses within ICG. The 
increase was partially offset by lower credit spread exposures 
and volatilities. Average trading and credit portfolio VAR was 
largely unchanged from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 
2017, mainly due to a reduction of the hedging related to 
lending activities offsetting the increase in average trading 
VAR.  

Factor Sensitivities
Factor sensitivities are expressed as the change in the value of 
a position for a defined change in a market risk factor, such as 
a change in the value of a U.S. Treasury bill for a one-basis-
point change in interest rates. Citi’s market risk management, 
within the Risk organization, works to ensure that factor 
sensitivities are calculated, monitored and, in most cases, 
limited for all material risks taken in the trading portfolios.

Value at Risk (VAR)
VAR estimates, at a 99% confidence level, the potential 
decline in the value of a position or a portfolio under normal 
market conditions assuming a one-day holding period. VAR 
statistics, which are based on historical data, can be materially 
different across firms due to differences in portfolio 
composition, differences in VAR methodologies and 
differences in model parameters. As a result, Citi believes 
VAR statistics can be used more effectively as indicators of 
trends in risk-taking within a firm, rather than as a basis for 
inferring differences in risk-taking across firms.

Citi uses a single, independently approved Monte Carlo 

simulation VAR model (see “VAR Model Review and 
Validation” below), which has been designed to capture 
material risk sensitivities (such as first- and second-order 
sensitivities of positions to changes in market prices) of 
various asset classes/risk types (such as interest rate, credit 
spread, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks). Citi’s 
VAR includes positions which are measured at fair value; it 
does not include investment securities classified as AFS or

(1)  Covariance adjustment (also known as diversification benefit) equals the difference between the total VAR and the sum of the VARs tied to each individual risk 
type. The benefit reflects the fact that the risks within each and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a given day will 
be lower than the sum of the VARs relating to each individual risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made 
by an examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes. 

(2)    The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain fair value option trading positions in ICG, with the exception of hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value 

option loans and all CVA exposures. Available-for-sale and accrual exposures are not included.

(3)   The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and fixed income issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR. 
(4)   The credit portfolio is composed of mark-to-market positions associated with non-trading business units including Citi Treasury, the CVA relating to derivative 
counterparties and all associated CVA hedges. FVA and DVA are not included. The credit portfolio also includes hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option 
loans and hedges to the leveraged finance pipeline within capital markets origination in ICG.

VAR Model Review and Validation
Generally, Citi’s VAR review and model validation process 
entails reviewing the model framework, major assumptions 
and implementation of the mathematical algorithm. In 
addition, as part of the model validation process, product 
specific back-testing on portfolios is periodically completed 
and reviewed with Citi’s U.S. banking regulators. 
Furthermore, Regulatory VAR back-testing (as described 
below) is performed against buy-and-hold profit and loss on a 
monthly basis for multiple sub-portfolios across the 
organization (trading desk level, ICG business segment and 
Citigroup) and the results are shared with U.S. banking 
regulators.

Significant VAR model and assumption changes must be 

independently validated within Citi’s risk management 
organization. This validation process includes a review by 
Citi’s model validation group and further approval from its 
model validation review committee, which is composed of 
senior quantitative risk management officers. In the event of 
significant model changes, parallel model runs are undertaken 
prior to implementation. In addition, significant model and 
assumption changes are subject to the periodic reviews and 
approval by Citi’s U.S. banking regulators.

Citi uses the same independently validated VAR model 
for both Regulatory VAR and Risk Management VAR (i.e., 
total trading and total trading and credit portfolios VARs) and, 
as such, the model review and oversight process for both 
purposes is as described above.

Regulatory VAR, which is calculated in accordance with 
Basel III, differs from Risk Management VAR due to the fact 
that certain positions included in Risk Management VAR are 

not eligible for market risk treatment in Regulatory VAR. The 
composition of Risk Management VAR is discussed under 
“Value at Risk” above. The applicability of the VAR model for 
positions eligible for market risk treatment under U.S. 
regulatory capital rules is periodically reviewed and approved 
by Citi’s U.S. banking regulators.

In accordance with Basel III, Regulatory VAR includes all 

trading book-covered positions and all foreign exchange and 
commodity exposures. Pursuant to Basel III, Regulatory VAR 
excludes positions that fail to meet the intent and ability to 
trade requirements and are therefore classified as non-trading 
book and categories of exposures that are specifically 
excluded as covered positions. Regulatory VAR excludes CVA 
on derivative instruments and DVA on Citi’s own fair value 
option liabilities. CVA hedges are excluded from Regulatory 
VAR and included in credit risk-weighted assets as computed 
under the Advanced Approaches for determining risk-
weighted assets.

Regulatory VAR Back-Testing
In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-
testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR 
model. Regulatory VAR back-testing is the process in which 
the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% confidence interval, is 
compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit 
and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of 
the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit 
and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss 
attributable to price movements in covered positions from the 
close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and 
loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and 
commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes in 
reserves.

Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two 

to three days in any one year where buy-and-hold losses 
exceeded the Regulatory VAR. Given the conservative 
calibration of Citi’s VAR model (as a result of taking the 
greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling 
of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer exceptions under 
normal and stable market conditions. Periods of unstable 
market conditions could increase the number of back-testing 
exceptions.

112

The following graph shows the daily buy-and-hold profit 
and loss associated with Citi’s covered positions compared to 
Citi’s one-day Regulatory VAR during 2017. During 2017, 
there were no back-testing exceptions observed for Citi’s 
Regulatory VAR.

The difference between the 45.4% of days with buy-and-
hold gains for Regulatory VAR back-testing and the 99.6% of 
days with trading, net interest and other revenue associated 
with Citi’s trading businesses, shown in the histogram of daily 
trading-related revenue below, reflects, among other things, 
that a significant portion of Citi’s trading-related revenue is 
not generated from daily price movements on these positions 
and exposures, as well as differences in the portfolio 
composition of Regulatory VAR and Risk Management VAR.

Regulatory Trading VAR and Associated Buy-and-Hold Profit and Loss (1)—12 Months ended December 31, 2017
In millions of dollars

(1)   Buy-and-hold profit and loss, as defined by the banking regulators under Basel III, represents the daily mark-to-market revenue movement attributable to the 
trading position from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue and net interest intra-day trading 
profit and loss on new and terminated trades, as well as changes in reserves. Therefore, it is not comparable to the trading-related revenue presented in the chart of 
daily trading-related revenue above.

113

Stress Testing
Citi performs market risk stress testing on a regular basis to 
estimate the impact of extreme market movements. It is 
performed on individual positions and trading portfolios, as 
well as in aggregate, inclusive of multiple trading portfolios. 
Citi’s market risk management, after consultations with the 
businesses, develops both systemic and specific stress 
scenarios, reviews the output of periodic stress testing 
exercises, and uses the information to assess the ongoing 
appropriateness of exposure levels and limits. Citi uses two 
complementary approaches to market risk stress testing across 
all major risk factors (i.e., equity, foreign exchange, 
commodity, interest rate and credit spreads): top-down 
systemic stresses and bottom-up business-specific stresses. 
Systemic stresses are designed to quantify the potential impact 
of extreme market movements on an institution-wide basis, 
and are constructed using both historical periods of market 
stress and projections of adverse economic scenarios. 
Business-specific stresses are designed to probe the risks of 
particular portfolios and market segments, especially those 
risks that are not fully captured in VAR and systemic stresses.
The systemic stress scenarios and business-specific stress 
scenarios at Citi are used in several reports reviewed by senior 
management and also to calculate internal risk capital for 
trading market risk. In general, changes in market values are 
defined over a one-year horizon. For the most liquid positions 
and market factors, changes in market values are defined over 
a shorter two-month horizon. The limited set of positions and 
market factors whose market value changes are defined over a 
two-month time horizon are those that in management’s 
judgment have historically remained very liquid during 
financial crises, even as the trading liquidity of most other 
positions and market factors materially declined.

114

Citigroup and to provide a forum to assess Citi’s operational 
risk profile and ensure actions are taken so that Citi’s 
operational risk exposure is actively managed consistent with 
Citi’s risk appetite. The Committee seeks to ensure that these 
actions address the root causes that persistently lead to 
operational risk losses and create lasting solutions to 
minimize these losses. Members include Citi’s Chief Risk 
Officer and Citi’s Head of Operational Risk and senior 
members of their organizations. These members cover 
multiple dimensions of risk management and include business 
and regional Chief Risk Officers and senior operational risk 
managers.

In addition, Risk management, including Operational 
Risk Management, works proactively with the businesses 
and other independent control functions to embed a strong 
operational risk management culture and framework across 
Citi. Operational Risk Management engages with the 
businesses to ensure effective implementation of the 
Operational Risk Management framework by focusing on (i) 
identification, analysis and assessment of operational risks, 
(ii) effective challenge of key control issues and operational 
risks and (iii) anticipation and mitigation of operational risk 
events.

Information about the businesses’ operational risk, 

historical operational risk losses and the control 
environment is reported by each major business segment and 
functional area. The information is summarized and reported 
to senior management, as well as to the Audit Committee of 
Citi’s Board of Directors.

Operational risk is measured and assessed through risk 

capital. Projected operational risk losses under stress scenarios 
are also required as part of the Federal Reserve Board’s CCAR 
process.

COMPLIANCE RISK
Compliance risk is the risk arising from violations of, or non-
conformance with, local, national, or cross-border laws, rules, 
or regulations, Citi's internal policies, or other relevant 
standards of conduct or the risk of harming customers, clients 
or the integrity of the market.

As the champion of responsible finance, Independent 
Compliance Risk Management’s primary objectives are to:
•  Maintain a framework that facilitates enterprise-wide 

• 

compliance with local, national or cross-border laws, rules 
or regulations, Citi’s internal policies and procedures and 
relevant standards of conduct;
Support Citi’s operations by assisting in the management 
of compliance risk across products, business lines, 
functions and geographies, supported by globally 
consistent systems and processes; and

•  Drive and embed a risk culture of compliance, control and 

ethical conduct throughout Citi.

OPERATIONAL RISK
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or 
failed internal processes, systems or human factors, or from 
external events. It includes risk of failing to comply with 
applicable laws and regulations, but excludes strategic risk. 
Operational risk includes the reputation and franchise risk 
associated with business practices or market conduct in which 
Citi is involved, as well as compliance, conduct and legal 
risks.

Operational risk is inherent in Citi’s global business 

activities, as well as related support functions, and can result 
in losses arising from events associated with the following, 
among others:
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

fraud, theft and unauthorized activity;
employment practices and workplace environment;
clients, products and business practices;
physical assets and infrastructure; and
execution, delivery and process management.

Citi manages operational risk consistent with the overall 
framework described in “Managing Global Risk—Overview” 
above. The Company’s goal is to keep operational risk at 
appropriate levels relative to the characteristics of Citi’s 
businesses, the markets in which it operates, its capital and 
liquidity and the competitive, economic and regulatory 
environment.

To anticipate, mitigate and control operational risk, Citi 

has established policies and a global framework for assessing, 
monitoring and communicating operational risks and the 
overall operating effectiveness of the internal control 
environment across Citigroup. As part of this framework, Citi 
has defined its operational risk appetite and has established a 
manager’s control assessment (MCA) process (a process 
through which managers at Citi identify, monitor, measure, 
report on and manage risks and the related controls) to help 
managers self-assess significant operational risks and key 
controls and identify and address weaknesses in the design 
and/or operating effectiveness of internal controls that mitigate 
significant operational risks.

Each major business segment must implement an 

operational risk process consistent with the requirements of 
this framework. The process for operational risk management 
includes the following steps:
• 
• 
• 
• 

identify and assess key operational risks;
design controls to mitigate identified risks;
establish key risk indicators;
implement a process for early problem recognition and 
timely escalation;
produce comprehensive operational risk reporting; and
ensure that sufficient resources are available to actively 
improve the operational risk environment and mitigate 
emerging risks.

• 
• 

As new products and business activities are developed, 

processes are designed, modified or sourced through 
alternative means and operational risks are considered.

An Operational Risk Management Committee has been 
established to provide oversight for operational risk across 

115

Independent Compliance Risk Management (ICRM) 
Program
To anticipate, mitigate and control compliance risk, Citi has 
established a global independent compliance risk management 
framework for assessing, monitoring and communicating 
compliance risks. To achieve this mission, ICRM seeks to:
•  Communicate a strong culture of compliance, control and 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

ethical conduct.
Identify compliance risk and AML compliance risk for 
which each business or function has responsibility, 
including through compliance risk assessments, and set 
standards with respect to these requirements.
Identify regulatory changes and oversee the assessment of 
impact, as well as capture and monitor adherence to 
existing regulatory requirements, providing the businesses 
with guidance and support as needed in accordance with 
the regulatory change management standard.
Provide credible challenge to the first-line units in their 
assessment and management of compliance risk.
Perform compliance assurance activities to oversee 
adherence to applicable requirements.
Issue policies, procedures and other documentation that 
set standards for employees in conducting Citi’s business 
and provide oversight in the application of those standards 
to specific circumstances.

•  Manage regulatory examinations and other supervisory 
activity impacting Citi’s businesses and global control 
functions in accordance with the regulatory exam 
management governance and process standards.
Provide training to support the effective execution of roles 
and responsibilities related to the identification, control, 
reporting and escalation of matters related to compliance 
risks.

•  Report to senior management and the Citigroup Board of 

• 

Directors or their designated committees on the 
effectiveness of the processes and standards implemented 
to manage compliance risk.

•  Escalate through the appropriate channels, which may 
include governance forums, the results of monitoring, 
testing, reporting or other oversight activities that may 
represent a violation of law, regulation, policy or other 
significant compliance risk and take reasonable action to 
see that the matter is appropriately identified, tracked and 
resolved, including through the issuance of corrective 
action plans against the first line of defense.

•  Advise, as needed or when required by policy, on the 
degree to which existing and new business processes, 
methodologies, performance, products, services, 
transactions or customer segments satisfy Citi standards 
and are consistent with the prudent management of 
compliance risk.

CONDUCT RISK
Citi places conduct risk within compliance risk and defines 
conduct risk as the risk that Citi’s employees or agents may—
intentionally or through negligence—harm customers, clients, 
or the integrity of the markets, and thereby the integrity of the 
Company. Citi manages its exposure to conduct risk through a 
global conduct risk program that is implemented across its 
businesses and functions. The conduct risk program requires 
all three lines of defense to understand and perform certain 
key roles and responsibilities. The first line of defense owns 
and manages the risks inherent in or arising from the business, 
including conduct risk, and is responsible for managing, 
minimizing and mitigating those risks. The second line of 
defense takes a risk-based approach to assess, advise on, 
monitor and test current and emerging significant conduct 
risks across products, businesses, functions, countries and 
regions and works to enhance the effectiveness of controls. 
The third line of defense provides independent risk-based 
assurance over the conduct risk program based upon a risk-
based audit plan and audit methodology as approved by the 
Citigroup Board of Directors.

Each business and function identifies its significant 
conduct risks through a diagnostic process that includes 
broadly understanding their potential significant conduct risks 
in the context of their overall activities, identifying and 
flagging their significant conduct risks and related controls 
and incorporating the results of this diagnostic process into 
their annual risk assessment process. Citi also manages its 
conduct risk through other initiatives, including various 
culture-related efforts. 

LEGAL RISK
Citi views legal risk as qualitative in nature because it does not 
lend itself to an appetite expressed through a numerical limit 
and it cannot be reliably estimated or measured based on 
forecasts. As such, Citi seeks to manage this risk in 
accordance with its qualitative risk appetite principle, which 
generally states that activities in which Citi engages and the 
risks those activities generate must be consistent with Citi’s 
underlying commitment to the principle of responsible finance 
and managed with a goal to eliminate, minimize or mitigate 
this risk, as practicable. To accomplish this goal, legal risk is 
managed in accordance with the overall framework described 
in greater detail in “Managing Global Risk—Overview” 
above.

REPUTATIONAL RISK
Citi’s reputation is a vital asset in building trust with its 
stakeholders and Citi is diligent in communicating its 
corporate values, including the importance of protecting Citi’s 
reputation, to its employees, customers and investors.  The 
responsibility for maintaining Citi’s reputation is shared by all 
employees, who are guided by Citi’s code of conduct.  
Employees are expected to exercise sound judgment and 
common sense in every action they take and issues that 
present potential franchise, reputational and/or systemic risks 
are to be appropriately escalated.  The business practices 
committees for each of Citi’s businesses and regions are part 
of the governance infrastructure Citi has in place to properly 

116

review business activities, sales practices, product design, 
perceived conflicts of interest and other potential franchise or 
reputational risks that arise in these businesses and regions.  
These committees may also raise potential franchise, 
reputational or systemic risks for due consideration by the 
business practices committee at the corporate level.   All of 
these committees, which are composed of Citi’s most senior 
executives, provide the guidance necessary for Citi’s business 
practices to meet the highest standards of professionalism, 
integrity and ethical behavior consistent with Citi’s mission 
and value proposition.

STRATEGIC RISK
Citi senior management, led by Citi’s CEO, is responsible for 
the development and execution of the strategy of the 
Company. Significant strategic actions are reviewed and 
approved by, or notified to, the Citigroup and Citibank Board 
of Directors, as appropriate.  The Citigroup Board of Directors 
holds an annual strategic meeting and annual regional strategic 
meetings, and receives business presentations at its regular 
meetings, in order to monitor management’s execution of 
Citi’s strategy. At the business level, business heads are 
accountable for the interpretation and execution of the 
Company-wide strategy, as it applies to their area, including 
decisions on new business and product entries.

The management of strategic risk rests upon the 

foundational elements that include an annual financial 
operating plan encompassing all businesses, products and 
geographies and defined financial and operating targets, 
derived from the operating plan, which can be monitored 
throughout the year in order to assess strategic and operating 
performance.   Strategic risk is monitored through various 
mechanisms, including regular updates to senior management 
and the Board of Directors on performance against the 
operating plan, quarterly business reviews between the Citi 
CEO and business and regional CEOs in which the 
performance and risks of each major business and region are 
discussed, ongoing reporting to senior management and 
executive management scorecards.

Country Risk

Top 25 Country Exposures 
The following table presents Citi’s top 25 exposures by
country (excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2017. The 
total exposure as of December 31, 2017 to the top 25 countries 
disclosed below, in combination with the U.S., would 
represent, approximately 94% of Citi’s exposure to all 
countries. For purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected 
in the country where the loan is booked, which is generally 
based on the domicile of the borrower. For example, a loan to 
a Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based corporation will 
generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition, Citi 
has developed regional booking centers in certain countries, 
most significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland, 
in order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers. As 
an example, with respect to the U.K., only 24% of corporate
 

loans presented in the table below are to U.K. domiciled
entities (25% for unfunded commitments), with the balance of
the loans predominately to European domiciled counterparties.
Approximately 80% of the total U.K. funded loans and 88% of
the total U.K. unfunded commitments were investment grade
as of December 31, 2017. Trading account assets and 
investment securities are generally categorized based on the 
domicile of the issuer of the security of the underlying 
reference entity. For additional information on the assets 
included in the table, see the footnotes to the table below.

For a discussion of uncertainties arising as a result of the 

terms and other uncertainties resulting from the U.K.’s 
potential exit from the EU, see “Risk Factors—Strategic 
Risks” above.

located in that country.

Argentina
As of December 31, 2017, Citi’s net investment in its 
Argentine operations was approximately $954 million, 
compared to $725 million at December 31, 2016. 

Citi uses the Argentine peso as the functional currency in 

Argentina and translates its financial statements into U.S. 
dollars using the official exchange rate as published by the 
Central Bank of Argentina. The impact of devaluations of the 
Argentine peso on Citi’s net investment in Argentina, net of 
hedges, is reported as a translation loss in stockholders’ equity.

Although Citi currently uses the Argentine peso as the 
functional currency, an increase in inflation resulting in a 
cumulative three-year inflation rate of 100% or more would 
result in a change in the functional currency to the U.S. dollar. 
Citi has historically based its evaluation of the cumulative 
three-year inflation rate on the CPI (Consumer Price Index) 
inflation statistics published by INDEC, the Argentine 
government’s statistics agency. However, for the period from 
November 2015 to April 2016, INDEC did not publish CPI 
statistics, which has led to uncertainty about the cumulative 
three-year inflation rate. As of December 31, 2017, Citi 
evaluated the available CPI statistics as well as inflation 
statistics published by the Argentine Central Bank and 
concluded that Argentina’s cumulative three-year inflation rate 
had not reached 100%. However, uncertainty continues as to 
the cumulative three-year inflation rate, and additional 
information received in future periods could result in a change 
of functional currency to the U.S. dollar in 2018. 

While a change in the functional currency to the U.S. 
dollar would not result in any immediate gains or losses to 
Citi, it would result in future changes in the translation of 
Citi’s Argentine peso-denominated assets and liabilities into 
U.S. dollars being recorded in earnings instead of 
stockholders’ equity.

FFIEC—Cross-Border Claims on Third Parties and Local 
Country Assets
Citi’s cross-border disclosures are based on the country 
exposure bank regulatory reporting guidelines of the Federal 
Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). The 
following summarizes some of the FFIEC key reporting 
guidelines:
•  Amounts are based on the domicile of the ultimate 

obligor, counterparty, collateral, issuer or guarantor, as 
applicable.    

•  Amounts do not consider the benefit of collateral received 

for secured financing transactions (i.e., repurchase 
agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities 
loaned and borrowed) and are reported based on notional 
amounts. 

•  Netting of derivative receivables and payables, reported at 

fair value, is permitted, but only under a legally binding 
netting agreement with the same specific counterparty, 
and does not include the benefit of margin received or 
hedges.

•  The netting of long and short positions for AFS securities 

and trading portfolios is not permitted. 

•  Credit default swaps (CDS) are included based on the 
gross notional amount sold and purchased and do not 
include any offsetting CDS on the same underlying entity. 

•  Loans are reported without the benefit of hedges.

Given the requirements noted above, Citi’s FFIEC cross-
border exposures and total outstandings tend to fluctuate, in 
some cases, significantly, from period to period. As an 
example, because total outstandings under FFIEC guidelines 
do not include the benefit of margin or hedges, market 
volatility in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and credit 
spreads may cause significant fluctuations in the level of total 
outstandings, all else being equal.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES

This section contains a summary of Citi’s most significant 
accounting policies and accounting standards that have been 
issued, but are not yet effective. Note 1 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements contains a summary of Citigroup’s 
significant accounting policies, including a discussion of 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements. These 
policies, as well as estimates made by management, are 
integral to the presentation of Citi’s results of operations and 
financial condition. While all of these policies require a 
certain level of management judgment and estimates, this 
section highlights and discusses the significant accounting 
policies that require management to make highly difficult, 
complex or subjective judgments and estimates at times 
regarding matters that are inherently uncertain and 
susceptible to change (see also “Risk Factors—Operational 
Risks” above). Management has discussed each of these 
significant accounting policies, the related estimates and its 
judgments with the Audit Committee of the Citigroup Board 
of Directors. 

Valuations of Financial Instruments
Citigroup holds debt and equity securities, derivatives, 
retained interests in securitizations, investments in private 
equity and other financial instruments. Substantially all of 
these assets and liabilities are reflected at fair value on Citi’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Citi purchases securities under agreements to 

resell (reverse repos) and sells securities under agreements 
to repurchase (repos), a majority of which are carried at 
fair value. In addition, certain loans, short-term borrowings, 
long-term debt and deposits, as well as certain securities 
borrowed and loaned positions that are collateralized with 
cash, are carried at fair value. Citigroup holds its 
investments, trading assets and liabilities, and resale and 
repurchase agreements on the Consolidated Balance Sheet to 
meet customer needs and to manage liquidity needs, interest 
rate risks and private equity investing.

When available, Citi generally uses quoted market 
prices to determine fair value and classifies such items 
within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy established under 
ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement. If quoted market 
prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally 
developed valuation models that use, where possible, current 
market-based or independently sourced market parameters, 
such as interest rates, currency rates and option volatilities. 
Such models are often based on a discounted cash flow 
analysis. In addition, items valued using such internally 
generated valuation techniques are classified according to 
the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the 
valuation. Thus, an item may be classified under the fair 
value hierarchy as Level 3 even though there may be some 
significant inputs that are readily observable.

Citi is required to exercise subjective judgments relating 

to the applicability and functionality of internal valuation 
models, the significance of inputs or value drivers to the 
valuation of an instrument and the degree of illiquidity and 
subsequent lack of observability in certain markets. These 

121

judgments have the potential to impact the Company’s 
financial performance for instruments where the changes in 
fair value are recognized in either the Consolidated 
Statement of Income or in AOCI. 

Moreover, for certain investments, decreases in fair 
value are only recognized in earnings in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income if such decreases are judged to be an 
other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). Adjudicating the 
temporary nature of fair value impairments is also inherently 
judgmental.  

 The fair value of financial instruments incorporates the 

effects of Citi’s own credit risk and the market view of 
counterparty credit risk, the quantification of which is also 
complex and judgmental. For additional information on 
Citi’s fair value analysis, see Notes 1, 6, 24 and 25 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Allowance for Credit Losses
Management provides reserves for an estimate of probable 
losses inherent in the funded loan portfolio and in unfunded 
loan commitments and standby letters of credit on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet in the Allowance for loan losses 
and in Other liabilities, respectively. 

Estimates of these probable losses are based upon (i) 
Citigroup’s internal system of credit-risk ratings that are 
analogous to the risk ratings of the major credit rating 
agencies and (ii) historical default and loss data, including 
rating agency information regarding default rates from 1983 
to 2016 and internal data dating to the early 1970s on 
severity of losses in the event of default. Adjustments may 
be made to this data, including (i) statistically calculated 
estimates to cover the historical fluctuation of the default 
rates over the credit cycle, the historical variability of loss 
severity among defaulted loans and the degree to which 
there are large obligor concentrations in the global portfolio 
and (ii) adjustments made for specifically known items, such 
as current environmental factors and credit trends.
In addition, representatives from both the risk 

management and finance staffs who cover business areas 
with delinquency-managed portfolios containing smaller 
balance homogeneous loans present their recommended 
reserve balances based upon leading credit indicators, 
including loan delinquencies and changes in portfolio size, 
as well as economic trends, including housing prices, 
unemployment and GDP. This methodology is applied 
separately for each individual product within each 
geographic region in which these portfolios exist.

This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates 

and judgments. The frequency of default, risk ratings, loss 
recovery rates, the size and diversity of individual large 
credits and the ability of borrowers with foreign currency 
obligations to obtain the foreign currency necessary for 
orderly debt servicing, among other things, are all taken into 
account during this review. Changes in these estimates could 
have a direct impact on Citi’s credit costs and the allowance 
in any period. 

For a further description of the loan loss reserve and 
related accounts, see Notes 1 and 15 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
Goodwill
Citi tests goodwill for impairment annually on July 1 (the 
annual test) and between annual tests (the interim test) if an 
event occurs or circumstances change that would more-
likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit 
below its carrying amount, such as a significant adverse 
change in the business climate, a decision to sell or dispose 
of all or a significant portion of a reporting unit or a 
significant decline in Citi’s stock price. During 2017, annual 
and interim tests were performed, which resulted in no 
goodwill impairment as described in Note 16 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 

As of December 31, 2017, Citigroup’s activities are 

conducted through the Global Consumer Banking and 
Institutional Clients Group business segments and 
Corporate/Other. Goodwill impairment testing is performed 
at the level below the business segment (referred to as a 
reporting unit). Goodwill is recorded in a business 
combination under the acquisition method of accounting 
when the acquisition price is higher than the fair value of net 
assets, including identifiable intangible assets. At the time a 
business is acquired, goodwill is allocated to Citi’s 
applicable reporting units based on relative fair value. Once 
goodwill has been allocated to the reporting units, it 
generally no longer retains its identification with a particular 
acquisition, but instead becomes identified with the reporting 
unit as a whole. As a result, all of the fair value of each 
reporting unit is available to support the allocated goodwill. 
If any significant business reorganization occurs, Citi may 
reallocate the goodwill.

Consistent with prior years, Citi utilizes allocated equity 

as a proxy for the carrying value of its reporting units for 
purposes of goodwill impairment testing. The allocated 
equity in the reporting units is determined based on the 
capital the business would require if it were operating as a 
standalone entity, incorporating sufficient capital to be in 
compliance with regulatory capital requirements, including 
capital for specifically identified goodwill and intangible 
assets. The capital allocated to the businesses is incorporated 
into the annual budget process, which is approved by Citi’s 
Board of Directors. 

 Goodwill impairment testing involves management 

judgment, requiring an assessment of whether the carrying 
value of the reporting unit can be supported by the fair value 
of the reporting unit using widely accepted valuation 
techniques, such as the market approach (earnings multiples 
and/or transaction multiples) and/or the income approach 
(discounted cash flow (DCF) method). In applying these 
methodologies, Citi utilizes a number of factors, including 
actual operating results, future business plans, economic 
projections and market data.

 Similar to 2016, Citigroup engaged an independent 

valuation specialist in 2017 to assist in Citi’s valuation for 
most of the reporting units employing both the market 
approach and the DCF method. For reporting units in which 
both methods were utilized in 2017, the resulting fair values 

were relatively consistent and appropriate weighting was 
given to outputs from both methods.

The DCF method utilized at the time of each 

impairment test used discount rates that Citi believes 
adequately reflected the risk and uncertainty in the financial 
markets in the internally generated cash flow projections. 
The DCF method employs a capital asset pricing model in 
estimating the discount rate. 

Since none of the Company’s reporting units are 

publicly traded, individual reporting unit fair-value 
determinations cannot be directly correlated to Citigroup’s 
common stock price. The sum of the fair values of the 
reporting units exceeded the overall market capitalization of 
Citi as of July 1, 2017. However, Citi believes that it is not 
meaningful to reconcile the sum of the fair values of the 
Company’s reporting units to its market capitalization due to 
several factors. The market capitalization of Citigroup 
reflects the execution risk in a transaction involving 
Citigroup due to its size. However, the individual reporting 
units’ fair values are not subject to the same level of 
execution risk nor a business model that is perceived to be as 
complex. In addition, the market capitalization of Citigroup 
does not include consideration of the individual reporting 
unit’s control premium.

See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements 

for additional information on goodwill, including the 
changes in the goodwill balance year-over-year and the 
reporting unit goodwill balances as of December 31, 2017.

Income Taxes

Overview
Citi is subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states 
and local municipalities and the non-U.S. jurisdictions in 
which Citi operates. These tax laws are complex and are 
subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the 
relevant governmental taxing authorities. Disputes over 
interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review and 
adjudication by the court systems of the various tax 
jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon 
audit.

In establishing a provision for income tax expense, Citi 

must make judgments and interpretations about the 
application of these inherently complex tax laws. Citi must 
also make estimates about when in the future certain items 
will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions, 
both domestic and foreign. Deferred taxes are recorded for 
the future consequences of events that have been recognized 
in the financial statements or tax returns, based upon enacted 
tax laws and rates. Deferred tax assets (DTAs) are 
recognized subject to management’s judgment that 
realization is more-likely-than-not.

On December 22, 2017, the President signed the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform), reflecting many of the 
anticipated changes to U.S. corporate taxation, including a 
lower statutory tax rate of 21%, a quasi-territorial regime 
and a deemed repatriation of all accumulated earnings and 
profits of foreign subsidiaries. The new law was generally 
effective January 1, 2018. 

122

Citi recorded a charge to continuing operations of $22.6 

billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, composed of a $12.4 
billion remeasurement due to the reduction to the U.S. 
corporate tax rate and a change to a quasi- territorial tax 
system, a $7.9 billion valuation allowance against Citi’s  
FTC carry-forwards and its U.S. residual DTAs related to its 
non-U.S. branches, and a $2.3 billion reduction in Citi’s FTC 
carry-forwards related to the deemed repatriation of 
undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. Quasi-
territorial refers to the continued U.S. taxation of non-U.S. 
branches, with a separate FTC basket for branches, and the 
application of Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) 
provisions to intangible income (e.g., services income) of 
non-U.S. subsidiaries. The valuation allowance against FTCs 
results from the impact of the lower tax rate and the new 
separate FTC basket for non-U.S. branches, as well as 
diminished ability under Tax Reform to generate income 
from sources outside the U.S. to support FTC utilization. 
Some of the components of the charge are provisional 
amounts as defined in SAB 118 and therefore will be revised 
in 2018. For additional information, see Note 1 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Citi has an overall domestic loss (ODL) of 

approximately $52 billion. An ODL allows a company to 
recharacterize domestic income as income from sources 
outside the U.S., which enables a taxpayer to use FTC carry-
forwards and FTCs generated in future years, assuming the 
generation of sufficient U.S. taxed income. The change in 
Tax Reform to allow a taxpayer to elect to recharacterize up 
to 100% of its domestic source income as non-U.S. source 
income (up from 50%) is not expected to materially impact 
the valuation allowance. 

Beginning in 2018, Citi will be taxed on income 

generated by its U.S. operations at a federal tax rate of 21%. 
The effect on its state tax rate is dependent upon how and 
when the individual states choose to or automatically adopt 
the various new provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue 
Code.

Citi’s non-U.S. branches and subsidiaries will be subject 

to tax at their local tax rates. While non-U.S. branches 
continue to be subject to U.S. taxation, Citi expects no 
material residual U.S. tax on such earnings since its overall 
non-U.S. branch tax rate is in excess of 21%. With respect to 
non-U.S. subsidiaries, dividends from these subsidiaries will 
be excluded from U.S. taxation. While Citi expects that the 
majority of its non-U.S. subsidiary earnings may be 
classified as GILTI, it similarly expects no material residual 
U.S. tax on such earnings based on its non-U.S. subsidiaries’ 
local tax rates, which exceed, on average, the GILTI tax rate. 
Although Citi is still in the process of analyzing the 
provisions of Tax Reform associated with GILTI, it does not 
expect a material change in impact. Finally, Citi does not 
expect the BEAT (Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax) to affect its 
tax provision. 

Citi expects that its effective tax rate will be roughly 

25% in 2018 with the possibility of lower effective tax rates 
in subsequent years.

DTAs
At December 31, 2017, Citi had net DTAs of $22.5 billion. 
In the fourth quarter of 2017, Citi’s DTAs decreased by 
$23.0 billion, driven primarily by the remeasurement related 
to Tax Reform and by earnings, partially offset by an 
increase in AOCI. On a full-year basis, Citi’s DTAs 
decreased $24.2 billion from $46.7 billion at December 31, 
2016. The decrease in total DTAs year-over-year was 
primarily due to Tax Reform and earnings, partially offset by 
an increase in AOCI.

Citi expects that the absolute amount of its $5.7 billion 
valuation allowance against FTC carry-forwards may grow 
in future years as it generates additional FTCs relating to its 
non-U.S. branches due to their higher overall local tax rate 
reduced by the statutory expiration of FTC carry-forwards. 
With respect to the portion of the valuation allowance 
established on its FTC carry-forwards that are available for 
use in the general basket, changes in the amount of earnings 
from sources outside the U.S. could alter the amount of 
valuation allowance that is eventually needed against such 
FTCs.

FTCs comprised approximately $7.6 billion of Citi’s 

DTAs as of December 31, 2017, compared to approximately 
$14.2 billion as of December 31, 2016. The decrease in 
FTCs year-over-year was primarily due to the use of FTCs 
against the deemed repatriation under Tax Reform, the 
valuation allowance established as a result of the reduced 
future corporate tax rate and the change to a quasi-territorial 
tax system. This represented $6.6 billion of the $24.2 billion 
decrease in Citi’s overall DTAs noted above. The FTC carry-
forward periods represent the most time-sensitive component 
of Citi’s DTAs. 

Citi believes the U.S. federal and New York state and 

city net operating loss carry-forward period of 20 years 
provides enough time to fully utilize the net DTAs pertaining 
to the existing net operating loss carry-forwards. This is due 
to Citi’s forecast of sufficient U.S. taxable income and the 
continued taxation of Citi’s non-U.S. income by New York 
state and city. Although realization is not assured, Citi 
believes that the realization of the recognized net DTAs of 
$22.5 billion at December 31, 2017 is more-likely-than-not, 
based upon management’s expectations as to future taxable 
income in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise as well 
as available tax planning strategies (as defined in ASC Topic 
740, Income Taxes) that would be implemented, if necessary, 
to prevent a carry-forward from expiring. Citi has concluded 
that it has the necessary positive evidence to support the 
realization of its net DTAs after taking its valuation 
allowances into consideration. 

For additional information on Citi’s income taxes, 

including its income tax provision, tax assets and liabilities, 
and a tabular summary of Citi’s net DTAs balance as of 
December 31, 2017 (including the FTCs and applicable 
expiration dates of the FTCs), see Note 9 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. For additional discussion of the 
potential impact to Citi’s DTAs that could arise from Tax 
Reform, see “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” above.

Litigation Accruals
See the discussion in Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements for information regarding Citi’s policies on 
establishing accruals for litigation and regulatory 
contingencies.

change in presentation will not have an impact on Income from 
continuing operations; however, this standard would have 
increased Citi’s efficiency ratio by approximately 57 bps for 
the year ended December 31, 2017. The impact for 2018 is 
expected to be consistent with 2017.

FUTURE APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING 
STANDARDS

Accounting for Financial Instruments—Credit Losses
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial 
Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326). The ASU introduces 
a new credit loss methodology, Current Expected Credit 
Losses (CECL), which requires earlier recognition of credit 
losses, while also providing additional transparency about 
credit risk.

The CECL methodology utilizes a lifetime “expected 
credit loss” measurement objective for the recognition of 
credit losses for loans, held-to-maturity securities and other 
receivables at the time the financial asset is originated or 
acquired. The expected credit losses are adjusted each period 
for changes in expected lifetime credit losses. This 
methodology replaces the multiple existing impairment 
methods in current GAAP, which generally require that a loss 
be incurred before it is recognized. For available-for-sale 
securities where fair value is less than cost, credit-related 
impairment, if any, will be recognized through an allowance 
for credit losses and adjusted each period for changes in credit 
risk. 

The CECL methodology represents a significant change 

from existing GAAP and may result in material changes to the 
Company’s accounting for financial instruments. The 
Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-13 will have 
on its Consolidated Financial Statements and related 
disclosures. The impact of the ASU will depend upon the state 
of the economy and the nature of Citi’s portfolios at the date 
of adoption. Based on a preliminary analysis performed in 
2017 and the environment and portfolios at that time, the 
overall impact was estimated to be an approximate 10% to 
20% increase in credit reserves as of that time. Moreover, 
there are still some implementation questions that will need to 
be resolved that could affect the estimated impact. The ASU 
will be effective for Citi as of January 1, 2020. 

Revenue Recognition
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue 
from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to 
recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be 
entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to 
customers. The Company adopted the guidance as of January 
1, 2018 using full retrospective application for all periods 
presented. There is no material change in timing and amount 
of revenue recognized associated with the adoption.

 The new standard clarified the guidance related to 

reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent. 
The Company has identified transactions, including 
underwriting activity where Citi is deemed the principal, 
rather than the agent, which require a gross up of annual 
revenues and expenses of approximately $1.0 billion. This 

Lease Accounting
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases 
(Topic 842), which is intended to increase transparency and 
comparability of accounting for lease transactions. The ASU 
will require lessees to recognize leases on the balance sheet as 
lease assets and lease liabilities and will require both 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding key 
information about leasing arrangements. Lessor accounting is 
largely unchanged. The guidance is effective beginning 
January 1, 2019 with an option to early adopt. The Company 
does not plan to early adopt the ASU. The Company estimates 
that upon adoption, its Consolidated Balance Sheet will have 
an approximate $5 billion increase in assets and liabilities. 
Additionally, the Company estimates an approximate $200 
million increase in retained earnings due to the cumulative 
effect of recognizing previously deferred gains on sale/
leaseback transactions. 

Income Tax Impact of Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income 
Taxes—Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, 
which requires an entity to recognize the income tax 
consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than 
inventory when the transfer occurs. The ASU was effective 
January 1, 2018. The impact of this standard upon adoption is 
an increase of DTAs by approximately $0.2 billion, a decrease 
of retained earnings by approximately $0.2 billion and a 
decrease of prepaid tax assets by approximately $0.4 billion.  

Subsequent Measurement of Goodwill
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, 
Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the 
Test for Goodwill Impairment. The ASU simplifies the 
subsequent measurement of goodwill impairment by 
eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value 
of goodwill (i.e., the current Step 2 of the goodwill 
impairment test) to measure a goodwill impairment charge. 
Under the ASU, the impairment test is the comparison of the 
fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount (the 
current Step 1), with the impairment charge being the deficit 
in fair value but not exceeding the total amount of goodwill 
allocated to that reporting unit. The simplified one-step 
impairment test applies to all reporting units (including those 
with zero or negative carrying amounts).

The ASU will be effective for Citi as of January 1, 2020, 

with early adoption permitted. The impact of the ASU will 
depend upon the performance of the reporting units and the 
market conditions impacting the fair value of each reporting 
unit going forward.

124

Clarifying the Definition of a Business
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business 
Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a 
Business. The definition of a business directly and indirectly 
affects many areas of accounting (e.g., acquisitions, disposals, 
goodwill and consolidation). The ASU narrows the definition 
of a business by introducing a quantitative screen as the first 
step, such that if substantially all of the fair value of the gross 
assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or 
a group of similar identifiable assets, the set of transferred 
assets and activities is not a business. If the set is not scoped 
out from the quantitative screen, the entity then evaluates 
whether the set meets the requirement that a business include, 
at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together 
significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs.

The ASU was effective for public entities, including Citi, 
as of January 1, 2018 with prospective application. The impact 
of the ASU will depend upon the acquisition and disposal 
activities of Citi. If fewer transactions qualify as a business, 
there could be less initial recognition of goodwill, but also less 
goodwill allocated to disposals.

Changes in Accounting for Pension and Postretirement 
(Benefit) Expense
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, 
Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving 
the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net 
Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which changes the 
income statement presentation of net benefit expense and 
requires restating the Company’s financial statements for each 
of the earlier periods presented in Citi’s annual and interim 
financial statements. The change in presentation was effective 
for annual and interim periods starting January 1, 2018. The 
ASU requires that only the service cost component of net 
benefit expense be included in Compensation and benefits on 
the income statement.  The other components of net benefit 
expense will be required to be presented outside of 
Compensation and benefits and will be presented in Other 
operating expense.  Since both of these income statement line 
items are part of Operating expenses, total Operating expenses 
will not change, nor will there be any change in Net 
income. This change in presentation is not expected to have a 
material effect on Compensation and benefits and Other 
operating expenses and will be applied prospectively. The 
components of the net benefit expense are currently disclosed 
in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 The new standard also changes the components of net 

benefit expense that are eligible for capitalization when 
employee costs are capitalized in connection with various 
activities, such as internally developed software, construction-
in-progress, and loan origination costs. Prospectively from 
January 1, 2018, only the service cost component of net 
benefit expense may be capitalized.  Existing capitalized 
balances are not affected. This change in amounts eligible for 
capitalization is not expected to have a material effect on the 
Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and related 
disclosures.

Hedging
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Targeted 
Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which 
will better align an entity’s risk management activities and 
financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes 
to the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying 
hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results.  
The mandatory effective date for calendar year-end public 
companies is January 1, 2019, but the amendments may be 
early adopted in any interim or annual period after issuance. 
The targeted improvements in the ASU will allow Citi 
increased flexibility to structure hedges of fixed- and floating-
rate instruments and will allow a one-time transfer of certain 
pre-payable debt securities from HTM to AFS.  Application of 
the ASU is expected to better reflect the economics of Citi’s 
risk management activities and will also reduce the volatility 
associated with foreign currency hedging. The ASU requires 
the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument to be 
presented in the same income statement line as the hedged 
item and also requires expanded disclosures. Citi adopted this 
standard on January 1, 2018 and transferred approximately $4 
billion of HTM securities into AFS classification as permitted 
as a one-time transfer under the standard. The impact to 
opening retained earnings was immaterial.

See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a 

discussion of “Accounting Changes.”

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Citi’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to 
ensure that information required to be disclosed under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, 
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods 
specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, including without 
limitation that information required to be disclosed by Citi in 
its SEC filings is accumulated and communicated to 
management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) 
and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow for 
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Citi’s Disclosure Committee assists the CEO and CFO in 

their responsibilities to design, establish, maintain and 
evaluate the effectiveness of Citi’s disclosure controls and 
procedures. The Disclosure Committee is responsible for, 
among other things, the oversight, maintenance and 
implementation of the disclosure controls and procedures, 
subject to the supervision and oversight of the CEO and CFO.
Citi’s management, with the participation of its CEO and 
CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of Citigroup’s disclosure 
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of December 31, 2017 
and, based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have 
concluded that at that date, Citigroup’s disclosure controls and 
procedures were effective.

MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over 

financial reporting may not prevent or detect all 
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of 
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that 
controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies 
or procedures may deteriorate. In addition, given Citi’s large 
size, complex operations and global footprint, lapses or 
deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time.

Citi’s management assessed the effectiveness of 

Citigroup’s internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2017 based on the criteria set forth by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated 
Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management 
believes that, as of December 31, 2017, Citi’s internal control 
over financial reporting was effective. In addition, there were 
no changes in Citi’s internal control over financial reporting 
during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017 that 
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially 
affect, Citi’s internal control over financial reporting.

The effectiveness of Citi’s internal control over financial 

reporting as of December 31, 2017 has been audited by 
KPMG LLP, Citi’s independent registered public accounting 
firm, as stated in their report below, which expressed an 
unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Citi’s internal 
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017.

Citi’s management is responsible for establishing and 
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. 
Citi’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. 
generally accepted accounting principles. Citi’s internal 
control over financial reporting includes those policies and 
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that 
in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of Citi’s assets, (ii) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as 
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and 
that Citi’s receipts and expenditures are made only in 
accordance with authorizations of Citi’s management and 
directors and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use 
or disposition of Citi’s assets that could have a material effect 
on its financial statements.

127

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Certain statements in this Form 10-K, including but not 
limited to statements included within the Management’s 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations, are “forward-looking statements” within the 
meaning of the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition, Citigroup also may 
make forward-looking statements in its other documents filed 
or furnished with the SEC and its management may make 
forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, 
representatives of the media and others.

Generally, forward-looking statements are not based on 

historical facts, but instead represent Citigroup’s and its 
management’s beliefs regarding future events. Such statements 
may be identified by words such as believe, expect, anticipate, 
intend, estimate, may increase, may fluctuate, target, illustrate, 
and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as 
will, should, would and could.

Such statements are based on management’s current 

expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes 
in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial 
conditions may differ materially from those included in these 
statements due to a variety of factors, including, without 
limitation, (i) the precautionary statements included within 
each individual business’s discussion and analysis of its results 
of operations and (ii) the factors listed and described under 
“Risk Factors” above.

Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of 

Citigroup speak only as to the date they are made and Citi 
does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to 
reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after 
the date the forward-looking statements were made.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM—
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
Citigroup Inc.:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
We have audited Citigroup Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the 
“Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal 
Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all 
material respects, effective internal control over financial 
reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria 
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission.  

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of 

the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United 
States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheet of the 
Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related 
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, 
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in 
the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, and the 
related notes (collectively, the “consolidated financial 
statements”), and our report dated February 23, 2018 
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated 
financial statements.

Basis for Opinion 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining 
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its 
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over 
financial reporting, included in the accompanying 
management’s annual report on internal control over financial 
reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on 
our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the 
PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the 
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws 
and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards 

of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was 
maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal 
control over financial reporting included obtaining an 
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing 
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also 
included performing such other procedures as we considered 
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit 
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial 
Reporting 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a 
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding 
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of 
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s 
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies 
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records 
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded 
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made 
only in accordance with authorizations of management and 
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s 
assets that could have a material effect on the financial 
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over 
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future 
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the 
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may 
deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM—
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Citigroup Inc.:

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
of Citigroup Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of 
December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated 
statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in 
stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the years in the 
three-year period ended December 31, 2017, and the related 
notes (collectively, the “consolidated financial statements”). In 
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present 
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the 
Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results 
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the 
three-year period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity 
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of 

the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United 
States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over 
financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria 
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 23, 
2018 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of 
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility 
of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements 
based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm 
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent 
with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. 
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations 
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards 

of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements are free of 
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our 
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of 
material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, 
whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that 
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, 
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and 
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits 
also included evaluating the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as 
evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated 
financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for our opinion.

/s/ KPMG LLP

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1969.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING 
POLICIES 

Throughout these Notes, “Citigroup,” “Citi” and the 
“Company” refer to Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated 
subsidiaries.

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior 
periods’ financial statements and Notes to conform to the 
current period’s presentation.

Principles of Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts 
of Citigroup and its subsidiaries prepared in accordance with 
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The 
Company consolidates subsidiaries in which it holds, 
directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights or 
where it exercises control. Entities where the Company 
holds 20% to 50% of the voting rights and/or has the ability 
to exercise significant influence, other than investments of 
designated venture capital subsidiaries or investments 
accounted for at fair value under the fair value option, are 
accounted for under the equity method, and the pro rata 
share of their income (loss) is included in Other revenue. 
Income from investments in less-than-20%-owned 
companies is recognized when dividends are received. As 
discussed in more detail in Note 21 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, Citigroup also consolidates entities 
deemed to be variable interest entities when Citigroup is 
determined to be the primary beneficiary. Gains and losses 
on the disposition of branches, subsidiaries, affiliates, 
buildings and other investments are included in Other 
revenue.

Citibank
Citibank, N.A. (Citibank) is a commercial bank and wholly 
owned subsidiary of Citigroup. Citibank’s principal offerings 
include consumer finance, mortgage lending and retail 
banking (including commercial banking) products and 
services; investment banking, cash management and trade 
finance; and private banking products and services.

Variable Interest Entities
An entity is a variable interest entity (VIE) if it meets either 
of the criteria outlined in Accounting Standards Codification 
(ASC) Topic 810, Consolidation, which are (i) the entity has 
equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its 
activities without additional subordinated financial support 
from other parties, or (ii) the entity has equity investors that 
cannot make significant decisions about the entity’s 
operations or that do not absorb their proportionate share of 
the entity’s expected losses or expected returns.

The Company consolidates a VIE when it has both the 
power to direct the activities that most significantly impact 
the VIE’s economic performance and a right to receive 
benefits or the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that 
could be potentially significant to the VIE (that is, Citi is the 
primary beneficiary). In addition to variable interests held in 

consolidated VIEs, the Company has variable interests in 
other VIEs that are not consolidated because the Company is 
not the primary beneficiary.

All unconsolidated VIEs are monitored by the Company 

to assess whether any events have occurred to cause its 
primary beneficiary status to change. 

All entities not deemed to be VIEs with which the 

Company has involvement are evaluated for consolidation 
under other subtopics of ASC 810. See Note 21 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed 
information.

Foreign Currency Translation
Assets and liabilities of Citi’s foreign operations are 
translated from their respective functional currencies into 
U.S. dollars using period-end spot foreign exchange rates. 
The effects of those translation adjustments are reported in 
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a 
component of stockholders’ equity, net of any related hedge 
and tax effects, until realized upon sale or substantial 
liquidation of the foreign operation. Revenues and expenses 
of Citi’s foreign operations are translated monthly from their 
respective functional currencies into U.S. dollars at amounts 
that approximate weighted average exchange rates.

For transactions that are denominated in a currency 
other than the functional currency, including transactions 
denominated in the local currencies of foreign operations 
that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, the 
effects of changes in exchange rates are primarily included 
in Principal transactions, along with the related effects of 
any economic hedges. Instruments used to hedge foreign 
currency exposures include foreign currency forward, option 
and swap contracts and, in certain instances, designated 
issues of non-U.S. dollar debt. Foreign operations in 
countries with highly inflationary economies designate the 
U.S. dollar as their functional currency, with the effects of 
changes in exchange rates primarily included in Other 
revenue.

Investment Securities
Investments include fixed income and equity securities. 
Fixed income instruments include bonds, notes and 
redeemable preferred stocks, as well as certain loan-backed 
and structured securities that are subject to prepayment risk. 
Equity securities include common and nonredeemable 
preferred stock.

Investment securities are classified and accounted for as 

follows:
• 

• 

140

Fixed income securities classified as “held-to-maturity” 
are securities that the Company has both the ability and 
the intent to hold until maturity and are carried at 
amortized cost. Interest income on such securities is 
included in Interest revenue.
Fixed income securities and marketable equity securities 
classified as “available-for-sale” are carried at fair value 
with changes in fair value reported in Accumulated 
other comprehensive income (loss), a component of 

stockholders’ equity, net of applicable income taxes and 
hedges. Realized gains and losses on sales are included 
in income primarily on a specific identification cost 
basis. Interest and dividend income on such securities is 
included in Interest revenue.

•  Certain investments in non-marketable equity securities 
and certain investments that would otherwise have been 
accounted for using the equity method are carried at fair 
value, since the Company has elected to apply fair value 
accounting. Changes in fair value of such investments 
are recorded in earnings.

•  Certain non-marketable equity securities are carried at 

cost.

For investments in fixed income securities classified as 
held-to-maturity or available-for-sale, the accrual of interest 
income is suspended for investments that are in default or for 
which it is likely that future interest payments will not be 
made as scheduled. 

Investment securities are subject to evaluation for other-

than-temporary impairment as described in Note 13 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Company uses a number of valuation techniques for 

investments carried at fair value, which are described in 
Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Realized 
gains and losses on sales of investments are included in 
earnings.

Trading Account Assets and Liabilities
Trading account assets include debt and marketable equity 
securities, derivatives in a receivable position, residual 
interests in securitizations and physical commodities 
inventory. In addition, as described in Note 25 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, certain assets that 
Citigroup has elected to carry at fair value under the fair 
value option, such as loans and purchased guarantees, are 
also included in Trading account assets.

Trading account liabilities include securities sold, not 

yet purchased (short positions) and derivatives in a net 
payable position, as well as certain liabilities that Citigroup 
has elected to carry at fair value (as described in Note 25 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Other than physical commodities inventory, all trading 

account assets and liabilities are carried at fair value. 
Revenues generated from trading assets and trading 
liabilities are generally reported in Principal transactions 
and include realized gains and losses as well as unrealized 
gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of 
such instruments. Interest income on trading assets is 
recorded in Interest revenue reduced by interest expense on 
trading liabilities.

Physical commodities inventory is carried at the lower 
of cost or market with related losses reported in Principal 
transactions. Realized gains and losses on sales of 
commodities inventory are included in Principal 
transactions. Investments in unallocated precious metals 
accounts (gold, silver, platinum and palladium) are 
accounted for as hybrid instruments containing a debt host 
contract and an embedded non-financial derivative 

141

instrument indexed to the price of the relevant precious 
metal. The embedded derivative instrument is separated 
from the debt host contract and accounted for at fair value. 
The debt host contract is carried at fair value under the fair 
value option, as described in Note 25 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

Derivatives used for trading purposes include interest 

rate, currency, equity, credit and commodity swap 
agreements, options, caps and floors, warrants, and financial 
and commodity futures and forward contracts. Derivative 
asset and liability positions are presented net by counterparty 
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when a valid master 
netting agreement exists and the other conditions set out in 
ASC Topic 210-20, Balance Sheet—Offsetting, are met. See 
Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company uses a number of techniques to determine 

the fair value of trading assets and liabilities, which are 
described in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.

Securities Borrowed and Securities Loaned
Securities borrowing and lending transactions do not 
constitute a sale of the underlying securities for accounting 
purposes and are treated as collateralized financing 
transactions. Such transactions are recorded at the amount of 
proceeds advanced or received plus accrued interest. As 
described in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, the Company has elected to apply fair value 
accounting to a number of securities borrowing and lending 
transactions. Fees paid or received for all securities lending 
and borrowing transactions are recorded in Interest expense 
or Interest revenue at the contractually specified rate.

The Company monitors the fair value of securities 
borrowed or loaned on a daily basis and obtains or posts 
additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin 
protection.

As described in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial 

Statements, the Company uses a discounted cash flow 
technique to determine the fair value of securities lending 
and borrowing transactions.

Repurchase and Resale Agreements
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repos) and 
securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse 
repos) do not constitute a sale (or purchase) of the 
underlying securities for accounting purposes and are treated 
as collateralized financing transactions. As described in Note 
25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company 
has elected to apply fair value accounting to the majority of 
such transactions, with changes in fair value reported in 
earnings. Any transactions for which fair value accounting 
has not been elected are recorded at the amount of cash 
advanced or received plus accrued interest. Irrespective of 
whether the Company has elected fair value accounting, 
interest paid or received on all repo and reverse repo 
transactions is recorded in Interest expense or Interest 
revenue at the contractually specified rate.

Where the conditions of ASC 210-20-45-11, Balance 

Sheet—Offsetting: Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase 

Agreements, are met, repos and reverse repos are presented 
net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The Company’s policy is to take possession of securities 

purchased under reverse repurchase agreements. The 
Company monitors the fair value of securities subject to 
repurchase or resale on a daily basis and obtains or posts 
additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin 
protection.

As described in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial 

Statements, the Company uses a discounted cash flow 
technique to determine the fair value of repo and reverse 
repo transactions.

Loans
Loans are reported at their outstanding principal balances net 
of any unearned income and unamortized deferred fees and 
costs except that credit card receivable balances also include 
accrued interest and fees. Loan origination fees and certain 
direct origination costs are generally deferred and 
recognized as adjustments to income over the lives of the 
related loans.

As described in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial 

Statements, Citi has elected fair value accounting for certain 
loans. Such loans are carried at fair value with changes in 
fair value reported in earnings. Interest income on such loans 
is recorded in Interest revenue at the contractually specified 
rate.

Loans that are held-for-investment are classified as 

Loans, net of unearned income on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet, and the related cash flows are included within the 
cash flows from investing activities category in the 
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on the line Change in 
loans. However, when the initial intent for holding a loan 
has changed from held-for-investment to HFS, the loan is 
reclassified to held-for-sale, but the related cash flows 
continue to be reported in cash flows from investing 
activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on 
the line Proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans.

Consumer Loans
Consumer loans represent loans and leases managed 
primarily by the Global Consumer Banking (GCB) 
businesses and Corporate/Other.

Consumer Non-accrual and Re-aging Policies
As a general rule, interest accrual ceases for installment and 
real estate (both open- and closed-end) loans when payments 
are 90 days contractually past due. For credit cards and other 
unsecured revolving loans, however, Citi generally accrues 
interest until payments are 180 days past due. As a result of 
OCC guidance, home equity loans in regulated bank entities 
are classified as non-accrual if the related residential first 
mortgage is 90 days or more past due. Also as a result of 
OCC guidance, mortgage loans in regulated bank entities 
within 60 days of notification that the borrower has filed for 
bankruptcy, other than FHA-insured loans, are classified as 
non-accrual. Commercial market loans are placed on a cash 
(non-accrual) basis when it is determined, based on actual 
experience and a forward-looking assessment of the 

142

collectability of the loan in full, that the payment of interest 
or principal is doubtful or when interest or principal is 90 
days past due.

Loans that have been modified to grant a concession to 

a borrower in financial difficulty may not be accruing 
interest at the time of the modification. The policy for 
returning such modified loans to accrual status varies by 
product and/or region. In most cases, a minimum number of 
payments (ranging from one to six) is required, while in 
other cases the loan is never returned to accrual status. For 
regulated bank entities, such modified loans are returned to 
accrual status if a credit evaluation at the time of, or 
subsequent to, the modification indicates the borrower is 
able to meet the restructured terms, and the borrower is 
current and has demonstrated a reasonable period of 
sustained payment performance (minimum six months of 
consecutive payments).

For U.S. consumer loans, generally one of the 

conditions to qualify for modification is that a minimum 
number of payments (typically ranging from one to three) 
must be made. Upon modification, the loan is re-aged to 
current status. However, re-aging practices for certain open-
ended consumer loans, such as credit cards, are governed by 
Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) 
guidelines. For open-ended consumer loans subject to FFIEC 
guidelines, one of the conditions for the loan to be re-aged to 
current status is that at least three consecutive minimum 
monthly payments, or the equivalent amount, must be 
received. In addition, under FFIEC guidelines, the number of 
times that such a loan can be re-aged is subject to limitations 
(generally once in 12 months and twice in five years). 
Furthermore, Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loans may only be 
modified under those respective agencies’ guidelines, and 
payments are not always required in order to re-age a 
modified loan to current.

Consumer Charge-Off Policies
Citi’s charge-off policies follow the general guidelines 
below:
•  Unsecured installment loans are charged off at 120 days 

contractually past due.

•  Unsecured revolving loans and credit card loans are 

charged off at 180 days contractually past due.

•  Loans secured with non-real estate collateral are written 
down to the estimated value of the collateral, less costs 
to sell, at 120 days contractually past due.

•  Real estate-secured loans are written down to the 

estimated value of the property, less costs to sell, at 180 
days contractually past due.

•  Real estate-secured loans are charged off no later than 
180 days contractually past due if a decision has been 
made not to foreclose on the loans.

•  Unsecured loans in bankruptcy are charged off within 

60 days of notification of filing by the bankruptcy court 
or in accordance with Citi’s charge-off policy, 
whichever occurs earlier.

•  Real estate-secured loans in bankruptcy, other than 

FHA-insured loans, are written down to the estimated 
value of the property, less costs to sell, within 60 days of 
notification that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy or 
in accordance with Citi’s charge-off policy, whichever is 
earlier.

•  Commercial market loans are written down to the extent 

that principal is judged to be uncollectable.

Corporate Loans
Corporate loans represent loans and leases managed by 
Institutional Clients Group (ICG). Corporate loans are 
identified as impaired and placed on a cash (non-accrual) 
basis when it is determined, based on actual experience and 
a forward-looking assessment of the collectability of the loan 
in full, that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or 
when interest or principal is 90 days past due, except when 
the loan is well collateralized and in the process of 
collection. Any interest accrued on impaired corporate loans 
and leases is reversed at 90 days past due and charged 
against current earnings, and interest is thereafter included in 
earnings only to the extent actually received in cash. When 
there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of 
principal, all cash receipts are thereafter applied to reduce 
the recorded investment in the loan.

Impaired corporate loans and leases are written down to 

the extent that principal is deemed to be uncollectable. 
Impaired collateral-dependent loans and leases, where 
repayment is expected to be provided solely by the sale of 
the underlying collateral and there are no other available and 
reliable sources of repayment, are written down to the lower 
of cost or collateral value. Cash-basis loans are returned to 
accrual status when all contractual principal and interest 
amounts are reasonably assured of repayment and there is a 
sustained period of repayment performance in accordance 
with the contractual terms.

Loans Held-for-Sale
Corporate and consumer loans that have been identified for 
sale are classified as loans held-for-sale and included in 
Other assets. The practice of Citi’s U.S. prime mortgage 
business has been to sell substantially all of its conforming 
loans. As such, U.S. prime mortgage conforming loans are 
classified as held-for-sale and the fair value option is elected 
at origination, with changes in fair value recorded in Other 
revenue. With the exception of those loans for which the fair 
value option has been elected, held-for-sale loans are 
accounted for at the lower of cost or market value, with any 
write-downs or subsequent recoveries charged to Other 
revenue. The related cash flows are classified in the 
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in the cash flows 
from operating activities category on the line Change in 
loans held-for-sale.

143

Allowance for Loan Losses
Allowance for loan losses represents management’s best 
estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio, 
including probable losses related to large individually 
evaluated impaired loans and troubled debt restructurings. 
Attribution of the allowance is made for analytical purposes 
only, and the entire allowance is available to absorb probable 
loan losses inherent in the overall portfolio. Additions to the 
allowance are made through the Provision for loan losses. 
Loan losses are deducted from the allowance and subsequent 
recoveries are added. Assets received in exchange for loan 
claims in a restructuring are initially recorded at fair value, 
with any gain or loss reflected as a recovery or charge-off to 
the provision.

Consumer Loans
For consumer loans, each portfolio of non-modified smaller-
balance homogeneous loans is independently evaluated for 
impairment by product type (e.g., residential mortgage, 
credit card, etc.) in accordance with ASC 450, 
Contingencies. The allowance for loan losses attributed to 
these loans is established via a process that estimates the 
probable losses inherent in the specific portfolio. This 
process includes migration analysis, in which historical 
delinquency and credit loss experience is applied to the 
current aging of the portfolio, together with analyses that 
reflect current and anticipated economic conditions, 
including changes in housing prices and unemployment 
trends. Citi’s allowance for loan losses under ASC 450 only 
considers contractual principal amounts due, except for 
credit card loans, where estimated loss amounts related to 
accrued interest receivable are also included.

Management also considers overall portfolio indicators, 
including historical credit losses, delinquent, non-performing 
and classified loans, trends in volumes and terms of loans, an 
evaluation of overall credit quality, the credit process, 
including lending policies and procedures, and economic, 
geographical, product and other environmental factors.
Separate valuation allowances are determined for 

impaired smaller-balance homogeneous loans whose terms 
have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). 
Long-term modification programs, and short-term (less than 
12 months) modifications that provide concessions (such as 
interest rate reductions) to borrowers in financial difficulty, 
are reported as TDRs. In addition, loan modifications that 
involve a trial period are reported as TDRs at the start of the 
trial period. The allowance for loan losses for TDRs is 
determined in accordance with ASC 310-10-35, Receivables
—Subsequent Measurement, considering all available 
evidence, including, as appropriate, the present value of the 
expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original 
contractual effective rate, the secondary market value of the 
loan and the fair value of collateral less disposal costs. These 
expected cash flows incorporate modification program 
default rate assumptions. The original contractual effective 
rate for credit card loans is the pre-modification rate, which 
may include interest rate increases under the original 
contractual agreement with the borrower.

Valuation allowances for commercial market loans, 

which are classifiably managed consumer loans, are 
determined in the same manner as for corporate loans and 
are described in more detail in the following section. 
Generally, an asset-specific component is calculated under 
ASC 310-10-35 on an individual basis for larger-balance, 
non-homogeneous loans that are considered impaired, and 
the allowance for the remainder of the classifiably managed 
consumer loan portfolio is calculated under ASC 450 using a 
statistical methodology that may be supplemented by 
management adjustment.

Corporate Loans
In the corporate portfolios, the Allowance for loan losses 
includes an asset-specific component and a statistically 
based component. The asset-specific component is 
calculated under ASC 310-10-35 for larger-balance, non-
homogeneous loans that are considered impaired. An asset-
specific allowance is established when the discounted cash 
flows, collateral value (less disposal costs) or observable 
market price of the impaired loan are lower than its carrying 
value. This allowance considers the borrower’s overall 
financial condition, resources and payment record, the 
prospects for support from any financially responsible 
guarantors (discussed further below) and, if appropriate, the 
realizable value of any collateral. The asset-specific 
component of the allowance for smaller-balance impaired 
loans is calculated on a pool basis considering historical loss 
experience.

The allowance for the remainder of the loan portfolio is 
determined under ASC 450 using a statistical methodology, 
supplemented by management judgment. The statistical 
analysis considers the portfolio’s size, remaining tenor and 
credit quality as measured by internal risk ratings assigned to 
individual credit facilities, which reflect probability of 
default and loss given default. The statistical analysis 
considers historical default rates and historical loss severity 
in the event of default, including historical average levels 
and historical variability. The result is an estimated range for 
inherent losses. The best estimate within the range is then 
determined by management’s quantitative and qualitative 
assessment of current conditions, including general 
economic conditions, specific industry and geographic 
trends and internal factors including portfolio 
concentrations, trends in internal credit quality indicators 
and current and past underwriting standards.

For both the asset-specific and the statistically based 

components of the Allowance for loan losses, management 
may incorporate guarantor support. The financial 
wherewithal of the guarantor is evaluated, as applicable, 
based on net worth, cash flow statements and personal or 
company financial statements, which are updated and 
reviewed at least annually. Citi seeks performance on 
guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business. 
Seeking performance entails obtaining satisfactory 
cooperation from the guarantor or borrower in the specific 
situation. This regular cooperation is indicative of pursuit 
and successful enforcement of the guarantee; the exposure is 
reduced without the expense and burden of pursuing a legal 

remedy. A guarantor’s reputation and willingness to work 
with Citigroup is evaluated based on the historical 
experience with the guarantor and the knowledge of the 
marketplace. In the rare event that the guarantor is unwilling 
or unable to perform or facilitate borrower cooperation, Citi 
pursues a legal remedy; however, enforcing a guarantee via 
legal action against the guarantor is not the primary means of 
resolving a troubled loan situation and rarely occurs. If Citi 
does not pursue a legal remedy, it is because Citi does not 
believe that the guarantor has the financial wherewithal to 
perform regardless of legal action or because there are legal 
limitations on simultaneously pursuing guarantors and 
foreclosure. A guarantor’s reputation does not impact Citi’s 
decision or ability to seek performance under the guarantee.
In cases where a guarantee is a factor in the assessment 

of loan losses, it is included via adjustment to the loan’s 
internal risk rating, which in turn is the basis for the 
adjustment to the statistically based component of the 
Allowance for loan losses. To date, it is only in rare 
circumstances that an impaired commercial loan or 
commercial real estate loan is carried at a value in excess of 
the appraised value due to a guarantee.

When Citi’s monitoring of the loan indicates that the 

guarantor’s wherewithal to pay is uncertain or has 
deteriorated, there is either no change in the risk rating, 
because the guarantor’s credit support was never initially 
factored in, or the risk rating is adjusted to reflect that 
uncertainty or deterioration. Accordingly, a guarantor’s 
ultimate failure to perform or a lack of legal enforcement of 
the guarantee does not materially impact the allowance for 
loan losses, as there is typically no further significant 
adjustment of the loan’s risk rating at that time. Where Citi is 
not seeking performance under the guarantee contract, it 
provides for loan losses as if the loans were non-performing 
and not guaranteed.

Reserve Estimates and Policies
Management provides reserves for an estimate of probable 
losses inherent in the funded loan portfolio on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet in the form of an allowance for 
loan losses. These reserves are established in accordance 
with Citigroup’s credit reserve policies, as approved by the 
Audit Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors. Citi’s 
Chief Risk Officer and Chief Financial Officer review the 
adequacy of the credit loss reserves each quarter with 
representatives from the risk management and finance staffs 
for each applicable business area. Applicable business areas 
include those having classifiably managed portfolios, where 
internal credit-risk ratings are assigned (primarily ICG and 
GCB) or modified consumer loans, where concessions were 
granted due to the borrowers’ financial difficulties.

The above-mentioned representatives for these business 
areas present recommended reserve balances for their funded 
and unfunded lending portfolios along with supporting 
quantitative and qualitative data discussed below:

144

Estimated probable losses for non-performing, non-
homogeneous exposures within a business line’s classifiably 
managed portfolio and impaired smaller-balance 
homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified due to 
the borrowers’ financial difficulties, where it was determined 
that a concession was granted to the borrower. 
Consideration may be given to the following, as appropriate, 
when determining this estimate: (i) the present value of 
expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original 
effective rate, (ii) the borrower’s overall financial condition, 
resources and payment record and (iii) the prospects for 
support from financially responsible guarantors or the 
realizable value of any collateral. In the determination of the 
allowance for loan losses for TDRs, management considers a 
combination of historical re-default rates, the current 
economic environment and the nature of the modification 
program when forecasting expected cash flows. When 
impairment is measured based on the present value of 
expected future cash flows, the entire change in present 
value is recorded in Provision for loan losses.

Statistically calculated losses inherent in the classifiably 
managed portfolio for performing and de minimis non-
performing exposures. The calculation is based on (i) Citi’s 
internal system of credit-risk ratings, which are analogous to 
the risk ratings of the major rating agencies, and (ii) 
historical default and loss data, including rating agency 
information regarding default rates from 1983 to 2016 and 
internal data dating to the early 1970s on severity of losses 
in the event of default. Adjustments may be made to this 
data. Such adjustments include (i) statistically calculated 
estimates to cover the historical fluctuation of the default 
rates over the credit cycle, the historical variability of loss 
severity among defaulted loans and the degree to which 
there are large obligor concentrations in the global portfolio, 
and (ii) adjustments made for specific known items, such as 
current environmental factors and credit trends.

In addition, representatives from each of the risk 

management and finance staffs that cover business areas 
with delinquency-managed portfolios containing smaller-
balance homogeneous loans present their recommended 
reserve balances based on leading credit indicators, 
including loan delinquencies and changes in portfolio size as 
well as economic trends, including current and future 
housing prices, unemployment, length of time in foreclosure, 
costs to sell and GDP. This methodology is applied 
separately for each individual product within each 
geographic region in which these portfolios exist.

This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates 

and judgments. The frequency of default, risk ratings, loss 
recovery rates, the size and diversity of individual large 
credits and the ability of borrowers with foreign currency 
obligations to obtain the foreign currency necessary for 
orderly debt servicing, among other things, are all taken into 
account during this review. Changes in these estimates could 
have a direct impact on the credit costs in any period and 
could result in a change in the allowance.

Allowance for Unfunded Lending Commitments
A similar approach to the allowance for loan losses is used 
for calculating a reserve for the expected losses related to 
unfunded lending commitments and standby letters of credit. 
This reserve is classified on the balance sheet in Other 
liabilities. Changes to the allowance for unfunded lending 
commitments are recorded in Provision for unfunded lending 
commitments.

Mortgage Servicing Rights
Mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) are recognized as 
intangible assets when purchased or when the Company sells 
or securitizes loans acquired through purchase or origination 
and retains the right to service the loans. Mortgage servicing 
rights are accounted for at fair value, with changes in value 
recorded in Other revenue in the Company’s Consolidated 
Statement of Income.

For additional information on the Company’s MSRs, see 

Notes 16 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the 
fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a 
business combination. Goodwill is subject to annual 
impairment testing and between annual tests if an event 
occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-
not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its 
carrying amount. 

Under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and 
Other, the Company has an option to assess qualitative 
factors to determine if it is necessary to perform the goodwill 
impairment test. If, after assessing the totality of events or 
circumstances, the Company determines that it is not more-
likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less 
than its carrying amount, no further testing is necessary. If, 
however, the Company determines that it is more-likely-
than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its 
carrying amount, then the Company must perform the first 
step of the two-step goodwill impairment test. 
 
The Company has an unconditional option to bypass the 
qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any reporting 
period and proceed directly to the first step of the goodwill 
impairment test. 

The first step requires a comparison of the fair value of 
the individual reporting unit to its carrying value, including 
goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of 
the carrying value, the related goodwill is considered not 
impaired and no further analysis is necessary. If the carrying 
value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, this is an 
indication of potential impairment and the second step of 
testing is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if 
any, for that reporting unit.

If required, the second step involves calculating the 

implied fair value of goodwill for each of the affected 
reporting units. The implied fair value of goodwill is 
determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill 
recognized in a business combination, which is the excess of 
the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one 
over the fair value of the net assets and identifiable 

145

intangibles as if the reporting unit were being acquired. If 
the amount of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 
exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill in the pro 
forma purchase price allocation, an impairment charge is 
recorded for the excess. A recognized impairment charge 
cannot exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to a 
reporting unit and cannot subsequently be reversed even if 
the fair value of the reporting unit recovers.

Upon any business disposition, goodwill is allocated to, 

and derecognized with the disposed business based on the 
ratio of the fair value of the disposed business to the fair 
value of the reporting unit.

Additional information on Citi’s goodwill impairment 

testing can be found in Note 16 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

Intangible Assets
Intangible assets, including core deposit intangibles, present 
value of future profits, purchased credit card relationships, 
credit card contract related intangibles, other customer 
relationships and other intangible assets, but excluding 
MSRs, are amortized over their estimated useful lives. 
Intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite useful 
lives, primarily trade names, are not amortized and are 
subject to annual impairment tests. An impairment exists if 
the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset 
exceeds its fair value. For other intangible assets subject to 
amortization, an impairment is recognized if the carrying 
amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the 
intangible asset.

Other Assets and Other Liabilities
Other assets include, among other items, loans held-for-sale, 
deferred tax assets, equity method investments, interest and 
fees receivable, premises and equipment (including 
purchased and developed software), repossessed assets and 
other receivables. Other liabilities include, among other 
items, accrued expenses and other payables, deferred tax 
liabilities and reserves for legal claims, taxes, unfunded 
lending commitments, repositioning reserves and other 
matters.

Other Real Estate Owned and Repossessed Assets
Real estate or other assets received through foreclosure or 
repossession are generally reported in Other assets, net of a 
valuation allowance for selling costs and subsequent 
declines in fair value.

Securitizations
There are two key accounting determinations that must be 
made relating to securitizations. Citi first makes a 
determination as to whether the securitization entity must be 
consolidated. Second, it determines whether the transfer of 
financial assets to the entity is considered a sale under 
GAAP. If the securitization entity is a VIE, the Company 
consolidates the VIE if it is the primary beneficiary (as 
discussed in “Variable Interest Entities” above). For all other 
securitization entities determined not to be VIEs in which 
Citigroup participates, consolidation is based on which party 

146

has voting control of the entity, giving consideration to 
removal and liquidation rights in certain partnership 
structures. Only securitization entities controlled by 
Citigroup are consolidated.

Interests in the securitized and sold assets may be 

retained in the form of subordinated or senior interest-only 
strips, subordinated tranches, spread accounts and servicing 
rights. In credit card securitizations, the Company retains a 
seller’s interest in the credit card receivables transferred to 
the trusts, which is not in securitized form. In the case of 
consolidated securitization entities, including the credit card 
trusts, these retained interests are not reported on Citi’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The securitized loans remain on
the balance sheet. Substantially all of the consumer loans 
sold or securitized through non-consolidated trusts by 
Citigroup are U.S. prime residential mortgage loans. 
Retained interests in non-consolidated mortgage 
securitization trusts are classified as Trading account assets, 
except for MSRs, which are included in Mortgage servicing 
rights on Citigroup’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Debt
Short-term borrowings and Long-term debt are accounted for 
at amortized cost, except where the Company has elected to 
report the debt instruments, including certain structured 
notes at fair value, or the debt is in a fair value hedging 
relationship.

Transfers of Financial Assets
For a transfer of financial assets to be considered a sale (i) 
the assets must be legally isolated from the Company, even 
in bankruptcy or other receivership, (ii) the purchaser must 
have the right to pledge or sell the assets transferred or, if the 
purchaser is an entity whose sole purpose is to engage in 
securitization and asset-backed financing activities through 
the issuance of beneficial interests and that entity is 
constrained from pledging the assets it receives, each 
beneficial interest holder must have the right to sell or 
pledge their beneficial interests and (iii) the Company may 
not have an option or obligation to reacquire the assets.

If these sale requirements are met, the assets are 

removed from the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
If the conditions for sale are not met, the transfer is 
considered to be a secured borrowing, the assets remain on 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the sale proceeds are 
recognized as the Company’s liability. A legal opinion on a 
sale generally is obtained for complex transactions or where 
the Company has continuing involvement with assets 
transferred or with the securitization entity. For a transfer to 
be eligible for sale accounting, those opinions must state that 
the asset transfer would be considered a sale and that the 
assets transferred would not be consolidated with the 
Company’s other assets in the event of the Company’s 
insolvency.

For a transfer of a portion of a financial asset to be 
considered a sale, the portion transferred must meet the 
definition of a participating interest. A participating interest 
must represent a pro rata ownership in an entire financial 
asset; all cash flows must be divided proportionately, with 

the same priority of payment; no participating interest in the 
transferred asset may be subordinated to the interest of 
another participating interest holder; and no party may have 
the right to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset 
unless all participating interest holders agree. Otherwise, the 
transfer is accounted for as a secured borrowing.

See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements 

for further discussion.

Risk Management Activities—Derivatives Used for 
Hedging Purposes
The Company manages its exposures to market movements 
outside of its trading activities by modifying the asset and 
liability mix, either directly or through the use of derivative 
financial products, including interest-rate swaps, futures, 
forwards and purchased options, as well as foreign-exchange 
contracts. These end-user derivatives are carried at fair value 
in Other assets, Other liabilities, Trading account assets and 
Trading account liabilities.

 See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements 

for a further discussion of the Company’s hedging and 
derivative activities.

Employee Benefits Expense
Employee benefits expense includes current service costs of 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans (which are 
accrued on a current basis), contributions and unrestricted 
awards under other employee plans, the amortization of 
restricted stock awards and costs of other employee benefits. 
For its most significant pension and postretirement benefit 
plans (Significant Plans), Citigroup measures and discloses 
plan obligations, plan assets and periodic plan expense 
quarterly, instead of annually. The effect of remeasuring the 
Significant Plan obligations and assets by updating plan 
actuarial assumptions on a quarterly basis is reflected in 
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and 
periodic plan expense. All other plans (All Other Plans) are 
remeasured annually. See Note 8 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

Stock-Based Compensation
The Company recognizes compensation expense related to 
stock and option awards over the requisite service period, 
generally based on the instruments’ grant-date fair value, 
reduced by actual forfeitures as they occur. Compensation 
cost related to awards granted to employees who meet 
certain age plus years-of-service requirements (retirement-
eligible employees) is accrued in the year prior to the grant 
date, in the same manner as the accrual for cash incentive 
compensation. Certain stock awards with performance 
conditions or certain clawback provisions are subject to 
variable accounting, pursuant to which the associated 
compensation expense fluctuates with changes in Citigroup’s 
common stock price. See Note 7 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

Income Taxes
The Company is subject to the income tax laws of the U.S. 
and its states and municipalities, as well as the non-U.S. 
jurisdictions in which it operates. These tax laws are 
complex and may be subject to different interpretations by 
the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing 
authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax 
expense, the Company must make judgments and 
interpretations about these tax laws. The Company must also 
make estimates about when in the future certain items will 
affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions, both 
domestic and foreign.

Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be 
subject to review and adjudication by the court systems of 
the various tax jurisdictions, or may be settled with the 
taxing authority upon examination or audit. The Company 
treats interest and penalties on income taxes as a component 
of Income tax expense.

Deferred taxes are recorded for the future consequences 
of events that have been recognized in financial statements 
or tax returns, based upon enacted tax laws and rates. 
Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s 
judgment about whether realization is more-likely-than-not. 
ASC 740, Income Taxes, sets out a consistent framework to 
determine the appropriate level of tax reserves to maintain 
for uncertain tax positions. This interpretation uses a two-
step approach wherein a tax benefit is recognized if a 
position is more-likely-than-not to be sustained. The amount 
of the benefit is then measured to be the highest tax benefit 
that is more than 50% likely to be realized. ASC 740 also 
sets out disclosure requirements to enhance transparency of 
an entity’s tax reserves.

On December 22, 2017, the SEC issued Staff 

Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118, which sets forth the 
accounting for the changes in tax law caused by the 
enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform). The 
Bulletin provides guidance as to how ASC 740 should be 
applied for the quarterly reporting period that includes the 
December 22, 2017 enactment date of Tax Reform. SAB 118 
covers three different fact patterns that can be applied to 
each aspect of Tax Reform. The first is where the accounting 
is complete as of December 31, 2017; in this case, a 
company must report the effects of Tax Reform in its 
financial statements that include the enactment date. The 
second situation is where a company cannot complete its 
accounting as of December 31, 2017, but can provide a 
reasonable estimate based upon the information available to 
it and its ability to prepare and analyze this information 
(including related computations). In the situation described, 
the company must include the reasonable estimate it so 
determined in its financial statements as a provisional 
amount that will then be trued up within the one-year 
measurement period after the date of enactment of Tax 
Reform. The third situation, in which no reasonable estimate 
can be made for an item, requires a company to apply ASC 
740 using the pre-Tax Reform tax law until the first 
reporting period in which it can make a reasonable estimate 
for the item.

To the extent that a company records a provisional 

amount in its financial statements, it must update its 
reporting during the one-year measurement period whenever 
the facts and circumstances existing at the enactment date 
are further analyzed. Any company providing provisional 
amounts must qualitatively disclose the income tax effects 
for which the accounting is incomplete, the reason it is 
incomplete and the additional information that is needed to 
complete the accounting. In addition, when the company 
revises or finalizes its provisional accounting for any item, it 
must disclose the nature and amount of any measurement 
period adjustments recognized in the reporting period, the 
impact of such adjustments on its effective tax rate and a 
confirmation when the accounting for such items is 
complete.

Citi recorded a charge to continuing operations of $22.6 

billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, composed of a $12.4 
billion remeasurement due to the reduction to the U.S. 
corporate tax rate and a change to a quasi-territorial tax 
system, a $7.9 billion valuation allowance against Citi’s FTC 
carry-forwards and its U.S. residual DTAs related to its non-
U.S. branches, and a $2.3 billion reduction in Citi’s FTC 
carry-forwards related to the deemed repatriation of 
undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries.

Of the aforementioned amounts, the following are 

considered to be provisional for which certain aspects of 
Citi’s accounting is incomplete, as described below. First, of 
the $12.4 billion, $6.2 billion is provisional as Citi continues 
to analyze the aspects of the quasi-territorial tax regime, 
particularly as it affects the deferred taxes, including 
indefinite reinvestment assertions, for non-U.S. operations, 
as well as the interaction with U.S. tax rate reduction. Also 
included as provisional is Citi’s state income tax charge for 
Tax Reform due to the uncertainty of how states will 
interpret the new federal provisions. The remaining $6.2 
billion primarily relates to the reduction in the U.S. 
corporate tax rate and for which the accounting is complete. 
Second, Citi’s reported valuation allowance of $7.9 billion is 
a provisional amount, because there is uncertainty under Tax 
Reform as to the calculation of the deemed repatriation tax 
on non-U.S. subsidiary earnings, which itself is a provisional 
amount, and thus the amount of FTC carry-forwards that will 
be utilized to offset the resulting tax. In addition, such 
valuation allowance is also affected by uncertainty as to the 
methodology to be employed to allocate Citi’s FTC carry-
forwards and related overall domestic loss among the 
redefined FTC baskets under Tax Reform, as well as related 
calculations affecting the usage of its FTCs in future periods. 
Transitional guidance is expected from the U.S. Treasury on 
these issues. Citi also continues to analyze the effects on the 
amount of residual U.S. tax related to its non-U.S. branches.

In all other material respects, Citi has completed its 
accounting for Tax Reform, and there are no amounts for 
which a reasonable estimate was not possible.

Additionally, Citi has not yet made a policy election 

with respect to its treatment of GILTI. Companies can either 
account for taxes on GILTI as incurred, or recognize 
deferred taxes when basis differences exist that are expected 
to impact the amount of the GILTI inclusion upon reversal. 

Citi is still in the process of analyzing the provisions of Tax 
Reform associated with GILTI and the expected future 
impact. 

See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for 

a further description of the Company’s tax provision and 
related income tax assets and liabilities.

Commissions, Underwriting and Principal Transactions
Commissions revenues are recognized in income when 
earned. Underwriting revenues are recognized in income 
typically at the closing of the transaction. Principal 
transactions revenues are recognized in income on a trade-
date basis. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements for a description of the Company’s revenue 
recognition policies for commissions and fees, and Note 6 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements for details of 
principal transactions revenue.

Earnings per Share
Earnings per share (EPS) is computed after deducting 
preferred stock dividends. The Company has granted 
restricted and deferred share awards with dividend rights that 
are considered to be participating securities, which are akin 
to a second class of common stock. Accordingly, a portion of 
Citigroup’s earnings is allocated to those participating 
securities in the EPS calculation.

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing 

income available to common stockholders after the 
allocation of dividends and undistributed earnings to the 
participating securities by the weighted average number of 
common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings 
per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if 
securities or other contracts to issue common stock were 
exercised. It is computed after giving consideration to the 
weighted average dilutive effect of the Company’s stock 
options and warrants and convertible securities and after the 
allocation of earnings to the participating securities. Anti-
dilutive options and warrants are disregarded in the EPS 
calculations. 

Use of Estimates
Management must make estimates and assumptions that 
affect the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such 
estimates are used in connection with certain fair value 
measurements. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements for further discussions on estimates used in the 
determination of fair value. Moreover, estimates are 
significant in determining the amounts of other-than-
temporary impairments, impairments of goodwill and other 
intangible assets, provisions for probable losses that may 
arise from credit-related exposures and probable and 
estimable losses related to litigation and regulatory 
proceedings, and income taxes. While management makes 
its best judgment, actual amounts or results could differ from 
those estimates. 

148

Cash Flows
Cash equivalents are defined as those amounts included in 
Cash and due from banks. Cash flows from risk management 
activities are classified in the same category as the related 
assets and liabilities.

Related Party Transactions
The Company has related party transactions with certain of 
its subsidiaries and affiliates. These transactions, which are 
primarily short-term in nature, include cash accounts, 
collateralized financing transactions, margin accounts, 
derivative transactions, charges for operational support and 
the borrowing and lending of funds, and are entered into in 
the ordinary course of business.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated 
Other Comprehensive Income
On February 14, 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards 
Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2018-02, Reclassification of 
Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive 
Income. The ASU allows a reclassification from 
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) to 
Retained earnings for the deferred taxes previously recorded 
in AOCI that exceed the current federal tax rate of 21% 
resulting from the newly enacted corporate tax rate in the 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) and other stranded tax 
amounts related to the application of Tax Reform that Citi 
elects to reclassify. The ASU allows adjustments to 
reclassification amounts in subsequent periods as a result of 
changes to the amounts recorded under SAB 118. If adopted, 
the ASU is effective in years beginning after December 15, 
2018, but permits early adoption in a period for which 
financial statements have not yet been issued. Citi has 
elected to early adopt the ASU, which affects only the period 
that the effects related to Tax Reform are recognized. In 
addition to the reclassification of deferred taxes recorded in 
AOCI that exceed the current federal tax rate, Citi has also 
reclassified amounts recorded in AOCI related to the effects 
of the shift to a territorial system related to the application of 
Tax Reform using the portfolio method.

The effect of adopting the ASU resulted in an increase 
of $3.3 billion to Retained earnings at December 31, 2017 
due to the reclassification of AOCI to Retained earnings. 
This amount is provisional because more information needs 
to be obtained and analyzed related to Tax Reform as noted 
above and, thus, the amount to be reclassified 
may change in 2018.

Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt 
Securities
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-08, 
Receivables—Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs 
(Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased 
Callable Debt Securities, which amends the amortization 
period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a 
premium.  The ASU requires entities to amortize premiums 
on debt securities by the first call date when the securities 

have fixed and determinable call dates and prices. The scope 
of the ASU includes all accounting premiums, such as 
purchase premiums and cumulative fair value hedge 
adjustments.  The ASU does not change the accounting for 
discounts, which continue to be recognized over the 
contractual life of a security.

The ASU is effective as of January 1, 2019, but it may 

be early adopted in any interim or year-end period after 
issuance. Adoption of the ASU is on a modified retrospective 
basis through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained 
earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. Citi 
early adopted the ASU in the second quarter of 2017, with an 
effective date of January 1, 2017.  Adoption of the ASU 
primarily affected Citi’s available-for-sale (AFS) and held-
to-maturity (HTM) portfolios of callable state and municipal 
securities. The ASU adoption resulted in a net reduction to 
total stockholders’ equity of $156 million (after tax), 
effective as of January 1, 2017.  This amount is composed of 
a reduction of approximately $660 million to retained 
earnings for the incremental amortization of purchase 
premiums and cumulative hedge adjustments generated 
under fair value hedges of these callable debt securities, 
offset by an increase to AOCI of $504 million related to the 
cumulative fair value hedge adjustments reclassified to 
retained earnings for AFS securities.

Financial statements for periods prior to 2017 were not 
subject to restatement under the provisions of this ASU.  The 
amortization recorded in each of quarter of 2017 and 
cumulatively as of each quarter end under the provisions of 
the ASU was not materially different than the amount that 
would have been recorded if the ASU had not been early 
adopted.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, 
Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): 
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment 
Accounting in order to simplify certain complex aspects of 
the accounting for income taxes and forfeitures related to 
employee stock-based compensation. The guidance became 
effective for Citi beginning on January 1, 2017. Under the 
new standard, excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to 
employee stock-based compensation are recognized directly 
within Income tax expense or benefit in Citi’s Consolidated 
Statement of Income, rather than within Additional paid-in 
capital. The impact of this change was not material in the 
first quarter of 2017 or each subsequent quarterly periods of 
2017 as the majority of employees’ deferred stock-based 
compensation awards are granted within the first quarter of 
each year, and therefore vest within the first quarter of each 
year, commensurate with vesting in equal annual 
installments. For additional information on these receivables 
and payables, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. 

Additionally, as permitted under the new guidance, Citi 
made an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures 
of awards as they occur, which represents a change from the 
previous requirement to estimate forfeitures when 
recognizing compensation expense. This change resulted in a 

149

cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings that was 
not material at January 1, 2017. 

Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and 
Financial Liabilities
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, 
Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10): 
Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and 
Financial Liabilities, which addresses certain aspects of 
recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of 
financial instruments. 

This ASU requires entities to present separately in 

AOCI the portion of the total change in the fair value of a 
liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific 
credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the 
liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option 
for financial instruments. It also requires equity investments 
(except those accounted for under the equity method of 
accounting or those that result in consolidation of the 
investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair 
value recognized in net income, thus eliminating eligibility 
for the current available-for-sale category. However, Federal 
Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock, as well 
as certain exchange seats, will continue to be presented at 
cost. The ASU also introduces a measurement alternative for 
non-marketable equity securities.

Citi early adopted only the provisions of this ASU 

related to presentation of the change in fair value of 
liabilities for which the fair value option was elected, related 
to changes in Citigroup’s own credit spreads in AOCI 
effective January 1, 2016. Accordingly, since the first quarter 
of 2016, these amounts have been reflected as a component 
of AOCI, whereas these amounts were previously recognized 
in Citigroup’s revenues and net income. The impact of 
adopting this amendment resulted in a cumulative catch-up 
reclassification from retained earnings to AOCI of an 
accumulated after-tax loss of approximately $15 million at 
January 1, 2016. Financial statements for periods prior to 
2016 were not subject to restatement under the provisions of 
this ASU. For additional information, see Notes 19, 24 and 
25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Citi adopted 
the other provisions of ASU 2016-01 on January 1, 2018. 
The ASU does not have a significant impact on the 
Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and related 
disclosures.

2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT DISPOSALS

Sale of Fixed Income Analytics and Index Business
On August 31, 2017, Citi completed the sale of a fixed income 
analytics business (Yield Book) and a fixed income index 
business that were part of Markets and Securities Services 
within Institutional Clients Group (ICG). As part of the sale, 
Citi derecognized total assets of $112 million, including 
goodwill of $72 million, while the derecognized liabilities 
were $18 million. The transaction generated a pretax gain on 
sale of $580 million ($355 million after-tax) recorded in Other 
Revenue in ICG during 2017. 

Income before taxes for the divested businesses, 

excluding the pretax gain on sale, was as follows:

Exit of U.S. Mortgage Service Operations
Citigroup executed agreements during the first quarter of 2017 
to effectively exit its direct U.S. mortgage servicing operations 
by the end of 2018 to intensify focus on originations. The exit 
of the mortgage servicing operations included the sale of 
mortgage servicing rights and execution of a subservicing 
agreement for the remaining Citi-owned loans and certain 
other mortgage servicing rights. As part of this transaction, 
Citi has also transferred certain employees.

This transaction, which was part of Corporate/Other, 
resulted in a pretax loss of $331 million ($207 million after-
tax) recorded in Other revenue during 2017. The loss on sale 
did not include certain other costs and charges related to the 
disposed operation recorded primarily in Operating expenses 
during 2017, resulting in a total pretax loss of $382 million. As 
part of the completed sale, during 2017, Citi derecognized a 
total of $1,162 million of servicing-related assets, including 
$1,046 million of mortgage servicing rights, related to 
approximately 750,000 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac held 
loans with outstanding balances of approximately $93 billion. 
Excluding the loss on sale and the additional charges, income 
before taxes for the disposed operation was immaterial for 
2017, 2016 and 2015.

Summary of Discontinued Operations
The Company’s discontinued operations consisted of residual 
activities related to the sales of the Brazil Credicard business 
in 2013, the Egg Banking plc Credit Card Business in 2011 
and the German Retail Banking business in 2008. All 
discontinued operations results are recorded within Corporate/
Other.

Sale of Mexico Asset Management Business
On November 27, 2017, Citi entered into an agreement to sell 
its Mexico asset management business, which is part of Latin 
America GCB. The transaction is expected to result in a pretax 
gain on sale at closing, which is anticipated to occur during 
the second half of 2018, subject to regulatory approval and 
other customary closing conditions. The transaction will also 
result in derecognition of approximately $72 million of net 
book value, including $32 million of goodwill. Income before

On March 31, 2017, Citi completed the sale of CitiFinancial 
Canada (CitiFinancial), which was part of Corporate/Other, 
and included 220 retail branches and approximately 1,400 
employees. As part of the sale, Citi derecognized total assets 
of approximately $1.9 billion, including $1.7 billion consumer 
loans (net of allowance), and total liabilities of approximately 
$1.5 billion related to intercompany borrowings, which were 
settled at closing of the transaction. Separately, during 2017 
and prior to closing of the transaction, CitiFinancial settled 
$0.4 billion of debt issued through loan securitizations. The 
sale of CitiFinancial generated a pretax gain on sale of $350 
million recorded in Other revenue ($178 million after-tax) 
during 2017.

Effective January 1, 2016, Citi completed a novation (an
arrangement that extinguishes Citi’s rights and obligations
under a contract) of the Primerica 80% coinsurance
agreement, which was recorded in Corporate/Other, to a third-
party re-insurer. The novation resulted in revenues of $404 
million recorded in Other revenue ($263 million after-tax) 
during 2016. Furthermore, the novation resulted in 
derecognition of $1.5 billion of available-for-sale securities 
and cash, $0.95 billion of deferred acquisition costs and $2.7 
billion of insurance liabilities.

million customer accounts. OneMain had approximately $10.2 
billion of assets, including $7.8 billion of loans (net of 
allowance), and $1.4 billion of available-for-sale securities. 
OneMain also had $8.4 billion of liabilities, including $6.2 
billion of long-term debt and $1.1 billion of short-term 
borrowings. The transaction generated a pretax gain on sale of 
$2.6 billion, recorded in Other revenue ($1.6 billion after-tax) 
in 2015. However, when combined with the loss on 
redemption of certain long-term debt supporting certain 
Corporate/Other assets during the fourth quarter of 2015, the 
resulting net after-tax gain was $0.8 billion.

3. BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Citigroup’s activities are conducted through the following 
business segments: Global Consumer Banking (GCB) 
and Institutional Clients Group (ICG). In addition, Corporate/
Other includes activities not assigned to a specific business 
segment as well as certain North America and international 
loan portfolios, other legacy assets and discontinued 
operations.

The business segments are determined based on products 
and services provided or type of customers served, of which 
those identified as non-core are recorded in Corporate/Other 
and are reflective of how management currently evaluates 
financial information to make business decisions.

GCB includes a global, full-service consumer franchise 

delivering a wide array of banking, including commercial 
banking, credit card lending and investment services through a 
network of local branches, offices and electronic delivery 
systems and is composed of three GCB businesses: North 
America, Latin America and Asia (including consumer 
banking activities in certain EMEA countries).

ICG is composed of Banking and Markets and securities 

services and provides corporate, institutional, public sector 
and high-net-worth clients in 97 countries and jurisdictions 
with a broad range of banking and financial products and 
services.

Corporate/Other includes certain unallocated costs of 
global functions, other corporate expenses and net treasury 

results, unallocated corporate expenses, offsets to certain line-
item reclassifications and eliminations, the results of certain 
North America and international legacy loan portfolios, 
discontinued operations and unallocated taxes.

The accounting policies of these reportable segments are 

the same as those disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 

The prior-period balances reflect reclassifications to 

• 

conform the presentation for all periods to the current period’s 
presentation. Financial data was reclassified to reflect:
• 

the reporting of the remaining businesses and portfolios of 
assets of Citi Holdings as part of Corporate/Other (prior 
to the first quarter of 2017, Citi Holdings was a separately 
reported business segment); 
the re-attribution of certain treasury-related costs between 
Corporate/Other, GCB and ICG; 
the re-attribution of regional revenues within ICG; and
certain other immaterial reclassifications. 

• 
• 
Citi’s consolidated results remain unchanged for all periods 
presented as a result of the changes and reclassifications 
discussed above.

5.  COMMISSIONS AND FEES

The primary components of Citi’s Commissions and fees 
revenue are investment banking fees, trading-related fees, fees 
related to trade and securities services in ICG and credit card 
and bank card fees.

Investment banking fees are substantially composed of 

underwriting and advisory revenues and are recognized when 
Citigroup’s performance under the terms of a contractual 
arrangement is completed, which is typically at the closing of 
a transaction. Underwriting revenue is recorded in 
Commissions and fees, net of both reimbursable and non-
reimbursable expenses, consistent with the AICPA Accounting 
Guide for Brokers and Dealers in Securities (codified in ASC 
940-605-05-1). Expenses associated with advisory 
transactions are recorded in Other operating expenses, net of 
client reimbursements. Out-of-pocket expenses are deferred 
and recognized at the time the related revenue is recognized. 
In general, expenses incurred related to investment banking 
transactions that fail to close (are not consummated) are 
recorded gross in Other operating expenses.

Trading-related fees primarily include commissions and 
fees from the following: executing transactions for clients on 

exchanges and over-the-counter markets; sales of mutual 
funds and other annuity products; and assisting clients in 
clearing transactions, providing brokerage services and other 
such activities. Trading-related fees are recognized when 
earned in Commissions and fees. Gains or losses, if any, on 
these transactions are included in Principal transactions (see 
Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Credit card and bank card fees are primarily composed of 

interchange revenue and certain card fees, including annual 
fees, reduced by reward program costs and certain partner 
payments. Interchange revenue and fees are recognized when 
earned. Annual card fees are deferred and amortized on a 
straight-line basis over a 12-month period. Reward costs are 
recognized when points are earned by the customers. 

Insurance premiums consists of premium income from 
insurance policies which Citi has underwritten and sold to 
policyholders. Insurance distribution revenue consists of 
commissions earned from third party insurance companies for 
marketing and selling insurance policies on behalf of such 
entities.

Citi’s Principal transactions revenue consists of realized and 
unrealized gains and losses from trading activities. Trading 
activities include revenues from fixed income, equities, credit 
and commodities products and foreign exchange transactions 
that are managed on a portfolio basis characterized by primary 
risk. Not included in the table below is the impact of net 
interest revenue related to trading activities, which is an 
integral part of trading activities’ profitability. For additional

7.   INCENTIVE PLANS
 
Discretionary Annual Incentive Awards
Citigroup grants immediate cash bonus payments and various 
forms of immediate and deferred awards as part of its 
discretionary annual incentive award program involving a 
large segment of Citigroup’s employees worldwide. Most of 
the shares of common stock issued by Citigroup as part of its 
equity compensation programs are to settle the vesting of the 
stock components of these awards.  

Discretionary annual incentive awards are generally 

awarded in the first quarter of the year based upon the 
previous year’s performance. Awards valued at less than U.S. 
$100,000 (or the local currency equivalent) are generally paid 
entirely in the form of an immediate cash bonus. Pursuant to 
Citigroup policy and/or regulatory requirements, certain 
employees and officers are subject to mandatory deferrals of 
incentive pay and generally receive 25% to 60% of their 
awards in a combination of restricted or deferred stock, 
deferred cash stock units, or deferred cash. Discretionary 
annual incentive awards to many employees in the EU are 
subject to deferral requirements regardless of the total award 
value, with 50% of the immediate incentive delivered in the 
form of a stock payment or stock unit award subject to a 
restriction on sale or transfer or hold back (generally, for 
twelve months).  

Deferred annual incentive awards may be delivered in the 

form of one or more award types—a restricted or deferred 
stock award under Citi’s Capital Accumulation Program 
(CAP), or a deferred cash stock unit award and/or a deferred 
cash award under Citi’s Deferred Cash Award Plan. The 
applicable mix of awards may vary based on the employee’s 
minimum deferral requirement and the country of 
employment. 

Subject to certain exceptions (principally, for retirement-
eligible employees), continuous employment within Citigroup 
is required to vest in CAP, deferred cash stock unit and 
deferred cash awards. Post employment vesting by retirement-
eligible employees and participants who meet other conditions 
is generally conditioned upon their refraining from 
competition with Citigroup during the remaining vesting 
period, unless the employment relationship has been 
terminated by Citigroup under certain conditions.

Generally, the deferred awards vest in equal annual 

installments over three- or four-year periods. Vested CAP 
awards are delivered in shares of common stock. Deferred 
cash awards are payable in cash and, except as prohibited by 
applicable regulatory guidance, earn a fixed notional rate of 
interest that is paid only if and when the underlying principal 
award amount vests. Deferred cash stock unit awards are 
payable in cash at the vesting value of the underlying stock. 
Generally, in the EU, vested CAP shares are subject to a 
restriction on sale or transfer after vesting, and vested deferred 
cash awards and deferred cash stock units are subject to hold 
back (generally, for twelve months in each case).

Unvested CAP, deferred cash stock units and deferred 
cash awards are subject to one or more clawback provisions 
that apply in certain circumstances, including gross 
misconduct. CAP and deferred cash stock unit awards, made 

to certain employees, are subject to a formulaic performance-
based vesting condition pursuant to which amounts otherwise 
scheduled to vest will be reduced based on the amount of any 
pretax loss in the participant’s business in the calendar year 
preceding the scheduled vesting date. A minimum reduction of 
20% applies for the first dollar of loss for CAP and deferred 
cash stock unit awards. 

In addition, deferred cash awards are subject to a 

discretionary performance-based vesting condition under 
which an amount otherwise scheduled to vest may be reduced 
in the event of a “material adverse outcome” for which a 
participant has “significant responsibility.” These awards are 
also subject to an additional clawback provision pursuant to 
which unvested awards may be canceled if the employee 
engaged in misconduct or exercised materially imprudent 
judgment, or failed to supervise or escalate the behavior of 
other employees who did. 

Sign-on and Long-Term Retention Awards
Stock awards and deferred cash awards may be made at 
various times during the year as sign-on awards to induce new 
hires to join Citi or to high-potential employees as long-term 
retention awards.

Vesting periods and other terms and conditions pertaining 

to these awards tend to vary by grant. Generally, recipients 
must remain employed through the vesting dates to vest in the 
awards, except in cases of death, disability or involuntary 
termination other than for gross misconduct. These awards do 
not usually provide for post-employment vesting by 
retirement-eligible participants. 

Outstanding (Unvested) Stock Awards

period of 1.6 years.

Performance Share Units
Certain executive officers were awarded a target number of 
performance share units (PSUs) each February from 2014 to 
2017, for performance in the year prior to the award date. For 
grants prior to 2016, PSUs will be earned only to the extent 
that Citigroup attains specified performance goals relating to 
Citigroup’s return on assets and relative total shareholder 
return against peers over the three-year period beginning with 
the year of award. The actual dollar amounts ultimately earned 
could vary from zero, if performance goals are not met, to as 
much as 150% of target, if performance goals are 
meaningfully exceeded. 
       The PSUs granted in February 2016 are earned over a 
three-year performance period based on Citigroup’s relative 
total shareholder return as compared to peers. The actual 
dollar amounts ultimately earned could vary from zero, if 
performance goals are not met, to as much as 150% of target, 
if performance goals are meaningfully exceeded. 

The PSUs granted in February 2017 are earned over a 

three-year performance period based half on return on tangible 
common equity performance in 2019, and the remaining half 
on cumulative earnings per share over 2017 to 2019. 

For the PSUs awarded in 2016 and 2017, if the total 

shareholder return is negative over the three-year performance 
period, executives may earn no more than 100% of the target 
PSUs, regardless of the extent to which Citi outperforms peer 
firms.

For all award years, the value of each PSU is equal to the 

value of one share of Citi common stock. Dividend 
equivalents will be accrued and paid on the number of earned 
PSUs after the end of the performance period.

PSUs are subject to variable accounting, pursuant to 

which the associated value of the award will fluctuate with 
changes in Citigroup’s stock price and the attainment of the 
specified performance goals for each award, until the award is 
settled solely in cash after the end of the performance period. 
The value of the award, subject to the performance goals, is 
estimated using a simulation model that incorporates multiple 
valuation assumptions, including the probability of achieving 
the specified performance goals of each award. The risk-free 
rate used in the model is based on the applicable U.S. Treasury 
yield curve. Other significant assumptions for the awards are 
as follows:

PSUs granted in 2015 and 2017 were equitably adjusted 

after the enactment of Tax Reform, as required under the terms 
of those awards. The adjustments were intended to reproduce 
the expected value of the awards immediately prior to the 
passage of Tax Reform.

Stock Option Programs
All outstanding stock options are fully vested with the related 
expense recognized as a charge to income in prior periods. 
Generally, the stock options outstanding have a six-year term, 
with some stock options subject to various transfer 
restrictions. Cash received from employee stock option 
exercises under this program for the year ended December 31, 
2017 was approximately $14 million.

Other Variable Incentive Compensation
Citigroup has various incentive plans globally that are used to 
motivate and reward performance primarily in the areas of 
sales, operational excellence and customer satisfaction. 
Participation in these plans is generally limited to employees 
who are not eligible for discretionary annual incentive awards. 
Other forms of variable compensation include monthly 
commissions paid to Financial Advisors and Mortgage Loan 
Officers.

Summary
Except for awards subject to variable accounting, the total 
expense recognized for stock awards represents the grant date 
fair value of such awards, which is generally recognized as a 
charge to income ratably over the vesting period, other than 
for awards to retirement-eligible employees and immediately 
vested awards. Whenever awards are made or are expected to 
be made to retirement-eligible employees, the charge to 
income is accelerated based on when the applicable conditions 
to retirement eligibility were or will be met. If the employee is 
retirement eligible on the grant date, or the award is vested at 
grant date, the entire expense is recognized in the year prior to 
grant. 

Recipients of Citigroup stock awards generally do not 
have any stockholder rights until shares are delivered upon 
vesting or exercise, or after the expiration of applicable 
required holding periods. Recipients of restricted or deferred 
stock awards and deferred cash stock unit awards, however, 
may, except as prohibited by applicable regulatory guidance, 

159

be entitled to receive dividends or dividend-equivalent 
payments during the vesting period. Recipients of restricted 
stock awards generally are entitled to vote the shares in their 
award during the vesting period. Once a stock award vests, the 
shares are freely transferable, unless they are subject to a 
restriction on sale or transfer for a specified period. 

All equity awards granted since April 19, 2005 have been 
made pursuant to stockholder-approved stock incentive plans 
that are administered by the Personnel and Compensation 
Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors, which is 
composed entirely of independent non-employee directors.

At December 31, 2017, approximately 39.2 million shares 
of Citigroup common stock were authorized and available for 
grant under Citigroup’s 2014 Stock Incentive Plan, the only 
plan from which equity awards are currently granted.

The 2014 Stock Incentive Plan and predecessor plans 
permit the use of treasury stock or newly issued shares in 
connection with awards granted under the plans. Newly issued 
shares were distributed to settle the vesting of the majority of 
annual deferred stock awards from 2012 to 2015. Treasury 
shares were used to settle vestings in 2016 and 2017, and the 
first quarter of 2018, except where local laws favor newly 
issued shares. The use of treasury stock or newly issued shares 
to settle stock awards does not affect the compensation 
expense recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income for 
equity awards.

generally accrued as cash incentive compensation in the year prior to 
grant.

(2)  All periods include amortization expense for all unvested awards to non-

retirement-eligible employees. 

Future Expenses Associated with Outstanding (Unvested) 
Awards
Citi expects to record compensation expense in future periods 
as a result of awards granted for performance in 2017 and 
prior years. Because the awards contain service or other 
conditions that will be satisfied in the future, the expense of 
these already-granted awards is recognized over those future 
periods. The portion of these awards that is subject to variable 
accounting will cause the expense amount to fluctuate with 
changes in Citigroup’s common stock price. Citi's expected 
future expenses, excluding the impact of forfeitures, 
cancelations, clawbacks and repositioning-related 
accelerations that have not yet occurred, are summarized in

Pension and Postretirement Plans
The Company has several non-contributory defined benefit 
pension plans covering certain U.S. employees and has various 
defined benefit pension and termination indemnity plans 
covering employees outside the U.S. 

The U.S. qualified defined benefit plan was frozen 

effective January 1, 2008 for most employees. Accordingly, no 
additional compensation-based contributions have been 
credited to the cash balance portion of the plan for existing plan 
participants after 2007. However, certain employees covered 
under the prior final pay plan formula continue to accrue 
benefits. The Company also offers postretirement health care 
and life insurance benefits to certain eligible U.S. retired 
employees, as well as to certain eligible employees outside the 
U.S.

The Company also sponsors a number of non-contributory, 

nonqualified pension plans. These plans, which are unfunded, 
provide supplemental defined pension benefits to certain U.S. 

employees. With the exception of certain employees covered 
under the prior final pay plan formula, the benefits under these 
plans were frozen in prior years.

The plan obligations, plan assets and periodic plan expense 
for the Company’s most significant pension and postretirement 
benefit plans (Significant Plans) are measured and disclosed 
quarterly, instead of annually. The Significant Plans captured 
approximately 90% of the Company’s global pension and 
postretirement plan obligations as of December 31, 2017. All 
other plans (All Other Plans) are measured annually with a 
December 31 measurement date.

(1)  Losses and gains due to curtailment and settlement benefits relate to repositioning and divestiture actions.

The estimated net actuarial loss and prior service (benefit) cost 
that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive 
income (loss) into net expense in 2018 are approximately $241 
million and $(2) million, respectively, for defined benefit 
pension plans.

For postretirement plans, the estimated 2018 net actuarial 

loss and prior service (benefit) cost amortizations are 
approximately $28 million and $(9) million, respectively.

Contributions
The Company’s funding practice for U.S. and non-U.S. pension 
and postretirement plans is generally to fund to minimum 
funding requirements in accordance with applicable local laws 
and regulations. The Company may increase its contributions 
above the minimum required contribution, if appropriate. In 
addition, management has the ability to change its funding 
practices. For the U.S. pension plans, there were no required 
minimum cash contributions for 2017 or 2016. 

The following table summarizes the actual Company 

contributions for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, 
as well as estimated expected Company contributions for 2018. 
Expected contributions are subject to change, since contribution 
decisions are affected by various factors, such as market 
performance, tax considerations and regulatory requirements.

Plan Assumptions 
The Company utilizes a number of assumptions to determine 
plan obligations and expenses. Changes in one or a 
combination of these assumptions will have an impact on the 
Company’s pension and postretirement PBO, funded status and 
(benefit) expense. Changes in the plans’ funded status resulting 
from changes in the PBO and fair value of plan assets will have 
a corresponding impact on Accumulated other comprehensive 
income (loss). 

The actuarial assumptions at the respective years ended 
December 31 in the table below are used to measure the year-
end PBO and the net periodic (benefit) expense for the 
subsequent year (period).  Since Citi’s Significant Plans are 
measured on a quarterly basis, the year-end rates for those plans 
are used to calculate the net periodic (benefit) expense for the 
subsequent year’s first quarter.  As a result of the quarterly 
measurement process, the net periodic (benefit) expense for the 
Significant Plans is calculated at each respective quarter end 
based on the preceding quarter-end rates (as shown below for 
the U.S. and non-U.S. pension and postretirement plans). The 
actuarial assumptions for All Other Plans are measured 
annually. 

Certain assumptions used in determining pension and 

postretirement benefit obligations and net benefit expense for 
the Company’s plans are shown in the following table:

Discount Rate
The discount rates for the U.S. pension and postretirement 
plans were selected by reference to a Citigroup-specific 
analysis using each plan’s specific cash flows and compared 
with high-quality corporate bond indices for reasonableness. 
The discount rates for the non-U.S. pension and postretirement 
plans are selected by reference to high-quality corporate bond 
rates in countries that have developed corporate bond markets. 
However, where developed corporate bond markets do not 
exist, the discount rates are selected by reference to local 
government bond rates with a premium added to reflect the 
additional risk for corporate bonds in certain countries.
Effective December 31, 2017, the established rounding 
convention was to the nearest 5 bps for the top five non-U.S. 
countries, and 25 bps for all other countries.

Expected Rate of Return
The Company determines its assumptions for the expected rate 
of return on plan assets for its U.S. pension and postretirement 
plans using a “building block” approach, which focuses on 
ranges of anticipated rates of return for each asset class. A 
weighted average range of nominal rates is then determined 
based on target allocations to each asset class. Market 
performance over a number of earlier years is evaluated 
covering a wide range of economic conditions to determine 
whether there are sound reasons for projecting any past trends.
The Company considers the expected rate of return to be a 

long-term assessment of return expectations and does not 
anticipate changing this assumption unless there are significant 
changes in investment strategy or economic conditions. This 
contrasts with the selection of the discount rate and certain 
other assumptions, which are reconsidered annually (or 
quarterly for the Significant Plans) in accordance with GAAP.

The expected rate of return for the U.S. pension and 

postretirement plans was 6.80% at December 31, 2017 and 
2016 and 7.00% at December 31, 2015. The expected return on 
assets reflects the expected annual appreciation of the plan 
assets and reduces the Company’s annual pension expense. The 
expected return on assets is deducted from the sum of service 
cost, interest cost and other components of pension expense to 
arrive at the net pension (benefit) expense. Net pension 
(benefit) expense for the U.S. pension plans for 2017, 2016 and 
2015 reflects deductions of $865 million, $886 million and 
$893 million of expected returns, respectively.

The following table shows the expected rates of return 

used in determining the Company’s pension expense compared 
to the actual rate of return on plan assets during 2017, 2016 and 
2015 for the U.S. pension and postretirement plans:

In 2017, the VEBA Trust was funded for postretirement benefits with an 
expected rate of return of assets of 3.00%.

(2)  Actual rates of return are presented net of fees.

For the non-U.S. pension plans, pension expense for 2017 was 
reduced by the expected return of $299 million, compared with 
the actual return of $462 million. Pension expense for 2016 and 
2015 was reduced by expected returns of $287 million and 
$323 million, respectively. 

Mortality Tables
At December 31, 2017, the Company maintained the 
Retirement Plan 2014 (RP-2014) mortality table and adopted 
the Mortality Projection 2017 (MP-2017) projection table for 
the U.S. plans.

0.75%  ultimate rate of annual improvement by 2032.

of a one-percentage-point change in the discount rate:

Since the U.S. qualified pension plan was frozen, most of 
the prospective service cost has been eliminated and the gain/
loss amortization period was changed to the life expectancy for 
inactive participants. As a result, pension expense for the U.S. 
qualified pension plan is driven more by interest costs than 
service costs, and an increase in the discount rate would 
increase pension expense, while a decrease in the discount rate 
would decrease pension expense.

(1)  Asset allocations for the U.S. plans are set by investment strategy, not by investment product. For example, private equities with an underlying investment in real 

estate are classified in the real estate asset category, not private equity.

(2)  Equity securities in the U.S. pension and postretirement plans do not include any Citigroup common stock at the end of 2017 and 2016.
(3) 

In December 2017, Citi contributed $140 million to the VEBA Trust for postretirement benefits, which amount was invested solely in debt securities which are not 
reflected in the table above.

        Third-party investment managers and advisers provide 
their services to Citigroup’s U.S. pension and postretirement 
plans. Assets are rebalanced as the Company’s Pension Plan 
Investment Committee deems appropriate. Citigroup’s 
investment strategy, with respect to its assets, is to maintain a 
globally diversified investment portfolio across several asset 
classes that, when combined with Citigroup’s contributions to 

the plans, will maintain the plans’ ability to meet all required 
benefit obligations.

Citigroup’s pension and postretirement plans’ weighted-

average asset allocations for the non-U.S. plans and the actual 
ranges, and the weighted-average target allocations by asset

Oversight and Risk Management Practices
The framework for the Company’s pension oversight process 
includes monitoring of retirement plans by plan fiduciaries and/
or management at the global, regional or country level, as 
appropriate. Independent Risk Management contributes to the 
risk oversight and monitoring for the Company’s U.S. qualified 
pension plan and non-U.S. Significant Pension Plans. Although 
the specific components of the oversight process are tailored to 
the requirements of each region, country and plan, the 
following elements are common to the Company’s monitoring 
and risk management process:
 
• 

periodic asset/liability management studies and strategic 
asset allocation reviews;
periodic monitoring of funding levels and funding ratios;
periodic monitoring of compliance with asset allocation 
guidelines;
periodic monitoring of asset class and/or investment 
manager performance against benchmarks; and
periodic risk capital analysis and stress testing.

•

• 

Investment Strategy
The Company’s global pension and postretirement funds’ 
investment strategy is to invest in a prudent manner for the 
exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants. The 
investment strategies are targeted to produce a total return that, 
when combined with the Company’s contributions to the funds, 
will maintain the funds’ ability to meet all required benefit 
obligations. Risk is controlled through diversification of asset 
types and investments in domestic and international equities, 
fixed income securities and cash and short-term investments. 
The target asset allocation in most locations outside the U.S. is 
primarily in equity and debt securities. These allocations may 
vary by geographic region and country depending on the nature 
of applicable obligations and various other regional 
considerations. The wide variation in the actual range of plan 
asset allocations for the funded non-U.S. plans is a result of 
differing local statutory requirements and economic conditions. 
For example, in certain countries local law requires that all 
pension plan assets must be invested in fixed income 
investments, government funds or local-country securities.
 
Significant Concentrations of Risk in Plan Assets
The assets of the Company’s pension plans are diversified to 
limit the impact of any individual investment. The U.S. 
qualified pension plan is diversified across multiple asset 
classes, with publicly traded fixed income, hedge funds, 
publicly traded equity and private equity representing the most 
significant asset allocations. Investments in these four asset 
classes are further diversified across funds, managers, 
strategies, vintages, sectors and geographies, depending on the 
specific characteristics of each asset class. The pension assets 
for the Company’s non-U.S. Significant Plans are primarily 
invested in publicly traded fixed income and publicly traded 
equity securities.

Prescription Drugs
In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug 
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (Act of 2003) 
was enacted. The Act of 2003 established a prescription drug 
benefit under Medicare known as “Medicare Part D,” and a 
federal subsidy to sponsors of U.S. retiree health care benefit 
plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent 
to Medicare Part D. The benefits provided to certain 
participants are at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare 
Part D and, accordingly, the Company is entitled to a subsidy.

172

The subsidy reduced the accumulated postretirement 

benefit obligation (APBO) by approximately $4 million and $5 
million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 
the postretirement expense by approximately $0.1 million and 
$0.2 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Certain provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act of 2010 improved the Medicare Part D option known 
as the Employer Group Waiver Plan (EGWP) with respect to 
the Medicare Part D subsidy. The EGWP provides prescription 

drug benefits that are more cost effective for Medicare-eligible 
participants and large employers. Effective April 1, 2013, the 
Company began sponsoring and implementing an EGWP for 
eligible retirees. The Company subsidy received under the 
EGWP for 2017 and 2016 was $15.0 million and $12.9 million, 
respectively.

The other provisions of the Act of 2010 are not expected to 

have a significant impact on Citigroup’s pension and 
postretirement plans.

Post Employment Plans
The Company sponsors U.S. post employment plans that 
provide income continuation and health and welfare benefits to 
certain eligible U.S. employees on long-term disability.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the plans’ funded 
status recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Balance 
Sheet was $(46) million and $(157) million, respectively. The 
pre-tax amounts recognized in Accumulated other 
comprehensive income (loss) as of December 31, 2017 and 
2016 were $3 million and $34 million, respectively. The 
improvement in funded status as of December 31, 2017 was 
primarily due to the Company’s funding of the VEBA Trust 
during 2017.

The following table summarizes the components of net 
expense recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income 
for the Company’s U.S. post employment plans:

Defined Contribution Plans
The Company sponsors defined contribution plans in the U.S. 
and in certain non-U.S. locations, all of which are administered 
in accordance with local laws. The most significant defined 
contribution plan is the Citi Retirement Savings Plan (formerly 
known as the Citigroup 401(k) Plan) sponsored by the 
Company in the U.S.

Under the Citi Retirement Savings Plan, eligible U.S. 

employees received matching contributions of up to 6% of their 
eligible compensation for 2017 and 2016, subject to statutory 
limits. Additionally, for eligible employees whose eligible 
compensation is $100,000 or less, a fixed contribution of up to 
2% of eligible compensation is provided. All Company 
contributions are invested according to participants’ individual 
elections. The following table summarizes the Company

As of December 31, 2017, Citi is under audit by the 

Internal Revenue Service and other major taxing jurisdictions 
around the world. It is thus reasonably possible that significant 
changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits may 
occur within the next 12 months, although Citi does not expect 
such audits to result in amounts that would cause a significant 
change to its effective tax rate.

Deferred Tax Assets
As of December 31, 2017, Citi had a valuation allowance of 
$9.4 billion, composed of valuation allowances of $5.7 billion 
on its FTC carry-forwards, $2.2 billion on its U.S. residual 
DTA related to its non-U.S. branches, $1.4 billion on local 
non-U.S. DTAs and $0.1 billion on state net operating loss 
carry-forwards. The valuation allowance against FTCs results 
from the impact of the lower tax rate and the new separate 
FTC basket for non-U.S. branches, as well as diminished 
ability under Tax Reform to generate income from sources 
outside the U.S. to support FTC utilization. The absolute 
amount of Citi’s post-Tax Reform-related valuation 
allowances may change in future years. First, the separate FTC 
basket for non-U.S. branches will result in additional DTAs 
(for FTCs) requiring a valuation allowance, given that the 
local tax rate for these branches exceeds on average the U.S. 
tax rate of 21%. Second, in Citi’s general basket for FTCs, 
changes in the forecasted amount of income in U.S. locations 
derived from sources outside the U.S. could alter the amount 
of valuation allowance that is needed against such FTCs. As of 
December 31, 2016, Citi had no valuation allowance on its 
DTAs. The following table summarizes Citi’s DTAs:

Included in the net U.S. federal DTAs of $16.1 billion as of December 
31, 2017 were deferred tax liabilities of $2.4 billion that will reverse in 
the relevant carry-forward period and may be used to support the DTAs.

(3)  Consists of non-consolidated tax return NOL carry-forwards that are 

eventually expected to be utilized in Citigroup’s consolidated tax return. 

Non-U.S. Earnings
Non-U.S. pretax earnings approximated $13.7 billion in 2017 
(of which a $0.1 billion loss was recorded in Discontinued 
operations), $11.6 billion in 2016 and $11.3 billion in 2015. 
As a U.S. corporation, Citigroup and its U.S. subsidiaries are 
currently subject to U.S. taxation on all non-U.S. pretax 
earnings of a non-U.S. branch. Starting in 2018, there will be a 
separate foreign tax credit (FTC) basket for branches. Also 
starting in 2018, dividends from a non-U.S. subsidiary or 
affiliate are effectively exempt from U.S. taxation. The 
Company provides income taxes on the book over tax basis 
differences of non-U.S. subsidiaries except to the extent that 
such differences are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.

At December 31, 2017, $14.1 billion of basis differences 

of non-U.S. subsidiaries was indefinitely invested. At the 
existing tax rates, additional taxes (net of U.S. FTCs) of $3.5 
billion would have to be provided if such basis differences 
were realized. These amounts are significantly less than the 
corresponding amounts at December 31, 2016 due to the 
deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings of non-U.S. 
subsidiaries under the provisions of Tax Reform.

Income taxes are not provided for the Company’s 

“savings bank base year bad debt reserves” that arose before 
1988, because under current U.S. tax rules, such taxes will 
become payable only to the extent that such amounts are 
distributed in excess of limits prescribed by federal law. At 
December 31, 2017, the amount of the base year reserves 
totaled approximately $358 million (subject to a tax of $75 
million).

176

and available tax planning strategies (as defined in ASC 740, 
Income Taxes) that would be implemented, if necessary, to 
prevent a carry-forward from expiring.

Citi believes the U.S. federal and New York state and city 
NOL carry-forward period of 20 years provides enough time 
to fully utilize the DTAs pertaining to the existing NOL carry-
forwards. This is due to Citi’s forecast of sufficient U.S. 
taxable income and the fact that New York state and city 
continue to tax Citi’s non-U.S. income.

With respect to the FTCs component of the DTAs, the 
carry-forward period is 10 years. Utilization of FTCs in any 
year is restricted to 21% of foreign source taxable income in 
that year. However, overall domestic losses that Citi has 
incurred of approximately $52 billion as of December 31, 
2017 are allowed to be reclassified as foreign source income 
to the extent of 50%–100% of domestic source income 
produced in subsequent years. Such resulting foreign source 
income would cover the FTC carry-forwards after valuation 
allowance. As noted in the tables above, Citi’s FTC carry-
forwards were $7.6 billion ($13.3 billion before valuation 
allowance) as of December 31, 2017, compared to $14.2 
billion as of December 31, 2016. This decrease represented 
$6.6 billion of the $24.2 billion decrease in Citi’s overall 
DTAs during 2017. Citi believes that it will generate sufficient 
U.S. taxable income within the 10-year carry-forward period 
to be able to utilize the net FTCs after the valuation allowance, 
in addition to any FTCs produced in the tax return for such 
period, which must be used prior to any carry-forward 
utilization.

forwards and their expiration dates:

The time remaining for utilization of the FTC component 
has shortened, given the passage of time. Although realization 
is not assured, Citi believes that the realization of the 
recognized net DTAs of $22.5 billion at December 31, 2017 is 
more-likely-than-not based upon expectations as to future 
taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise

(1)   The above tables do not include securities-for-securities lending 

transactions of $14.0 billion and $9.3 billion at December 31, 2017 and 
December 31, 2016, respectively, where the Company acts as lender and 
receives securities that can be sold or pledged as collateral. In these 
transactions, the Company recognizes the securities received at fair 
value within Other assets and the obligation to return those securities as 
a liability within Brokerage payables. 

The resale and repurchase agreements represent 

collateralized financing transactions. Citi executes these 
transactions primarily through its broker-dealer subsidiaries to 
facilitate customer matched-book activity and to efficiently 
fund a portion of Citi’s trading inventory. Transactions 
executed by Citi’s bank subsidiaries primarily facilitate 
customer financing activity.

To maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market 

conditions, including under periods of stress, Citi manages 
these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the 
underlying collateral, and stipulating financing tenor. Citi 
manages the risks in its collateralized financing transactions 
by conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in 
capacity, tenors, haircut, collateral profile and client actions. 
Additionally, Citi maintains counterparty diversification by 
establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty 
reliability and stability under stress.

It is the Company’s policy to take possession of the 

underlying collateral, monitor its market value relative to the 
amounts due under the agreements and, when necessary, 

179

require prompt transfer of additional collateral in order to 
maintain contractual margin protection. For resale and 
repurchase agreements, when necessary, the company posts 
additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin 
protection. 

Collateral typically consists of government and 

government-agency securities, corporate and municipal bonds, 
equities and mortgage-backed and other asset-backed 
securities.

The resale and repurchase agreements are generally 

documented under industry standard agreements that allow the 
prompt close-out of all transactions (including the liquidation 
of securities held) and the offsetting of obligations to return 
cash or securities by the non-defaulting party, following a 
payment default or other type of default under the relevant 
master agreement. Events of default generally include 
(i) failure to deliver cash or securities as required under the 
transaction, (ii) failure to provide or return cash or securities 
as used for margining purposes, (iii) breach of representation, 
(iv) cross-default to another transaction entered into among 
the parties, or, in some cases, their affiliates, and (v) a 
repudiation of obligations under the agreement. The 
counterparty that receives the securities in these transactions is 
generally unrestricted in its use of the securities, with the 
exception of transactions executed on a tri-party basis, where 
the collateral is maintained by a custodian and operational 
limitations may restrict its use of the securities.

A substantial portion of the resale and repurchase 

agreements is recorded at fair value, as described in Notes 24 
and 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The 
remaining portion is carried at the amount of cash initially 
advanced or received, plus accrued interest, as specified in the 
respective agreements.

The securities borrowing and lending agreements also 
represent collateralized financing transactions similar to the 
resale and repurchase agreements. Collateral typically consists 
of government and government-agency securities and 
corporate debt and equity securities.

Similar to the resale and repurchase agreements, securities 

borrowing and lending agreements are generally documented 
under industry standard agreements that allow the prompt 
close-out of all transactions (including the liquidation of 
securities held) and the offsetting of obligations to return cash 
or securities by the non-defaulting party, following a payment 
default or other default by the other party under the relevant 
master agreement. Events of default and rights to use 
securities under the securities borrowing and lending 
agreements are similar to the resale and repurchase 
agreements referenced above.

A substantial portion of securities borrowing and lending 

agreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or 
received. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the 
Company elected the fair value option for certain securities 
borrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 25 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. With respect to securities 
loaned, the Company receives cash collateral in an amount 
generally in excess of the market value of the securities 
loaned. The Company monitors the market value of securities 
borrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis and obtains or 

posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual 
margin protection.

The enforceability of offsetting rights incorporated in the 

master netting agreements for resale and repurchase 
agreements and securities borrowing and lending agreements 
is evidenced to the extent that a supportive legal opinion has 
been obtained from counsel of recognized standing that 
provides the requisite level of certainty regarding the 
enforceability of these agreements. Also, the exercise of rights 
by the non-defaulting party to terminate and closeout 
transactions on a net basis under these agreements will not be 
stayed or avoided under applicable law upon an event of 
default including bankruptcy, insolvency or similar 
proceeding.

A legal opinion may not have been sought or obtained for 

certain jurisdictions where local law is silent or sufficiently 
ambiguous to determine the enforceability of offsetting rights 
or where adverse case law or conflicting regulation may cast 

doubt on the enforceability of such rights. In some 
jurisdictions and for some counterparty types, the insolvency 
law for a particular counterparty type may be nonexistent or 
unclear as overlapping regimes may exist. For example, this 
may be the case for certain sovereigns, municipalities, central 
banks and U.S. pension plans.

The following tables present the gross and net resale and 
repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending 
agreements and the related offsetting amount permitted under 
ASC 210-20-45. The tables also include amounts related to 
financial instruments that are not permitted to be offset under 
ASC 210-20-45 but would be eligible for offsetting to the 
extent that an event of default occurred and a legal opinion 
supporting enforceability of the offsetting rights has been 
obtained. Remaining exposures continue to be secured by 
financial collateral, but the Company may not have sought or 
been able to obtain a legal opinion evidencing enforceability 
of the offsetting right.

PAYABLES

Citi has receivables and payables for financial instruments 
sold to and purchased from brokers, dealers and customers, 
which arise in the ordinary course of business. Citi is 
exposed to risk of loss from the inability of brokers, dealers 
or customers to pay for purchases or to deliver the financial 
instruments sold, in which case Citi would have to sell or 
purchase the financial instruments at prevailing market 
prices. Credit risk is reduced to the extent that an exchange 
or clearing organization acts as a counterparty to the 
transaction and replaces the broker, dealer or customer in 
question.

Citi seeks to protect itself from the risks associated with 

customer activities by requiring customers to maintain 
margin collateral in compliance with regulatory and internal 
guidelines. Margin levels are monitored daily, and customers 
deposit additional collateral as required. Where customers 
cannot meet collateral requirements, Citi may liquidate 
sufficient underlying financial instruments to bring the 
customer into compliance with the required margin level.

Exposure to credit risk is impacted by market volatility, 

which may impair the ability of clients to satisfy their 
obligations to Citi. Credit limits are established and closely 
monitored for customers and for brokers and dealers 
engaged in forwards, futures and other transactions deemed 
to be credit sensitive.

The Company has sold certain debt securities that were 

classified as HTM. These sales were in response to significant 
deterioration in the creditworthiness of the issuers or 
securities or because the Company has collected a substantial 
portion (at least 85%) of the principal outstanding at 
acquisition of the security. In addition, certain other securities 
were reclassified to AFS investments in response to 

significant credit deterioration. Because the Company 
generally intends to sell these reclassified securities, Citi 
recorded OTTI on the securities. The following table sets 
forth, for the periods indicated, the carrying value of HTM 
securities sold and reclassified to AFS, as well as the related 
gain (loss) or the OTTI losses recorded on these securities.

(1)  The Company invests in mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. These securitizations are generally considered VIEs. The Company’s maximum exposure 

(2) 

to loss from these VIEs is equal to the carrying amount of the securities, which is reflected in the table above. For mortgage-backed and asset-backed 
securitizations in which the Company has other involvement, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In the second quarter of 2017, Citi early adopted ASU 2017-08. Upon adoption, a cumulative effect adjustment was recorded to reduce retained earnings, 
effective January 1, 2017, for the incremental amortization of purchase premiums and cumulative fair value hedge adjustments on callable state and municipal 
debt securities. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 

a year and, of these, 99% were rated investment grade; and 
$672 million represented unrealized losses on fixed income 
investments that have been in a gross-unrealized-loss position 
for a year or more and, of these, 94% were rated investment 
grade. Of the $672 million mentioned above, $234 million 
represent state and municipal securities.
 

At December 31, 2017, the amortized cost of 

approximately 4,600 investments in equity and fixed income 
securities exceeded their fair value by $2,527 million. Of the 
$2,527 million, the gross unrealized losses on equity 
securities were $1 million. Of the remainder, $1,854 million 
represented unrealized losses on fixed income investments 
that have been in a gross-unrealized-loss position for less than

(1)  For securities transferred to HTM from Trading account assets, adjusted amortized cost basis is defined as the fair value of the securities at the date of transfer 

plus any accretion income and less any impairments recognized in earnings subsequent to transfer. For securities transferred to HTM from AFS, adjusted 
amortized cost basis is defined as the original purchase cost, adjusted for the cumulative accretion or amortization of any purchase discount or premium, plus or 
minus any cumulative fair value hedge adjustments, net of accretion or amortization, and less any other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings.

(2)  HTM securities are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at adjusted amortized cost basis, plus or minus any unamortized unrealized gains and losses and 

fair value hedge adjustments recognized in AOCI prior to reclassifying the securities from AFS to HTM. Changes in the values of these securities are not 
reported in the financial statements, except for the amortization of any difference between the carrying value at the transfer date and par value of the securities, 
and the recognition of any non-credit fair value adjustments in AOCI in connection with the recognition of any credit impairment in earnings related to securities 
the Company continues to intend to hold until maturity.

(3)  The Company invests in mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. These securitizations are generally considered VIEs. The Company’s maximum exposure 

(4) 

to loss from these VIEs is equal to the carrying amount of the securities, which is reflected in the table above. For mortgage-backed and asset-backed 
securitizations in which the Company has other involvement, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In the second quarter of 2017, Citi early adopted ASU 2017-08. Upon adoption, a cumulative effect adjustment was recorded to reduce retained earnings, 
effective January 1, 2017, for the incremental amortization of purchase premiums and cumulative fair value hedge adjustments that would have been recorded 
under the ASU on callable state and municipal debt securities. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(5)  During the fourth quarter of 2016, securities with a total fair value of approximately $5.8 billion were transferred from AFS to HTM, composed of $5 billion of 
U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities and $830 million of municipal securities. The transfer reflects the Company’s intent to hold these securities 
to maturity or to issuer call, in part, in order to reduce the impact of price volatility on AOCI and certain capital measures under Basel III. While these securities 
were transferred to HTM at fair value as of the transfer date, no subsequent changes in value may be recorded, other than in connection with the recognition of 
any subsequent other-than-temporary impairment and the amortization of differences between the carrying values at the transfer date and the par values of each 
security as an adjustment of yield. Any net unrealized holding losses within AOCI related to the respective securities at the date of transfer, inclusive of any 
cumulative fair value hedge adjustments, will be amortized as an adjustment of yield in a manner consistent with the amortization of any premium or discount.

188

The Company has the positive intent and ability to hold 
these securities to maturity or, where applicable, the exercise 
of any issuer call options, absent any unforeseen significant 
changes in circumstances, including deterioration in credit or 
changes in regulatory capital requirements.

The net unrealized losses classified in AOCI for HTM 

securities primarily relate to debt securities previously 
classified as AFS that were transferred to HTM, and include 
any cumulative fair 

value hedge adjustments. The net unrealized loss amount also 
includes any non-credit-related changes in fair value of HTM 
securities that have suffered credit impairment recorded in 
earnings. The AOCI balance related to HTM securities is 
amortized as an adjustment of yield, in a manner consistent 
with the accretion of any difference between the carrying 
value at the transfer date and par value of the same debt 
securities. 

The table below shows the fair value of debt securities HTM that have been in an unrecognized loss position:

Evaluating Investments for Other-Than-Temporary 
Impairment (OTTI)

Overview
The Company conducts periodic reviews of all securities with 
unrealized losses to evaluate whether the impairment is other-
than-temporary.

An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of 
an individual security is less than its adjusted amortized cost 
basis. Unrealized losses that are determined to be temporary 
in nature are recorded, net of tax, in AOCI for AFS securities. 
Losses related to HTM securities generally are not recorded, 
as these investments are carried at adjusted amortized cost 
basis. However, for HTM securities with credit-related losses, 
the credit loss is recognized in earnings as OTTI and any 
difference between the cost basis adjusted for the OTTI and 
fair value is recognized in AOCI and amortized as an 
adjustment of yield over the remaining contractual life of the 
security. 

Regardless of the classification of the securities as AFS 

or HTM, the Company assesses each position with an 
unrealized loss for OTTI. Factors considered in determining 
whether a loss is temporary include:
• 

the length of time and the extent to which fair value has 
been below cost;
the severity of the impairment;
the cause of the impairment and the financial condition 
and near-term prospects of the issuer;
activity in the market of the issuer that may indicate 
adverse credit conditions; and
the Company’s ability and intent to hold the investment 
for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of the 
amortized cost basis.

• 
• 

• 

• 

The Company’s review for impairment generally entails:
• 
• 

identification and evaluation of impaired investments;
analysis of individual investments that have fair values 
less than the amortized cost, including consideration of 
the length of time the investment has been in an 
unrealized loss position and the expected recovery 
period;
consideration of evidential matter, including an 
evaluation of factors or triggers that could cause 
individual investments to qualify as having other-than-
temporary impairment and those that would not support 
other-than-temporary impairment; and
documentation of the results of these analyses, as 
required under business policies.

• 

• 

191

Debt Securities
The entire difference between the adjusted amortized cost 
basis and fair value is recognized in earnings as OTTI for 
impaired debt securities that the Company has an intent to sell 
or for which the Company believes it will more-likely-than-
not be required to sell prior to recovery of the adjusted 
amortized cost basis. However, for those securities that the 
Company does not intend to sell and is not likely to be 
required to sell, only the credit-related impairment is 
recognized in earnings and any non-credit-related impairment 
is recorded in AOCI.

For debt securities, credit impairment exists where the 

present value of cash flows management expects to receive is 
not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a 
security.

Equity Securities
For equity securities, management considers the various 
factors described above, including its intent and ability to 
hold the equity security for a period of time sufficient for 
recovery or whether it is more-likely-than-not that the 
Company will be required to sell the security prior to 
recovery of its cost basis. Where management lacks that intent 
or ability, the security’s decline in fair value is deemed to be 
other-than-temporary and is recorded in earnings. AFS equity 
securities deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired are 
written down to fair value, with the full difference between 
fair value and cost recognized in earnings.

Management also assesses equity method investments 

that have fair values that are less than their respective 
carrying values for OTTI. Fair value is measured as price 
multiplied by quantity if the investee has publicly listed 
securities. If the investee is not publicly listed, other methods 
are used (see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements).

For impaired equity method investments that Citi plans to 

sell prior to recovery of value or would likely be required to 
sell with no expectation that the fair value will recover prior 
to the expected sale date, the full impairment is recognized in 
earnings as OTTI regardless of severity and duration. The 
measurement of the OTTI does not include partial projected 
recoveries subsequent to the balance sheet date.

For impaired equity method investments that 

management does not plan to sell and is not likely to be 
required to sell prior to recovery of value, the evaluation of 
whether an impairment is other-than-temporary is based on 
(i) whether and when an equity method investment will 
recover in value and (ii) whether the investor has the intent 
and ability to hold that investment for a period of time 
sufficient to recover the value. The determination of whether 
the impairment is considered other-than-temporary considers 
the following indicators, regardless of the time and extent of 
impairment:
• 

the cause of the impairment and the financial condition 
and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any 
specific events that may influence the operations of the 
issuer;

• 

• 

the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period 
of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in 
market value; and
the length of time and extent to which fair value has been 
less than the carrying value.

The sections below describe the Company’s process for 
identifying credit-related impairments for security types that 
have the most significant unrealized losses as of 
December 31, 2017. 

Mortgage-Backed Securities
For U.S. mortgage-backed securities, credit impairment is 
assessed using a cash flow model that estimates the principal 
and interest cash flows on the underlying mortgages using the 
security-specific collateral and transaction structure. The 
model distributes the estimated cash flows to the various 
tranches of securities, considering the transaction structure 
and any subordination and credit enhancements that exist in 
that structure. The cash flow model incorporates actual cash 
flows on the mortgage-backed securities through the current 
period and then estimates the remaining cash flows using a 
number of assumptions, including default rates, prepayment 
rates, recovery rates (on foreclosed properties) and loss 
severity rates (on non-agency mortgage-backed securities).

Management develops specific assumptions using 

market data, internal estimates and estimates published by 
rating agencies and other third-party sources. Default rates are 
projected by considering current underlying mortgage loan 
performance, generally assuming the default of (i) 10% of 
current loans, (ii) 25% of 30–59 day delinquent loans, 
(iii) 70% of 60–90 day delinquent loans and (iv) 100% of 91+ 
day delinquent loans. These estimates are extrapolated along a 
default timing curve to estimate the total lifetime pool default 

rate. Other assumptions contemplate the actual collateral 
attributes, including geographic concentrations, rating actions 
and current market prices.

Cash flow projections are developed using different stress 

test scenarios. Management evaluates the results of those 
stress tests (including the severity of any cash shortfall 
indicated and the likelihood of the stress scenarios actually 
occurring based on the underlying pool’s characteristics and 
performance) to assess whether management expects to 
recover the amortized cost basis of the security. If cash flow 
projections indicate that the Company does not expect to 
recover its amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes the 
estimated credit loss in earnings.

State and Municipal Securities
The process for identifying credit impairments in Citigroup’s 
AFS and HTM state and municipal bonds is primarily based 
on a credit analysis that incorporates third-party credit ratings.  
Citigroup monitors the bond issuers and any insurers 
providing default protection in the form of financial guarantee 
insurance.  The average external credit rating, ignoring any 
insurance, is Aa3/AA-.  In the event of an external rating 
downgrade or other indicator of credit impairment (i.e., based 
on instrument-specific estimates of cash flows or probability 
of issuer default), the subject bond is specifically reviewed for 
adverse changes in the amount or timing of expected 
contractual principal and interest payments. 

For state and municipal bonds with unrealized losses that 

Citigroup plans to sell or would be more-likely-than-not 
required to sell (for AFS only) or that will be subject to an 
issuer call deemed probable of exercise prior to the expected 
recovery of its amortized cost basis (for AFS and HTM), the 
full impairment is recognized in earnings as OTTI.

Investments in Alternative Investment Funds That 
Calculate Net Asset Value
The Company holds investments in certain alternative 
investment funds that calculate net asset value (NAV) or its 
equivalent, including hedge funds, private equity funds, funds 
of funds and real estate funds, as provided by third-party asset 
managers. Investments in such funds are generally classified 
as non-marketable equity securities carried at fair value. The 
fair values of these investments are estimated using the NAV 
of the Company’s ownership interest in the funds. Some of 
these investments are in “covered funds” for purposes of the 

Volcker Rule, which prohibits certain proprietary investment 
activities and limits the ownership of, and relationships with, 
covered funds. On April 21, 2017, Citi’s request for extension 
of the permitted holding period under the Volcker Rule for 
certain of its investments in illiquid funds was approved. This 
allows the Company to hold such investments until the earlier 
of 5 years from the July 21, 2017 (expiration date of the 
general conformance period), or the date such investments 
mature or are otherwise conformed with the Volcker Rule.

(1)  Private equity funds include funds that invest in infrastructure, emerging markets and venture capital.
(2)  With respect to the Company’s investments in private equity funds and real estate funds, distributions from each fund will be received as the underlying assets 
held by these funds are liquidated. It is estimated that the underlying assets of these funds will be liquidated over a period of several years as market conditions 
allow. Private equity and real estate funds do not allow redemption of investments by their investors. Investors are permitted to sell or transfer their investments, 
subject to the approval of the general partner or investment manager of these funds, which generally may not be unreasonably withheld.
Includes several real estate funds that invest primarily in commercial real estate in the U.S., Europe and Asia.

Delinquency Status
Delinquency status is monitored and considered a key 
indicator of credit quality of consumer loans. Principally, the 
U.S. residential first mortgage loans use the Mortgage Bankers 
Association (MBA) method of reporting delinquencies, which 
considers a loan delinquent if a monthly payment has not been 
received by the end of the day immediately preceding the 
loan’s next due date. All other loans use a method of reporting 
delinquencies that considers a loan delinquent if a monthly 
payment has not been received by the close of business on the 
loan’s next due date.

As a general policy, residential first mortgages, home 

equity loans and installment loans are classified as non-accrual 
when loan payments are 90 days contractually past due. Credit 
cards and unsecured revolving loans generally accrue interest 
until payments are 180 days past due. Home equity loans in 
regulated bank entities are classified as non-accrual if the 
related residential first mortgage is 90 days or more past due. 
Mortgage loans, other than Federal Housing Administration 
(FHA)-insured loans, are classified as non-accrual within 60 
days of notification that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy. 
Commercial market loans are placed on a cash (non-accrual) 
basis when it is determined, based on actual experience and a 
forward-looking assessment of the collectability of the loan in 
full, that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or 
when interest or principal is 90 days past due.

The policy for re-aging modified U.S. consumer loans to 

current status varies by product. Generally, one of the 
conditions to qualify for these modifications is that a 
minimum number of payments (typically ranging from one to 
three) be made. Upon modification, the loan is re-aged to 
current status. However, re-aging practices for certain open-
ended consumer loans, such as credit cards, are governed by 
Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) 
guidelines. For open-ended consumer loans subject to FFIEC 
guidelines, one of the conditions for a loan to be re-aged to 
current status is that at least three consecutive minimum 
monthly payments, or the equivalent amount, must be 
received. In addition, under FFIEC guidelines, the number of 
times that such a loan can be re-aged is subject to limitations 
(generally once in 12 months and twice in five years). 
Furthermore, FHA and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) 
loans are modified under those respective agencies’ guidelines 
and payments are not always required in order to re-age a 
modified loan to current.

14.   LOANS

Citigroup loans are reported in two categories—consumer and 
corporate. These categories are classified primarily according 
to the segment and subsegment that manage the loans.

Consumer Loans
Consumer loans represent loans and leases managed primarily 
by GCB and Corporate/Other. The following table provides 
Citi’s consumer loans by loan type:

Citigroup has established a risk management process to 
monitor, evaluate and manage the principal risks associated 
with its consumer loan portfolio. Credit quality indicators that 
are actively monitored include delinquency status, consumer 
credit scores (FICO) and loan to value (LTV) ratios, each as 
discussed in more detail below.

Included in the loan table above are lending products 
whose terms may give rise to greater credit issues. Credit 
cards with below-market introductory interest rates and 
interest-only loans are examples of such products. These 
products are closely managed using credit techniques that are 
intended to mitigate their higher inherent risk.

During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the 
Company sold and/or reclassified to held-for-sale, $4.9 billion  
and $9.7 billion, respectively, of consumer loans.

Consumer Credit Scores (FICO)
In the U.S., independent credit agencies rate an individual’s 
risk for assuming debt based on the individual’s credit history 
and assign every consumer a “FICO” (Fair Isaac Corporation) 
credit score. These scores are continually updated by the 
agencies based upon an individual’s credit actions (e.g., taking 
out a loan or missed or late payments).

The following tables provide details on the FICO scores 

for Citi’s U.S. consumer loan portfolio based on end-of-period 
receivables (commercial market loans are excluded from the 
table since they are business based and FICO scores are not a 
primary driver in their credit evaluation). FICO scores are 
updated monthly for substantially all of the portfolio or, 
otherwise, on a quarterly basis for the remaining portfolio.

Impaired Consumer Loans
A loan is considered impaired when Citi believes it is probable 
that all amounts due according to the original contractual 
terms of the loan will not be collected. Impaired consumer 
loans include non-accrual commercial market loans, as well as 
smaller-balance homogeneous loans whose terms have been 
modified due to the borrower’s financial difficulties and where 
Citi has granted a concession to the borrower. These 
modifications may include interest rate reductions and/or 
principal forgiveness. Impaired consumer loans exclude 
smaller-balance homogeneous loans that have not been 
modified and are carried on a non-accrual basis. 

(1)  Excludes loans guaranteed by U.S. government entities, loans subject to 

long-term standby commitments (LTSCs) with U.S. government-
sponsored entities and loans recorded at fair value.

(2)  Excludes balances where FICO was not available. Such amounts are not 

material.

Loan to Value (LTV) Ratios
LTV ratios (loan balance divided by appraised value) are 
calculated at origination and updated by applying market price 
data.

The following tables provide details on the LTV ratios for 

Citi’s U.S. consumer mortgage portfolios. LTV ratios are 
updated monthly using the most recent Core Logic Home 
Price Index data available for substantially all of the portfolio 
applied at the Metropolitan Statistical Area level, if available, 
or the state level if not. The remainder of the portfolio is 
updated in a similar manner using the Federal Housing 
Finance Agency indices.

(1)  Post-modification balances include past due amounts that are capitalized at the modification date.
(2)  Post-modification balances in North America include $53 million of residential first mortgages and $21 million of home equity loans to borrowers who have gone 

through Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the year ended December 31, 2017. These amounts include $36 million of residential first mortgages and $18 million of home 
equity loans that were newly classified as TDRs during 2017, based on previously received OCC guidance.

(3)  Represents portion of contractual loan principal that is non-interest bearing, but still due from the borrower. Such deferred principal is charged off at the time of 

permanent modification to the extent that the related loan balance exceeds the underlying collateral value.

(4)  Represents portion of contractual loan principal that is non-interest bearing and, depending upon borrower performance, eligible for forgiveness.
(5)  Represents portion of contractual loan principal that was forgiven at the time of permanent modification.
(6)    Commercial banking loans are generally borrower-specific modifications and incorporate changes in the amount and/or timing of principal and/or interest.
(7)    Post-modification balances in North America include $74 million of residential first mortgages and $22 million of home equity loans to borrowers who have gone 

through Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the year ended December 31, 2016. These amounts include $48 million of residential first mortgages and $20 million of home 
equity loans that were newly classified as TDRs during 2016, based on previously received OCC guidance.

(8)    The above tables reflect activity for loans outstanding as of the end of the reporting period that were considered TDRs.

201

The following table presents consumer TDRs that defaulted, for which the payment default occurred within one year of a 

permanent modification. Default is defined as 60 days past due, except for classifiably managed commercial banking loans, where 
default is defined as 90 days past due.

(1)  Loans secured primarily by real estate.

The Company sold and/or reclassified to held-for-sale 
$1.0 billion and $4.2 billion of corporate loans during the 
years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The 
Company did not have significant purchases of corporate 
loans classified as held-for-investment for the years ended 
December 31, 2017 or 2016.

Delinquency Status
Citi generally does not manage corporate loans on a 
delinquency basis. Corporate loans are identified as impaired 
and placed on a cash (non-accrual) basis when it is 
determined, based on actual experience and a forward-
looking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full, 
that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when 
interest or principal is 90 days past due, except when the 
loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection. 
Any interest accrued on impaired corporate loans and leases 
is reversed at 90 days and charged against current earnings, 
and interest is thereafter included in earnings only to the 
extent actually received in cash. When there is doubt 
regarding the ultimate collectability of principal, all cash 
receipts are thereafter applied to reduce the recorded 
investment in the loan. While corporate loans are generally 
managed based on their internally assigned risk rating (see 
further discussion below), the following tables present 
delinquency information by corporate loan type.

(1)  Corporate loans that are 90 days past due are generally classified as non-accrual. Corporate loans are considered past due when principal or interest is 

contractually due but unpaid.

(2)  Non-accrual loans generally include those loans that are 

 90 days past due or those loans for which Citi believes, based on actual experience and a forward-

looking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full, that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful.

(3)  Loans less than 30 days past due are presented as current.
(4)  Total loans include loans at fair value, which are not included in the various delinquency columns. 

Citigroup has a risk management process to monitor, 
evaluate and manage the principal risks associated with its 
corporate loan portfolio. As part of its risk management 
process, Citi assigns numeric risk ratings to its corporate 
loan facilities based on quantitative and qualitative 
assessments of the obligor and facility. These risk ratings are 
reviewed at least annually or more often if material events 
related to the obligor or facility warrant. Factors considered 
in assigning the risk ratings include financial condition of the 
obligor, qualitative assessment of management and strategy, 
amount and sources of repayment, amount and type of 
collateral and guarantee arrangements, amount and type of 
any contingencies associated with the obligor and the 
obligor’s industry and geography.

The obligor risk ratings are defined by ranges of default 
probabilities. The facility risk ratings are defined by ranges 
of loss norms, which are the product of the probability of 
default and the loss given default. The investment grade 
rating categories are similar to the category BBB-/Baa3 and 
above as defined by S&P and Moody’s. Loans classified 
according to the bank regulatory definitions as special 
mention, substandard and doubtful will have risk ratings 
within the non-investment grade categories.

(1)  Recorded investment in a loan includes net deferred loan fees and 

costs, unamortized premium or discount, less any direct write-downs.

(2)  Held-for-investment loans are accounted for on an amortized cost 

basis.

Impaired collateral-dependent loans and leases, where 
repayment is expected to be provided solely by the sale of 
the underlying collateral and there are no other available and 
reliable sources of repayment, are written down to the lower 
of cost or collateral value, less cost to sell. Cash-basis loans 
are returned to an accrual status when all contractual 
principal and interest amounts are reasonably assured of 
repayment and there is a sustained period of repayment 
performance, generally six months, in accordance with the 
contractual terms of the loan.

(1)  TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of principal payments may involve principal forgiveness or deferral of periodic and/or final principal 

payments. Because forgiveness of principal is rare for corporate loans, modifications typically have little to no impact on the loans’ projected cash flows and 
thus little to no impact on the allowance established for the loans.  Charge-offs for amounts deemed uncollectable may be recorded at the time of the 
restructuring or may have already been recorded in prior periods such that no charge-off is required at the time of the modification.

(2)  TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of interest payments may involve a below-market interest rate.

The following table presents total corporate loans modified in a TDR as well as those TDRs that defaulted and for which the 
payment default occurred within one year of a permanent modification. Default is defined as 60 days past due, except for 
classifiably managed commercial banking loans, where default is defined as 90 days past due.

(2)  2015 includes a reclassification of $271 million of Allowance for loan losses to Allowance for unfunded lending commitments, included in Other, net. This 
reclassification reflects the re-attribution of $271 million in Allowances for credit losses between the funded and unfunded portions of the corporate credit 
portfolios and does not reflect a change in the underlying credit performance of these portfolios.

(3)  Represents additional credit loss reserves for unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit recorded in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(1)  Primarily related to the sales of the Latin America Retirement Services and Japan cards businesses completed in 2015, and agreements to sell certain 

businesses in Citi Holdings as of December 31, 2015. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2)  Goodwill impairment related to reporting units subsequently sold, including Citi Holdings—Consumer Finance South Korea of $16 million and Citi 

(3)  Primarily related to the sale of the private equity services business completed in 2016 and agreements to sell Argentina and Brazil consumer operations as of 

Holdings—Consumer Latin America of $15 million.

December 31, 2016.

(4)  Primarily related to the sale of a fixed income analytics business and a fixed income index business completed in 2017 and an agreement to sell a Mexico 

asset management business as of December 31, 2017. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(5)  Goodwill impairment related to the mortgage servicing business upon transfer from North America GCB to Corporate/Other effective January 1, 2017.
(6)  All Citi Holdings reporting units are presented in Corporate/Other. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
(7)  December 31, 2015 has been restated to reflect intersegment goodwill allocations that resulted from the reorganizations in 2016 and on January 1, 2017 

including transfers of GCB businesses to ICG and to Corporate/Other. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

      Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the level 
below each business segment (referred to as a reporting 
unit). The Company performed its annual goodwill 
impairment test as of July 1, 2017. The fair values of the 
Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values 
by approximately 32% to 168% and no reporting unit is at 
risk of impairment, except for Citi Holdings—Consumer 
Latin America. 

Interim impairment tests were performed for Citi 

Holdings—Consumer Latin America, which is reported as 
part of Corporate/Other, for all other quarters in 2017. 

While there is no indication of impairment, each interim 
impairment test showed that the fair value of Citi Holdings
—Consumer Latin America reporting unit, which has $16 
million of goodwill, only marginally exceeded its carrying 
value. The fair value as a percentage of allocated book value 
as of December 31, 2017 was 111%. Subsequently, on 
January 31, 2018, Citi executed a definitive agreement to 
sell the reporting unit and allocated the entire goodwill to 
the sale, which is expected to result in a pre-tax gain upon 
closing.

211

      Further, effective January 1, 2017, the mortgage 
servicing business in North America GCB was reorganized 
and is now reported as part of Corporate/Other. Goodwill 
was allocated to the transferred business based on its 
relative fair value to the legacy North America GCB 
reporting unit. An interim test was performed under both the 
legacy and current reporting unit structures, which resulted 
in full impairment of the $28 million of allocated goodwill 
upon transfer to Citi Holdings—REL, recorded in Operating 
expenses in 2017.

Includes borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Banks and other 
market participants. At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, 
collateralized short-term advances from the Federal Home Loan Banks 
were $23.8 billion and $12.0 billion, respectively.

Borrowings under bank lines of credit may be at interest 

rates based on LIBOR, CD rates, the prime rate or bids 
submitted by the banks. Citigroup pays commitment fees for 
its lines of credit.

Some of Citigroup’s non-bank subsidiaries have credit 
facilities with Citigroup’s subsidiary depository institutions, 
including Citibank. Borrowings under these facilities are 
secured in accordance with Section 23A of the Federal 
Reserve Act.

Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. (CGMHI) has 
borrowing agreements consisting of facilities that CGMHI 
has been advised are available, but where no contractual 
lending obligation exists. These arrangements are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis to ensure flexibility in meeting 
CGMHI’s short-term requirements.

Includes notes that are subordinated within certain countries, regions 
or subsidiaries.

(3)  Represents Citibank entities as well as other bank entities. At 

December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, collateralized long-term 
advances from the Federal Home Loan Banks were $19.3 billion and 
$21.6 billion, respectively.

(4)  Represents broker-dealer and other non-bank subsidiaries that are 

consolidated into Citigroup Inc., the parent holding company.

The Company issues both fixed- and variable-rate debt 

in a range of currencies. It uses derivative contracts, 
primarily interest rate swaps, to effectively convert a portion 
of its fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt. The maturity 
structure of the derivatives generally corresponds to the 
maturity structure of the debt being hedged. In addition, the 
Company uses other derivative contracts to manage the 
foreign exchange impact of certain debt issuances. At 
December 31, 2017, the Company’s overall weighted 
average interest rate for long-term debt was 3.57% on a 
contractual basis and 2.70% including the effects of 
derivative contracts.

18. REGULATORY CAPITAL 
 
Citigroup is subject to risk-based capital and leverage 
standards issued by the Federal Reserve Board, which 
constitute the U.S. Basel III rules. Citi’s U.S.-insured 
depository institution subsidiaries, including Citibank, are 
subject to similar standards issued by their respective primary 
federal bank regulatory agencies. These standards are used to 
evaluate capital adequacy and include the required minimums 
shown in the following table. The regulatory agencies are 

 

required by law to take specific, prompt corrective actions 
with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital 
standards.

 The following table sets forth for Citigroup and Citibank 
the regulatory capital tiers, total risk-weighted assets, quarterly 
adjusted average total assets, Total Leverage Exposure, risk-
based capital ratios and leverage ratios in accordance with 
current regulatory standards (reflecting Basel III Transition 
Arrangements):

Citigroup’s and Citibank’s Total Capital as derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach was $202 billion and $150 billion, respectively.

(2)  Reflected in the table above are Citigroup’s and Citibank’s total risk-weighted assets as derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach. At December 31, 

2017, Citigroup’s and Citibank’s total risk-weighted assets as derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches were $1,135 billion and $955 billion, respectively. 

(3)  Tier 1 Leverage ratio denominator. 
(4)  Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator. 
(5)  As of December 31, 2017, Citigroup’s and Citibank’s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were the lower derived under the Basel 

III Standardized Approach, whereas the reportable Total Capital ratios were the lower derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework. 

(6)  Commencing on January 1, 2018, Citigroup and Citibank will be required to maintain a stated minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 3%, and Citibank will 

be required to maintain a Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6% to be considered “well capitalized.”

N/A  Not applicable

As indicated in the table above, Citigroup and Citibank 

were “well capitalized” under the current federal bank 
regulatory agency definitions as of December 31, 2017.

216

Banking Subsidiaries—Constraints on Dividends
There are various legal limitations on the ability of Citigroup’s 
subsidiary depository institutions to extend credit, pay 
dividends, or otherwise supply funds to Citigroup and its non-
bank subsidiaries. The approval of the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency is required if total dividends 
declared in any calendar year were to exceed amounts 
specified by the applicable agency’s regulations. 

In determining the dividends, each subsidiary depository 

institution must also consider its effect on applicable risk-
based capital and leverage ratio requirements, as well as 
policy statements of the federal bank regulatory agencies that 
indicate that banking organizations should generally pay 
dividends out of current operating earnings. Citigroup 
received $7.5 billion and $13.8 billion in dividends from 
Citibank during 2017 and 2016, respectively.

(1)  Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, changes in DVA are reflected as a component of AOCI, pursuant to the adoption of only the provisions of ASU 2016-01 
relating to the presentation of DVA on fair value option liabilities. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this 
change.

(2)  Primarily driven by Citi’s pay fixed/receive floating interest rate swap programs that hedge the floating rates on liabilities. 
(3)  Primarily reflects adjustments based on the quarterly actuarial valuations of Citi’s significant pension and postretirement plans, annual actuarial valuations of 

all other plans and amortization of amounts previously recognized in Other comprehensive income. 

(4)  Primarily reflects the movements in (by order of impact) the Euro, Mexican peso, Polish zloty and Korean won against the U.S. dollar and changes in related 
tax effects and hedges for the year ended December 31, 2017. Primarily reflects the movements in (by order of impact) the Mexican peso, Euro, British pound 
and Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar and changes in related tax effects and hedges for the year ended December 31, 2016. Primarily reflects the 
movements in (by order of impact) the Mexican peso, Brazilian real, Korean won and Euro against the U.S. dollar and changes in related tax effects and 
hedges for the year ended December 31, 2015.
In the second quarter of 2017, Citi early adopted ASU No. 2017-08. Upon adoption, a cumulative effect adjustment was recorded to reduce retained earnings, 
effective January 1, 2017, for the incremental amortization of cumulative fair value hedge adjustments on callable state and municipal debt securities. See 
Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In the fourth quarter of 2017, Citi adopted ASU 2018-02, which transferred these amounts from AOCI to Retained earnings. See Note 1 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

21. SECURITIZATIONS AND VARIABLE INTEREST 
ENTITIES
 
Uses of Special Purpose Entities
A special purpose entity (SPE) is an entity designed to fulfill a 
specific limited need of the company that organized it. The 
principal uses of SPEs by Citi are to obtain liquidity and 
favorable capital treatment by securitizing certain financial 
assets, to assist clients in securitizing their financial assets and 
to create investment products for clients. SPEs may be 
organized in various legal forms, including trusts, partnerships 
or corporations. In a securitization, through the SPE’s issuance 
of debt and equity instruments, certificates, commercial paper 
or other notes of indebtedness, the company transferring assets 
to the SPE converts all (or a portion) of those assets into cash 
before they would have been realized in the normal course of 
business. These issuances are recorded on the balance sheet of 
the SPE, which may or may not be consolidated onto the 
balance sheet of the company that organized the SPE.

Investors usually have recourse only to the assets in the 
SPE, but may also benefit from other credit enhancements, 
such as a collateral account, a line of credit or a liquidity 
facility, such as a liquidity put option or asset purchase 
agreement. Because of these enhancements, the SPE issuances 
typically obtain a more favorable credit rating than the 
transferor could obtain for its own debt issuances. This results 
in less expensive financing costs than unsecured debt. The 
SPE may also enter into derivative contracts in order to 
convert the yield or currency of the underlying assets to match 
the needs of the SPE investors or to limit or change the credit 
risk of the SPE. Citigroup may be the provider of certain 
credit enhancements as well as the counterparty to any related 
derivative contracts.

Most of Citigroup’s SPEs are variable interest entities 

(VIEs), as described below.
 
Variable Interest Entities
VIEs are entities that have either a total equity investment that 
is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities 
without additional subordinated financial support or whose 
equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling 
financial interest (i.e., ability to make significant decisions 
through voting rights or similar rights and a right to receive 
the expected residual returns of the entity or an obligation to 
absorb the expected losses of the entity). Investors that finance 
the VIE through debt or equity interests or other counterparties 
providing other forms of support, such as guarantees, certain 
fee arrangements or certain types of derivative contracts, are 
variable interest holders in the entity.

The variable interest holder, if any, that has a controlling 

financial interest in a VIE is deemed to be the primary 
beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. Citigroup would be 
deemed to have a controlling financial interest and be the 
primary beneficiary if it has both of the following 
characteristics:
• 

power to direct the activities of the VIE that most 
significantly impact the entity’s economic performance; 
and
an obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could 
potentially be significant to the VIE, or a right to receive 
benefits from the entity that could potentially be 
significant to the VIE. 

• 

The Company must evaluate each VIE to understand the 
purpose and design of the entity, the role the Company had in 
the entity’s design and its involvement in the VIE’s ongoing 
activities. The Company then must evaluate which activities 
most significantly impact the economic performance of the 
VIE and who has the power to direct such activities.

For those VIEs where the Company determines that it has 
the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact 
the VIE’s economic performance, the Company must then 
evaluate its economic interests, if any, and determine whether 
it could absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially 
be significant to the VIE. When evaluating whether the 
Company has an obligation to absorb losses that could 
potentially be significant, it considers the maximum exposure 
to such loss without consideration of probability. Such 
obligations could be in various forms, including, but not 
limited to, debt and equity investments, guarantees, liquidity 
agreements and certain derivative contracts.
 
a derivative counterparty (for example, interest rate swap, 
cross-currency swap or purchaser of credit protection under a 
credit default swap or total return swap where the Company 
pays the total return on certain assets to the SPE), (ii) act as 
underwriter or placement agent, (iii) provide administrative, 
trustee or other services or (iv) make a market in debt 
securities or other instruments issued by VIEs. The Company 
generally considers such involvement, by itself, not to be 
variable interests and thus not an indicator of power or 
potentially significant benefits or losses. 

In various other transactions, the Company may (i) act as

The previous tables do not include the following:
• 

certain venture capital investments made by some of the 
Company’s private equity subsidiaries, as the Company 
accounts for these investments in accordance with the 
Investment Company Audit Guide (codified in ASC Topic 
946);
certain investment funds for which the Company provides 
investment management services and personal estate 
trusts for which the Company provides administrative, 
trustee and/or investment management services; 
certain VIEs structured by third parties in which the 
Company holds securities in inventory, as these 
investments are made on arm’s-length terms; 
certain positions in mortgage-backed and asset-backed 
securities held by the Company, which are classified as 
Trading account assets or Investments, in which the 
Company has no other involvement with the related 
securitization entity deemed to be significant (for more 
information on these positions, see Notes 13 and 24 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements); 
certain representations and warranties exposures in legacy 
ICG-sponsored mortgage-backed and asset-backed 
securitizations, in which the Company has no variable 
interest or continuing involvement as servicer. The 
outstanding balance of mortgage loans securitized during 
2005 to 2008 in which the Company has no variable 
interest or continuing involvement as servicer was 
approximately $9 billion and $10 billion at December 31, 
2017 and 2016, respectively;
certain representations and warranties exposures in 
Citigroup residential mortgage securitizations, in which 
the original mortgage loan balances are no longer 
outstanding; and

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

•  VIEs such as trust preferred securities trusts used in 

connection with the Company’s funding activities. The 
Company does not have a variable interest in these trusts.

The asset balances for consolidated VIEs represent the 

carrying amounts of the assets consolidated by the Company. 
The carrying amount may represent the amortized cost or the 
current fair value of the assets depending on the legal form of 
the asset (e.g., loan or security) and the Company’s standard 
accounting policies for the asset type and line of business.

The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in which the 

Company has significant involvement represent the most 
current information available to the Company. In most cases, 
the asset balances represent an amortized cost basis without 
regard to impairments, unless fair value information is readily 
available to the Company.

The maximum funded exposure represents the balance 
sheet carrying amount of the Company’s investment in the 
VIE. It reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the VIE 
adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal payments 
received. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for 
increases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value 
recognized in earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded 
positions represents the remaining undrawn committed 
amount, including liquidity and credit facilities provided by 
the Company or the notional amount of a derivative 
instrument considered to be a variable interest. In certain 
transactions, the Company has entered into derivative 
instruments or other arrangements that are not considered 
variable interests in the VIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, cross-
currency swaps or where the Company is the purchaser of 
credit protection under a credit default swap or total return 
swap where the Company pays the total return on certain 
assets to the SPE). Receivables under such arrangements are 
not included in the maximum exposure amounts.

Consolidated VIEs
The Company engages in on-balance sheet securitizations, 
which are securitizations that do not qualify for sales 
treatment; thus, the assets remain on the Citi’s Consolidated 
Balance Sheet, and any proceeds received are recognized as 
secured liabilities. The consolidated VIEs represent hundreds 
of separate entities with which the Company is involved. In 
general, the third-party investors in the obligations of 
consolidated VIEs have legal recourse only to the assets of the 
respective VIEs and do not have such recourse to the 
Company, except where Citi has provided a guarantee to the 
investors or is the counterparty to certain derivative 

transactions involving the VIE. Thus, Citigroup’s maximum 
legal exposure to loss related to consolidated VIEs is 
significantly less than the carrying value of the consolidated 
VIE assets due to outstanding third-party financing. 
Intercompany assets and liabilities are excluded from Citi’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. All VIE assets are restricted from 
being sold or pledged as collateral. The cash flows from these 
assets are the only source used to pay down the associated 
liabilities, which are non-recourse to Citi’s general assets. See 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet for more information about 
these Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities.

Citigroup has the power to direct the activities that most 
significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts. 
Citigroup holds a seller’s interest and certain securities issued 
by the trusts, which could result in exposure to potentially 
significant losses or benefits from the trusts. Accordingly, the 
transferred credit card receivables remain on Citi’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet with no gain or loss recognized. 
The debt issued by the trusts to third parties is included on 
Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Citi utilizes securitizations as one of the sources of 

funding for its business in North America. The following table

Credit Card Securitizations
The Company securitizes credit card receivables through trusts 
established to purchase the receivables. Citigroup transfers 
receivables into the trusts on a non-recourse basis. Credit card 
securitizations are revolving securitizations; as customers pay 
their credit card balances, the cash proceeds are used to 
purchase new receivables and replenish the receivables in the 
trust.

Substantially all of Citigroup’s credit card securitization 
activity is through two trusts—Citibank Credit Card Master 
Trust (Master Trust) and Citibank Omni Master Trust (Omni 
Trust), with the substantial majority through the Master Trust. 
These trusts are consolidated entities because, as servicer,

Managed Loans
After securitization of credit card receivables, the Company 
continues to maintain credit card customer account 
relationships and provides servicing for receivables transferred 
to the trusts. As a result, the Company considers the 
securitized credit card receivables to be part of the business it 
manages. As Citigroup consolidates the credit card trusts, all 
managed securitized card receivables are on-balance sheet.

Funding, Liquidity Facilities and Subordinated Interests
As noted above, Citigroup securitizes credit card receivables 
through two securitization trusts—Master Trust and Omni 
Trust. The liabilities of the trusts are included on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet, excluding those retained by 
Citigroup.
 

226

Mortgage Securitizations
Citigroup provides a wide range of mortgage loan products to 
a diverse customer base. Once originated, the Company often 
securitizes these loans through the use of VIEs. These VIEs 
are funded through the issuance of trust certificates backed 
solely by the transferred assets. These certificates have the 
same life as the transferred assets. In addition to providing a 
source of liquidity and less expensive funding, securitizing 
these assets also reduces Citi’s credit exposure to the 
borrowers. These mortgage loan securitizations are primarily 
non-recourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future 
credit losses to the purchasers of the securities issued by the 
trust. However, Citi’s U.S. consumer mortgage business 
generally retains the servicing rights and in certain instances 
retains investment securities, interest-only strips and residual 
interests in future cash flows from the trusts and also provides 
servicing for a limited number of ICG securitizations.

The Company securitizes mortgage loans generally 

through either a government-sponsored agency, such as Ginnie 
Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (U.S. agency-sponsored 
mortgages), or private-label (non-agency-sponsored 
mortgages) securitization. Citi is not the primary beneficiary 
of its U.S. agency-sponsored mortgage securitizations because 

Citigroup does not have the power to direct the activities of 
the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic 
performance. Therefore, Citi does not consolidate these U.S. 
agency-sponsored mortgage securitizations. Substantially all 
of the consumer loans sold or securitized through non-
consolidated trusts by Citigroup are U.S. prime residential 
mortgage loans. Retained interests in non-consolidated 
mortgage securitization trusts are classified as Trading 
account assets, except for MSRs, which are included in 
Mortgage servicing rights on Citigroup’s Consolidated 
Balance Sheet.

Citigroup does not consolidate certain non-agency-

sponsored mortgage securitizations because Citi is either not 
the servicer with the power to direct the significant activities 
of the entity or Citi is the servicer, but the servicing 
relationship is deemed to be a fiduciary relationship; therefore, 
Citi is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the entity.

In certain instances, the Company has (i) the power to 
direct the activities and (ii) the obligation to either absorb 
losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially 
significant to its non-agency-sponsored mortgage 
securitizations and, therefore, is the primary beneficiary and, 
thus, consolidates the VIE.

(1) The proceeds from new securitizations in 2016 and 2015 include $0.5 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively, related to personal loan securitizations.

Agency and non-agency securitization gains for the year 
ended December 31, 2017 were $73 million and $77 million, 
respectively. 

Agency and non-agency securitization gains for the year

Anticipated net credit losses, in this instance, do not represent total credit losses incurred to date, nor do they represent credit losses expected on retained interests

NM  Anticipated net credit losses are not meaningful due to U.S. agency guarantees.

The interests retained by Citi range from highly rated and/

or senior in the capital structure to unrated and/or residual 
interests.

The key assumptions used to value retained interests, and 
the sensitivity of the fair value to adverse changes of 10% and 
20% in each of the key assumptions, are set forth in the tables 

below. The negative effect of each change is calculated 
independently, holding all other assumptions constant. 
Because the key assumptions may not be independent, the net 
effect of simultaneous adverse changes in the key assumptions 
may be less than the sum of the individual effects shown 
below.

Mortgage Servicing Rights
In connection with the securitization of mortgage loans, Citi’s 
U.S. consumer mortgage business generally retains the 
servicing rights, which entitle the Company to a future stream 
of cash flows based on the outstanding principal balances of 
the loans and the contractual servicing fee. Failure to service 
the loans in accordance with contractual requirements may 
lead to a termination of the servicing rights and the loss of 
future servicing fees.

These transactions create an intangible asset referred to as 
mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), which are recorded at fair 
value on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of 
Citi’s capitalized MSRs was $558 million and $1.6 billion at 
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The MSRs 
correspond to principal loan balances of $66 billion and $168 
billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The 
following table summarizes the changes in capitalized MSRs:

sale of MSRs. 2016 amount includes sales of credit-challenged MSRs 
for which Citi paid the new servicer.

229

The fair value of the MSRs is primarily affected by 

changes in prepayments of mortgages that result from shifts in 
mortgage interest rates. Specifically, higher interest rates tend 
to lead to declining prepayments, which causes the fair value 
of the MSRs to increase. In managing this risk, Citigroup 
economically hedges a significant portion of the value of its 
MSRs through the use of interest rate derivative contracts, 
forward purchase and sale commitments of mortgage-backed 
securities and purchased securities all classified as Trading 
account assets. The Company receives fees during the course 
of servicing previously securitized mortgages. The amounts of 
these fees were as follows:

In the Consolidated Statement of Income these fees are

Citi signed agreements during the first quarter of 2017 to 
effectively exit its direct U.S. mortgage servicing operations 
by the end of 2018 to intensify focus on originations. The exit 
of the mortgage servicing operations included the sale of 
mortgage servicing rights and execution of a subservicing 
agreement for the remaining Citi-owned loans and certain 
other mortgage servicing rights. As part of this transaction, 
Citi is also transferring certain employees. See Note 2 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on 
the exit of the U.S. mortgage servicing operations and sale of 
MSRs.

Re-securitizations
Citigroup engages in re-securitization transactions in which 
debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new 
beneficial interests. Citi did not transfer non-agency (private-
label) securities to re-securitization entities during the years 
ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. These securities are 
backed by either residential or commercial mortgages and are 
often structured on behalf of clients. 

As of December 31, 2017, the fair value of Citi-retained 

interests in private-label re-securitization transactions 
structured by Citi totaled approximately $79 million (all 
related to re-securitization transactions executed prior to 
2016), which has been recorded in Trading account assets. Of 
this amount, substantially all was related to subordinated 
beneficial interests. As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of 
Citi-retained interests in private-label re-securitization 
transactions structured by Citi totaled approximately $126 
million (all related to re-securitization transactions executed 
prior to 2016). Of this amount, substantially all was related to 
subordinated beneficial interests. The original par value of 
private-label re-securitization transactions in which Citi holds 
a retained interest as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was 
approximately $887 million and $1.3 billion, respectively.

The Company also re-securitizes U.S. government-agency 

guaranteed mortgage-backed (agency) securities. During the 
years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, Citi transferred 

agency securities with a fair value of approximately $26.6 
billion and $26.5 billion, respectively, to re-securitization 
entities. 

As of December 31, 2017, the fair value of Citi-retained 
interests in agency re-securitization transactions structured by 
Citi totaled approximately $2.1 billion (including $854 million 
related to re-securitization transactions executed in 2017) 
compared to $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2016 (including 
$741 million related to re-securitization transactions executed 
in 2016), which is recorded in Trading account assets. The 
original fair value of agency re-securitization transactions in 
which Citi holds a retained interest as of December 31, 2017 
and 2016 was approximately $68.3 billion and $71.8 billion, 
respectively.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company did not 

consolidate any private-label or agency re-securitization 
entities.

Citi-Administered Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Conduits
The Company is active in the asset-backed commercial paper 
conduit business as administrator of several multi-seller 
commercial paper conduits and also as a service provider to 
single-seller and other commercial paper conduits sponsored 
by third parties.

Citi’s multi-seller commercial paper conduits are designed 
to provide the Company’s clients access to low-cost funding in 
the commercial paper markets. The conduits purchase assets 
from or provide financing facilities to clients and are funded 
by issuing commercial paper to third-party investors. The 
conduits generally do not purchase assets originated by Citi. 
The funding of the conduits is facilitated by the liquidity 
support and credit enhancements provided by the Company.

As administrator to Citi’s conduits, the Company is 
generally responsible for selecting and structuring assets 
purchased or financed by the conduits, making decisions 
regarding the funding of the conduits, including determining 
the tenor and other features of the commercial paper issued, 
monitoring the quality and performance of the conduits’ assets 
and facilitating the operations and cash flows of the conduits. 
In return, the Company earns structuring fees from customers 
for individual transactions and earns an administration fee 
from the conduit, which is equal to the income from the client 
program and liquidity fees of the conduit after payment of 
conduit expenses. This administration fee is fairly stable, since 
most risks and rewards of the underlying assets are passed 
back to the clients. Once the asset pricing is negotiated, most 
ongoing income, costs and fees are relatively stable as a 
percentage of the conduit’s size.

The conduits administered by Citi do not generally invest 
in liquid securities that are formally rated by third parties. The 
assets are privately negotiated and structured transactions that 
are generally designed to be held by the conduit, rather than 
actively traded and sold. The yield earned by the conduit on 
each asset is generally tied to the rate on the commercial paper 
issued by the conduit, thus passing interest rate risk to the 
client. Each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with 
transaction-specific credit enhancement features provided by 
the third-party client seller, including over-collateralization, 
cash and excess spread collateral accounts, direct recourse or 
third-party guarantees. These credit enhancements are sized 

230

with the objective of approximating a credit rating of A or 
above, based on Citi’s internal risk ratings. At December 31, 
2017 and 2016, the conduits had approximately $19.3 billion 
and $19.7 billion of purchased assets outstanding, 
respectively, and had incremental funding commitments with 
clients of approximately $14.5 billion and $12.8 billion, 
respectively.

Substantially all of the funding of the conduits is in the 
form of short-term commercial paper. At December 31, 2017 
and 2016, the weighted average remaining lives of the 
commercial paper issued by the conduits were approximately 
51 and 55 days, respectively. 

The primary credit enhancement provided to the conduit 

investors is in the form of transaction-specific credit 
enhancements described above. In addition to the transaction-
specific credit enhancements, the conduits, other than the 
government guaranteed loan conduit, have obtained a letter of 
credit from the Company, which is equal to at least 8% to 10% 
of the conduit’s assets with a minimum of $200 million. The 
letters of credit provided by the Company to the conduits total 
approximately $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion as of 
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The net result 
across multi-seller conduits administered by the Company is 
that, in the event defaulted assets exceed the transaction-
specific credit enhancements described above, any losses in 
each conduit are allocated first to the Company and then to the 
commercial paper investors.

Citigroup also provides the conduits with two forms of 
liquidity agreements that are used to provide funding to the 
conduits in the event of a market disruption, among other 
events. Each asset of the conduits is supported by a 
transaction-specific liquidity facility in the form of an asset 
purchase agreement (APA). Under the APA, the Company has 
generally agreed to purchase non-defaulted eligible 
receivables from the conduit at par. The APA is not designed 
to provide credit support to the conduit, as it generally does 
not permit the purchase of defaulted or impaired assets. Any 
funding under the APA will likely subject the underlying 
conduit clients to increased interest costs. In addition, the 
Company provides the conduits with program-wide liquidity 
in the form of short-term lending commitments. Under these 
commitments, the Company has agreed to lend to the conduits 
in the event of a short-term disruption in the commercial paper 
market, subject to specified conditions. The Company receives 
fees for providing both types of liquidity agreements and 
considers these fees to be on fair market terms.

Finally, Citi is one of several named dealers in the 

commercial paper issued by the conduits and earns a market-
based fee for providing such services. Along with third-party 
dealers, the Company makes a market in the commercial paper 
and may from time to time fund commercial paper pending 
sale to a third party. On specific dates with less liquidity in the 
market, the Company may hold in inventory commercial paper 
issued by conduits administered by the Company, as well as 
conduits administered by third parties. Separately, in the 
normal course of business, Citi purchases commercial paper, 
including commercial paper issued by Citigroup's conduits. At 
December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company owned $9.3 
billion and $9.7 billion, respectively, of the commercial paper 
issued by its administered conduits. The Company's purchases 

were not driven by market illiquidity and, other than the 
amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention 
rules, the Company is not obligated under any agreement to 
purchase the commercial paper issued by the conduits.
The asset-backed commercial paper conduits are 

consolidated by Citi. The Company has determined that, 
through its roles as administrator and liquidity provider, it has 
the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact 
the entities’ economic performance. These powers include its 
ability to structure and approve the assets purchased by the 
conduits, its ongoing surveillance and credit mitigation 
activities, its ability to sell or repurchase assets out of the 
conduits and its liability management. In addition, as a result 
of all the Company’s involvement described above, it was 
concluded that Citi has an economic interest that could 
potentially be significant. However, the assets and liabilities of 
the conduits are separate and apart from those of Citigroup. 
No assets of any conduit are available to satisfy the creditors 
of Citigroup or any of its other subsidiaries.

Collateralized Loan Obligations
A collateralized loan obligation (CLO) is a VIE that purchases 
a portfolio of assets consisting primarily of non-investment 
grade corporate loans. CLOs issue multiple tranches of debt 
and equity to investors to fund the asset purchases and pay 
upfront expenses associated with forming the CLO. A third-
party asset manager is contracted by the CLO to purchase the 
underlying assets from the open market and monitor the credit 
risk associated with those assets. Over the term of a CLO, the 
asset manager directs purchases and sales of assets in a 
manner consistent with the CLO’s asset management 
agreement and indenture. In general, the CLO asset manager 
will have the power to direct the activities of the entity that 
most significantly impact the economic performance of the 
CLO. Investors in a CLO, through their ownership of debt 
and/or equity in it, can also direct certain activities of the 
CLO, including removing its asset manager under limited 
circumstances, optionally redeeming the notes, voting on 
amendments to the CLO’s operating documents and other 
activities. A CLO has a finite life, typically 12 years.

Citi serves as a structuring and placement agent with 
respect to the CLOs. Typically, the debt and equity of the 
CLOs are sold to third-party investors. On occasion, certain 
Citi entities may purchase some portion of a CLO’s liabilities 
for investment purposes. In addition, Citi may purchase, 
typically in the secondary market, certain securities issued by 
the CLOs to support its market making activities.

The Company does not generally have the power to direct 

the activities that most significantly impact the economic 
performance of the CLOs, as this power is generally held by a 
third-party asset manager of the CLO. As such, those CLOs 
are not consolidated.

Asset-Based Financing
The Company provides loans and other forms of financing to 
VIEs that hold assets. Those loans are subject to the same 
credit approvals as all other loans originated or purchased by 
the Company. Financings in the form of debt securities or 
derivatives are, in most circumstances, reported in Trading 
account assets and accounted for at fair value through 
earnings. The Company generally does not have the power to 
direct the activities that most significantly impact these VIEs’ 
economic performance; thus, it does not consolidate them.
 
assets of the unconsolidated VIEs with significant 
involvement and Citi’s maximum exposure to loss are shown 
below. For Citi to realize the maximum loss, the VIE 
(borrower) would have to default with no recovery from the 
assets held by the VIE.

Municipal Securities Tender Option Bond (TOB) Trusts
Municipal TOB trusts may hold fixed- or floating-rate, taxable 
or tax-exempt securities issued by state and local governments 
and municipalities. TOB trusts are typically structured as 
single-issuer entities whose assets are purchased from either 
the Company or from other investors in the municipal 
securities market. TOB trusts finance the purchase of their 
municipal assets by issuing two classes of certificates: long-
dated, floating rate certificates (“Floaters”) that are putable 
pursuant to a liquidity facility and residual interest certificates 
(“Residuals”). The Floaters are purchased by third-party 
investors, typically tax-exempt money market funds. The 
Residuals are purchased by the original owner of the 
municipal securities that are being financed.

From the Citigroup’s perspective, there are two types of 

TOB trusts: customer and non-customer. Customer TOB trusts 
are those trusts utilized by customers of the Company to 
finance their municipal securities investments. The Residuals 
issued by these trusts are purchased by the customer being 
financed. Non-customer TOB trusts are used by the Company 
to finance its own municipal securities investments; the 
Residuals issued by non-customer TOB trusts are purchased 
by the Company.

With respect to both customer and non-customer TOB 

trusts, Citi may provide remarketing agent services. If Floaters 
are optionally tendered and the Company, in its role as 
remarketing agent, is unable to find a new investor to purchase 
the optionally tendered Floaters within a specified period of 
time, Citigroup may, but is not obligated to, purchase the 
tendered Floaters into its own inventory. The level of the 
Company’s inventory of such Floaters fluctuates. 

For certain customer TOB trusts, Citi may also serve as a 

voluntary advance provider. In this capacity, the Company 
may, but is not obligated to, make loan advances to customer 
TOB trusts to purchase optionally tendered Floaters that have 
not otherwise been successfully remarketed to new investors. 
Such loans are secured by pledged Floaters. As of 
December 31, 2017, Citi had no outstanding voluntary 
advances to customer TOB trusts.

For certain non-customer trusts, the Company also 

provides credit enhancement. At December 31, 2017 and 
2016, approximately $62 million and $82 million, 
respectively, of the municipal bonds owned by non-customer 
TOB trusts were subject to a credit guarantee provided by the 
Company.

Citigroup also provides liquidity services to many 

customer and non-customer trusts. If a trust is unwound early 
due to an event other than a credit event on the underlying 
municipal bonds, the underlying municipal bonds are sold out 
of the trust and bond sale proceeds are used to redeem the 
outstanding trust certificates. If this results in a shortfall 
between the bond sale proceeds and the redemption price of 
the tendered Floaters, the Company, pursuant to the liquidity 
agreement, would be obligated to make a payment to the trust 
to satisfy that shortfall. For certain customer TOB trusts, 
Citigroup has also executed a reimbursement agreement with 
the holder of the Residual, pursuant to which the Residual 
holder is obligated to reimburse the Company for any payment 
the Company makes under the liquidity arrangement. These 
reimbursement agreements may be subject to daily margining 

based on changes in the market value of the underlying 
municipal bonds. In cases where a third party provides 
liquidity to a non-customer TOB trust, a similar 
reimbursement arrangement may be executed, whereby the 
Company (or a consolidated subsidiary of the Company), as 
Residual holder, would absorb any losses incurred by the 
liquidity provider.

For certain other non-customer TOB trusts, Citi serves as 

tender option provider. The tender option provider 
arrangement allows Floater holders to put their interests 
directly to the Company at any time, subject to the requisite 
notice period requirements, at a price of par.

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, liquidity agreements 
provided with respect to customer TOB trusts totaled $3.2 
billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, of which $2.0 billion and 
$2.1 billion, respectively, were offset by reimbursement 
agreements. For the remaining exposure related to TOB 
transactions, where the residual owned by the customer was at 
least 25% of the bond value at the inception of the transaction, 
no reimbursement agreement was executed. 

Citi considers both customer and non-customer TOB 

trusts to be VIEs. Customer TOB trusts are not consolidated 
by the Company, as the power to direct the activities that most 
significantly impact the trust’s economic performance rests 
with the customer Residual holder, which may unilaterally 
cause the sale of the trust’s bonds.

Non-customer TOB trusts generally are consolidated 

because the Company holds the Residual interest and thus has 
the unilateral power to cause the sale of the trust’s bonds.

The Company also provides other liquidity agreements or 
letters of credit to customer-sponsored municipal investment 
funds, which are not variable interest entities, and 
municipality-related issuers that totaled $6.1 billion and $7.4 
billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These 
liquidity agreements and letters of credit are offset by 
reimbursement agreements with various term-out provisions.

Municipal Investments
Municipal investment transactions include debt and equity 
interests in partnerships that finance the construction and 
rehabilitation of low-income housing, facilitate lending in new 
or underserved markets or finance the construction or 
operation of renewable municipal energy facilities. Citi 
generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and 
earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits and 
grants earned from the investments made by the partnership. 
The Company may also provide construction loans or 
permanent loans for the development or operation of real 
estate properties held by partnerships. These entities are 
generally considered VIEs. The power to direct the activities 
of these entities is typically held by the general partner. 
Accordingly, these entities are not consolidated by Citigroup.

Client Intermediation
Client intermediation transactions represent a range of 
transactions designed to provide investors with specified 
returns based on the returns of an underlying security, 
referenced asset or index. These transactions include credit-
linked notes and equity-linked notes. In these transactions, the 
VIE typically obtains exposure to the underlying security, 
referenced asset or index through a derivative instrument, such 
as a total-return swap or a credit-default swap. In turn, the VIE 
issues notes to investors that pay a return based on the 
specified underlying security, referenced asset or index. The 
VIE invests the proceeds in a financial asset or a guaranteed 
insurance contract that serves as collateral for the derivative 
contract over the term of the transaction. The Company’s 
involvement in these transactions includes being the 
counterparty to the VIE’s derivative instruments and investing 
in a portion of the notes issued by the VIE. In certain 
transactions, the investor’s maximum risk of loss is limited 
and the Company absorbs risk of loss above a specified level. 
Citi does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIEs 
that most significantly impact their economic performance and 
thus it does not consolidate them.

Citi’s maximum risk of loss in these transactions is 

defined as the amount invested in notes issued by the VIE and 
the notional amount of any risk of loss absorbed by Citi 
through a separate instrument issued by the VIE. The 
derivative instrument held by the Company may generate a 
receivable from the VIE (for example, where the Company 
purchases credit protection from the VIE in connection with 
the VIE’s issuance of a credit-linked note), which is 
collateralized by the assets owned by the VIE. These 
derivative instruments are not considered variable interests 
and any associated receivables are not included in the 
calculation of maximum exposure to the VIE.

The proceeds from new securitizations related to Citi’s 

client intermediation transactions for the years ended 
December 31, 2017 and 2016 totaled approximately $1.1 
billion and $2.3 billion, respectively.

Investment Funds
The Company is the investment manager for certain 
investment funds and retirement funds that invest in various 
asset classes including private equity, hedge funds, real estate, 
fixed income and infrastructure. Citigroup earns a 
management fee, which is a percentage of capital under 
management, and may earn performance fees. In addition, for 
some of these funds the Company has an ownership interest in 
the investment funds. Citi has also established a number of 
investment funds as opportunities for qualified employees to 
invest in private equity investments. The Company acts as 
investment manager for these funds and may provide 
employees with financing on both recourse and non-recourse 
bases for a portion of the employees’ investment 
commitments.

22.   DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES

• 

• 

• 

In the ordinary course of business, Citigroup enters into 
various types of derivative transactions, which include: 
•  Futures and forward contracts, which are commitments to 

buy or sell at a future date a financial instrument, 
commodity or currency at a contracted price and may be 
settled in cash or through delivery of an item readily 
convertible to cash.
Swap contracts, which are commitments to settle in cash 
at a future date or dates that may range from a few days to 
a number of years, based on differentials between 
specified indices or financial instruments, as applied to a 
notional principal amount.
 Option contracts, which give the purchaser, for a 
premium, the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell 
within a specified time a financial instrument, commodity 
or currency at a contracted price that may also be settled 
in cash, based on differentials between specified indices 
or prices.

Swaps, forwards and some option contracts are over-the-
counter (OTC) derivatives that are bilaterally negotiated with 
counterparties and settled with those counterparties, except for 
swap contracts that are novated and "cleared" through central 
counterparties (CCPs). Futures contracts and other option 
contracts are standardized contracts that are traded on an 
exchange with a CCP as the counterparty from the inception of 
the transaction. Citigroup enters into derivative contracts 
relating to interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and other 
market/credit risks for the following reasons:
• 

 Trading Purposes: Citigroup trades derivatives as an 
active market maker. Citigroup offers its customers 
derivatives in connection with their risk management 
actions to transfer, modify or reduce their interest rate, 
foreign exchange and other market/credit risks or for their 
own trading purposes. Citigroup also manages its 
derivative risk positions through offsetting trade activities, 
controls focused on price verification and daily reporting 
of positions to senior managers.
 Hedging: Citigroup uses derivatives in connection with 
its own risk management activities to hedge certain risks 
or reposition the risk profile of the Company. Hedging 
may be accomplished by applying hedge accounting in 
accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or 
by an economic hedge. For example, Citigroup issues 
fixed-rate long-term debt and then enters into a receive-
fixed, pay-variable-rate interest rate swap with the same 
tenor and notional amount to synthetically convert the 
interest payments to a net variable-rate basis. This 
strategy is the most common form of an interest rate 
hedge, as it minimizes net interest cost in certain yield 
curve environments. Derivatives are also used to manage 
market risks inherent in specific groups of on-balance 
sheet assets and liabilities, including AFS securities, 
commodities and borrowings, as well as other interest-
sensitive assets and liabilities. In addition, foreign 
exchange contracts are used to hedge non-U.S.-dollar-

denominated debt, foreign currency-denominated AFS 
securities and net investment exposures. 

Derivatives may expose Citigroup to market, credit or 

liquidity risks in excess of the amounts recorded on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Market risk on a derivative 
product is the exposure created by potential fluctuations in 
interest rates, market prices, foreign exchange rates and other 
factors and is a function of the type of product, the volume of 
transactions, the tenor and terms of the agreement and the 
underlying volatility. Credit risk is the exposure to loss in the 
event of nonperformance by the other party to satisfy a 
derivative liability where the value of any collateral held by 
Citi is not adequate to cover such losses. The recognition in 
earnings of unrealized gains on derivative transactions is 
subject to management’s assessment of the probability of 
counterparty default. Liquidity risk is the potential exposure 
that arises when the size of a derivative position may affect the 
ability to monetize the position in a reasonable period of time 
and at a reasonable cost in periods of high volatility and 
financial stress. 

Derivative transactions are customarily documented under 

industry standard master netting agreements, which provide 
that following an event of default, the non-defaulting party 
may promptly terminate all transactions between the parties 
and determine the net amount due to be paid to, or by, the 
defaulting party. Events of default include (i) failure to make a 
payment on a derivatives transaction that remains uncured 
following applicable notice and grace periods, (ii) breach of 
agreement that remains uncured after applicable notice and 
grace periods, (iii) breach of a representation, (iv) cross 
default, either to third-party debt or to other derivative 
transactions entered into between the parties, or, in some 
cases, their affiliates, (v) the occurrence of a merger or 
consolidation which results in a party’s becoming a materially 
weaker credit and (vi) the cessation or repudiation of any 
applicable guarantee or other credit support document. 
Obligations under master netting agreements are often secured 
by collateral posted under an industry standard credit support 
annex to the master netting agreement. An event of default 
may also occur under a credit support annex if a party fails to 
make a collateral delivery that remains uncured following 
applicable notice and grace periods. 

The netting and collateral rights incorporated in the 
master netting agreements are considered to be legally 
enforceable if a supportive legal opinion has been obtained 
from counsel of recognized standing that provides (i) the 
requisite level of certainty regarding enforceability, and (ii) 
that the exercise of rights by the non-defaulting party to 
terminate and close-out transactions on a net basis under these 
agreements will not be stayed or avoided under applicable law 
upon an event of default, including bankruptcy, insolvency or 
similar proceeding. 

A legal opinion may not be sought for certain jurisdictions 

where local law is silent or unclear as to the enforceability of 
such rights or where adverse case law or conflicting regulation 
may cast doubt on the enforceability of such rights. In some 
jurisdictions and for some counterparty types, the insolvency 
law may not provide the requisite level of certainty. For 

234

example, this may be the case for certain sovereigns, 
municipalities, central banks and U.S. pension plans. 

Exposure to credit risk on derivatives is affected by 

market volatility, which may impair the ability of 
counterparties to satisfy their obligations to the Company. 
Credit limits are established and closely monitored for 
customers engaged in derivatives transactions. Citi considers 
the level of legal certainty regarding enforceability of its 
offsetting rights under master netting agreements and credit 
support annexes to be an important factor in its risk 
management process. Specifically, Citi generally transacts 
much lower volumes of derivatives under master netting 
agreements where Citi does not have the requisite level of 
legal certainty regarding enforceability, because such 
derivatives consume greater amounts of single counterparty 
credit limits than those executed under enforceable master 
netting agreements. 

Cash collateral and security collateral in the form of G10 

government debt securities are often posted by a party to a 
master netting agreement to secure the net open exposure of 
the other party; the receiving party is free to commingle/
rehypothecate such collateral in the ordinary course of its 
business. Nonstandard collateral such as corporate bonds, 
municipal bonds, U.S. agency securities and/or MBS may also 
be pledged as collateral for derivative transactions. Security 
collateral posted to open and maintain a master netting 
agreement with a counterparty, in the form of cash and/or 
securities, may from time to time be segregated in an account 
at a third-party custodian pursuant to a tri-party account 
control agreement.

235

Information pertaining to Citigroup’s derivative activities, 

based on notional amounts, is presented in the table below. 
Derivative notional amounts are reference amounts from 
which contractual payments are derived and do not represent a 
complete and accurate measure of Citi’s exposure to derivative 
transactions. Rather, Citi’s derivative exposure arises primarily 
from market fluctuations (i.e., market risk), counterparty 
failure (i.e., credit risk) and/or periods of high volatility or 
financial stress (i.e., liquidity risk), as well as any market 
valuation adjustments that may be required on the

transactions. Moreover, notional amounts do not reflect the 
netting of offsetting trades. For example, if Citi enters into a 
receive-fixed interest rate swap with $100 million notional, 
and offsets this risk with an identical but opposite pay-fixed 
position with a different counterparty, $200 million in 
derivative notionals is reported, although these offsetting 
positions may result in de minimis overall market risk. 
Aggregate derivative notional amounts can fluctuate from 
period to period in the normal course of business based on 
Citi’s market share, levels of client activity and other factors.

(1)  The notional amounts presented in this table do not include hedge accounting relationships under ASC 815 where Citigroup is hedging the foreign currency risk of 
a net investment in a foreign operation by issuing a foreign currency-denominated debt instrument. The notional amount of such debt was $63 million and $1,825 
million at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.

(2)  Derivatives in hedge accounting relationships accounted for under ASC Topic 815 are recorded in either Other assets/Other liabilities or Trading account assets/

$
$

Trading account liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(3)  Management hedges represent derivative instruments used to mitigate certain economic risks, but for which hedge accounting is not applied. These derivatives are 

recorded in either Other assets/Other liabilities or Trading account assets/Trading account liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(4)  Credit derivatives are arrangements designed to allow one party (protection buyer) to transfer the credit risk of a “reference asset” to another party (protection 

seller). These arrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk associated with the reference asset without directly purchasing that asset. The 

236

Company enters into credit derivative positions for purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement, reduction of credit concentrations and diversification 
of overall risk.

The following tables present the gross and net fair values 

of the Company’s derivative transactions and the related 
offsetting amounts as of December 31, 2017 and 
December 31, 2016. Gross positive fair values are offset 
against gross negative fair values by counterparty pursuant to 
enforceable master netting agreements. Under 
ASC 815-10-45, payables and receivables in respect of cash 
collateral received from or paid to a given counterparty 
pursuant to a credit support annex are included in the 
offsetting amount if a legal opinion supporting the 
enforceability of netting and collateral rights has been 
obtained. GAAP does not permit similar offsetting for security 
collateral. 

In addition, the table for December 31, 2017 reflects rule 

changes adopted by clearing organizations that require or 
allow entities to elect to treat derivative assets, liabilities and 
the related variation margin as settlement of the related 
derivative fair values for legal and accounting purposes, as 
opposed to presenting gross derivative assets and liabilities 

that are subject to collateral, whereby the counterparties would 
record a related collateral payable or receivable. As a result, 
the table for December 31, 2017 reflects a reduction of 
approximately $100 billion of derivative assets and derivative 
liabilities that previously would have been reported on a gross 
basis, but are now settled and not subject to collateral. The 
table for December 31, 2016 presents derivative assets and 
liabilities as gross amounts subject to variation margin 
collateral that were netted under enforceable master netting 
agreements. Therefore, the net presentation of the affected 
items on the consolidated balance sheet is consistent for all 
periods. The tables also present amounts that are not permitted 
to be offset, such as security collateral or cash collateral 
posted at third-party custodians, but which would be eligible 
for offsetting to the extent an event of default occurred and a 
legal opinion supporting enforceability of the netting and 
collateral rights has been obtained.

For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 

the amounts recognized in Principal transactions in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income related to derivatives not 
designated in a qualifying hedging relationship, as well as the 
underlying non-derivative instruments, are presented in Note 6 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Citigroup presents 
this disclosure by business classification, showing derivative 
gains and losses related to its trading activities together with 
gains and losses related to non-derivative instruments within 
the same trading portfolios, as this represents the way these 
portfolios are risk managed.

The amounts recognized in Other revenue in the 

Consolidated Statement of Income related to derivatives not 
designated in a qualifying hedging relationship are shown

Accounting for Derivative Hedging
Citigroup accounts for its hedging activities in accordance 
with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. As a general rule, 
hedge accounting is permitted where the Company is exposed 
to a particular risk, such as interest rate or foreign exchange 
risk, that causes changes in the fair value of an asset or 
liability or variability in the expected future cash flows of an 
existing asset, liability or a forecasted transaction that may 
affect earnings.

Derivative contracts hedging the risks associated with 

changes in fair value are referred to as fair value hedges, while 
contracts hedging the variability of expected future cash flows 
are cash flow hedges. Hedges that utilize derivatives or debt 
instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated 
with equity investments in non-U.S.-dollar-functional-
currency foreign subsidiaries (net investment in a foreign 
operation) are net investment hedges.

To qualify as an accounting hedge under the hedge 

accounting rules (versus an economic hedge where hedge 
accounting is not applied), a hedging relationship must be 
highly effective in offsetting the risk designated as being 

240

hedged. The hedge relationship must be formally documented 
at inception, detailing the particular risk management 
objective and strategy for the hedge. This includes the item 
and risk(s) being hedged, the hedging instrument being used 
and how effectiveness will be assessed. The effectiveness of 
these hedging relationships is evaluated at hedge inception and 
on an ongoing basis both on a retrospective and prospective 
basis, typically using quantitative measures of correlation, 
with hedge ineffectiveness measured and recorded in current 
earnings. Hedge effectiveness assessment methodologies are 
performed in a similar manner for similar hedges, and are used 
consistently throughout the hedging relationships. The 
assessment of effectiveness may exclude changes in the value 
of the hedged item that are unrelated to the risks being hedged 
and the changes in fair value of the derivative associated with 
time value. These excluded items are recognized in current 
earnings for the hedging derivative, while changes in the value 
of a hedged item that are not related to the hedged risk are not 
recorded.

Discontinued Hedge Accounting
A hedging instrument must be highly effective in 
accomplishing the hedge objective of offsetting either changes 
in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item for the risk 
being hedged. Management may voluntarily de-designate an 
accounting hedge at any time, but if a hedge relationship is not 
highly effective, it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting 
and must be de-designated. Subsequent changes in the fair 
value of the derivative are recognized in Other revenue or 
Principal transactions, similar to trading derivatives, with no 
offset recorded related to the hedged item.

For fair value hedges, any changes in the fair value of the 
hedged item remain as part of the basis of the asset or liability 
and are ultimately realized as an element of the yield on the 
item. For cash flow hedges, changes in fair value of the end-
user derivative remain in Accumulated other comprehensive 
income (loss) (AOCI) and are included in the earnings of 
future periods when the forecasted hedged cash flows impact 
earnings. However, if it becomes probable that some or all of 
the hedged forecasted transactions will not occur, any amounts 
that remain in AOCI related to these transactions must be 
immediately reflected in Other revenue.

The foregoing criteria are applied on a decentralized 

basis, consistent with the level at which market risk is 
managed, but are subject to various limits and controls. The 
underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction may be an 
individual item or a portfolio of similar items.

Fair Value Hedges

Hedging of Benchmark Interest Rate Risk
Citigroup’s fair value hedges are primarily hedges of fixed-
rate long-term debt or assets, such as available-for-sale 
securities.

Citigroup hedges exposure to changes in the fair value of 

outstanding fixed-rate issued debt. These hedges are 
designated as fair value hedges of the benchmark interest rate 
risk associated with the currency of the hedged liability. The 
fixed cash flows of the hedged items are typically converted to 
benchmark variable-rate cash flows by entering into receive-
fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. By designating an 
interest rate swap contract as a hedging instrument and 
electing to apply ASC 815 fair value hedge accounting, the 
carrying value of the debt is adjusted to reflect the impact of 
changes in the benchmark interest rate, with such changes in 
value recorded in Other revenue. The related interest rate swap 
is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in 
fair value also reflected in Other revenue. These amounts are 
expected to, and generally do, offset. Any net amount, 
representing hedge ineffectiveness, is automatically reflected 
in current earnings. These fair value hedge relationships use 
either regression or dollar-offset ratio analysis to assess 
whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at 
inception and on an ongoing basis.

Citigroup also hedges its exposure to changes in the fair 

value of fixed-rate available for sale debt securities due to 
changes in benchmark interest rates. The hedging instruments 
are typically receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps. 
These fair value hedging relationships use either regression or 
dollar-offset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging 
relationships are highly effective at inception and on an 
ongoing basis. 

Hedging of Foreign Exchange Risk
Citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to 
foreign exchange rate movements in available-for-sale 
securities that are denominated in currencies other than the 
functional currency of the entity holding the securities, which 
may be within or outside the U.S. The hedging instrument 
may be a cross currency swap or a forward foreign exchange 
contract. When a forward foreign exchange contract is used as 
the hedging instrument, the portion of the change in the fair 
value of the hedged available-for-sale security attributable to 
foreign exchange risk (i.e., spot rates) is reported in earnings, 
and not AOCI, which offsets the change in the fair value of the 
forward contract that is also reflected in earnings. Citigroup 
considers the premium associated with forward contracts (i.e., 
the differential between spot and contractual forward rates) as 
the cost of hedging; this amount is excluded from the 
assessment of hedge effectiveness and reflected directly in 
earnings over the life of the hedge. 

Hedging of Commodity Price Risk 
Citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to spot 
price movements in physical commodities inventory. The 
hedging instrument is a futures contract to sell the underlying 
commodity. In this hedge, the change in the value of the 
hedged inventory is reflected in earnings, which offsets the 
change in the fair value of the futures contract that is also 
reflected in earnings. Although the change in the fair value of 
the hedging instrument recorded in earnings includes changes 
in forward rates, Citigroup excludes the differential between 
the spot and the contractual forward rates under the futures 
contract from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Since the 
assessment is based on changes in fair value attributable to 
change in spot prices on both the physical commodity and the 
futures contract, the amount of hedge ineffectiveness is not 
significant.

Cash Flow Hedges

Hedging of Benchmark Interest Rate Risk
Citigroup hedges the variability of forecasted cash flows 
associated with floating-rate assets/liabilities and other 
forecasted transactions. Variable cash flows from those 
liabilities are synthetically converted to fixed-rate cash flows 
by entering into receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps 
and receive-variable, pay-fixed forward-starting interest rate 
swaps. Variable cash flows associated with certain assets are 
synthetically converted to fixed-rate cash flows by entering 
into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. These cash 
flow hedging relationships use either regression analysis or 
dollar-offset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging 
relationships are highly effective at inception and on an 
ongoing basis. When the variable interest rates associated with 
hedged items do not qualify as benchmark interest rates, 
Citigroup designates the risk being hedged as the risk of 
overall variability in the hedged cash flows. Because efforts 
are made to match the terms of the derivatives to those of the 
hedged forecasted cash flows as closely as possible, the 
amount of hedge ineffectiveness is not significant.

For cash flow hedges in which derivatives hedge the 
variability of forecasted cash flows related to recognized 
assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions, the accounting 
treatment depends on the effectiveness of the hedge. To the 
extent that these derivatives are effective in offsetting the 
variability of the forecasted hedged cash flows, the effective 
portion of the changes in the derivatives’ fair values will not 

be included in current earnings, but will be reported in AOCI. 
These changes in fair value will be included in the earnings of 
future periods when the hedged cash flows impact earnings. 
To the extent that these derivatives are not fully effective, 
changes in their fair values are immediately included in Other 
revenue. Citigroup’s cash flow hedges primarily include 
hedges of floating-rate assets or liabilities which may include 
loans as well as forecasted transactions.

Hedging of Foreign Exchange Risk
Citigroup locks in the functional currency equivalent cash 
flows of long-term debt and short-term borrowings that are 
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
of the issuing entity. Depending on risk management 
objectives, these types of hedges are designated either as cash 
flow hedges of foreign exchange risk only or cash flow hedges 
of both foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk, and the 
hedging instruments are foreign exchange cross-currency 
swaps and forward contracts. These cash flow hedge 
relationships use dollar-offset ratio analysis to determine 
whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at 
inception and on an ongoing basis.

The amount of hedge ineffectiveness on the cash flow 

hedges recognized in earnings for the years ended 
December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 is not significant. The 
pretax change in AOCI from cash flow hedges is presented in 
the table below:

For cash flow hedges, the changes in the fair value of the 

hedging derivative remain in AOCI on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet and will be included in the earnings of future 
periods to offset the variability of the hedged cash flows when 
such cash flows affect earnings. The net gain associated with 
cash flow hedges expected to be reclassified from AOCI 
within 12 months of December 31, 2017 is approximately $0.4 
billion. The maximum length of time over which forecasted 
cash flows are hedged is 10 years.

The after-tax impact of cash flow hedges on AOCI is 

shown in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

243

Net Investment Hedges
Consistent with ASC 830-20, Foreign Currency Matters—
Foreign Currency Transactions, ASC 815 allows the hedging 
of the foreign currency risk of a net investment in a foreign 
operation. Citigroup uses foreign currency forwards, cross-
currency swaps, options and foreign currency-denominated 
debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk 
associated with Citigroup’s equity investments in several non-
U.S.-dollar-functional-currency foreign subsidiaries. Citigroup 
records the change in the carrying amount of these 
investments in the Foreign currency translation adjustment 
account within AOCI. Simultaneously, the effective portion of 
the hedge of this exposure is also recorded in the Foreign 
currency translation adjustment account and any ineffective 
portion is immediately recorded in earnings.

For derivatives designated as net investment hedges, 

Citigroup follows the forward-rate method outlined in ASC 
815-35-35. According to that method, all changes in fair value, 
including changes related to the forward-rate component of 
the foreign currency forward contracts and the time value of 
foreign currency options, are recorded in the Foreign currency 
translation adjustment account within AOCI.

For foreign currency-denominated debt instruments that 
are designated as hedges of net investments, the translation 
gain or loss that is recorded in the Foreign currency 
translation adjustment account is based on the spot exchange 
rate between the functional currency of the respective 
subsidiary and the U.S. dollar, which is the functional 
currency of Citigroup. To the extent the notional amount of the 
hedging instrument exactly matches the hedged net investment 
and the underlying exchange rate of the derivative hedging 
instrument relates to the exchange rate between the functional 
currency of the net investment and Citigroup’s functional 
currency (or, in the case of a non-derivative debt instrument, 
such instrument is denominated in the functional currency of 
the net investment), no ineffectiveness is recorded in earnings.

The pretax gain (loss) recorded in the Foreign currency 
translation adjustment account within AOCI, related to the 
effective portion of the net investment hedges, is $2,528 
million, $(220) million and $2,475 million for the years ended 
December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Economic Hedges
Citigroup often uses economic hedges when hedge accounting 
would be too complex or operationally burdensome. End-user 
derivatives that are economic hedges are carried at fair value, 
with changes in value included in either Principal transactions 
or Other revenue. 

For asset/liability management hedging, fixed-rate long-

term debt is recorded at amortized cost under GAAP.

For other hedges that either do not meet the ASC 815 

hedging criteria or for which management decides not to apply 
ASC 815 hedge accounting, the derivative is recorded at fair 
value on the balance sheet with the associated changes in fair 
value recorded in earnings, while the debt continues to be 
carried at amortized cost. Therefore, current earnings are 
affected by the interest rate shifts and other factors that cause a 
change in the swap’s value, but for which no offsetting change 
in value is recorded on the debt.

244

Citigroup may alternatively elect to account for the debt 
at fair value under the fair value option. Once the irrevocable 
election is made upon issuance of the debt, the full change in 
fair value of the debt is reported in earnings. The changes in 
fair value of the related interest rate swap are also reflected in 
earnings, which provides a natural offset to the debt’s fair 
value change. To the extent the two amounts differ because the 
full change in the fair value of the debt includes risks not 
offset by the interest rate swap, the difference is automatically 
captured in current earnings.

Additional economic hedges include hedges of the credit 
risk component of commercial loans and loan commitments. 
Citigroup periodically evaluates its hedging strategies in other 
areas and may designate either an accounting hedge or an 
economic hedge after considering the relative costs and 
benefits. Economic hedges are also employed when the 
hedged item itself is marked to market through current 
earnings, such as hedges of commitments to originate one- to 
four-family mortgage loans to be held for sale and MSRs.

Credit Derivatives
Citi is a market maker and trades a range of credit derivatives. 
Through these contracts, Citi either purchases or writes 
protection on either a single name or a portfolio of reference 
credits. Citi also uses credit derivatives to help mitigate credit 
risk in its corporate and consumer loan portfolios and other 
cash positions and to facilitate client transactions.  

Citi monitors its counterparty credit risk in credit 

derivative contracts. As of both December 31, 2017 and 
December 31, 2016, approximately 98% of the gross 
receivables are from counterparties with which Citi maintains 
collateral agreements. A majority of Citi’s top 15 
counterparties (by receivable balance owed to Citi) are banks, 
financial institutions or other dealers. Contracts with these 
counterparties do not include ratings-based termination events. 
However, counterparty ratings downgrades may have an 
incremental effect by lowering the threshold at which Citi may 
call for additional collateral. 

The range of credit derivatives entered into includes credit 

default swaps, total return swaps, credit options and credit-
linked notes. 

A credit default swap is a contract in which, for a fee, a 

protection seller agrees to reimburse a protection buyer for any 
losses that occur due to a predefined credit event on a 
reference entity. These credit events are defined by the terms 
of the derivative contract and the reference credit and are 
generally limited to the market standard of failure to pay on 
indebtedness and bankruptcy of the reference credit and, in a 
more limited range of transactions, debt restructuring. Credit 
derivative transactions that reference emerging market entities 
also typically include additional credit events to cover the 
acceleration of indebtedness and the risk of repudiation or a 
payment moratorium. In certain transactions, protection may 
be provided on a portfolio of reference entities or asset-backed 
securities. If there is no credit event, as defined by the specific 
derivative contract, then the protection seller makes no 
payments to the protection buyer and receives only the 
contractually specified fee. However, if a credit event occurs 
as defined in the specific derivative contract sold, the 

protection seller will be required to make a payment to the 
protection buyer. Under certain contracts, the seller of 
protection may not be required to make a payment until a 
specified amount of losses has occurred with respect to the 
portfolio and/or may only be required to pay for losses up to a 
specified amount.

A total return swap typically transfers the total economic 
performance of a reference asset, which includes all associated 
cash flows, as well as capital appreciation or depreciation. The 
protection buyer receives a floating rate of interest and any 
depreciation on the reference asset from the protection seller 
and, in return, the protection seller receives the cash flows 
associated with the reference asset plus any appreciation. 
Thus, according to the total return swap agreement, the 
protection seller will be obligated to make a payment any time 
the floating interest rate payment plus any depreciation of the 
reference asset exceeds the cash flows associated with the 
underlying asset. A total return swap may terminate upon a 
default of the reference asset or a credit event with respect to 
the reference entity subject to the provisions of the related 
total return swap agreement between the protection seller and 
the protection buyer.

A credit option is a credit derivative that allows investors 
to trade or hedge changes in the credit quality of a reference 
entity. For example, in a credit spread option, the option writer 
assumes the obligation to purchase or sell credit protection on 
the reference entity at a specified “strike” spread level. The 
option purchaser buys the right to sell credit default protection 
on the reference entity to, or purchase it from, the option 
writer at the strike spread level. The payments on credit spread 
options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price 
of the underlying credit-sensitive asset or other reference 
entity. The options usually terminate if a credit event occurs 
with respect to the underlying reference entity. 

A credit-linked note is a form of credit derivative 

structured as a debt security with an embedded credit default 
swap. The purchaser of the note effectively provides credit 
protection to the issuer by agreeing to receive a return that 
could be negatively affected by credit events on the underlying 
reference credit. If the reference entity defaults, the note may 
be cash settled or physically settled by delivery of a debt 
security of the reference entity. Thus, the maximum amount of 
the note purchaser’s exposure is the amount paid for the 
credit-linked note.

246

Fair values included in the above tables are prior to 

application of any netting agreements and cash collateral. For 
notional amounts, Citi generally has a mismatch between the 
total notional amounts of protection purchased and sold, and it 
may hold the reference assets directly rather than entering into 
offsetting credit derivative contracts as and when desired. The 
open risk exposures from credit derivative contracts are 
largely matched after certain cash positions in reference assets 
are considered and after notional amounts are adjusted, either 
to a duration-based equivalent basis or to reflect the level of 
subordination in tranched structures. The ratings of the credit 
derivatives portfolio presented in the tables and used to 
evaluate payment/performance risk are based on the assigned 
internal or external ratings of the reference asset or entity. 
Where external ratings are used, investment-grade ratings are 
considered to be ‘Baa/BBB’ and above, while anything below 
is considered non-investment grade. Citi’s internal ratings are 
in line with the related external rating system. 

Citigroup evaluates the payment/performance risk of the 

credit derivatives for which it stands as a protection seller 
based on the credit rating assigned to the underlying reference 
credit. Credit derivatives written on an underlying non-
investment grade reference credit represent greater payment 
risk to the Company. The non-investment grade category in 
the table above also includes credit derivatives where the 
underlying reference entity has been downgraded subsequent 
to the inception of the derivative. 

The maximum potential amount of future payments under 

credit derivative contracts presented in the table above is 
based on the notional value of the derivatives. The Company 
believes that the notional amount for credit protection sold is 
not representative of the actual loss exposure based on 
historical experience. This amount has not been reduced by the 
value of the reference assets and the related cash flows. In 
accordance with most credit derivative contracts, should a 
credit event occur, the Company usually is liable for the 
difference between the protection sold and the value of the 
reference assets. Furthermore, the notional amount for credit 
protection sold has not been reduced for any cash collateral 
paid to a given counterparty, as such payments would be 
calculated after netting all derivative exposures, including any 
credit derivatives with that counterparty in accordance with a 
related master netting agreement. Due to such netting 
processes, determining the amount of collateral that 
corresponds to credit derivative exposures alone is not 
possible. The Company actively monitors open credit-risk 
exposures and manages this exposure by using a variety of 
strategies, including purchased credit derivatives, cash 
collateral or direct holdings of the referenced assets. This risk 
mitigation activity is not captured in the table above.

Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features in Derivatives
Certain derivative instruments contain provisions that require 
the Company to either post additional collateral or 
immediately settle any outstanding liability balances upon the 
occurrence of a specified event related to the credit risk of the 
Company. These events, which are defined by the existing 
derivative contracts, are primarily downgrades in the credit 
ratings of the Company and its affiliates. The fair value 
(excluding CVA) of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-
related contingent features that were in a net liability position 
at both December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $29 
billion and $26 billion, respectively. The Company posted $28 
billion and $26 billion as collateral for this exposure in the 
normal course of business as of December 31, 2017 and 
December 31, 2016, respectively.

A downgrade could trigger additional collateral or cash 

settlement requirements for the Company and certain 
affiliates. In the event that Citigroup and Citibank were 
downgraded a single notch by all three major rating agencies 
as of December 31, 2017, the Company could be required to 
post an additional $0.9 billion as either collateral or settlement 
of the derivative transactions. Additionally, the Company 
could be required to segregate with third-party custodians 
collateral previously received from existing derivative 
counterparties in the amount of $0.3 billion upon the single 
notch downgrade, resulting in aggregate cash obligations and 
collateral requirements of approximately $1.2 billion.

Derivatives Accompanied by Financial Asset Transfers
The Company executes total return swaps that provide it with 
synthetic exposure to substantially all of the economic return 
of the securities or other financial assets referenced in the 
contract. In certain cases, the derivative transaction is 
accompanied by the Company’s transfer of the referenced 
financial asset to the derivative counterparty, most typically in 
response to the derivative counterparty’s desire to hedge, in 
whole or in part, its synthetic exposure under the derivative 
contract by holding the referenced asset in funded form. In 
certain jurisdictions these transactions qualify as sales, 
resulting in derecognition of the securities transferred (see 
Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further 
discussion of the related sale conditions for transfers of 
financial assets). For a significant portion of the transactions, 
the Company has also executed another total return swap 
where the Company passes on substantially all of the 
economic return of the referenced securities to a different third 
party seeking the exposure. In those cases, the Company is not 
exposed, on a net basis, to changes in the economic return of 
the referenced securities.

These transactions generally involve the transfer of the 
Company’s liquid government bonds, convertible bonds or 
publicly traded corporate equity securities from the trading 
portfolio and are executed with third-party financial 
institutions. The accompanying derivatives are typically total 
return swaps. The derivatives are cash settled and subject to 
ongoing margin requirements.

When the conditions for sale accounting are met, the 

Company reports the transfer of the referenced financial asset 
as a sale and separately reports the accompanying derivative 

247

transaction. These transactions generally do not result in a gain 
or loss on the sale of the security, because the transferred 
security was held at fair value in the Company’s trading 
portfolio. For transfers of financial assets accounted for by the 
Company as a sale, where the Company has retained 
substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred 
asset through a total return swap executed in contemplation of 
the initial sale, with the same counterparty and still 
outstanding as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, 
both the asset carrying amounts derecognized and gross cash 
proceeds received as of the date of derecognition were $3.0 
billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2017, 
the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was $3.1 
billion and the fair value of the total return swaps was $89 
million, recorded as gross derivative assets, and $15 million 
recorded as gross derivative liabilities. At December 31, 2016, 
the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was $1.0 
billion and the fair value of the total return swaps was $32 
million, recorded as gross derivative assets, and $23 million, 
recorded as gross derivative liabilities. The balances for the 
total return swaps are on a gross basis, before the application 
of counterparty and cash collateral netting, and are included 
primarily as equity derivatives in the tabular disclosures in this 
Note.

23. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK 

Concentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic, 
industry or geographic factors similarly affect groups of 
counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is material in 
relation to Citigroup’s total credit exposure. Although 
Citigroup’s portfolio of financial instruments is broadly 
diversified along industry, product and geographic lines, 
material transactions are completed with other financial 
institutions, particularly in the securities trading, derivatives 
and foreign exchange businesses.

In connection with the Company’s efforts to maintain a 
diversified portfolio, the Company limits its exposure to any 
one geographic region, country or individual creditor and 
monitors this exposure on a continuous basis. At 
December 31, 2017, Citigroup’s most significant 
concentration of credit risk was with the U.S. government and 
its agencies. The Company’s exposure, which primarily results 
from trading assets and investments issued by the U.S. 
government and its agencies, amounted to $227.8 billion and 
$228.5 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
The German and Japanese governments and their agencies, 
which are rated investment grade by both Moody’s and S&P, 
were the next largest exposures. The Company’s exposure to 
Germany amounted to $38.3 billion and $26.7 billion at 
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and was composed 
of investment securities, loans and trading assets. The 
Company’s exposure to Japan amounted to $25.8 billion and 
$27.3 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, 
and was composed of investment securities, loans and trading 
assets.

The Company’s exposure to states and municipalities 

amounted to $30.6 billion and $30.7 billion at December 31, 
2017 and 2016, respectively, and was composed of trading

24.   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement, defines fair value, 
establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value 
and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair 
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date. 
Among other things, the standard requires the Company to 
maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use 
of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.

Under ASC 820-10, the probability of default of a 

counterparty is factored into the valuation of derivative and 
other positions as well as the impact of Citigroup’s own 
credit risk on derivatives and other liabilities measured at 
fair value.

Fair Value Hierarchy
ASC 820-10 specifies a hierarchy of inputs based on 
whether the inputs are observable or unobservable. 
Observable inputs are developed using market data and 
reflect market participant assumptions, while unobservable 
inputs reflect the Company’s market assumptions. These two 
types of inputs have created the following fair value 
hierarchy:
•  Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in 

active markets.

•  Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active 

markets; quoted prices for identical or similar 
instruments in markets that are not active; and model-
derived valuations in which all significant inputs and 
significant value drivers are observable in active 
markets.

•  Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques 
in which one or more significant inputs or significant 
value drivers are unobservable.

As required under the fair value hierarchy, the Company 

considers relevant and observable market inputs in its 
valuations where possible. The frequency of transactions, the 
size of the bid-ask spread and the amount of adjustment 
necessary when comparing similar transactions are all 
factors in determining the liquidity of markets and the 
relevance of observed prices in those markets.

The Company’s policy with respect to transfers between 

levels of the fair value hierarchy is to recognize transfers 
into and out of each level as of the end of the reporting 
period.

Determination of Fair Value
For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, the Company 
measures fair value using the procedures set out below, 
irrespective of whether the assets and liabilities are measured 
at fair value as a result of an election or whether they are 
required to be measured at fair value.

When available, the Company uses quoted market 

prices to determine fair value and classifies such items as 
Level 1. In some cases where a market price is available, the 

Company will make use of acceptable practical expedients 
(such as matrix pricing) to calculate fair value, in which case 
the items are classified as Level 2.

The Company may also apply a price-based 

methodology, which utilizes, where available, quoted prices 
or other market information obtained from recent trading 
activity in positions with the same or similar characteristics 
to the position being valued. The market activity and the 
amount of the bid-ask spread are among the factors 
considered in determining the liquidity of markets and the 
observability of prices from those markets. If relevant and 
observable prices are available, those valuations may be 
classified as Level 2. When less liquidity exists for a security 
or loan, a quoted price is stale, a significant adjustment to 
the price of a similar security is necessary to reflect 
differences in the terms of the actual security or loan being 
valued, or prices from independent sources are insufficient 
to corroborate the valuation, the “price” inputs are 
considered unobservable and the fair value measurements 
are classified as Level 3.

If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is 
based upon internally developed valuation techniques that 
use, where possible, current market-based parameters, such 
as interest rates, currency rates and option volatilities. Items 
valued using such internally generated valuation techniques 
are classified according to the lowest level input or value 
driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may 
be classified as Level 3 even though there may be some 
significant inputs that are readily observable.

Fair value estimates from internal valuation techniques 

are verified, where possible, to prices obtained from 
independent vendors or brokers. Vendors’ and brokers’ 
valuations may be based on a variety of inputs ranging from 
observed prices to proprietary valuation models.

The following section describes the valuation 

methodologies used by the Company to measure various 
financial instruments at fair value, including an indication of 
the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each instrument 
is generally classified. Where appropriate, the description 
includes details of the valuation models, the key inputs to 
those models and any significant assumptions.

Market Valuation Adjustments
Generally, the unit of account for a financial instrument is 
the individual financial instrument. The Company applies 
market valuation adjustments that are consistent with the 
unit of account, which does not include adjustment due to 
the size of the Company’s position, except as follows. ASC 
820-10 permits an exception, through an accounting policy 
election, to measure the fair value of a portfolio of financial 
assets and financial liabilities on the basis of the net open 
risk position when certain criteria are met. Citi has elected to 
measure certain portfolios of financial instruments, such as 
derivatives, that meet those criteria on the basis of the net 
open risk position. The Company applies market valuation 
adjustments, including adjustments to account for the size of 
the net open risk position, consistent with market participant 
assumptions and in accordance with the unit of account.

250

Liquidity adjustments are applied to items in Level 2 or 
Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy in an effort to ensure that 
the fair value reflects the price at which the net open risk 
position could be liquidated. The liquidity adjustment is 
based on the bid/offer spread for an instrument. When Citi 
has elected to measure certain portfolios of financial 
investments, such as derivatives, on the basis of the net open 
risk position, the liquidity adjustment may be adjusted to 
take into account the size of the position.

Credit valuation adjustments (CVA) and funding 

• 

valuation adjustments (FVA) are applied to over-the-counter 
(OTC) derivative instruments in which the base valuation 
generally discounts expected cash flows using the relevant 
base interest rate curve for the currency of the derivative 
(e.g., LIBOR for uncollateralized U.S.-dollar derivatives). 
As not all counterparties have the same credit risk as that 
implied by the relevant base curve, a CVA is necessary to 
incorporate the market view of both counterparty credit risk 
and Citi’s own credit risk in the valuation. FVA reflects a 
market funding risk premium inherent in the uncollateralized 
portion of derivative portfolios and in collateralized 
derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not permit 
the reuse of the collateral received.

Citi’s CVA and FVA methodology consists of two steps: 
First, the exposure profile for each counterparty is 
determined using the terms of all individual derivative 
positions and a Monte Carlo simulation or other 
quantitative analysis to generate a series of expected 
cash flows at future points in time. The calculation of 
this exposure profile considers the effect of credit risk 
mitigants and sources of funding, including pledged 
cash or other collateral and any legal right of offset that 
exists with a counterparty through arrangements such as 
netting agreements. Individual derivative contracts that 
are subject to an enforceable master netting agreement 
with a counterparty are aggregated as a netting set for 
this purpose, since it is those aggregate net cash flows 
that are subject to nonperformance risk. This process 
identifies specific, point-in-time future cash flows that 
are subject to nonperformance risk and unsecured 
funding, rather than using the current recognized net 
asset or liability as a basis to measure the CVA and 
FVA. 
Second, for CVA, market-based views of default 
probabilities derived from observed credit spreads in the 
credit default swap (CDS) market are applied to the 
expected future cash flows determined in step one. Citi’s 
own-credit CVA is determined using Citi-specific CDS 
spreads for the relevant tenor. Generally, counterparty 
CVA is determined using CDS spread indices for each 
credit rating and tenor. For certain identified netting sets 
where individual analysis is practicable (e.g., exposures 
to counterparties with liquid CDSs), counterparty-
specific CDS spreads are used. For FVA, a term 
structure of future liquidity spreads is applied to the 
expected future funding requirement.
The CVA and FVA are designed to incorporate a market 
view of the credit and funding risk, respectively, inherent in 

• 

the derivative portfolio. However, most unsecured derivative 
instruments are negotiated bilateral contracts and are not 
commonly transferred to third parties. Derivative 
instruments are normally settled contractually or, if 
terminated early, are terminated at a value negotiated 
bilaterally between the counterparties. Thus, the CVA and 
FVA may not be realized upon a settlement or termination in 
the normal course of business. In addition, all or a portion of 
these adjustments may be reversed or otherwise adjusted in 
future periods in the event of changes in the credit or 
funding risk associated with the derivative instruments.

Valuation Process for Fair Value Measurements
Price verification procedures and related internal control 
procedures are governed by the Citigroup Pricing and Price 
Verification Policy and Standards, which is jointly owned by 
Finance and Risk Management. 

For fair value measurements of substantially all assets 

and liabilities held by the Company, individual business 
units are responsible for valuing the trading account assets 
and liabilities, and Product Control within Finance performs 
independent price verification procedures to evaluate those 
fair value measurements. Product Control is independent of 
the individual business units and reports to the Global Head 
of Product Control. It has authority over the valuation of 
financial assets and liabilities. Fair value measurements of 
assets and liabilities are determined using various 
techniques, including, but not limited to, discounted cash 
flows and internal models, such as option and correlation 
models.

Based on the observability of inputs used, Product 
Control classifies the inventory as Level 1, Level 2 or 
Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. When a position involves 
one or more significant inputs that are not directly 
observable, price verification procedures are performed that 
may include reviewing relevant historical data, analyzing 
profit and loss, valuing each component of a structured trade 
individually and benchmarking, among others.

Reports of inventory that is classified within Level 3 of 
the fair value hierarchy are distributed to senior management 
in Finance, Risk and the business. This inventory is also 
discussed in Risk Committees and in monthly meetings with 
senior trading management. As deemed necessary, reports 
may go to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors or 
to the full Board of Directors. Whenever an adjustment is 
needed to bring the price of an asset or liability to its exit 
price, Product Control reports it to management along with 
other price verification results.

In addition, the pricing models used in measuring fair 
value are governed by an independent control framework. 
Although the models are developed and tested by the 
individual business units, they are independently validated 
by the Model Validation Group within Risk Management 
and reviewed by Finance with respect to their impact on the 
price verification procedures. The purpose of this 
independent control framework is to assess model risk 
arising from models’ theoretical soundness, calibration 
techniques where needed and the appropriateness of the 
model for a specific product in a defined market. To ensure 
their continued applicability, models are independently 
reviewed annually. In addition, Risk Management approves 
and maintains a list of products permitted to be valued under 
each approved model for a given business.

Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and 
Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase
No quoted prices exist for these instruments, so fair value is 
determined using a discounted cash flow technique. Cash 
flows are estimated based on the terms of the contract, 
taking into account any embedded derivative or other 
features. These cash flows are discounted using interest rates 
appropriate to the maturity of the instrument as well as the 
nature of the underlying collateral. Generally, when such 
instruments are recorded at fair value, they are classified 
within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, as the inputs used 
in the valuation are readily observable. However, certain 
long-dated positions are classified within Level 3 of the fair 
value hierarchy.

Trading Account Assets and Liabilities—Trading Securities 
and Trading Loans
When available, the Company uses quoted market prices in 
active markets to determine the fair value of trading 
securities; such items are classified as Level 1 of the fair 
value hierarchy. Examples include government securities 
and exchange-traded equity securities.

For bonds and secondary market loans traded over the 

counter, the Company generally determines fair value 
utilizing valuation techniques, including discounted cash 
flows, price-based and internal models, such as Black-
Scholes and Monte Carlo simulation. Fair value estimates 
from these internal valuation techniques are verified, where 
possible, to prices obtained from independent sources, 
including third-party vendors. Vendors compile prices from 
various sources and may apply matrix pricing for similar 
bonds or loans where no price is observable. A price-based 
methodology utilizes, where available, quoted prices or other 
market information obtained from recent trading activity of 
assets with similar characteristics to the bond or loan being 
valued. The yields used in discounted cash flow models are 
derived from the same price information. Trading securities 
and loans priced using such methods are generally classified 
as Level 2. However, when less liquidity exists for a security 
or loan, a quoted price is stale, a significant adjustment to 
the price of a similar security or loan is necessary to reflect 
differences in the terms of the actual security or loan being 
valued, or prices from independent sources are insufficient 
to corroborate valuation, a loan or security is generally 
classified as Level 3. The price input used in a price-based 
methodology may be zero for a security, such as a subprime 
CDO, that is not receiving any principal or interest and is 
currently written down to zero.

When the Company’s principal market for a portfolio of 

loans is the securitization market, the Company uses the 
securitization price to determine the fair value of the 
portfolio. The securitization price is determined from the 
assumed proceeds of a hypothetical securitization in the 
current market, adjusted for transformation costs (i.e., direct 
costs other than transaction costs) and securitization 
uncertainties such as market conditions and liquidity. As a 
result of the severe reduction in the level of activity in 
certain securitization markets since the second half of 2007, 
observable securitization prices for certain directly 

252

Investments
The investments category includes available-for-sale debt 
and marketable equity securities whose fair values are 
generally determined by utilizing similar procedures 
described for trading securities above or, in some cases, 
using vendor pricing as the primary source.

Also included in investments are nonpublic investments 
in private equity and real estate entities. Determining the fair 
value of nonpublic securities involves a significant degree of 
management judgment, as no quoted prices exist and such 
securities are generally thinly traded. In addition, there may 
be transfer restrictions on private equity securities. The 
Company’s process for determining the fair value of such 
securities utilizes commonly accepted valuation techniques, 
including comparables analysis. In determining the fair value 
of nonpublic securities, the Company also considers events 
such as a proposed sale of the investee company, initial 
public offerings, equity issuances or other observable 
transactions. 

Private equity securities are generally classified as 

Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

In addition, the Company holds investments in certain 
alternative investment funds that calculate NAV per share, 
including hedge funds, private equity funds and real estate 
funds. Investments in funds are generally classified as non-
marketable equity securities carried at fair value. The fair 
values of these investments are estimated using the NAV per 
share of the Company’s ownership interest in the funds 
where it is not probable that the investment will be realized 
at a price other than the NAV. Consistent with the provisions 
of ASU 2015-07 these investments have not been 
categorized within the fair value hierarchy and are not 
included in the tables below. See Note 13 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional 
information.

Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt
Where fair value accounting has been elected, the fair value 
of non-structured liabilities is determined by utilizing 
internal models using the appropriate discount rate for the 
applicable maturity. Such instruments are generally 
classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy when all 
significant inputs are readily observable.

The Company determines the fair value of hybrid 

financial instruments, including structured liabilities, using 
the appropriate derivative valuation methodology (described 
above in “Trading Account Assets and Liabilities—
Derivatives”) given the nature of the embedded risk profile. 
Such instruments are classified as Level 2 or Level 3 
depending on the observability of significant inputs to the 
model.

comparable portfolios of loans have not been readily 
available. Therefore, such portfolios of loans are generally 
classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. However, for 
other loan securitization markets, such as commercial real 
estate loans, price verification of the hypothetical 
securitizations has been possible, since these markets have 
remained active. Accordingly, this loan portfolio is classified 
as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

For most of the lending and structured direct subprime 

exposures, fair value is determined utilizing observable 
transactions where available, other market data for similar 
assets in markets that are not active and other internal 
valuation techniques. The valuation of certain asset-backed 
security (ABS) CDO positions utilizes prices based on the 
underlying assets of the ABS CDO. 

Trading Account Assets and Liabilities—Derivatives
Exchange-traded derivatives, measured at fair value using 
quoted (i.e., exchange) prices in active markets, where 
available, are classified as Level 1 of the fair value 
hierarchy.

Derivatives without a quoted price in an active market 
and derivatives executed over the counter are valued using 
internal valuation techniques. These derivative instruments 
are classified as either Level 2 or Level 3 depending upon 
the observability of the significant inputs to the model.

The valuation techniques and inputs depend on the type 

of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument. 
The principal techniques used to value these instruments are 
discounted cash flows and internal models, including Black-
Scholes and Monte Carlo simulation.  

The key inputs depend upon the type of derivative and 
the nature of the underlying instrument and include interest 
rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, volatilities and 
correlation. The Company uses overnight indexed swap 
(OIS) curves as fair value measurement inputs for the 
valuation of certain collateralized derivatives. Citi uses the 
relevant benchmark curve for the currency of the derivative 
(e.g., the London Interbank Offered Rate for U.S.-dollar 
derivatives) as the discount rate for uncollateralized 
derivatives. 

As referenced above, during the third quarter of 2016, 
Citi incorporated FVA into the fair value measurements due 
to what it believes to be an industry migration toward 
incorporating the market’s view of funding risk premium in 
OTC derivatives. The charge incurred in connection with the 
implementation of FVA was reflected in Principal 
transactions as a change in accounting estimate. Citi’s FVA 
methodology leverages the existing CVA methodology to 
estimate a funding exposure profile. The calculation of this 
exposure profile considers collateral agreements where the 
terms do not permit the Company to reuse the collateral 
received, including where counterparties post collateral to 
third-party custodians.

(1)  Changes in fair value of available-for-sale investments are recorded in AOCI, unless related to other-than-temporary impairment, while gains and losses from sales 

are recorded in Realized gains (losses) from sales of investments on the Consolidated Statement of Income.
(2)  Unrealized gains (losses) on MSRs are recorded in Other revenue on the Consolidated Statement of Income.
(3)  Represents the amount of total gains or losses for the period, included in earnings (and AOCI for changes in fair value of available-for-sale investments),

(4)  Total Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities have been netted in these tables for presentation purposes only.

Level 3 Fair Value Rollforward 
The following were the significant Level 3 transfers for the 
period December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017:
•  Transfers of Federal funds sold and securities borrowed 
or purchased under agreements to resell of $1.2 billion 
from Level 3 to Level 2 related to the significance of 
unobservable inputs as well as certain underlying market 
inputs becoming more observable and shortening of the 
remaining tenor of certain reverse repos. There is more 
transparency and observability for repo curves used in the 
valuation of structured reverse repos with tenors up to 
five years.

•  Transfers of Other trading assets of $2.7 billion from 
Level 3 to Level 2, related to trading loans, reflecting 
changes in the volume of market quotations, changes in 
the significance of unobservable inputs for certain 
portfolios of trading loans economically hedging 
derivatives, and certain underlying market inputs 
becoming more observable as a result of secondary 
market transactions for portfolios of residential mortgage 
loans with similar characteristics.

•  Transfers of Long-term debt of $1.3 billion from Level 2 

to Level 3, and of $1.8 billion from Level 3 to Level 2, 
mainly related to structured debt, reflecting changes in the 
significance of unobservable inputs as well as certain 
underlying market inputs becoming less or more 
observable.

The following were the significant Level 3 transfers for the 
period December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016:

261

•  Transfers of U.S. government-sponsored agency 

guaranteed MBS in Trading account assets of $0.5 billion 
from Level 2 to Level 3, and of $1.1 billion from Level 3 
to Level 2, primarily related to Agency Guaranteed MBS 
securities for which there were changes in volume of 
market quotations.

•  Transfer of Equity securities of $4.0 billion from Level 3 
to Level 2, included $3.2 billion of non-marketable equity 
securities and $0.5 billion of related partial economic 
hedging derivatives for which the portfolio valuation 
measurement exception under ASC 820-35-18D has been 
applied. After application of the portfolio exception, the 
Company considers these items to be one valuation unit 
and measures the fair value of the net open risk position 
primarily based on recent market transactions where these 
instruments are traded concurrently.  Because the 
derivatives offset the significant unobservable exposure 
within the non-marketable equity securities, there were no 
remaining unobservable inputs deemed to be significant.

•  Transfers of Other trading assets of $2.1 billion from 
Level 2 to Level 3, and of $2.7 billion from Level 3 to 
Level 2, primarily related to trading loans for which there 
were changes in volume of market quotations.

•  Transfers of State and Municipal securities in AFS 

Investments of $0.5 billion from Level 2 to Level 3, and 
of $1.6 billion from Level 3 to Level 2, primarily 
reflecting changes in the volume of market quotations. 

•  Transfers of Loans of $1.1 billion from Level 3 to Level 2 

reflecting changes in the volume of market quotations.
•  Transfers of Securities Sold Not Yet Purchased of $1.2 

billion from Level 2 to Level 3 related to the significance 

of unobservable inputs as well as certain underlying 
market inputs becoming less observable.

•  Transfers of Long-term debt of $3.8 billion from Level 2 

to Level 3, and of $4.4 billion from Level 3 to Level 2, 
mainly related to structured debt, reflecting changes in the 
significance of unobservable inputs as well as certain 
underlying market inputs becoming less or more 
observable.

Valuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value 
Measurements
The Company’s Level 3 inventory consists of both cash
instruments and derivatives of varying complexity. The
valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of
these positions include discounted cash flow analysis, internal
models and comparative analysis. A position is classified
within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy when at least one
input is unobservable and is considered significant to its
valuation. The specific reason an input is deemed
unobservable varies; for example, at least one significant
input to the pricing model is not observable in the market, at

least one significant input has been adjusted to make it more
representative of the position being valued or the price quote
available does not reflect sufficient trading activities.

The following tables present the valuation techniques 

covering the majority of Level 3 inventory and the most 
significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value 
measurements. Differences between this table and amounts 
presented in the Level 3 Fair Value Rollforward table 
represent individually immaterial items that have been 
measured using a variety of valuation techniques other than 
those listed.

Sensitivity to Unobservable Inputs and Interrelationships 
between Unobservable Inputs
The impact of key unobservable inputs on the Level 3 fair 
value measurements may not be independent of one another. 
In addition, the amount and direction of the impact on a fair 
value measurement for a given change in an unobservable 
input depends on the nature of the instrument as well as 
whether the Company holds the instrument as an asset or a 
liability. For certain instruments, the pricing, hedging and risk 
management are sensitive to the correlation between various 
inputs rather than on the analysis and aggregation of the 
individual inputs.

The following section describes the sensitivities and 

interrelationships of the most significant unobservable inputs 
used by the Company in Level 3 fair value measurements.

Correlation
Correlation is a measure of the extent to which two or more 
variables change in relation to each other. A variety of 
correlation-related assumptions are required for a wide range 
of instruments, including equity and credit baskets, foreign-
exchange options, CDOs backed by loans or bonds, 
mortgages, subprime mortgages and many other instruments. 
For almost all of these instruments, correlations are not 
observable in the market and must be calculated using 
historical information. Estimating correlation can be especially 
difficult where it may vary over time. Calculating correlation 
information from market data requires significant assumptions 
regarding the informational efficiency of the market (for 
example, swaption markets). Changes in correlation levels can 
have a major impact, favorable or unfavorable, on the value of 
an instrument, depending on its nature. A change in the default 
correlation of the fair value of the underlying bonds 
comprising a CDO structure would affect the fair value of the 
senior tranche. For example, an increase in the default 
correlation of the underlying bonds would reduce the fair 
value of the senior tranche, because highly correlated 
instruments produce larger losses in the event of default and a 
part of these losses would become attributable to the senior 
tranche. That same change in default correlation would have a 
different impact on junior tranches of the same structure.

Volatility
Volatility represents the speed and severity of market price 
changes and is a key factor in pricing options. Typically, 
instruments can become more expensive if volatility increases. 
For example, as an index becomes more volatile, the cost to 
Citi of maintaining a given level of exposure increases 
because more frequent rebalancing of the portfolio is required. 
Volatility generally depends on the tenor of the underlying 
instrument and the strike price or level defined in the contract. 
Volatilities for certain combinations of tenor and strike are not 
observable. The general relationship between changes in the 
value of a portfolio to changes in volatility also depends on 
changes in interest rates and the level of the underlying index. 
Generally, long option positions (assets) benefit from 
increases in volatility, whereas short option positions 
(liabilities) will suffer losses. Some instruments are more 
sensitive to changes in volatility than others. For example, an 

266

at-the-money option would experience a larger percentage 
change in its fair value than a deep-in-the-money option. In 
addition, the fair value of an option with more than one 
underlying security (for example, an option on a basket of 
bonds) depends on the volatility of the individual underlying 
securities as well as their correlations.

Yield
In some circumstances, the yield of an instrument is not 
observable in the market and must be estimated from historical 
data or from yields of similar securities. This estimated yield 
may need to be adjusted to capture the characteristics of the 
security being valued. In other situations, the estimated yield 
may not represent sufficient market liquidity and must be 
adjusted as well. Whenever the amount of the adjustment is 
significant to the value of the security, the fair value 
measurement is classified as Level 3.

Adjusted yield is generally used to discount the projected 
future principal and interest cash flows on instruments, such as 
asset-backed securities. Adjusted yield is impacted by changes 
in the interest rate environment and relevant credit spreads. 

Prepayment
Voluntary unscheduled payments (prepayments) change the 
future cash flows for the investor and thereby change the fair 
value of the security. The effect of prepayments is more 
pronounced for residential mortgage-backed securities. An 
increase in prepayments—in speed or magnitude—generally 
creates losses for the holder of these securities. Prepayment is 
generally negatively correlated with delinquency and interest 
rate. A combination of low prepayment and high delinquencies 
amplifies each input’s negative impact on mortgage securities’ 
valuation. As prepayment speeds change, the weighted 
average life of the security changes, which impacts the 
valuation either positively or negatively, depending upon the 
nature of the security and the direction of the change in the 
weighted average life.

Recovery
Recovery is the proportion of the total outstanding balance of 
a bond or loan that is expected to be collected in a liquidation 
scenario. For many credit securities (such as asset-backed 
securities), there is no directly observable market input for 
recovery, but indications of recovery levels are available from 
pricing services. The assumed recovery of a security may 
differ from its actual recovery that will be observable in the 
future. The recovery rate impacts the valuation of credit 
securities. Generally, an increase in the recovery rate 
assumption increases the fair value of the security. An increase 
in loss severity, the inverse of the recovery rate, reduces the 
amount of principal available for distribution and, as a result, 
decreases the fair value of the security.

Credit Spread
Credit spread is a component of the security representing its 
credit quality. Credit spread reflects the market perception of 
changes in prepayment, delinquency and recovery rates, 

also have credit spreads that vary with the attributes of the 
underlying obligor. Stronger companies have tighter credit 
spreads, and weaker companies have wider credit spreads.

Price
The price input is a significant unobservable input for certain 
fixed income instruments. For these instruments, the price 
input is expressed as a percentage of the notional amount, with 
a price of $100 meaning that the instrument is valued at par. 
For most of these instruments, the price varies between zero to 
$100, or slightly above $100. Relatively illiquid assets that 
have experienced significant losses since issuance, such as 
certain asset-backed securities, are at the lower end of the 
range, whereas most investment grade corporate bonds will 
fall in the middle to the higher end of the range. For certain 
structured debt instruments with embedded derivatives, the 
price input may be above $100 to reflect the embedded 
features of the instrument (for example, a step-up coupon or a 
conversion option).

The price input is also a significant unobservable input for 

certain equity securities; however, the range of price inputs 
varies depending on the nature of the position, the number of 
shares outstanding and other factors.

Mean Reversion
A number of financial instruments require an estimate of the 
rate at which the interest rate reverts to its long-term average. 
Changes in this estimate can significantly affect the fair value 
of these instruments. However, sometimes there is insufficient 
external market data to calibrate this parameter, especially 
when pricing more complex instruments. The level of mean 
reversion affects the correlation between short- and long-term 
interest rates. The fair values of more complex instruments, 
such as Bermudan swaptions (options with multiple exercise 
dates) and constant maturity spread options or structured debts 
with these embedded features, are more sensitive to the 
changes in this correlation as compared to less complex 
instruments, such as caps and floors.

therefore capturing the impact of other variables on the fair 
value. Changes in credit spread affect the fair value of 
securities differently depending on the characteristics and 
maturity profile of the security. For example, credit spread is a 
more significant driver of the fair value measurement of a high 
yield bond as compared to an investment grade bond. 
Generally, the credit spread for an investment grade bond is 
also more observable and less volatile than its high yield 
counterpart.

Qualitative Discussion of the Ranges of Significant 
Unobservable Inputs
The following section describes the ranges of the most 
significant unobservable inputs used by the Company in 
Level 3 fair value measurements. The level of aggregation and 
the diversity of instruments held by the Company lead to a 
wide range of unobservable inputs that may not be evenly 
distributed across the Level 3 inventory.

Correlation
There are many different types of correlation inputs, including 
credit correlation, cross-asset correlation (such as equity-
interest rate correlation) and same-asset correlation (such as 
interest rate-interest rate correlation). Correlation inputs are 
generally used to value hybrid and exotic instruments. 
Generally, same-asset correlation inputs have a narrower range 
than cross-asset correlation inputs. However, due to the 
complex and unique nature of these instruments, the ranges for 
correlation inputs can vary widely across portfolios.

Volatility
Similar to correlation, asset-specific volatility inputs vary 
widely by asset type. For example, ranges for foreign 
exchange volatility are generally lower and narrower than 
equity volatility. Equity volatilities are wider due to the nature 
of the equities market and the terms of certain exotic 
instruments. For most instruments, the interest rate volatility 
input is on the lower end of the range; however, for certain 
structured or exotic instruments (such as market-linked 
deposits or exotic interest rate derivatives), the range is much 
wider.

Yield
Ranges for the yield inputs vary significantly depending upon 
the type of security. For example, securities that typically have 
lower yields, such as municipal bonds, will fall in the lower 
end of the range, while more illiquid securities or securities 
with lower credit quality, such as certain residual tranche 
asset-backed securities, will have much higher yield inputs.

Credit Spread
Credit spread is relevant primarily for fixed income and credit 
instruments; however, the ranges for the credit spread input 
can vary across instruments. For example, certain fixed 
income instruments, such as certificates of deposit, typically 
have lower credit spreads, whereas certain derivative 
instruments with high-risk counterparties are typically subject 
to higher credit spreads when they are uncollateralized or have 
a longer tenor. Other instruments, such as credit default swaps,

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a 
nonrecurring basis and therefore are not included in the tables 
above. These include assets measured at cost that have been 
written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an 
impairment. In addition, these assets include loans held-for-
sale and other real estate owned that are measured at the lower 
of cost or market.

The following table presents the carrying amounts of all 
assets that were still held for which a nonrecurring fair value 
measurement was recorded:

(1)  Net of fair value amounts on the unfunded portion of loans held-for-sale, 

recognized within Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

(2)  Represents impaired loans held for investment whose carrying amount is 
based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, primarily real estate 
secured loans.

The fair value of loans held-for-sale is determined where 

possible using quoted secondary-market prices. If no such 
quoted price exists, the fair value of a loan is determined using 
quoted prices for a similar asset or assets, adjusted for the 
specific attributes of that loan. Fair value for the other real 
estate owned is based on appraisals. For loans whose carrying 
amount is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, 
the fair values depend on the type of collateral. Fair value of 
the collateral is typically estimated based on quoted market 
prices if available, appraisals or other internal valuation 
techniques.

Where the fair value of the related collateral is based on 
an unadjusted appraised value, the loan is generally classified 
as Level 2. Where significant adjustments are made to the 
appraised value, the loan is classified as Level 3. Additionally, 
for corporate loans, appraisals of the collateral are often based 
on sales of similar assets; however, because the prices of 
similar assets require significant adjustments to reflect the 
unique features of the underlying collateral, these fair value 
measurements are generally classified as Level 3.

Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments not Carried 
at Fair Value
The following table presents the carrying value and fair value 
of Citigroup’s financial instruments that are not carried at fair 
value. The table below therefore excludes items measured at 
fair value on a recurring basis presented in the tables above.

The disclosure also excludes leases, affiliate investments, 

pension and benefit obligations, certain insurance contracts 
and tax-related items. Also, as required, the disclosure 
excludes the effect of taxes, any premium or discount that 
could result from offering for sale at one time the entire 
holdings of a particular instrument, excess fair value 
associated with deposits with no fixed maturity and other 
expenses that would be incurred in a market transaction. In 
addition, the table excludes the values of non-financial assets 
and liabilities, as well as a wide range of franchise, 
relationship and intangible values, which are integral to a full 
assessment of Citigroup’s financial position and the value of 
its net assets.

The fair value represents management’s best estimates 

based on a range of methodologies and assumptions. The 

carrying value of short-term financial instruments not 
accounted for at fair value, as well as receivables and payables 
arising in the ordinary course of business, approximates fair 
value because of the relatively short period of time between 
their origination and expected realization. Quoted market 
prices are used when available for investments and for 
liabilities, such as long-term debt not carried at fair value. For 
loans not accounted for at fair value, cash flows are discounted 
at quoted secondary market rates or estimated market rates if 
available. Otherwise, sales of comparable loan portfolios or 
current market origination rates for loans with similar terms 
and risk characteristics are used. Expected credit losses are 
either embedded in the estimated future cash flows or 
incorporated as an adjustment to the discount rate used. The 
value of collateral is also considered. For liabilities such as 
long-term debt not accounted for at fair value and without 
quoted market prices, market borrowing rates of interest are 
used to discount contractual cash flows.

(3) 

Includes items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
Includes cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, brokerage receivables, reinsurance recoverable and other financial instruments included in Other assets on 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet, for all of which the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

(4)  The carrying value includes long-term debt balances under qualifying fair value hedges.
(5) 

Includes brokerage payables, short-term borrowings (carried at cost) and other financial instruments included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet, for all of which the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Fair values vary from period to period based on changes 

in a wide range of factors, including interest rates, credit 
quality and market perceptions of value, and as existing assets 
and liabilities run off and new transactions are entered into. 
The estimated fair values of loans reflect changes in credit 
status since the loans were made, changes in interest rates in 
the case of fixed-rate loans and premium values at origination 
of certain loans. 

The estimated fair values of the Company’s corporate 
unfunded lending commitments at December 31, 2017 and 
December 31, 2016 were liabilities of $3.2 billion and $5.2 
billion, respectively, substantially all of which are classified as 
Level 3. The Company does not estimate the fair values of 
consumer unfunded lending commitments, which are 
generally cancelable by providing notice to the borrower.

25.   FAIR VALUE ELECTIONS

The Company may elect to report most financial instruments 
and certain other items at fair value on an instrument-by-
instrument basis with changes in fair value reported in 
earnings, other than DVA (see below). The election is made 
upon the initial recognition of an eligible financial asset, 
financial liability or firm commitment or when certain 
specified reconsideration events occur. The fair value election 
may not be revoked once an election is made. The changes in 

fair value are recorded in current earnings, other than DVA, 
which from January 1, 2016 is reported in AOCI. Additional 
discussion regarding the applicable areas in which fair value 
elections were made is presented in Note 24 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company has elected fair value accounting for its 
mortgage servicing rights. See Note 21 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements for further discussions regarding the 
accounting and reporting of MSRs.

The following table presents the changes in fair value of those items for which the fair value option has been elected:

Includes gains (losses) associated with interest rate lock-commitments for those loans that have been originated and elected under the fair value option.

Changes in fair value for transactions in these portfolios 

are recorded in Principal transactions. The related interest 
revenue and interest expense are measured based on the 
contractual rates specified in the transactions and are reported 
as Interest revenue and expense in the Consolidated Statement 
of Income.

Certain Loans and Other Credit Products
Citigroup has also elected the fair value option for certain 
other originated and purchased loans, including certain 
unfunded loan products, such as guarantees and letters of 
credit, executed by Citigroup’s lending and trading businesses. 
None of these credit products are highly leveraged financing 
commitments. Significant groups of transactions include loans 
and unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold 
or securitized in the near term, or transactions where the 
economic risks are hedged with derivative instruments, such 
as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where 
the Company pays the total return on the underlying loans to a 
third party. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to 
mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge 
accounting is complex and to achieve operational 
simplifications. Fair value was not elected for most lending 
transactions across the Company.

Own Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA)
Own debt valuation adjustments are recognized on Citi’s 
liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected 
using Citi’s credit spreads observed in the bond market. 
Effective January 1, 2016, changes in fair value of fair value 
option liabilities related to changes in Citigroup’s own credit 
spreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI; 
previously these amounts were recognized in Citigroup’s 
Revenues and Net income along with all other changes in fair 
value. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for 
additional information.  
       Among other variables, the fair value of liabilities for 
which the fair value option has been elected (other than non-
recourse and similar liabilities) is impacted by the narrowing 
or widening of the Company’s credit spreads. 
       The estimated change in the fair value of these liabilities 
due to such changes in the Company’s own credit spread (or 
instrument-specific credit risk) were losses of $680 million 
and $538 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 
2016, respectively. Changes in fair value resulting from 
changes in instrument-specific credit risk were estimated by 
incorporating the Company’s current credit spreads observable 
in the bond market into the relevant valuation technique used 
to value each liability as described above.

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial 
Liabilities

Selected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under 
Agreements to Resell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold 
Under Agreements to Repurchase, Securities Loaned and 
Certain Non-Collateralized Short-Term Borrowings
The Company elected the fair value option for certain 
portfolios of fixed income securities purchased under 
agreements to resell and fixed income securities sold under 
agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed, securities 
loaned and certain non-collateralized short-term borrowings 
held primarily by broker-dealer entities in the United States, 
United Kingdom and Japan. In each case, the election was 
made because the related interest-rate risk is managed on a 
portfolio basis, primarily with offsetting derivative 
instruments that are accounted for at fair value through 
earnings. 

The following table provides information about certain credit products carried at fair value:

In addition to the amounts reported above, $508 million 

and $1,828 million of unfunded commitments related to 
certain credit products selected for fair value accounting were 
outstanding as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Changes in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit 

products are classified in Principal transactions in Citi’s 
Consolidated Statement of Income. Related interest revenue is 
measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported 

273

as Interest revenue on Trading account assets or loan interest 
depending on the balance sheet classifications of the credit 
products. The changes in fair value for the years ended 
December 31, 2017 and 2016 due to instrument-specific credit 
risk totaled to gains of $10 million and $76 million, 
respectively.

Certain Investments in Unallocated Precious Metals
Citigroup invests in unallocated precious metals accounts 
(gold, silver, platinum and palladium) as part of its commodity 
and foreign currency trading activities or to economically 
hedge certain exposures from issuing structured liabilities. 
Under ASC 815, the investment is bifurcated into a debt host 
contract and a commodity forward derivative instrument. 
Citigroup elects the fair value option for the debt host contract, 
and reports the debt host contract within Trading account 
assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The 
total carrying amount of debt host contracts across unallocated 
precious metals accounts was approximately $0.9 billion and 
$0.6 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The 
amounts are expected to fluctuate based on trading activity in 
future periods.

As part of its commodity and foreign currency trading 

activities, Citi trades unallocated precious metals investments 
and executes forward purchase and forward sale derivative 
contracts with trading counterparties. When Citi sells an 
unallocated precious metals investment, Citi’s receivable from 
its depository bank is repaid and Citi derecognizes its 
investment in the unallocated precious metal. The forward 
purchase or sale contract with the trading counterparty 
indexed to unallocated precious metals is accounted for as a 
derivative, at fair value through earnings. As of December 31, 
2017, there were approximately $10.3 billion and $9.3 billion 
notional amounts of such forward purchase and forward sale 
derivative contracts outstanding, respectively.

Certain Investments in Private Equity and Real Estate 
Ventures and Certain Equity Method and Other Investments
Citigroup invests in private equity and real estate ventures for 
the purpose of earning investment returns and for capital 
appreciation. The Company has elected the fair value option 
for certain of these ventures, because such investments are 
considered similar to many private equity or hedge fund 
activities in Citi’s investment companies, which are reported at 
fair value. The fair value option brings consistency in the 
accounting and evaluation of these investments. All 
investments (debt and equity) in such private equity and real 
estate entities are accounted for at fair value. These 
investments are classified as Investments on Citigroup’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Changes in the fair values of these investments are 

classified in Other revenue in the Company’s Consolidated 
Statement of Income.

Citigroup also elects the fair value option for certain non-

marketable equity securities whose risk is managed with 
derivative instruments that are accounted for at fair value 
through earnings. These securities are classified as Trading 
account assets on Citigroup’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
Changes in the fair value of these securities and the related 
derivative instruments are recorded in Principal transactions.

Certain Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale (HFS)
Citigroup has elected the fair value option for certain 
purchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming 
adjustable-rate first mortgage loans HFS. These loans are 
intended for sale or securitization and are hedged with 
derivative instruments. The Company has elected the fair 
value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases 
where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational 
simplifications.

The following table provides information about certain mortgage loans HFS carried at fair value:

The changes in the fair values of these mortgage loans are 

reported in Other revenue in the Company’s Consolidated 
Statement of Income. There was no net change in fair value 
during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 due to 
instrument-specific credit risk. Related interest income 
continues to be measured based on the contractual interest 
rates and reported as Interest revenue in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income.

Certain Structured Liabilities
The Company has elected the fair value option for certain 
structured liabilities whose performance is linked to structured 
interest rates, inflation, currency, equity, referenced credit or 
commodity risks. The Company elected the fair value option, 
because these exposures are considered to be trading-related 
positions and, therefore, are managed on a fair value basis. 
These positions will continue to be classified as debt, deposits 
or derivatives (Trading account liabilities) on the Company’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet according to their legal form.

instrument:

Prior to 2016, the total change in the fair value of these 

structured liabilities was reported in Principal transactions in 
the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income. Beginning 
in the first quarter of 2016, the portion of the changes in fair 
value attributable to changes in Citigroup’s own credit spreads 
(DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI while all other 
changes in fair value will continue to be reported in Principal 
transactions. Changes in the fair value of these structured 
liabilities include accrued interest, which is also included in 
the change in fair value reported in Principal transactions.

Certain Non-Structured Liabilities
The Company has elected the fair value option for certain non-
structured liabilities with fixed and floating interest rates. The 
Company has elected the fair value option where the interest-
rate risk of such liabilities may be economically hedged with 
derivative contracts or the proceeds are used to purchase

financial assets that will also be accounted for at fair value 
through earnings. The elections have been made to mitigate 
accounting mismatches and to achieve operational 
simplifications. These positions are reported in Short-term 
borrowings and Long-term debt on the Company’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Prior to 2016, the total change in 
the fair value of these non-structured liabilities was reported in 
Principal transactions in the Company’s Consolidated 
Statement of Income. Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, 
the portion of the changes in fair value attributable to changes 
in Citigroup’s own credit spreads (DVA) is reflected as a

continue to be reported in Principal transactions.

 Interest expense on non-structured liabilities is measured 

based on the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest 
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

$7.4 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively, of cash segregated 
under federal and other brokerage regulations or deposited 
with clearing organizations.

Collateral
At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the approximate fair value 
of collateral received by Citi that may be resold or 
repledged, excluding the impact of allowable netting, was 
$457.5 billion and $378.1 billion, respectively. This 
collateral was received in connection with resale agreements, 
securities borrowings and loans, derivative transactions and 
margined broker loans.

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, a substantial portion 
of the collateral received by Citi had been sold or repledged 
in connection with repurchase agreements, securities sold, 
not yet purchased, securities borrowings and loans, pledges 
to clearing organizations, segregation requirements under 
securities laws and regulations, derivative transactions and 
bank loans.

Guarantees
Citi provides a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to 
its customers to enhance their credit standing and enable 
them to complete a wide variety of business transactions. For
certain contracts meeting the definition of a guarantee, the 
guarantor must recognize, at inception, a liability for the fair 
value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee.
In addition, the guarantor must disclose the maximum 

potential amount of future payments that the guarantor could 
be required to make under the guarantee, if there were a total 
default by the guaranteed parties. The determination of the 
maximum potential future payments is based on the notional 
amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible 
recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held 
or pledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts bear no 
relationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these 
guarantees.

(1)  The carrying values of securities lending indemnifications and credit card merchant processing were not material for either period presented, as the probability 

of potential liabilities arising from these guarantees is minimal.

(2)  At December 31, 2017 and 2016, this maximum potential exposure was estimated to be $86 billion and $86 billion, respectively. However, Citi believes that 

the maximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure based on its historical experience. This contingent liability is unlikely to 
arise, as most products and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants.

Financial Standby Letters of Credit
Citi issues standby letters of credit, which substitute its own 
credit for that of the borrower. If a letter of credit is drawn 
down, the borrower is obligated to repay Citi. Standby letters 
of credit protect a third party from defaults on contractual 
obligations. Financial standby letters of credit include 
(i) guarantees of payment of insurance premiums and 
reinsurance risks that support industrial revenue bond 
underwriting, (ii) settlement of payment obligations to 
clearing houses, including futures and over-the-counter 
derivatives clearing (see further discussion below), 
(iii) support options and purchases of securities in lieu of 
escrow deposit accounts and (iv) letters of credit that 
backstop loans, credit facilities, promissory notes and trade 
acceptances.

Performance Guarantees
Performance guarantees and letters of credit are issued to 
guarantee a customer’s tender bid on a construction or 
systems-installation project or to guarantee completion of 
such projects in accordance with contract terms. They are 
also issued to support a customer’s obligation to supply 
specified products, commodities or maintenance or warranty 
services to a third party.

Derivative Instruments Considered to Be Guarantees
Derivatives are financial instruments whose cash flows are 
based on a notional amount and an underlying instrument, 
reference credit or index, where there is little or no initial 
investment, and whose terms require or permit net 
settlement. For a discussion of Citi’s derivatives activities, 
see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Derivative instruments considered to be guarantees 
include only those instruments that require Citi to make 
payments to the counterparty based on changes in an 
underlying instrument that is related to an asset, a liability or 
an equity security held by the guaranteed party. More 
specifically, derivative instruments considered to be 

guarantees include certain over-the-counter written put 
options where the counterparty is not a bank, hedge fund or 
broker-dealer (such counterparties are considered to be 
dealers in these markets and may, therefore, not hold the 
underlying instruments). Credit derivatives sold by Citi are 
excluded from the tables above as they are disclosed 
separately in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. In instances where Citi’s maximum potential 
future payment is unlimited, the notional amount of the 
contract is disclosed.

Loans Sold with Recourse
Loans sold with recourse represent Citi’s obligations to 
reimburse the buyers for loan losses under certain 
circumstances. Recourse refers to the clause in a sales 
agreement under which a seller/lender will fully reimburse 
the buyer/investor for any losses resulting from the 
purchased loans. This may be accomplished by the seller 
taking back any loans that become delinquent.

In addition to the amounts shown in the tables above, 

Citi has recorded a repurchase reserve for its potential 
repurchases or make-whole liability regarding residential 
mortgage representation and warranty claims related to its 
whole loan sales to the U.S. government-sponsored 
enterprises (GSEs) and, to a lesser extent, private investors. 
The repurchase reserve was approximately $66 million and 
$107 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, 
and these amounts are included in Other liabilities on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Securities Lending Indemnifications
Owners of securities frequently lend those securities for a fee 
to other parties who may sell them short or deliver them to 
another party to satisfy some other obligation. Banks may 
administer such securities lending programs for their clients. 
Securities lending indemnifications are issued by the bank to 
guarantee that a securities lending customer will be made 

277

whole in the event that the security borrower does not return 
the security subject to the lending agreement and collateral 
held is insufficient to cover the market value of the security.

Credit Card Merchant Processing
Credit card merchant processing guarantees represent the 
Company’s indirect obligations in connection with 
(i) providing transaction processing services to various 
merchants with respect to its private-label cards and 
(ii) potential liability for bank card transaction processing 
services. The nature of the liability in either case arises as a 
result of a billing dispute between a merchant and a 
cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the cardholder’s 
favor. The merchant is liable to refund the amount to the 
cardholder. In general, if the credit card processing company 
is unable to collect this amount from the merchant, the credit 
card processing company bears the loss for the amount of the 
credit or refund paid to the cardholder.

With regard to (i) above, Citi has the primary contingent 

liability with respect to its portfolio of private-label 
merchants. The risk of loss is mitigated as the cash flows 
between Citi and the merchant are settled on a net basis, and 
Citi has the right to offset any payments with cash flows 
otherwise due to the merchant. To further mitigate this risk, 
Citi may delay settlement, require a merchant to make an 
escrow deposit, include event triggers to provide Citi with 
more financial and operational control in the event of the 
financial deterioration of the merchant or require various 
credit enhancements (including letters of credit and bank 
guarantees). In the unlikely event that a private-label 
merchant is unable to deliver products, services or a refund 
to its private-label cardholders, Citi is contingently liable to 
credit or refund cardholders.

With regard to (ii) above, Citi has a potential liability for 

bank card transactions where Citi provides the transaction 
processing services as well as those where a third party 
provides the services and Citi acts as a secondary guarantor, 
should that processor fail to perform.

Citi’s maximum potential contingent liability related to 

both bank card and private-label merchant processing 
services is estimated to be the total volume of credit card 
transactions that meet the requirements to be valid charge-
back transactions at any given time. At December 31, 2017 
and 2016, this maximum potential exposure was estimated to 
be $86 billion and $86 billion, respectively.

However, Citi believes that the maximum exposure is 

not representative of the actual potential loss exposure based 
on its historical experience. This contingent liability is 
unlikely to arise, as most products and services are delivered 
when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are 
returned to merchants. Citi assesses the probability and 
amount of its contingent liability related to merchant 
processing based on the financial strength of the primary 
guarantor, the extent and nature of unresolved charge-backs 
and its historical loss experience. At December 31, 2017 and 
2016, the losses incurred and the carrying amounts of Citi’s 
contingent obligations related to merchant processing 
activities were immaterial.

Credit Card Arrangements with Partners
Citi, in certain of its credit card partner arrangements, 
provides guarantees to the partner regarding the volume of 
certain customer originations during the term of the 
agreement. To the extent that such origination targets are not 
met, the guarantees serve to compensate the partner for 
certain payments that otherwise would have been generated 
in connection with such originations.

Custody Indemnifications
Custody indemnifications are issued to guarantee that 
custody clients will be made whole in the event that a third-
party subcustodian or depository institution fails to safeguard 
clients’ assets.

Other Guarantees and Indemnifications

Credit Card Protection Programs
Citi, through its credit card businesses, provides various
cardholder protection programs on several of its card
products, including programs that provide insurance
coverage for rental cars, coverage for certain losses
associated with purchased products, price protection for
certain purchases and protection for lost luggage. These
guarantees are not included in the table, since the total
outstanding amount of the guarantees and Citi’s maximum
exposure to loss cannot be quantified. The protection is
limited to certain types of purchases and losses, and it is not
possible to quantify the purchases that would qualify for
these benefits at any given time. Citi assesses the probability
and amount of its potential liability related to these programs
based on the extent and nature of its historical loss
experience. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the actual and 
estimated losses incurred and the carrying value
of Citi’s obligations related to these programs were
immaterial.

Other Representation and Warranty Indemnifications
In the normal course of business, Citi provides standard 
representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts 
in connection with numerous transactions and also provides 
indemnifications, including indemnifications that protect the 
counterparties to the contracts in the event that additional 
taxes are owed, due either to a change in the tax law or an 
adverse interpretation of the tax law. Counterparties to these 
transactions provide Citi with comparable indemnifications. 
While such representations, warranties and indemnifications 
are essential components of many contractual relationships, 
they do not represent the underlying business purpose for the 
transactions. The indemnification clauses are often standard 
contractual terms related to Citi’s own performance under 
the terms of a contract and are entered into in the normal 
course of business based on an assessment that the risk of 
loss is remote. Often these clauses are intended to ensure that 
terms of a contract are met at inception. No compensation is 
received for these standard representations and warranties, 
and it is not possible to determine their fair value because 
they rarely, if ever, result in a payment. In many cases, there 
are no stated or notional amounts included in the 

278

indemnification clauses, and the contingencies potentially 
triggering the obligation to indemnify have not occurred and 
are not expected to occur. As a result, these indemnifications 
are not included in the tables above.

Value-Transfer Networks
Citi is a member of, or shareholder in, hundreds of value-
transfer networks (VTNs) (payment, clearing and settlement 
systems as well as exchanges) around the world. As a 
condition of membership, many of these VTNs require that 
members stand ready to pay a pro rata share of the losses 
incurred by the organization due to another member’s default 
on its obligations. Citi’s potential obligations may be limited 
to its membership interests in the VTNs, contributions to the 
VTN’s funds, or, in limited cases, the obligation may be 
unlimited. The maximum exposure cannot be estimated as 
this would require an assessment of future claims that have 
not yet occurred. Citi believes the risk of loss is remote 
given historical experience with the VTNs. Accordingly, 
Citi’s participation in VTNs is not reported in the guarantees 
tables above, and there are no amounts reflected on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2017 or 
2016 for potential obligations that could arise from Citi’s 
involvement with VTN associations.

Long-Term Care Insurance Indemnification
In 2000, Travelers Life & Annuity (Travelers), then a 
subsidiary of Citi, entered into a reinsurance agreement to 
transfer the risks and rewards of its long-term care (LTC) 
business to GE Life (now Genworth Financial Inc., or 
Genworth), then a subsidiary of the General Electric 
Company (GE). As part of this transaction, the reinsurance 
obligations were provided by two regulated insurance 
subsidiaries of GE Life, which funded two collateral trusts 
with securities. Presently, as discussed below, the trusts are 
referred to as the Genworth Trusts. 

As part of GE’s spin-off of Genworth in 2004, GE 
retained the risks and rewards associated with the 2000 
Travelers reinsurance agreement by providing a reinsurance 
contract to Genworth through its Union Fidelity Life 
Insurance Company (UFLIC) subsidiary that covers the 
Travelers LTC policies. In addition, GE provided a capital 
maintenance agreement in favor of UFLIC which is designed 
to assure that UFLIC will have the funds to pay its 
reinsurance obligations. As a result of these reinsurance 
agreements and the spin-off of Genworth, Genworth has 
reinsurance protection from UFLIC (supported by GE) and 
has reinsurance obligations in connection with the Travelers 
LTC policies.  As noted below, the Genworth reinsurance 
obligations now benefit Brighthouse Financial, Inc. 
(Brighthouse). While neither Brighthouse nor Citi are direct 
beneficiaries of the capital maintenance agreement between 
GE and UFLIC, Brighthouse and Citi benefit indirectly from 
the existence of the capital maintenance agreement, which 
helps assure that UFLIC will continue to have funds 
necessary to pay its reinsurance obligations to Genworth. 

In connection with Citi’s 2005 sale of Travelers to 

MetLife Inc. (MetLife), Citi provided an indemnification to 
MetLife for losses (including policyholder claims) relating to 

the LTC business for the entire term of the Travelers LTC 
policies, which, as noted above, are reinsured by subsidiaries 
of Genworth. In 2017, MetLife spun off its retail insurance 
business to Brighthouse.  As a result, the Travelers LTC 
policies now reside with Brighthouse.  The original 
reinsurance agreement between Travelers (now Brighthouse) 
and Genworth remains in place and Brighthouse is the sole 
beneficiary of the Genworth Trusts. The fair value of the 
Genworth Trusts is approximately $7.5 billion as of 
December 31, 2017, compared to $7.0 billion at December 
31, 2016. The Genworth Trusts are designed to provide 
collateral to Brighthouse in an amount equal to the statutory 
liabilities of Brighthouse in respect of the Travelers LTC 
policies. The assets in the Genworth Trusts are evaluated and 
adjusted periodically to ensure that the fair value of the 
assets continues to provide collateral in an amount equal to 
these estimated statutory liabilities, as the liabilities change 
over time.

If both (i) Genworth fails to perform under the original 

Travelers/GE Life reinsurance agreement for any reason, 
including insolvency or the failure of UFLIC to perform in a 
timely manner, and (ii) the assets of the two Genworth Trusts 
are insufficient or unavailable, then Citi, through its LTC 
reinsurance indemnification, must reimburse Brighthouse for 
any losses incurred in connection with the LTC policies. 
Since both events would have to occur before Citi would 
become responsible for any payment to Brighthouse 
pursuant to its indemnification obligation, and the likelihood 
of such events occurring is currently not probable, there is no 
liability reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of 
December 31, 2017 and 2016 related to this indemnification. 
Citi continues to closely monitor its potential exposure under 
this indemnification obligation. 

Separately, Genworth announced that it had agreed to 

be purchased by China Oceanwide Holdings Co., Ltd, 
subject to a series of conditions and regulatory approvals. 
Citi is monitoring these developments. 

Futures and Over-the-Counter Derivatives Clearing
Citi provides clearing services on central clearing parties 
(CCPs) for clients that need to clear exchange traded and 
over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts. Based on all 
relevant facts and circumstances, Citi has concluded that it 
acts as an agent for accounting purposes in its role as 
clearing member for these client transactions. As such, Citi 
does not reflect the underlying exchange traded or OTC 
derivatives contracts in its Consolidated Financial 
Statements. See Note 22 for a discussion of Citi’s derivatives 
activities that are reflected in its Consolidated Financial 
Statements.

As a clearing member, Citi collects and remits cash and 

securities collateral (margin) between its clients and the 
respective CCP. In certain circumstances, Citi collects a 
higher amount of cash (or securities) from its clients than it 
needs to remit to the CCPs. This excess cash is then held at 
depository institutions such as banks or carry brokers.

There are two types of margin: initial and variation. 
Where Citi obtains benefits from or controls cash initial 
margin (e.g., retains an interest spread), cash initial margin 

279

approximately $0.8 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The 
carrying value of financial and performance guarantees is 
included in Other liabilities. For loans sold with recourse, 
the carrying value of the liability is included in Other 
liabilities.

Collateral
Cash collateral available to Citi to reimburse losses realized 
under these guarantees and indemnifications amounted to 
$46 billion and $48 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, 
respectively. Securities and other marketable assets held as 
collateral amounted to $70 billion and $41 billion at 
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The majority of 
collateral is held to reimburse losses realized under securities 
lending indemnifications. Additionally, letters of credit in 
favor of Citi held as collateral amounted to $3.7 billion and 
$5.4 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Other property may also be available to Citi to cover losses 
under certain guarantees and indemnifications; however, the 
value of such property has not been determined.

Performance Risk
Citi evaluates the performance risk of its guarantees based 
on the assigned referenced counterparty internal or external 
ratings. Where external ratings are used, investment-grade 
ratings are considered to be Baa/BBB and above, while 
anything below is considered non-investment grade. Citi’s 
internal ratings are in line with the related external rating 
system. On certain underlying referenced assets or entities, 
ratings are not available. Such referenced assets are included 
in the “not rated” category. The maximum potential amount 
of the future payments related to the outstanding guarantees 
is determined to be the notional amount of these contracts, 
which is the par amount of the assets guaranteed.

Presented in the tables below are the maximum potential 

amounts of future payments that are classified based upon 
internal and external credit ratings. As previously mentioned, 
the determination of the maximum potential future payments 
is based on the notional amount of the guarantees without 
consideration of possible recoveries under recourse 
provisions or from collateral held or pledged. As such, Citi 
believes such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated 
losses, if any, on these guarantees.

collected from clients and remitted to the CCP or depository 
institutions is reflected within Brokerage payables (payables 
to customers) and Brokerage receivables (receivables from 
brokers, dealers and clearing organizations) or Cash and due 
from banks, respectively. 

However, for exchange traded and OTC-cleared 

derivatives contracts where Citi does not obtain benefits 
from or control the client cash balances, the client cash 
initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the CCP 
or depository institutions is not reflected on Citi’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. These conditions are met when 
Citi has contractually agreed with the client that (i) Citi will 
pass through to the client all interest paid by the CCP or 
depository institutions on the cash initial margin, (ii) Citi 
will not utilize its right as a clearing member to transform 
cash margin into other assets, (iii) Citi does not guarantee 
and is not liable to the client for the performance of the CCP 
or the depository institution and (iv) the client cash balances 
are legally isolated from Citi’s bankruptcy estate. The total 
amount of cash initial margin collected and remitted in this 
manner was approximately $10.7 billion and $9.4 billion as 
of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Variation margin due from clients to the respective CCP, 

or from the CCP to clients, reflects changes in the value of 
the client’s derivative contracts for each trading day. As a 
clearing member, Citi is exposed to the risk of non-
performance by clients (e.g., failure of a client to post 
variation margin to the CCP for negative changes in the 
value of the client’s derivative contracts). In the event of 
non-performance by a client, Citi would move to close out 
the client’s positions. The CCP would typically utilize initial 
margin posted by the client and held by the CCP, with any 
remaining shortfalls required to be paid by Citi as clearing 
member. Citi generally holds incremental cash or securities 
margin posted by the client, which would typically be 
expected to be sufficient to mitigate Citi’s credit risk in the 
event that the client fails to perform.

 As required by ASC 860-30-25-5, securities collateral 
posted by clients is not recognized on Citi’s Consolidated 
Balance Sheet.

Carrying Value—Guarantees and Indemnifications
At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the total carrying amounts 
of the liabilities related to the guarantees and 
indemnifications included in the tables above amounted to

Credit Commitments and Lines of Credit
The table below summarizes Citigroup’s credit commitments:

In millions of dollars
Commercial and similar letters of credit
One- to four-family residential mortgages
Revolving open-end loans secured by one- to four-family residential
properties
Commercial real estate, construction and land development
Credit card lines
Commercial and other consumer loan commitments
Other commitments and contingencies
Total

The majority of unused commitments are contingent upon 

customers maintaining specific credit standards. 
Commercial commitments generally have floating interest 
rates and fixed expiration dates and may require payment of 
fees. Such fees (net of certain direct costs) are deferred and, 
upon exercise of the commitment, amortized over the life of 
the loan or, if exercise is deemed remote, amortized over the 
commitment period. 

Commercial and Similar Letters of Credit
A commercial letter of credit is an instrument by which 
Citigroup substitutes its credit for that of a customer to 
enable the customer to finance the purchase of goods or to 
incur other commitments. Citigroup issues a letter on behalf 
of its client to a supplier and agrees to pay the supplier upon 
presentation of documentary evidence that the supplier has 
performed in accordance with the terms of the letter of 
credit. When a letter of credit is drawn, the customer is then 
required to reimburse Citigroup. 

One- to Four-Family Residential Mortgages
A one- to four-family residential mortgage commitment is a 
written confirmation from Citigroup to a seller of a property 
that the bank will advance the specified sums enabling the 
buyer to complete the purchase. 

Revolving Open-End Loans Secured by One- to Four-
Family Residential Properties
Revolving open-end loans secured by one- to four-family 
residential properties are essentially home equity lines of 
credit. A home equity line of credit is a loan secured by a 
primary residence or second home to the extent of the excess 
of fair market value over the debt outstanding for the first 
mortgage. 

Commercial Real Estate, Construction and Land 
Development
Commercial real estate, construction and land development 
include unused portions of commitments to extend credit for 
the purpose of financing commercial and multifamily 
residential properties as well as land development projects. 

 Both secured-by-real-estate and unsecured 
commitments are included in this line, as well as

undistributed loan proceeds, where there is an obligation to 
advance for construction progress payments. However, this 
line only includes those extensions of credit that, once 
funded, will be classified as Total loans, net on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Credit Card Lines
Citigroup provides credit to customers by issuing credit 
cards. The credit card lines are cancelable by providing 
notice to the cardholder or without such notice as permitted 
by local law. 

Commercial and Other Consumer Loan Commitments
Commercial and other consumer loan commitments include 
overdraft and liquidity facilities as well as commercial 
commitments to make or purchase loans, purchase third-
party receivables, provide note issuance or revolving 
underwriting facilities and invest in the form of equity. 

Other Commitments and Contingencies
Other commitments and contingencies include committed or 
unsettled regular-way reverse repurchase agreements and all 
other transactions related to commitments and contingencies 
not reported on the lines above.

Unsettled Reverse Repurchase and Securities Lending 
Agreements and Unsettled Repurchase and Securities 
Borrowing Agreements
In addition, in the normal course of business, Citigroup 
enters into reverse repurchase and securities borrowing 
agreements, as well as repurchase and securities lending 
agreements, which settle at a future date. At December 31, 
2017, and December 31, 2016, Citigroup had $35.0 billion 
and $43.1 billion unsettled reverse repurchase and securities 
borrowing agreements, and $19.1 billion and $14.9 billion 
unsettled repurchase and securities lending agreements. For 
a further discussion of securities purchased under 
agreements to resell and securities borrowed, and securities 
sold under agreements to repurchase and securities loaned, 
including the Company’s policy for offsetting repurchase 
and reverse repurchase agreements, see Note 11 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

27.   CONTINGENCIES

Accounting and Disclosure Framework
ASC 450 governs the disclosure and recognition of loss 
contingencies, including potential losses from litigation and 
regulatory matters. ASC 450 defines a “loss contingency” as 
“an existing condition, situation, or set of circumstances 
involving uncertainty as to possible loss to an entity that will 
ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur 
or fail to occur.” It imposes different requirements for the 
recognition and disclosure of loss contingencies based on the 
likelihood of occurrence of the contingent future event or 
events. It distinguishes among degrees of likelihood using the 
following three terms: “probable,” meaning that “the future 
event or events are likely to occur”; “remote,” meaning that 
“the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight”; 
and “reasonably possible,” meaning that “the chance of the 
future event or events occurring is more than remote but less 
than likely.” These three terms are used below as defined in 
ASC 450.

Accruals. ASC 450 requires accrual for a loss contingency 
when it is “probable that one or more future events will occur 
confirming the fact of loss” and “the amount of the loss can be 
reasonably estimated.” In accordance with ASC 450, Citigroup 
establishes accruals for contingencies, including the litigation 
and regulatory matters disclosed herein, when Citigroup 
believes it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the 
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When the 
reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts, 
the minimum amount of the range is accrued, unless some 
higher amount within the range is a better estimate than any 
other amount within the range. Once established, accruals are 
adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of 
additional information. The amount of loss ultimately incurred 
in relation to those matters may be substantially higher or 
lower than the amounts accrued for those matters.

Disclosure. ASC 450 requires disclosure of a loss 

contingency if “there is at least a reasonable possibility that a 
loss or an additional loss may have been incurred” and there is 
no accrual for the loss because the conditions described above 
are not met or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the 
amount accrued. In accordance with ASC 450, if Citigroup has 
not accrued for a matter because Citigroup believes that a loss 
is reasonably possible but not probable, or that a loss is 
probable but not reasonably estimable, and the reasonably 
possible loss is material, it discloses the loss contingency. In 
addition, Citigroup discloses matters for which it has accrued 
if it believes a reasonably possible exposure to material loss 
exists in excess of the amount accrued. In accordance with 
ASC 450, Citigroup’s disclosure includes an estimate of the 
reasonably possible loss or range of loss for those matters as to 
which an estimate can be made. ASC 450 does not require 
disclosure of an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or 
range of loss where an estimate cannot be made. Neither 
accrual nor disclosure is required for losses that are deemed 
remote.

Litigation and Regulatory Contingencies
Overview. In addition to the matters described below, in the 
ordinary course of business, Citigroup, its affiliates and 
subsidiaries, and current and former officers, directors and 
employees (for purposes of this section, sometimes 
collectively referred to as Citigroup and Related Parties) 
routinely are named as defendants in, or as parties to, various 
legal actions and proceedings. Certain of these actions and 
proceedings assert claims or seek relief in connection with 
alleged violations of consumer protection, fair lending, 
securities, banking, antifraud, antitrust, anti-money 
laundering, employment and other statutory and common 
laws. Certain of these actual or threatened legal actions and 
proceedings include claims for substantial or indeterminate 
compensatory or punitive damages, or for injunctive relief, 
and in some instances seek recovery on a class-wide basis.

In the ordinary course of business, Citigroup and Related 

Parties also are subject to governmental and regulatory 
examinations, information-gathering requests, investigations 
and proceedings (both formal and informal), certain of which 
may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, 
restitution, disgorgement, injunctions or other relief. In 
addition, certain affiliates and subsidiaries of Citigroup are 
banks, registered broker-dealers, futures commission 
merchants, investment advisers or other regulated entities and, 
in those capacities, are subject to regulation by various U.S., 
state and foreign securities, banking, commodity futures, 
consumer protection and other regulators. In connection with 
formal and informal inquiries by these regulators, Citigroup 
and such affiliates and subsidiaries receive numerous requests, 
subpoenas and orders seeking documents, testimony and other 
information in connection with various aspects of their 
regulated activities. From time to time Citigroup and Related 
Parties also receive grand jury subpoenas and other requests 
for information or assistance, formal or informal, from federal 
or state law enforcement agencies including, among others, 
various United States Attorneys’ Offices, the Asset Forfeiture 
and Money Laundering Section and other divisions of the 
Department of Justice, the Financial Crimes Enforcement 
Network of the United States Department of the Treasury, and 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation relating to Citigroup and 
its customers.

Because of the global scope of Citigroup’s operations, and 

its presence in countries around the world, Citigroup and 
Related Parties are subject to litigation and governmental and 
regulatory examinations, information-gathering requests, 
investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) in 
multiple jurisdictions with legal and regulatory regimes that 
may differ substantially, and present substantially different 
risks, from those Citigroup and Related Parties are subject to 
in the United States. In some instances, Citigroup and Related 
Parties may be involved in proceedings involving the same 
subject matter in multiple jurisdictions, which may result in 
overlapping, cumulative or inconsistent outcomes.

Citigroup seeks to resolve all litigation and regulatory 
matters in the manner management believes is in the best 
interests of Citigroup and its shareholders, and contests 
liability, allegations of wrongdoing and, where applicable, the

283

amount of damages or scope of any penalties or other relief 
sought as appropriate in each pending matter.

Inherent Uncertainty of the Matters Disclosed. Certain of 
the matters disclosed below involve claims for substantial or 
indeterminate damages. The claims asserted in these matters 
typically are broad, often spanning a multi-year period and 
sometimes a wide range of business activities, and the 
plaintiffs’ or claimants’ alleged damages frequently are not 
quantified or factually supported in the complaint or statement 
of claim. Other matters relate to regulatory investigations or 
proceedings, as to which there may be no objective basis for 
quantifying the range of potential fine, penalty or other 
remedy. As a result, Citigroup is often unable to estimate the 
loss in such matters, even if it believes that a loss is probable 
or reasonably possible, until developments in the case or 
investigation have yielded additional information sufficient to 
support a quantitative assessment of the range of reasonably 
possible loss. Such developments may include, among other 
things, discovery from adverse parties or third parties, rulings 
by the court on key issues, analysis by retained experts and 
engagement in settlement negotiations. Depending on a range 
of factors, such as the complexity of the facts, the novelty of 
the legal theories, the pace of discovery, the court’s scheduling 
order, the timing of court decisions and the adverse party’s 
willingness to negotiate in good faith toward a resolution, it 
may be months or years after the filing of a case or 
commencement of an investigation before an estimate of the 
range of reasonably possible loss can be made.

Matters as to Which an Estimate Can Be Made. For some 

of the matters disclosed below, Citigroup is currently able to 
estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess 
of amounts accrued (if any). For some of the matters included 
within this estimation, an accrual has been made because a 
loss is believed to be both probable and reasonably estimable, 
but an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued. 
In these cases, the estimate reflects the reasonably possible 
range of loss in excess of the accrued amount. For other 
matters included within this estimation, no accrual has been 
made because a loss, although estimable, is believed to be 
reasonably possible, but not probable; in these cases, the 
estimate reflects the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. 
As of December 31, 2017, Citigroup estimates that the 
reasonably possible unaccrued loss for these matters ranges up 
to approximately $1.0 billion in the aggregate.

These estimates are based on currently available 

information. As available information changes, the matters for 
which Citigroup is able to estimate will change, and the 
estimates themselves will change. In addition, while many 
estimates presented in financial statements and other financial 
disclosures involve significant judgment and may be subject to 
significant uncertainty, estimates of the range of reasonably 
possible loss arising from litigation and regulatory 
proceedings are subject to particular uncertainties. For 
example, at the time of making an estimate, (i) Citigroup may 
have only preliminary, incomplete, or inaccurate information 
about the facts underlying the claim, (ii) its assumptions about 
the future rulings of the court or other tribunal on significant 
issues, or the behavior and incentives of adverse parties or 
regulators, may prove to be wrong and (iii) the outcomes it is 

attempting to predict are often not amenable to the use of 
statistical or other quantitative analytical tools. In addition, 
from time to time an outcome may occur that Citigroup had 
not accounted for in its estimate because it had deemed such 
an outcome to be remote. For all of these reasons, the amount 
of loss in excess of accruals ultimately incurred for the matters 
as to which an estimate has been made could be substantially 
higher or lower than the range of loss included in the estimate.

Matters as to Which an Estimate Cannot Be Made. For 
other matters disclosed below, Citigroup is not currently able 
to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. Many 
of these matters remain in very preliminary stages (even in 
some cases where a substantial period of time has passed since 
the commencement of the matter), with few or no substantive 
legal decisions by the court or tribunal defining the scope of 
the claims, the class (if any) or the potentially available 
damages, and fact discovery is still in progress or has not yet 
begun. In many of these matters, Citigroup has not yet 
answered the complaint or statement of claim or asserted its 
defenses, nor has it engaged in any negotiations with the 
adverse party (whether a regulator or a private party). For all 
these reasons, Citigroup cannot at this time estimate the 
reasonably possible loss or range of loss, if any, for these 
matters.

Opinion of Management as to Eventual Outcome. Subject 
to the foregoing, it is the opinion of Citigroup’s management, 
based on current knowledge and after taking into account its 
current legal accruals, that the eventual outcome of all matters 
described in this Note would not be likely to have a material 
adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of 
Citigroup. Nonetheless, given the substantial or indeterminate 
amounts sought in certain of these matters, and the inherent 
unpredictability of such matters, an adverse outcome in certain 
of these matters could, from time to time, have a material 
adverse effect on Citigroup’s consolidated results of 
operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual 
periods.

CARD Act Matter
Citi identified certain methodological issues in connection 
with determining annual percentage rates (APRs) for certain 
cardholders under the rate re-evaluation provisions of the 
Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act 
(CARD Act) and Regulation Z. Citi self-reported the issues to 
its regulators and will be providing remediation to affected 
customers. Citi is cooperating fully with the regulatory 
reviews.

Credit Crisis-Related Litigation and Other Matters
Citigroup and Related Parties were named as defendants in 
numerous legal actions and other proceedings asserting claims 
for damages and related relief for losses arising from the 
global financial credit crisis that began in 2007. Citigroup also 
received subpoenas and requests for information from various 
regulatory agencies and other government authorities 
concerning certain businesses impacted by the credit crisis. 
The vast majority of these matters have been resolved as of 
December 31, 2017.

284

Mortgage-Related Litigation and Other Matters
Mortgage-Backed Securities and CDO Investor Actions: 
Beginning in July 2010, Citigroup and Related Parties were 
named as defendants in complaints filed by purchasers of 
MBS and CDOs sold or underwritten by Citigroup. The 
complaints generally assert that defendants made material 
misrepresentations and omissions about the credit quality of 
the assets underlying the securities or the manner in which 
those assets were selected, and typically assert claims under 
Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, state blue sky laws, 
and/or common-law misrepresentation-based causes of action.
All but one of these matters have been resolved through 

settlement or otherwise.  As of December 31, 2017, the 
aggregate original purchase amount of the purchases covered 
by the remaining tolling (extension) agreement with an 
investor threatening litigation is approximately $500 million. 
 Mortgage-Backed Securities Repurchase Claims: Various 

parties to MBS securitizations and other interested parties 
have asserted that certain Citigroup affiliates breached 
representations and warranties made in connection with 
mortgage loans sold into securitization trusts (private-label 
securitizations). Typically, these claims are based on 
allegations that securitized mortgages were not underwritten in 
accordance with the applicable underwriting standards. 
Citigroup also has received inquiries, demands for loan files, 
and requests to toll the applicable statutes of limitation for 
representation and warranty claims, relating to its private-label 
securitizations. These inquiries, demands and requests have 
been made by trustees of securitization trusts and others.

To date, trustees have filed six actions against Citigroup 

seeking to enforce certain of these contractual repurchase 
claims that were excluded from the April 7, 2014 settlement in 
connection with four private-label securitizations. Citigroup

Mortgage-Backed Securities Trustee Actions: On 

November 24, 2014, a group of investors in 27 RMBS trusts 
for which Citibank served or currently serves as trustee filed 
an action in the United States District Court for the Southern 
District of New York, captioned FIXED INCOME SHARES: 
SERIES M ET AL. v. CITIBANK N.A., alleging claims that 
Citibank failed to pursue contractual remedies against 
securitization sponsors and servicers.  On September 8, 2015, 
the United States District Court for the Southern District of 
New York dismissed all claims as to 24 of the 27 trusts and 
allowed certain of the claims to proceed as to the other three 
trusts. On September 7, 2016, plaintiffs filed a stipulation of 
voluntary dismissal of their claims with respect to two of the 
three remaining trusts, leaving one trust at issue. On 
September 30, 2016, plaintiffs moved to certify a class action, 
and on April 7, 2017, Citibank moved for summary judgment 
on all remaining claims. Both motions are pending. Additional 
information concerning this action is publicly available in 

court filings under the docket number 14-cv-9373 (S.D.N.Y.) 
(Furman, J.).

On November 24, 2015, largely the same group of 
investors filed an action in the New York State Supreme 
Court, captioned FIXED INCOME SHARES: SERIES M, ET 
AL. v. CITIBANK N.A., related to the 24 trusts dismissed 
from the federal court action and one additional trust, asserting 
claims similar to the action filed in federal court.  On June 22, 
2016, the court dismissed plaintiffs’ complaint. Plaintiffs filed 
an amended complaint on August 5, 2016. On June 27, 2017, 
the court granted in part and denied in part Citibank’s motion 
to dismiss the amended complaint.  Citibank appealed as to the 
sustained claims, and on January 16, 2018, the New York 
Appellate Division, First Department, dismissed all of the 
remaining claims except the claim for breach of contract 
related to purported discovery of alleged underwriter breaches 
of representations and warranties.  Additional information 
concerning this action is publicly available in court filings 
under the docket number 653891/2015 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.) 
(Ramos, J.).

On August 19, 2015, the Federal Deposit Insurance 

Corporation (FDIC), as receiver for a financial institution, 
filed a civil action against Citibank in the United States 
District Court for the Southern District of New York, 
captioned FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE 
CORPORATION AS RECEIVER FOR GUARANTY BANK 
v. CITIBANK N.A. The complaint concerns one RMBS trust 
for which Citibank formerly served as trustee, and alleges that 
Citibank failed to pursue contractual remedies against the 
sponsor and servicers of that trust. On September 30, 2016, the 
court granted Citibank’s motion to dismiss on the grounds that 
the FDIC lacked standing to pursue its claims. On October 14, 
2016, the FDIC filed a motion for reconsideration or relief 
from judgment from the court’s dismissal order. On July 10, 
2017, the court denied the motion for reconsideration but 
granted the FDIC leave to file an amended complaint. The 
FDIC filed an amended complaint on December 8, 2017.  
Additional information concerning this action is publicly 
available in court filings under the docket number 15-cv-6574

Lehman Brothers Bankruptcy Proceedings
On February 8, 2012, Citibank and certain Citigroup affiliates 
were named as defendants in an adversary proceeding 
asserting objections to certain proofs of claim totaling 
approximately $2.6 billion filed by Citibank and those 
affiliates, and claims under federal bankruptcy and state law to 
recover $2 billion deposited by Lehman Brothers Holdings 
Inc. (LBHI) with Citibank against which Citibank asserted a 
right of setoff. A global settlement between the parties was 
approved by the bankruptcy court on October 13, 2017. As 
part of the global settlement, Citibank retained $350 million 
from LBHI’s deposit at Citibank and returned to LBHI and its 
affiliates the remaining deposited funds, and LBHI withdrew 
its remaining objections to the bankruptcy claims filed by 
Citibank and its affiliates. This action was dismissed by 
stipulation on November 3, 2017. Additional information

Tribune Company Bankruptcy
Certain Citigroup affiliates have been named as defendants in 
adversary proceedings related to the Chapter 11 cases of 
Tribune Company (Tribune) filed in the United States 
Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, asserting 
claims arising out of the approximately $11 billion leveraged 
buyout of Tribune in 2007. On August 2, 2013, the Litigation 
Trustee, as successor plaintiff to the Official Committee of 
Unsecured Creditors, filed a fifth amended complaint in the 
adversary proceeding KIRSCHNER v. FITZSIMONS, ET AL. 
The complaint seeks to avoid and recover as actual fraudulent 
transfers the transfers of Tribune stock that occurred as a part 
of the leveraged buyout. Several Citigroup affiliates are named 
as “Shareholder Defendants” and are alleged to have tendered 
Tribune stock to Tribune as a part of the buyout. 

Several Citigroup affiliates are named as defendants in 

certain actions brought by Tribune noteholders, which seek to 
recover the transfers of Tribune stock that occurred as a part of 
the leveraged buyout, as state-law constructive fraudulent 
conveyances.  The noteholders’ claims were previously 
dismissed and the United States Court of Appeals for the 
Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal on appeal.  The 
noteholders’ petition to the United States Supreme Court for a 
writ of certiorari is pending.

In the FITZSIMONS action, on February 1, 2017, the 
Litigation Trustee requested leave to file an interlocutory 
appeal of Judge Sullivan’s order dismissing the actual 
fraudulent transfer claim against the shareholder defendants, 
including several Citigroup affiliates. On February 23, 2017, 
Judge Sullivan entered an order stating that an interlocutory 
appeal will be certified after the remaining motions to dismiss 
are resolved.  Those motions remain pending. Additional 
information concerning these actions is publicly available in 
court filings under the docket numbers 08-13141 (Bankr. D. 
Del.) (Carey, J.), 11 MD 02296 (S.D.N.Y.) (Sullivan, J.), 12

Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (CGMI), and Citigroup Global 
Markets Ltd. (CGML), under the caption TERA GROUP, 
INC., ET AL. v. CITIGROUP INC., ET AL. The complaint 
alleges that defendants colluded to prevent plaintiffs’ 
electronic CDS trading platform, TeraExchange, from entering 
the market, resulting in lost profits to plaintiffs.  The 
complaint asserts federal and state antitrust claims, and claims 
for unjust enrichment and tortious interference with business 
relations. Plaintiffs seek a finding of joint and several liability, 
treble damages, attorneys’ fees, interest, and injunctive relief.  
On September 11, 2017, defendants, including Citigroup, 
Citibank, CGMI, and CGML, filed motions to dismiss all 
claims.  Additional information concerning this action is

Depositary Receipts Conversion Litigation 
Citibank was sued by a purported class of persons or entities 
who, from January 2000 to the present, are or were holders of 
depositary receipts for which Citibank served as the depositary 
bank and converted, or caused to be converted, foreign-
currency dividends or other distributions into U.S. dollars.  On 
August 15, 2016, the court dismissed certain claims against 
Citibank as well as all claims against two of its affiliates, 
leaving one claim against Citibank. Plaintiffs assert that 
Citibank breached its deposit agreements by charging a spread 
for the conversions of dividends and other distributions.  On 
June 30, 2017, plaintiffs moved for certification of a damages 
class consisting of persons or entities who, from January 1, 
2006 to the present, were holders of 35 depositary receipts for 
which Citibank served as the depositary bank and converted, 
or caused to be converted, foreign currency dividends or other 
distributions into U.S. dollars.  Plaintiffs also moved to certify 
an injunctive class of persons or entities who currently hold 
the same 35 depositary receipts.  Citibank has opposed 
certification. Additional information concerning this action is 
publicly available in court filings under the docket number 15 
Civ. 9185 (S.D.N.Y.) (McMahon, C.).

LITIGATION. 

On January 10, 2018, Citigroup and Citibank executed a

Interchange Fee Litigation
Beginning in 2005, several putative class actions were filed 
against Citigroup and Related Parties, together with Visa, 
MasterCard and other banks and their affiliates, in various 
federal district courts and consolidated with other related 
individual cases in a multi-district litigation proceeding in the 
United States District Court for the Eastern District of New 
York (Interchange MDL). This proceeding is captioned IN RE 
PAYMENT CARD INTERCHANGE FEE AND 
MERCHANT DISCOUNT ANTITRUST LITIGATION. 

The plaintiffs, merchants that accept Visa and MasterCard 

branded payment cards as well as membership associations 
that claim to represent certain groups of merchants, allege, 
among other things, that defendants have engaged in 
conspiracies to set the price of interchange and merchant 
discount fees on credit and debit card transactions and to 
restrain trade through various Visa and MasterCard rules 
governing merchant conduct, all in violation of Section 1 of 
the Sherman Act and certain California statutes. Supplemental 
complaints also have been filed against defendants in the 
putative class actions alleging that Visa’s and MasterCard’s 
respective initial public offerings were anticompetitive and 
violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act, and that MasterCard’s 
initial public offering constituted a fraudulent conveyance. 
On January 14, 2014, the district court entered a final 

judgment approving the terms of a class settlement providing 
for, among other things, a total payment to the class of $6.05 
billion; a rebate to merchants participating in the damages 
class settlement of 10 bps on interchange collected for a 
period of eight months by the Visa and MasterCard networks; 
and changes to certain network rules. Various objectors 
appealed from the final class settlement approval order to the 
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

On June 30, 2016, the Court of Appeals reversed the 

district court’s approval of the class settlement and remanded 
for further proceedings. Additional information concerning 

these consolidated actions and the appeal is publicly available 
in court filings under the docket numbers MDL 05-1720 
(E.D.N.Y.) (Brodie, J.), 12-4671 (2d Cir.) and 16-710 (U.S. 
Supreme Court). 

In addition, following the district court’s approval of the 
class settlement, and during the pendency of appeals from that 
approval, numerous merchants, including large national 
merchants, requested exclusion from the portion of the now 
vacated settlement involving a settlement class certified with 
respect to damages claims for past conduct, and some of those 
opting out filed complaints against Visa, MasterCard, and in 
some instances one or more issuing banks. One of these suits, 
7-ELEVEN, INC., ET AL. v. VISA INC., ET AL., brought on 
behalf of numerous individual merchants, names Citigroup as 
a defendant. Additional information concerning these actions 
is publicly available in court filings under the docket number 
MDL 05-1720 (E.D.N.Y.) (Brodie, J.).

Interest Rate Swaps Matters
Regulatory Actions: The Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission is conducting an investigation into the trading 
and clearing of interest rate swaps by investment banks.  
Citigroup is cooperating with the investigation.

Antitrust and Other Litigation: Beginning in November 
2015, numerous interest rate swap (IRS) market participants, 
including Citigroup, Citibank, CGMI and CGML, were named 
as defendants in a number of industry-wide putative class 
actions. These actions have been consolidated in the United 
States District Court for the Southern District of New York 
under the caption IN RE INTEREST RATE SWAPS 
ANTITRUST LITIGATION. Plaintiffs in these actions allege 
that defendants colluded to prevent the development of 
exchange-like trading for IRS, thereby causing the putative 
classes to suffer losses in connection with their IRS 
transactions. Plaintiffs assert federal antitrust claims and 
claims for unjust enrichment. Also consolidated under the 
same caption are two individual actions filed by swap 
execution facilities, asserting federal and state antitrust claims 
as well as claims for unjust enrichment and tortious 
interference with business relations. Plaintiffs in all of these 
actions seek treble damages, fees, costs and injunctive relief. 

On July 28, 2017, the district court granted in part and 

denied in part defendants’ motions to dismiss. Additional 
information concerning these actions is publicly available in 
court filings under the docket number 16-MD-2704 (S.D.N.Y.)

things, banking relationships and transactions at Citibank and 
its affiliates associated with certain individuals and entities 
identified as having had involvement with the alleged corrupt

Oceanografía Fraud and Related Matters
Regulatory Actions: As a result of Citigroup’s announcement 
in the first quarter of 2014 of a fraud discovered in a Petróleos 
Mexicanos (Pemex) supplier program involving Oceanografía 
S.A. de C.V. (OSA), a Mexican oil services company and a 
key supplier to Pemex, the SEC commenced a formal 
investigation and the U.S. Department of Justice requested 
information regarding Banamex’s dealings with OSA. The 
SEC inquiry has included requests for documents and witness 
testimony. Citi continues to cooperate fully with these 
inquiries. 

Other Litigation: On February 26, 2016, a complaint was 
filed against Citigroup in the United States District Court for 
the Southern District of Florida alleging that it conspired with 
Oceanografía, S.A. de C.V. (OSA) and others with respect to 
receivable financings and other financing arrangements related 
to OSA in a manner that injured bondholders and other 
creditors of OSA. The complaint asserts claims on behalf of 
39 plaintiffs that are characterized in the complaint variously 
as trade creditors of, investors in, or lenders to OSA. Plaintiffs 
collectively claim to have lost $1.1 billion as a result of OSA’s 
bankruptcy. The complaint asserts claims under the federal 
civil RICO law and seeks treble damages and other relief 
pursuant to that statute. The complaint also asserts claims for 
fraud and breach of fiduciary duty. 

On August 23, 2016, plaintiffs filed an amended 

complaint adding common law claims for fraud, aiding and 
abetting fraud, and conspiracy on behalf of all plaintiffs. 
Citigroup has moved to dismiss the amended complaint. On 
January 30, 2018, the court granted Citigroup’s motion to 
dismiss. Additional information concerning this action is 
publicly available in court filings under the docket number 
16-20725 (S.D. Fla.) (Gayles, J.).

Citigroup in the United States District Court for the Southern 
District of New York by Oceanografía S.A. de C.V. (OSA) and 
its controlling shareholder, Amado Yáñez Osuna.  The 
complaint alleges that plaintiffs were injured when Citigroup 
made certain public statements about receivable financings 
and other financing arrangements related to OSA. The 
complaint asserts claims for malicious prosecution and 
tortious interference with existing and prospective business 
relationships. On December 4, 2017, plaintiffs filed an 
amended complaint adding CGMI, Citibank and Banco 
Nacional de México, or Banamex, as defendants and adding 
causes of action for fraud and breach of contract.  Citigroup 
has moved to dismiss the amended complaint.  Additional 
information concerning this action is publicly available in 
court filings under the docket number 1:17-cv-01434 
(S.D.N.Y.) (Sullivan, J.).

Parmalat Litigation
On July 29, 2004, Dr. Enrico Bondi, the Extraordinary 
Commissioner appointed under Italian law to oversee the 
administration of various Parmalat companies, filed a 
complaint in New Jersey state court against Citigroup and 
Related Parties alleging, among other things, that the 
defendants “facilitated” a number of frauds by Parmalat 
insiders. On October 20, 2008, following trial, a jury rendered 

289

a verdict in Citigroup’s favor on Parmalat’s claims and in 
favor of Citibank on three counterclaims, awarding Citi $431 
million. Parmalat has exhausted all appeals, and the judgment 
is now final. Additional information concerning this action is 
publicly available in court filings under the docket number 
A-2654-08T2 (N.J. Sup. Ct.). Citigroup has taken steps to 
enforce that judgment in the Italian courts. On August 29, 
2014, the Court of Appeal of Bologna affirmed the decision in 
the full amount of $431 million, to be paid in Parmalat shares. 
Parmalat appealed the judgment to the Italian Supreme Court.

On June 16, 2015, Parmalat filed a claim in an Italian 

civil court in Milan claiming damages of €1.8 billion against 
Citigroup and Related Parties. On January 25, 2018, the Milan 
court dismissed Parmalat’s claim on grounds that it was 
duplicative of Parmalat’s previously unsuccessful New Jersey 
claims.

Referral Hiring Practices Investigations
Government and regulatory agencies in the U.S., including the 
SEC, are conducting investigations or making inquiries 
concerning compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
and other laws with respect to the hiring of candidates referred

cooperating with the investigations and inquiries.

Shareholder Derivative Litigation
On March 30, 2016, a derivative action captioned 
OKLAHOMA FIREFIGHTERS PENSION & RETIREMENT 
SYSTEM, ET AL. v. CORBAT, ET AL. was filed in the 
Delaware Chancery Court on behalf of Citigroup (as nominal 
defendant) against certain of Citigroup’s present and former 
directors and officers. Plaintiffs assert claims for breach of 
fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets in connection 
with defendants’ alleged failure to exercise appropriate 
oversight and management of Bank Secrecy Act and anti-
money laundering laws and regulations and related consent 
decrees concerning Citigroup subsidiaries, Banamex and 
Banamex USA (BUSA) as well as defendants’ alleged failures 
to implement adequate internal controls and exercise adequate 
oversight with respect to Citigroup subsidiaries’ participation 
in foreign exchange markets and credit card practices. On 
December 18, 2017, the court granted the defendants’ motion 
to dismiss plaintiffs’ amended supplemental complaint. On 
January 17, 2018, plaintiffs filed a motion to reopen the

the Delaware Chancery Court, as well as an appeal with the 
Delaware Supreme Court. Additional information concerning

Sovereign Securities Matters
Regulatory Actions: Government and regulatory agencies in 
the U.S. and in other jurisdictions are conducting 
investigations or making inquiries regarding Citigroup’s sales 
and trading activities in connection with sovereign securities. 
Citigroup is fully cooperating with these investigations and 
inquiries.

Antitrust and Other Litigation: Beginning in July 2015, 

CGMI and numerous other U.S. Treasury primary dealer 
banks were named as defendants in a number of substantially 
similar putative class actions involving allegations that they 
colluded to manipulate U.S. Treasury securities markets. In 
December 2015, the cases were consolidated in the United 
States District Court for the Southern District of New York by 
the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. On August 23, 
2017, the court appointed interim co-lead counsel.

Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on November 16, 

2017, which alleges that CGMI and other primary dealer 
defendants colluded to fix Treasury auction bids by sharing 
competitively sensitive information ahead of the auctions, in 
violation of the antitrust laws. The consolidated complaint also 
alleges that CGMI and other primary dealer defendants 
colluded to boycott and prevent the emergence of an 
anonymous, all-to-all electronic trading platform in the 
Treasuries secondary market, and seeks damages, including 
treble damages where authorized by statute, and injunctive 
relief. Additional information relating to this action is publicly 
available in court filings under the docket number 15-
MD-2673 (S.D.N.Y.) (Gardephe, J.).

Beginning in May 2016, a number of substantially similar 
putative class action complaints were filed against a number of 
financial institutions and traders related to the supranational, 
sub-sovereign, and agency (SSA) bond market. The actions 
are based upon defendants’ roles as market makers and traders 
of SSA bonds and assert claims of alleged collusion under the 
antitrust laws and unjust enrichment and seek damages, 
including treble damages where authorized by statute, and 
disgorgement. In August 2016, these actions were 
consolidated in the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of New York, and interim co-lead counsel 
was appointed in December 2016. 

Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on April 7, 2017 
that names Citigroup, Citibank, CGMI and CGML among the 
defendants. Plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint 
on October 6, 2017, and defendants filed motions to dismiss 
on December 12, 2017. Additional information relating to this 
action is publicly available in court filings under the docket 
number 16-cv-03711 (S.D.N.Y.) (Ramos, J.).

On November 7, 2017, a class action related to the SSA 
bond market was filed in the Ontario Court of Justice against 
Citigroup, Citibank, CGMI, CGML, Citibank Canada and 
Citigroup Global Markets Canada, Inc., among other 
defendants, asserting claims for breach of contract, breach of 
the competition act, breach of foreign law, unjust enrichment, 
and civil conspiracy. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and 
punitive damages, as well as declaratory relief. Additional 
information relating to this action is publicly available in court 
filings under the docket number CV-17-586082-00CP (Ont. 
S.C.J.).

Settlement Payments
Payments required in settlement agreements described above 
have been made or are covered by existing litigation accruals.

SUPERVISION, REGULATION AND OTHER

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
Citi is subject to regulation under U.S. federal and state laws, 
as well as applicable laws in the other jurisdictions in which it 
does business.

General
Citigroup is a registered bank holding company and financial 
holding company and is regulated and supervised by the 
Federal Reserve Board. Citigroup’s nationally chartered 
subsidiary banks, including Citibank, are regulated and 
supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
(OCC) and its state-chartered depository institution by the 
relevant state’s banking department and the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The FDIC also has 
examination authority for banking subsidiaries whose deposits 
it insures. Overseas branches of Citibank are regulated and 
supervised by the Federal Reserve Board and OCC and 
overseas subsidiary banks by the Federal Reserve Board. 
These overseas branches and subsidiary banks are also 
regulated and supervised by regulatory authorities in the host 
countries. In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau (CFPB) regulates consumer financial products and 
services. Citi is also subject to laws and regulations 
concerning the collection, use, sharing and disposition of 
certain customer, employee and other personal and 
confidential information, including those imposed by the 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and 
the EU Data Protection Directive. For more information on 
U.S. and foreign regulation affecting or potentially affecting 
Citi and its subsidiaries, see “Risk Factors” above.

Other Bank and Bank Holding Company Regulation
Citi, including its banking subsidiaries, is subject to regulatory 
limitations, including requirements for banks to maintain 
reserves against deposits, requirements as to risk-based capital 
and leverage (see “Capital Resources” above and Note 18 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements), restrictions on the 
types and amounts of loans that may be made and the interest 
that may be charged and limitations on investments that can be 
made and services that can be offered. The Federal Reserve 
Board may also expect Citi to commit resources to its 
subsidiary banks in certain circumstances. Citi is also subject 
to anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws, 
including standards for verifying client identification at 
account opening and obligations to monitor client transactions 
and report suspicious activities.

Securities and Commodities Regulation
Citi conducts securities underwriting, brokerage and dealing 
activities in the U.S. through Citigroup Global Markets Inc. 
(CGMI), its primary broker-dealer, and other broker-dealer 
subsidiaries, which are subject to regulations of the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial 
Industry Regulatory Authority and certain exchanges. Citi 
conducts similar securities activities outside the U.S., subject 
to local requirements, through various subsidiaries and 
affiliates, principally Citigroup Global Markets Limited in 

303

London (CGML), which is regulated principally by the U.K. 
Financial Conduct Authority, and Citigroup Global Markets 
Japan Inc. in Tokyo, which is regulated principally by the 
Financial Services Agency of Japan.

Citi also has subsidiaries that are members of futures 
exchanges. In the U.S., CGMI is a member of the principal 
U.S. futures exchanges, and Citi has subsidiaries that are 
registered as futures commission merchants and commodity 
pool operators with the Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission (CFTC). Citibank, CGMI, Citigroup Energy Inc. 
and CGML, also are registered as swap dealers with the 
CFTC. CGMI is also subject to SEC and CFTC rules that 
specify uniform minimum net capital requirements. 
Compliance with these rules could limit those operations of 
CGMI that require the intensive use of capital and also limits 
the ability of broker-dealers to transfer large amounts of 
capital to parent companies and other affiliates. See also 
“Capital Resources” and Note 18 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements for a further discussion of capital 
considerations of Citi’s non-banking subsidiaries.

Transactions with Affiliates
Transactions between Citi’s U.S. subsidiary depository 
institutions and their non-bank affiliates are regulated by the 
Federal Reserve Board, and are generally required to be on 
arm’s-length terms. See also “Managing Global Risk—
Liquidity Risk” above.

COMPETITION
The financial services industry is highly competitive. Citi’s 
competitors include a variety of financial services and 
advisory companies. Citi competes for clients and capital 
(including deposits and funding in the short- and long-term 
debt markets) with some of these competitors globally and 
with others on a regional or product basis. Citi’s competitive 
position depends on many factors, including, among others, 
the value of Citi’s brand name, reputation, the types of clients 
and geographies served; the quality, range, performance, 
innovation and pricing of products and services; the 
effectiveness of and access to distribution channels, 
technology advances, customer service and convenience; the 
effectiveness of transaction execution, interest rates and 
lending limits; and regulatory constraints. Citi’s ability to 
compete effectively also depends upon its ability to attract 
new employees and retain and motivate existing employees, 
while managing compensation and other costs. For additional 
information on competitive factors and uncertainties 
impacting Citi’s businesses, see “Risk Factors—Operational 
Risks” above.

PROPERTIES
Citi’s principal executive offices are currently in New York 
City at 388 Greenwich Street and are owned and fully 
occupied by Citi. 

Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc.’s principal 
executive offices are in New York City at 388 Greenwich 
Street and 390 Greenwich Street. Both locations are owned 
and fully occupied by Citi.

Citigroup’s principal executive offices in EMEA are at 25 
and 33 Canada Square in London’s Canary Wharf, with both 
buildings subject to long-term leases.

In Asia, Citi’s principal executive offices are in leased 
premises at Champion Tower in Hong Kong. Citi has other 
significant leased premises, including in Singapore, Kuala 
Lumpur, Manila and Japan. Citi has major or full ownership 
interests in country headquarter locations in Shanghai, Seoul 
and Mumbai.

Citi’s principal executive offices in Mexico, which also 

serve as the headquarters of Citibanamex, are in Mexico City. 
Citi’s principal executive offices for Latin America (other than 
Mexico) are in leased premises in Miami.

Citi also owns or leases over 55 million square feet of real 

estate in 95 countries, consisting of over 7,700 properties.

Citi continues to evaluate its global real estate footprint 
and space requirements and may determine from time to time 
that certain of its premises are no longer necessary. There is no 
assurance that Citi will be able to dispose of any excess 
premises or that it will not incur charges in connection with 
such dispositions, which could be material to Citi’s operating 
results in a given period.

Citi has developed programs for its properties to achieve 

long-term energy efficiency objectives and reduce its 
greenhouse gas emissions to lessen its impact on climate 
change. These activities could help to mitigate, but will not 
eliminate, Citi’s potential risk from future climate change 
regulatory requirements.

For further information concerning leases, see Note 26 to 

the Consolidated Financial Statements.

DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO SECTION 219 OF THE 
IRAN THREAT REDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN 
RIGHTS ACT
Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria 
Human Rights Act of 2012 (Section 219), which added 
Section 13(r) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended, Citi is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly 
reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates 
knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or 
dealings relating to Iran or with individuals or entities that are 
subject to sanctions under U.S. law. Disclosure is generally 
required even where the activities, transactions or dealings 
were conducted in compliance with applicable law. Citi, in its 
related quarterly report on Form 10-Q, previously disclosed 
reportable activities pursuant to Section 219 for the first, 
second and third quarters of 2017. 

 During the fourth quarter of 2017, Bank Handlowy w 
Warszawie S.A., a Citibank subsidiary located in Poland, 
processed two funds transfers involving the Iranian Embassy 
in Poland.  The value of both funds transfers was EUR 60 each 
for a total of EUR 120 (approximately $70.48 per transfer for 
a total of $140.96).  These payments were for visa-related 
fees, which are permissible under the travel exemption in the 
Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations.  Bank 
Handlowy w Warszawie realized EUR 2.36 (approximately 
$2.93) in fees for processing a foreign currency payment.

(1)  Represents repurchases under the $15.6 billion 2017 common stock repurchase program (2017 Repurchase Program) that was approved by Citigroup’s Board of 

Directors and announced on June 28, 2017. The 2017 Repurchase Program was part of the planned capital actions included by Citi in its 2017 Comprehensive 
Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). Shares repurchased under the 2017 Repurchase Program were added to treasury stock.

(2)  Consisted of shares added to treasury stock related to (i) certain activity on employee stock option program exercises where the employee delivers existing shares 

to cover the option exercise, or (ii) under Citi’s employee restricted or deferred stock programs where shares are withheld to satisfy tax requirements.

N/A   Not applicable

Dividends
In addition to Board of Directors’ approval, Citi’s ability to 
pay common stock dividends substantially depends on 
regulatory approval, including an annual regulatory review of 
the results of the CCAR process required by the Federal 
Reserve Board and the supervisory stress tests required under 
the Dodd-Frank Act. For additional information regarding 
Citi’s capital planning and stress testing, see “Capital 
Resources—Current Regulatory Capital Standards—Stress 
Testing Component of Capital Planning” and “Risk Factors—
Strategic Risks” above. Any dividend on Citi’s outstanding 
common stock would also need to be made in compliance with 
Citi’s obligations to its outstanding preferred stock.

For information on the ability of Citigroup’s subsidiary 
depository institutions to pay dividends, see Note 18 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Stockholder Information

Citigroup common stock is listed on the NYSE under the 
ticker symbol “C” and on the Mexico Stock Exchange. 
Citigroup preferred stock Series C, J, K, L and S are also 
listed on the NYSE.

Exchange Agent
Holders of Golden State Bancorp, Associates First Capital 
Corporation or Citicorp common stock should arrange to 
exchange their certificates by contacting:

Because Citigroup’s common stock is listed on the NYSE, 
the Chief Executive Officer is required to make an annual 
certification to the NYSE stating that he was not aware of 
any violation by Citigroup of the corporate governance listing 
standards of the NYSE. The annual certification to that effect 
was made to the NYSE on May 22, 2017.

As of January 31, 2018, Citigroup had approximately 65,691 
common stockholders of record. This figure does not 
represent the actual number of beneficial owners of common 
stock because shares are frequently held in “street name” 
by securities dealers and others for the benefit of individual 
owners who may vote the shares.
