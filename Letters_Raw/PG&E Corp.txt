Dear Fellow Shareholders:
Thank you for your investment in PG&E Corporation and in Pacific Gas and Electric Company. The Boards 
of Directors are firmly committed to the sustainability and long-term interests of the companies, our 
customers, and you, our shareholders. 
The devastating October 2017 Northern California wildfires brought to light the need to address the 
continuing impacts of climate change and the role of California utilities. We continue to work with all 
stakeholders to address and meet these challenges, while continuing to support the recovery and rebuilding 
of communities affected by the wildfires.
In partnership with management, the Boards also are committed to operating and communicating with 
integrity, accountability, and transparency. Our corporate governance practices are a key part of this 
commitment and provide the foundation to oversee the strategies that will drive long-term value for the 
companies and our shareholders.
This Joint Proxy Statement highlights the governance policies and practices of the companies and the 
Boards. Our corporate governance practices are regularly reviewed and updated to serve the best interests 
of the companies so that they operate efficiently and responsibly for all of our stakeholders.
As always, we value your input and welcome the opportunity to engage with you to listen to your views 
and address your concerns. 
We cordially invite you to attend the companies’ 2018 annual meetings, which will be held concurrently 
on Tuesday, May 22, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. at the PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company

2018 Joint Proxy Statement2018 Proxy Statement Summary

This proxy statement summary highlights information to assist you in your review of this Proxy Statement. The summary 
does not contain all of the information that you should consider, and you should read the entire Proxy Statement 
carefully before voting.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility are committed to operating and communicating with integrity, accountability, 
and transparency. Establishing and adhering to strong corporate governance practices go hand in hand with this 
commitment. Our governance policies and practices are detailed in the companies’ respective Corporate Governance 
Guidelines, which are adopted by the Boards. These Guidelines are regularly reviewed against industry best practices 
by the Nominating and Governance Committee and by the full Boards. Since the 2017 Joint Proxy Statement was 
issued, the Boards and the Compensation Committee took action on the following governance matters:

•• Separated the Chair and CEO positions at PG&E Corporation. 

•– Effective March 1, 2017, Geisha J. Williams became CEO and President of PG&E Corporation, and Anthony F. Earley, Jr. 

became Executive Chair of the Board. 

•– Effective December 16, 2017, Richard C. Kelly became independent non-executive Chair of the Board, following 

Mr. Earley’s retirement on December 15, 2017.

•• Refreshed the composition of three of the standing Board committees by adding new committee members. The 
three committees were the Compensation Committee, the Compliance and Public Policy Committee, and the Safety 
and Nuclear Oversight Committees.

•• Amended the Corporate Governance Guidelines to strengthen the Board’s commitment to open communications 
with shareholders by providing opportunities for the Corporation’s largest shareholders to have regular dialogue 
with the Corporation, including with the independent chair or lead director and senior management.

•• Established the Safety and Nuclear Oversight Committees of both the Corporation and Utility Boards, replacing 
the Corporation’s former Nuclear, Operations, and Safety Committee. This change clarifies the Boards’ oversight 
responsibilites related to enterprise-wide safety matters.

•• Added safety experience to the list of experience, skills, and characteristics that the Boards consider, among other 

factors, in assessing potential candidates for the Boards. 

•• Amended each Board’s director retirement policy to change the retirement age to 75, with a target average tenure 
for all directors of 10 years or less. The Boards believe in balancing regular board refreshment with established 
board experience.

•• Amended the companies’ clawback policy to add additional events under which recoupment applies, such as fraud 
or intentional misconduct, to reflect prevailing market practices. Please see page 47 of the CD&A for more detail 
on the amended clawback policy.

2018 Joint Proxy Statement2018 PRoxy STATeMenT SuMMARy

Auditors
As a matter of good corporate governance, we are asking shareholders of each company to ratify the selection of 
Deloitte & Touche LLP (“Deloitte & Touche”) as that company’s Independent Auditor for 2018. We provide information 
on fees paid to Deloitte & Touche beginning on page 34. Each Board recommends a vote “FOR” the proposal to ratify 
the appointment of Deloitte & Touche.

Advisory Vote to Approve executive Compensation
We are asking shareholders of each company to approve on an advisory basis the compensation paid to that company’s 
executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table of this Proxy Statement (“say-on-pay” vote). Each Board 
recommends a “FOR” vote because it believes that the applicable company’s compensation policies and practices are 
effective in achieving the companies’ goals of rewarding sustained financial and operating performance and excellence, 
aligning the executives’ long-term interests with those of our shareholders, and motivating executives to remain with 
the companies for long and productive careers.

Shareholder Proposals
The proxy materials contain two proposals submitted by individual PG&E Corporation shareholders pertaining to 
(1) customer approval of the charitable giving program and (2) amendments to the proxy access bylaw provisions. The 
PG&E Corporation Board recommends that shareholders vote “AGAINST” these proposals for the reasons indicated 
beginning on page 78.

policies, or practices.

The Boards select nominees for director based on recommendations received from the Nominating and Governance 
Committee.

The Boards believe that each nominee for director is a qualified, dedicated, ethical, and highly regarded individual. The 
information provided below includes a chart and a description of each nominee’s specific experience, qualifications, 
attributes, and skills that indicate why that person should serve as a director of the applicable company, in light of the 
company’s business and structure. The Boards do not believe that each nominee must possess all of the characteristics 
shown in the chart below in order for each Board, as a whole, to function effectively.

Collectively, the distribution of the nominees’ experience, skills, and expertise, among other characteristics, reflects a 
balanced and multi-disciplinary Board at each company, and appropriately meets the needs of the companies.

Each director is elected for a one year term, and in general, the Nominating and Governance Committee will recommend, 
and the Boards will re-nominate, an existing director for re-election if the Committee and the Board each believe that 
the individual would continue to be a productive and effective contributor to the Board, unless that individual no 
longer is eligible for re-nomination under the applicable company’s Board of Directors retirement policy or he or she 
declines to stand for re-election. 

With respect to diversity, the Nominating and Governance Committee’s policy, as reflected in the companies’ respective 
Corporate Governance Guidelines, is to seek a range of different backgrounds, perspectives, skills, and experiences. 
Since 2013, the PG&E Corporation Board has elected five new directors, four of whom are diverse with respect to 
gender and/or ethnicity.

2018 Joint Proxy StatementITeM no. 1: eleCTIon oF DIReCToRS

The Nominating and Governance Committee and the Boards annually review whether the diversity represented by 
the members of the Boards serves the needs of the companies, given the current operating environment. If a diversity 
gap is identified, the Committee will consider and prioritize the need to close that gap, along with other factors, in its 
director recruitment process. The diversity represented by the director nominees is shown below.

2018 Joint Proxy StatementCorporate Governance

PG&E Corporation and the Utility are committed to good corporate governance practices that provide a framework 
within which the Boards and management of the Corporation and the Utility can pursue the companies’ business 
objectives. The foundation for these practices is the independent nature of each Board and its fiduciary responsibility 
to the company’s shareholders. These practices are reviewed against industry trends and input from the companies’ 
institutional investors and other shareholders.

CoRPoRATe GoVeRnAnCe GuIDelIneS

Corporate governance practices are documented in Guidelines that are adopted by the Boards of PG&E Corporation 
and the Utility. The Guidelines are reviewed and updated from time to time as recommended by the Nominating and 
Governance Committee, and were last updated in December 2017. Other corporate governance practices also are 
set forth in the charters of the various committees of the Corporation and Utility Boards (see “Website Availability of 
Governance Documents” on page 86).

BoARD leADeRSHIP STRuCTuRe

Chair of the Board – Duties; Executive Session Meetings

At both PG&E Corporation and the Utility, the Chair of the Board is a member of the Board. The Chair’s primary duty 
is to preside over meetings of the Board, including special meetings. The Chair also is responsible for setting meeting 
agendas, and representing the Board in any meeting with major shareholders. Additionally, the Chair is consulted 
regarding Board nominees and the composition and chairmanship of Board committees. 

At both companies, the independent directors meet at each regularly scheduled Board meeting in executive session. 
These executive session meetings generally are chaired by the independent Chair of the Board (or if the Chair is not 
independent, by the independent lead director). Richard C. Kelly is PG&E Corporation’s independent non-executive 
Chair of the Board, and Forrest E. Miller is the Utility’s independent non-executive Chair of the Board. Mr. Kelly chairs 
executive session meetings of the Corporation’s independent directors as well as concurrent executive session meetings 
of the Corporation’s and the Utility’s independent directors; Mr. Miller chairs executive session meetings of the Utility’s 
independent directors only. The independent Chair establishes the agenda for each executive session meeting, and 
also determines which, if any, other individuals (including members of management) attend each meeting.

Chair of the Board and CEO Positions

Each company’s Board maintains a flexible policy regarding board leadership structure, including whether the offices of 
Chair and CEO (or President, if the office of CEO is not filled) should be separate and, if the roles are separate, whether 
the Chair should be elected from management or from among the non-management directors. The Board regularly 
assesses the appropriateness of the Board’s leadership structure, given the specific facts at the time of assessment.

PG&e Corporation
At PG&E Corporation, the positions of Chair and CEO have been separate since March 1, 2017, when Anthony F. Earley, Jr. 
became Executive Chair of the Board and Geisha J. Williams became CEO and President. Since Mr. Earley’s retirement 
in December 2017, Richard C. Kelly has served as PG&E Corporation’s independent non-executive Chair of the Board, 
and the positions of Chair and CEO continue to be separated. Separating the roles allows Ms. Williams to continue 
to focus on the business of PG&E Corporation and its strategic priorities, while Mr. Kelly leads the Board of Directors. 
Among other things, Mr. Kelly’s extensive utility and leadership experience will allow him to support Ms. Williams’ 
continuing transition into her role as CEO and President, and to serve as an effective link between the Board and the 
CEO, especially during this transition period.

Pacific Gas and electric Company
At the Utility, the positions of Chair and principal executive officer have been separated since January 2008. Forrest E. 
Miller has been the independent non-executive Chair of the Board since May 30, 2017. Since March 1, 2017, Nickolas 
Stavropoulos has been the President of the Utility. By separating the Chair and principal executive officer roles, the 
Utility is able to benefit from the complementary skill sets and business experiences of the independent non-executive 
Chair (Mr. Miller) and the President (Mr. Stavropoulos). As a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation, the Utility also benefits 
from the fact that both Mr. Kelly and Ms. Williams are members of the Utility Board, as well as from their perspectives 
as PG&E Corporation Chair and CEO, respectively. Pursuant to the CPUC’s affiliate rules, no individual may serve as 
Chair of the Board, CEO, or President, or in a functionally equivalent position, of both PG&E Corporation and the Utility.

Independent Lead Director

At each company, if the Chair is not independent, then the independent directors must elect an independent lead 
director from among the independent chairs of the standing PG&E Corporation and Utility Board committees. Currently, 
each company has an independent Chair, and neither company has an independent lead director. 

For more information on the criteria and specific duties of a lead director, please see each company’s Corporate 
Governance Guidelines (see “Website Availability of Governance Documents” on page 86).

BoARD AnD DIReCToR GeneRAl InDePenDenCe  
AnD QuAlIFICATIonS

On both PG&E Corporation’s Board and the Utility’s Board, at least 75 percent of the directors are independent, as 
required by each company’s Guidelines. The definitions of “independence” are identical for each company, are set 
forth in each company’s Guidelines, and reflect the applicable NYSE and NYSE American definitions. Each company’s 
Guidelines are available on the company’s website (see “Website Availability of Governance Documents” on page 86).

A majority of PG&E Corporation’s directors also are independent, as defined by the NYSE. The Utility Board is exempt 
from NYSE American rules requiring that at least a majority of the directors meet the stock exchange’s definition of 
“independent director” because PG&E Corporation holds approximately 96 percent of the voting power of the Utility 
and the Utility is a “controlled” subsidiary.

The Boards of PG&E Corporation and the Utility have affirmatively determined that each of the following directors 
was independent while serving on the Boards, according to the applicable company’s Guidelines: Lewis Chew, Fred J. 
Fowler, Maryellen C. Herringer, Jeh C. Johnson, Richard C. Kelly, Roger H. Kimmel, Richard A. Meserve, Forrest E. Miller, 
Eric D. Mullins, Rosendo G. Parra, Barbara L. Rambo, Anne Shen Smith, and Barry Lawson Williams. (Ms. Herringer and 
Mr. Williams both were directors during 2017, but were not nominated for re-election at the 2017 annual shareholder 
meeting due to their retirement from the Boards.)

In determining each director’s independence, the Boards considered transactions between PG&E Corporation or the 
Utility and their respective directors and their immediate family members, and certain entities with which the directors 
or their immediate family members were affiliated. These transactions primarily involved the Utility’s provision of utility 
services at rates or charges fixed in conformity with law or governmental authority, which the Boards determined 
were not material and did not affect the director’s independence.

The Boards of PG&E Corporation and the Utility have numerous permanent standing committees, which support 
each Board’s basic responsibilities. Each Board also may establish temporary ad hoc committees from time to time.

Each Board’s permanent standing committees are described below. For each of these committees, the applicable 
company’s Board has adopted a formal charter that sets forth the committee’s duties and responsibilities; current 
copies of the charters are available on the companies’ websites (see “Website Availability of Governance Documents” 
on page 86).

Where a committee exists at PG&E Corporation only, that committee’s responsibilities include assisting and advising 
the Utility Board on matters within the committee’s scope of responsibility.

Committee Membership Requirements

Each of the permanent standing committees (other than the Executive Committees) is composed entirely of independent 
directors, as defined in the applicable company’s Guidelines and the Committee’s charters. In addition, the Audit 
Committees, the Compensation Committee, and the Nominating and Governance Committee are composed entirely 
of independent directors, as defined by the NYSE. Because the Utility is a “controlled” subsidiary of PG&E Corporation 
for purposes of the NYSE American standards, the Utility is not subject to NYSE American rules that otherwise would 
require that the Utility’s Board committees responsible for executive compensation and governance be comprised 
of “independent” directors, as defined by NYSE American, and would impose requirements on the Utility’s director 
nomination and compensation-setting processes.

Each member of the Audit Committees and each member of the Compensation Committee also satisfies heightened 
independence rules established by SEC rules and applicable stock exchange requirements regarding independence 
of audit committee members and compensation committee members. Each member of the Audit Committees also 
is financially literate, is identified as an “audit committee financial expert” in the above table, and has accounting and 
related financial management expertise and financial sophistication.

If a director is considering serving on the board of another public company (in addition to PG&E Corporation, the Utility, 
and their respective subsidiaries), that director must inform the Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee 
and the Chair of the Board of the Corporation and/or the Utility, as applicable, before accepting membership on any 
such board. Unless otherwise approved by the applicable Board, (1) a director may not serve on more than three public 
company boards (in addition to the Corporation and Utility Boards), and (2) a director who is the principal executive 
officer of a public company (including the Corporation and the Utility) may not serve on more than two public company 
boards in addition to the board of his or her employer. For these purposes, the Boards of the Corporation and the 
Utility would count as one board.

If an Audit Committee member simultaneously serves on the audit committees of three or more public companies 
other than PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and their respective subsidiaries, that Committee member must inform the 
applicable company’s Board. In order for that member to continue serving on the Audit Committees, each Board 
must affirmatively determine that the simultaneous service does not impair that committee member’s ability to serve 
effectively on the applicable Audit Committee.

All members of the Boards are in compliance with the above policies regarding service on other public company 
boards, as well as on audit committees of other public company boards.

Management Nominees – Characteristics and Qualifications

The Boards of PG&E Corporation and the Utility each select nominees for director based on recommendations received 
from the Nominating and Governance Committee. The Committee’s recommendations are based upon a review of 
the qualifications of Board candidates and consultation with the Chair of the Board of the Corporation or the Utility, 
as applicable, and with the Corporation CEO.

The Nominating and Governance Committee’s goal is to create for each company a balanced and multi-disciplinary 
Board composed of qualified, dedicated, ethical, and highly regarded individuals who have experience relevant to the 
company’s operations, understand the complexities of the company’s business environment, and possess capabilities to 
provide valuable insight, judgment, and oversight. The Committee also considers overall independence of the Boards, 
as defined in each company’s Guidelines.

The Committee considers factors such as diversity, age, skills, and any other factors that it deems appropriate, and 
annually reviews and recommends to the Boards the appropriate skills and characteristics required of Board members, 
given the current composition and needs of each company’s Board. In addition to the characteristics noted above, 
for the 2018 director nomination process, the Committee added safety experience as an additional assessment factor 
and considered the extent to which nominees (both individually and as a group) possess the experience, skills, and 
expertise shown in the chart on page 10.

2018 Joint Proxy StatementCorporate GovernanCe

Under each company’s Board of Directors retirement policy, the Boards may not designate any person as a candidate 
for election or re-election as a director after such person has reached the age of 75, unless the applicable company’s 
Board determines that it is in the best interests of the company to re-nominate that director. Under this policy, the 
Boards also consider tenure, and generally target an average tenure for all directors of 10 years or less. In general, the 
Nominating and Governance Committee will recommend, and the Boards will re-nominate, an existing director for 
re-election if the Committee and the Boards each believe that the individual would continue to be a productive and 
effective contributor to the Boards.

The criteria and considerations discussed above also will be used by the Nominating and Governance Committee and 
the Boards as they continue to assess candidates to fill current and future vacancies on both Boards.

As shown in the diagram above, the Nominating and Governance Committee accepts recommendations for director 
nominees from a variety of sources, including independent executive search firms, shareholders, management, and 
Board members. The Committee uses the same criteria to review all candidates recommended for nomination at the 
annual meetings. In 2017, the Committee retained Diversified Search and Kroll Inc. to assist the Committee’s evaluation 
of certain potential director nominees, including by performing appropriate due diligence on such candidates.

Shareholders may recommend a person for the Committee to consider as a nominee for director of PG&E Corporation 
or the Utility, as applicable, by writing to that company’s Corporate Secretary. Each such recommendation must include:

1.	 A brief description of the candidate,
2.	 The candidate’s name, age, business address, and residence address,
3.	 The candidate’s principal occupation and the class and number of shares of the company’s stock owned by the 

shareholder and the candidate,

4.	 Any other information that would be required under the rules of the SEC in a proxy statement listing the candidate 

as a nominee for director, and

5.	 Any material interest that the shareholder has in the candidate’s nomination.

Recommended candidates may be required to provide additional information. The companies also may request 
additional information regarding the candidate or the shareholder, consistent with the information requirements 
applicable to shareholder nominations.

Shareholder Nominations

On February 17, 2016, the PG&E Corporation Board adopted proxy access bylaw provisions that permit shareholders 
owning 3 percent or more of the Corporation’s outstanding common stock for at least three years to nominate the 
greater of two directors or 20 percent of the Board, and to include these nominees in the Corporation’s proxy materials. 
The number of shareholders who may aggregate their shares to meet the ownership threshold is limited to 20. 
Nominations are subject to the eligibility, procedural, and disclosure requirements set forth in the Corporation’s Bylaws.

Shareholders of either company who wish to nominate directors directly at an annual meeting in accordance with 
the procedures in the applicable company’s bylaws should follow the instructions under “2019 Annual Meetings - Can 
shareholders introduce proposals (other than proxy access proposals, but including director nominations) during the 
2019 annual meetings?” on page 93.

BoarD anD CoMMIttee SeLF-evaLUatIonS

The Nominating and Governance Committee oversees the process for evaluating and assessing the performance of the 
PG&E Corporation and Utility Boards, including Board committees. At least annually, each Board or the Nominating 
and Governance Committee conducts an evaluation to determine whether the Board as a whole and its committees 
are functioning effectively.

If the evaluation is conducted by the Nominating and Governance Committee, that Committee presents its conclusions 
to the applicable full Board for review and concurrence.

The Board evaluation includes an assessment of the Board’s contribution as a whole and of specific areas in which 
the Board and/or management believes that a better contribution could be made. The evaluation also considers 
any feedback that might be received from individual directors regarding the performance of the chair. The Audit 
Committees, the Compensation Committee, the Compliance and Public Policy Committee, the Finance Committee, 
the Nominating and Governance Committee, and the Safety and Nuclear Oversight Committees conduct annual self-
evaluations. The Nominating and Governance Committee may request the results of any Board committee evaluation 
for consideration in the Board evaluation. The Boards and Board committees consider the results of the evaluations 
when planning for the upcoming year.

rISK ManaGeMent

PG&E Corporation and the Utility continue to review and refine the approach to the companies’ risk management 
programs. In 2011, the companies expanded their Enterprise Risk Management program to examine all enterprise 
and operational company risks, and to increase Board review of risk management. The program was renamed as the 
Enterprise and Operational Risk Management (“EORM”) program in 2013 to reflect its expanded scope. At that time, 
risk management was integrated into the companies’ planning and budgeting process, which leads to the identification 
of specific enterprise risks for review and oversight by the Corporation and Utility Boards.

As described below, the companies’ risk management governance structures allow risks to be investigated both under 
a Board-directed review process and also from a “bottoms-up” approach that allows operational experts to add their 
knowledge and identify emerging issues for the companies.

Board-Level Duties

As part of their oversight functions, the Boards generally oversee the companies’ risk management policies and programs; 
however, management has day-to-day responsibility for assessing and managing exposure to various risks. Enterprise 
risks are reviewed annually by the Boards’ Audit Committees, and oversight for specific risk categories is allocated 
to various Board committees (and this allocation is reviewed once every 12 months), consistent with the substantive 
scope of each committee’s charter. Each such committee provides a report of its activities to the applicable Board.

The Boards and their respective committees have specific oversight responsibility for risk management in the following 
areas:

	• The Boards evaluate risks associated with major investments and strategic initiatives, with assistance from the 

Finance Committee.

25

2018 Joint Proxy StatementCorporate GovernanCe

	• Each company’s Audit Committee discusses the guidelines and policies that govern the processes for assessing 
and managing major risks (including the EORM program that is discussed in more detail below), allocates to other 
Board committees the specific responsibility to oversee identified enterprise risks, generally oversees regulatory and 
legal compliance risks, and considers risk issues associated with overall financial reporting and disclosure processes.
	• The Finance Committee discusses risk exposures related to energy procurement, including energy commodities 

and derivatives, and other enterprise risks, as assigned by the Audit Committees. 

	• The Safety and Nuclear Oversight Committees discuss risks related to the safety of the Utility’s nuclear, electric, 
gas, and other operations and facilities, and oversees other enterprise risks, as assigned by the Audit Committees.
	• The Compensation Committee oversees potential risks arising from the companies’ compensation policies and 

practices.

Other risk oversight responsibilities also have been allocated, consistent with the overall substantive scope and duties 
of each Board and their respective committees.

This allocation of Board-level risk oversight was last reviewed by the Audit Committees in April 2017, and is scheduled 
for review again in April 2018.

The Boards’ role in risk oversight has had no significant effect on either Board’s leadership structure.

Management-Level Duties

Management has the day-to-day responsibility for assessing and managing PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 
exposure to various risks. Currently, risk is managed in three broad categories: enterprise and operational risk (e.g., 
public and employee safety, customer service, and other operational risks), compliance risk (e.g., legal and regulatory 
requirements), and market and credit risk (e.g., energy commodity risk).

With respect to supporting the Boards’ oversight activities:

	• Management provides various reports to the Boards and their respective committees regarding different elements 

of corporate risk management programs and activities, as requested by the Boards and the committees.

	• The companies’ EORM program identifies and evaluates potential risks facing the enterprise, and nominates specific 
enterprise risks for Board-level oversight. The EORM program as a whole is implemented by management and 
overseen by the Audit Committees, which assign Board-level responsibility for oversight of specific enterprise risks 
to committees of either company’s Board.

	• In 2017, the company established a Vice President-level Risk Management Committee that meets monthly to provide 
strategic guidance and direction for the EORM program, make recommendations to senior management on key 
aspects of risk management, and to conduct regular deep dives into specific risks.

	• Each line of business (“LOB”) within the companies has its own risk and compliance committee. These LOB committees 
review all major enterprise, operational, and compliance risks within that LOB (including public safety), review 
and approve risk analysis and mitigation strategies, and track mitigation progress and results. Each LOB risk and 
compliance committee is led by a senior officer and must include the LOB risk manager and compliance manager, 
and risk and compliance representatives of the organizations of the companies’ Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer 
and the companies’ Vice President, Internal Audit and Chief Risk Officer.

	• All LOBs review their top risks with the entire senior management team as part of the companies’ integrated multi-
year planning process. Following review with the senior management team, these risks become an important factor 
in the development of each LOB’s strategy and budget proposals. The integrated planning cycle is an annual process 
that enables the company to prioritize it’s top risks and management activities, and identify the related investments 
and revenue requirements that effectively mitigate those risks.

	• PG&E Corporation and the Utility have a Vice President, Internal Audit and Chief Risk Officer who functionally 
reports to the Audit Committees. This officer attends Board and Board committee meetings, and provides regular 
reports regarding various aspects of the companies’ risk management policies, programs, and activities.

Compensation Risk Analysis

As discussed in more detail in the CD&A, the Compensation Committee’s independent compensation consultant assists 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility with a review of the design of the companies’ incentive plans relative to general 
compensation plan risk factors (or the potential for unintended consequences).

Compliance and Ethics

During 2015, as part of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s commitment to strengthen their compliance and ethics 
program and performance, the companies restructured the governance for managing compliance and ethics to 
highlight and delineate more clearly the responsibilities for the implementation, coordination, and monitoring of their 
compliance and ethics program.

Board-level oversight is shared by the Boards and their committees. The Compliance and Public Policy Committee 
coordinates the compliance-related oversight of the Boards, including, but not limited to: overseeing and evaluating 
the effectiveness of the companies’ compliance and ethics program; reviewing periodic reports from management 
about the companies’ compliance with laws, regulations, and internal policies and standards; and monitoring that a 
consistent commitment to an effective compliance and ethics program is conveyed to employees, contractors, and other 
relevant stakeholders. The Audit Committees also assist the Boards with monitoring and overseeing compliance with 
legal and regulatory requirements, including reviewing matters that may impact the companies’ financial statements. 
The Safety and Nuclear Oversight Committees review significant compliance issues related to the companies’ nuclear, 
generation, gas and electric transmission, and gas and electric distribution operations and facilities.

This compliance governance structure helps promote a consistent approach to compliance and ethics across Board 
committees and the companies. The Compliance and Public Policy Committee works with management to make 
sure that the appropriate reports and materials regarding compliance and ethics issues are reviewed and discussed 
on a regular basis. The Audit Committees, the Compliance and Public Policy Committee, and the Safety and Nuclear 
Oversight Committees meet jointly at least twice a year to, among other things, coordinate and discuss the companies’ 
compliance program and monitor that all significant compliance and ethics issues are addressed by the appropriate 
Board committees.

At the management level, the companies’ Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer (CECO), in partnership with the lines 
of business, has day-to-day responsibility for overseeing and monitoring the company-wide compliance and ethics 
program. The lines of business are responsible for program implementation, and regularly report to the CECO on 
compliance and ethics matters. Management also has established officer-level compliance and ethics committees 
that provides strategic guidance on, and oversight of, the compliance and ethics program, including the programs 
and systems designed to prevent, detect, and mitigate non-compliance. The CECO has direct access to the Chair of 
the Compliance and Public Policy Committee and may be required to report to the Committee on requested matters.

Political Contributions

The Compliance and Public Policy Committee reviews PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s political contributions 
and recommends Board approval limits for political contributions from the companies to candidates, measures, 
initiatives, political action committees, and certain other organizations that may engage in activities involving 
elections. The Boards are apprised of significant advocacy efforts undertaken by the companies. The Compliance 
and Public Policy Committee also directs preparation of an annual report summarizing political contributions and 
certain other expenditures made by the companies during the preceding year. Additional information regarding each 
company’s political engagement policies and political expenditures is available on PG&E Corporation’s website at 
www.pgecorp.com/aboutus/corp_gov/political_engagement/political_engagement.shtml.

Corporate Sustainability

The Compliance and Public Policy Committee has primary oversight of corporate sustainability issues, such as 
environmental compliance and leadership, climate change resilience, community investments, workforce development, 
and diversity and inclusion. This includes an annual review of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s sustainability 
practices and performance. Other committees of the Boards address other components of the companies’ sustainability 
commitment, such as public and employee safety, operational excellence and investments to increase our delivery of 
affordable clean energy to our customers, and enabling a low-carbon future. In addition, the Compensation Committee 
approves the structure of the STIP and the LTIP, which reinforce the companies’ sustainability commitment by rewarding 
eligible employees for achievement of goals that benefit customers, shareholders, and employees.

27

2018 Joint Proxy StatementCorporate GovernanCe

Within management, the Chief Sustainability Officer of PG&E Corporation is responsible for developing and coordinating 
the companies’ corporate sustainability initiatives and overseeing the companies’ corporate sustainability reporting 
and performance measurement. This is done in coordination with other members of senior management who are 
responsible for functions such as supply chain management, environmental compliance, and customer energy solutions.

In 2017, we introduced a new framework defining our mission, vision, and culture, developed through extensive outreach 
and interactions with our employees, customers, and other stakeholders. Our vision of a sustainable energy future is 
focused on meeting the challenge of climate change while providing affordable energy for all customers. 

For information regarding PG&E Corporation’s sustainability efforts and progress, please see our comprehensive online 
Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Report 2017, which can be accessed at www.pgecorp.com/sustainability.

Safety

The PG&E Corporation and Utility Boards are responsible for oversight of safety. Specifically, the Safety and Nuclear 
Oversight Committees of the Boards are responsible for overseeing and reviewing policies, practices, goals, issues, 
risks, and compliance relating to safety, including public and employee safety. This responsibility includes, among 
other things, overseeing goals, programs, policies and practices with respect to promoting a strong safety culture, 
and monitoring the impact of changes in laws and regulations affecting safety. The Safety and Nuclear Oversight 
Committees also monitor and review the adequacy and direction of the corporate safety function. 

In addition, the Compensation Committee, with advice from the Safety and Nuclear Oversight Committees, selects 
appropriate safety metrics for inclusion in executive compensation program and plans, and may adjust individual award 
amounts to reflect, among other reasons, safety performance. The Compliance and Public Policy Committee reviews 
compliance with safety requirements as part of its general oversight for compliance. The Finance Committee, as part 
of its responsibility for reviewing proposed major capital projects, reviews capital projects and programs with safety 
implications, such as projects and programs to enhance public or employee safety. 

Within management, all officers, including the PG&E Corporation CEO and the Utility President, are responsible for 
safety and the instillation of safety culture. More specifically, the Chief Safety Officer (CSO) of the Utility is responsible 
for the occupational health and safety of employees and contractors and partners with the lines of business to develop 
and monitor the enterprise-wide safety program at PG&E Corporation and the Utility. The CSO reports directly to the 
Utility President, and also reports regularly to the Safety and Nuclear Oversight Committees, which in turn serve as a 
direct channel of communication between the CSO and the full Boards. The CSO also may be requested to provide 
reports to the full Boards regarding safety matters. 

Management Succession

At least annually, and often more frequently, the PG&E Corporation and Utility Boards each review the applicable 
company’s plan for CEO succession, both in the ordinary course of business and in response to emergency situations. 
Each company’s Board also develops a profile of appropriate responsibilities, attributes, and requirements for the 
position of CEO, which reflects the Corporation’s and the Utility’s business functions, vision, and strategy. Potential 
candidates for CEO may be identified internally within the companies in consultation with the Compensation Committee 
(which oversees the evaluation of management) and the CEO, as well as externally through various sources, including 
independent third-party consultants.

The succession planning process also addresses the continuing development of appropriate leadership skills for internal 
candidates for CEO, as well as candidates for other leadership positions within the companies. The Compensation 
Committee is responsible for reviewing the CEO’s long-range plans for officer development and succession for 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility.

Throughout 2017, the Compensation Committee addressed management succession and executive development in 
connection with its review of officer elections, promotions, and compensation matters during the year. The Boards and 
the Compensation Committee last reviewed and discussed CEO and management succession planning and executive 
development at their respective meetings in February 2018.

Shareholder Engagement

PG&E Corporation and the Utility value our shareholders’ views and are committed to ongoing constructive dialogue 
with shareholders to advance the long-term viability and interests of the companies. PG&E Corporation has had a 
record of Board responsiveness to shareholders, demonstrated by the Board’s voluntary adoption of proxy access

respect to gender and/or ethnicity. 

We regularly provide opportunities for dialogue with shareholders to further promote the exchange of ideas regarding 
corporate governance and other issues. Under the companies’ Corporate Governance Guidelines, the independent 
Chairs of the Boards are responsible for responding to written communications that are directed to the Boards from

Secretary will forward to the independent lead director or the independent non-executive Chair any communications 
addressed to the Board of Directors as a body or to all of the independent or non-management directors in their 
entirety, and such other communications as the Corporate Secretary, in his or her discretion, determines is appropriate. 
The Corporate Secretary also will receive communications directed to individual directors or officers, including the 
independent non-executive Chair or the independent lead director, and will forward those as appropriate.

The address of the principal executive office for each company is:

PG&E Corporation 
Pacific Gas and Electric Company

2018 Joint Proxy StatementCompensation of Non-Employee 
Directors

The Boards of PG&E Corporation and the Utility each establish the level of compensation for that company’s non-employee 
directors, based on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee. Directors who also are current employees 
of either company receive no additional compensation for service as directors.

The Compensation Committee periodically reviews the amount and form of compensation paid to non-employee 
directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility. As part of this review, the Committee reviews the compensation provided 
to the companies’ non-employee directors as compared to other comparable U.S. peer companies (including both other 
utilities and companies within the S&P 250), with the objective of ensuring that non-employee director compensation is: 

	• Market-competitive in terms of annual compensation value, and
	• Consistent with emerging market practices and trends.
Compensation paid to non-employee directors for 2017 for service on the Boards and their committees is based upon 
periodic compensation reviews conducted in consultation with the Committee’s executive compensation consultant, 
Pay Governance LLC. The Compensation Committee’s most recent reviews of non-employee director compensation 
were conducted in September and December 2017.

both the Utility and Lockheed Martin Corporation unless FERC pre-approves the interlocking positions. Secretary Johnson has 
decided to not stand for re-election to the Corporation Board at the 2018 Annual Meetings.

Non-Employee Director Stock-Based Compensation

compensation. Pursuant to the terms of the 2014 LTIP, as approved by PG&E Corporation’s shareholders, the annual 
value of equity awards provided to any one non-employee director is limited to $400,000 in any calendar year.

Awards for 2017 were granted on May 30, 2017. Each non-employee director’s award had a total aggregate value of

Corporation common stock) and consisted of RSUs that were granted to each non-employee director after his or 
her election to the Board. These RSUs vest at the earlier of the end of the director’s annual elected term or one year 
after the date of grant, and are then settled as shares of PG&E Corporation common stock. RSUs also will vest and 
be settled upon the director’s death or disability, or if there is both a Change in Control (as defined on page 57) and 
the director is terminated. Otherwise, RSUs are forfeited if the director ceases to be a member of the Board prior to 
vesting. Non-employee directors also may elect to defer settlement of vested RSUs.

Stock Ownership Guidelines

Non-employee directors of PG&E Corporation are expected to own shares of PG&E Corporation common stock having 
a dollar value of at least five times the value of the then-applicable annual Board retainer. Ownership is measured 
annually as of December 31 of each calendar year. If any non-employee director is on the Utility Board only, then that 
director also may satisfy his or her stock ownership obligation with Utility preferred stock. Directors generally have 
five years to meet the guidelines. Ownership includes beneficial ownership of common stock, as well as RSUs and 
common stock equivalents. These guidelines were adopted in order to more closely align the interests of directors 
and each company’s shareholders.

Deferral of Retainers and Fees

Under the PG&E Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, directors of PG&E 
Corporation and the Utility may elect to defer all of their retainers, all of their meeting fees, or both. Directors who 
participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan may elect either to (1) convert their deferred compensation into common 
stock equivalents, the value of which is tied to the market value of PG&E Corporation common stock, or (2) have their 
deferred compensation deemed to be invested in the Utility Bond Fund (which is described in the narrative following 
the “Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation—2017” table beginning on page 68).

Reimbursement for Travel and Other Expenses

Directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility are reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with 
attending Board, Board committee, or shareholder meetings, or participating in other activities undertaken on behalf

2018 Joint Proxy StatementItem No. 2: Ratification of the 
Appointment of the Independent 
Registered Public Accounting Firm 
for PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas 
and Electric Company

The Audit Committees of PG&E Corporation and the Utility each have selected and appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP 
(“Deloitte & Touche”) as the independent auditor for that company to audit the consolidated financial statements as 
of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, and to audit the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
as of December 31, 2018. Deloitte & Touche is a major national accounting firm with substantial expertise in the energy 
and utility businesses. Deloitte & Touche has served as the independent auditors for PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
since 1999.

One or more representatives of Deloitte & Touche are expected to be present at the 2018 Annual Meetings. They will 
have the opportunity to make a statement if they wish and are expected to be available to respond to questions from 
shareholders.

Each company’s Board believes that this appointment of Deloitte & Touche is in the best interests of that company 
and its shareholders. 

PG&E Corporation and the Utility are not required to submit these appointments to a vote of their shareholders. 
However, the Boards of Directors believe that requesting shareholder ratification of this selection is a good corporate 
governance practice. If the shareholders of either PG&E Corporation or the Utility do not ratify the appointment, the 
applicable Audit Committee will investigate the reasons for rejection by the shareholders and will reconsider the 
appointment. Even if a company’s shareholders ratify the selection, the applicable Audit Committee, in its discretion, 
may change the appointment at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best 
interests of that company and its shareholders.
the Boards of Directors of pG&e Corporation and pacific Gas and electric Company Unanimously 
recommend a vote For the proposal to ratify the appointment of Deloitte & touche.

2018 Joint Proxy StatementInformation Regarding the 
Independent Auditor  for PG&E 
Corporation and Pacific Gas and 
Electric Company

Selection and Oversight of the Independent Auditor

Each Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment, replacement, compensation, and oversight of the work of 
the independent auditor. The Audit Committees review the scope of the audit, including the terms of the engagement. 
The independent auditor reports directly to the Audit Committees; at each Audit Committee meeting, the independent 
auditor meets separately with the Audit Committees, without management present. 

Annually, each Audit Committee also evaluates the independence, qualifications, and performance of the independent 
auditor, taking into account the opinions of management and the internal auditors. To ensure continuing independence 
of the independent auditor, the Audit Committees also consider whether there should be rotation of the independent 
auditor. In accordance with SEC rules, the lead audit partner may provide a maximum number of five consecutive years 
of service to the companies. Consistent with that requirement, Deloitte & Touche assigned a new lead auditor to lead 
the integrated audit of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial statements, starting in 2017. The Audit Committees 
reviewed and evaluated the new lead auditor as part of its annual process for reviewing the independent auditor. 

For 2018, the Audit Committees selected Deloitte & Touche as the companies’ independent auditor, following 
consideration of the following factors and criteria: (1) status as a registered public accounting firm and is subject 
to oversight by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; (2) status as a “Big Four” public accounting firm, 
nationally and internationally recognized as an expert in accounting and auditing; (3) having one of the largest utility 
practices of the “Big Four” public accounting firms; (4) having made a strong commitment to supporting supplier 
diversity; (5) having significant experience with the companies; and (6) having an experienced team, including the lead 
partner, familiar with the industry, assigned to the companies’ engagements. The Audit Committees also considered 
(1) Deloitte & Touche’s quality control report, (2) Deloitte & Touche’s discussion of its independence, and (3) a review 
of Deloitte & Touche’s proposed audit plan (including draft engagement letter) for 2018.

Although Deloitte & Touche has been the companies’ independent auditor since 1999, in 2015 and at the Audit Committees’ 
direction, the companies solicited bids from accounting firms to conduct the external audits of the companies’ financial 
statements for the year ending December 31, 2016. The bids were evaluated by the Auditor Selection Committee, 
which was comprised of members from the companies’ accounting, internal auditing, regulatory, operational, sourcing, 
and legal functions. The bids were evaluated with respect to four key factors: firm capabilities and background, firm 
resources and audit plan, supplier diversity plans, and pricing. Upon consideration of the information provided by the 
Auditor Selection Committee, each Audit Committee appointed Deloitte & Touche as the independent auditor for the 
year ending December 31, 2016. 

Fees Paid to the Independent Auditor During 2017 and 2016

The Audit Committees have reviewed the audit and non-audit fees that PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and their 
respective controlled subsidiaries have paid to the independent auditor (including subsidiaries and affiliates), in order to 
consider whether the nature and relative value of those fees are compatible with maintaining the firm’s independence.

Obtaining Services from the Independent Auditor

annual review and pre-approval of Services
For each fiscal year, each Audit Committee approves a list of services that will be obtained during that year by the 
applicable company and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates from the independent auditor (including its affiliates). 
The Audit Committees also approve maximum fee amounts for each approved service. Management also has adopted 
a policy under which PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and their controlled subsidiaries may enter into new engagements 
with Deloitte & Touche and its affiliate, Deloitte Consulting, only for the following services:

Audit-related services

Tax services

Description
Audit and review of annual and quarterly financial statements, expressing opinions on 
the conformity of the audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting 
principles, auditing management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control 
over financial reporting, and services that only the independent auditor reasonably can 
provide (e.g., comfort letters, statutory and regulatory audits, attest services, consents, and 
assistance with and review of documents filed with the SEC).
Assurance and related services that traditionally are performed by the independent auditor 
(e.g., agreed-upon procedure reports related to contractual obligations and attest services).
Advice relating to compliance, tax strategy, tax appeals, and specialized tax issues, all of 
which also must be permitted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

As part of the review process, the Audit Committees assess, among other things, the impact of that service on the 
independent auditor’s independence.

Mid-Year Monitoring and approval of additional Services
During the year, management periodically updates each Audit Committee as to the extent to which the approved 
services have already been provided. The Audit Committees also must approve (1) any proposed new services that 
were not approved during the annual review, and (2) any increase in authorized fee amounts for previously approved 
services.

Delegation of pre-approval authority
Each Audit Committee has delegated to its Committee Chair, or to any other independent Committee member if the 
Chair is not available, the authority to pre-approve services provided by the company’s independent auditor. These 
pre-approvals must be presented to the full Audit Committee at the next regularly scheduled Committee meeting.

Services provided During 2017 and 2016
During 2017 and 2016, all services provided by Deloitte & Touche to PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and their consolidated 
affiliates were approved consistent with the applicable pre-approval procedures.

2018 Joint Proxy StatementReport of the Audit Committees

The Audit Committees (“Committees”) of PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (“Utility”) are 
comprised of independent directors and operate under written charters adopted by their respective Boards. The 
members of the Audit Committees of PG&E Corporation and the Utility are identical. At both PG&E Corporation and 
the Utility, management is responsible for internal controls and the integrity of the financial reporting process.

The Committees reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements of PG&E Corporation and the 
Utility with management and the independent auditor. The Committees also discussed with the independent auditor 
matters that are required to be discussed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Auditing 
Standard No. 1301—Communications with Audit Committees.

Deloitte & Touche LLP was the independent auditor for PG&E Corporation and the Utility in 2017. Deloitte & Touche 
LLP provided to the Committees written disclosures required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding an 
independent auditor’s communications with an audit committee concerning independence and non-audit services, 
and the Committees discussed with Deloitte & Touche LLP that firm’s independence.

Based on the Committees’ review and discussions described above, the Committees recommended to the Boards 
that the audited consolidated financial statements for PG&E Corporation and the Utility be included in the PG&E 
Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 
2017, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

2018 Joint Proxy StatementItem No. 3: Advisory Vote on 
Executive Compensation for PG&E 
Corporation and Pacific Gas and 
Electric Company

PG&E Corporation and the Utility each ask their respective shareholders to approve the following:

RESOLVED that the compensation paid to the company’s executive officers named in the Summary Compensation 
Table of this Joint Proxy Statement, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and the accompanying narrative discussion, 
is hereby APPROVED.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility each believe that its executive compensation policies and practices are effective 
in tying a significant portion of pay to performance, while providing competitive compensation that attracts, retains, 
and motivates talented executives, and aligns the interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders.
In establishing PG&E Corporation’s officer compensation programs for 2017 (which also cover officers of the Utility), the 
Compensation Committee established three objectives. These objectives, and how these objectives were met for 2017, are 
discussed in the CD&A, which can be found immediately following this Item No. 3. These objectives are summarized below.
•• A significant portion of every officer’s compensation should be tied directly to PG&E Corporation’s performance, 

without promoting excessive risk-taking.
With the exception of base salary and perquisites, all elements of annual officer compensation are tied to corporate 
operational and/or financial performance and, therefore, provide a direct connection between compensation and 
performance in the achievement of both key operating results and long-term shareholder value. For Geisha J. Williams, 
who served as the PG&E Corporation CEO from March 1, 2017, approximately 88 percent of 2017 target compensation 
was tied to corporate performance. For the other NEOs, approximately 76 percent of average 2017 target compensation 
was tied to corporate performance.
The Compensation Committee’s independent compensation consultant, Pay Governance LLC, has advised that 
there are no material issues regarding PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s executive compensation programs, and 
that the design of the companies’ incentive pay plans pose a low likelihood of incenting employees to engage in 
behaviors that are likely to have an adverse material impact on the companies.

•• A significant component of officer compensation should be tied to PG&E Corporation’s long-term performance 

for shareholders, in the form of long-term incentive awards.
The annual long-term incentive awards for 2017 were comprised of 50 percent performance shares using a relative 
TSR measure, 10 percent performance shares using equally weighted safety and financial measures, and 40 percent 
RSUs. Performance shares granted in 2017 vest, if at all, at the end of a three-year period, and their value is also 
tied to the price of PG&E Corporation common stock. In addition, the value of performance shares using a TSR 
measure is tied to the relative three-year performance of PG&E Corporation common stock price appreciation and 
dividends paid, as compared to the TSR of companies in the 2017 Performance Comparator Group. RSUs vest over 
a three-year period, and their value is tied directly to the price of PG&E Corporation common stock.

•• Target cash compensation (base salary and target short-term incentive) should be competitive with the median 

target cash compensation for comparable officers in the 2017 Pay Comparator Group.
Target cash compensation for 2017 generally was within a range of 15 percent above to 15 percent below the 
corresponding market median for companies in the 2017 Pay Comparator Group.

This vote is non-binding and is required by Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. PG&E Corporation 
and the Utility each currently plan to submit this vote to shareholders annually, and expect to next submit this matter 
to shareholders in connection with next year’s annual shareholder meeting. If the shareholders of either company do 
not approve this proposal, the Compensation Committee and members of management will investigate the reasons 
for disapproval and will consider those reasons when developing future executive compensation programs, practices, 
and policies.
The Boards of Directors of PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company Unanimously 
Recommend a Vote FOR This Proposal to Approve the Compensation of Each Company’s Executive 
Officers Named in the Summary Compensation Table, as Described in This Joint Proxy Statement.

2018 Joint Proxy StatementCompensation Discussion and 
Analysis

This CD&A describes the companies’ compensation philosophy, executive compensation program, and how the NEOs 
were compensated in 2017. The CD&A discusses:

1.  Performance and Pay Highlights
2.  Compensation Program Objectives and Competitive Market Review
3.  Risk and Governance Approach
4.  NEO Compensation Structure
5.  Committee Conclusion

Detailed information regarding 2017 NEO compensation can be found in the Executive Officer Compensation Information 
section following this CD&A.

1.  PERFORMANCE AND PAY HIGHLIGHTS

Corporate Performance

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s (together, “PG&E”) performance is a product of factors that we can manage as 
well as larger forces over which we have less control:

•• We operate in settings prone to natural disasters and the adverse effects of climate change, including fires, high 

winds, droughts, floods, mudslides, and earthquakes. 

•• We provide service to diverse geographic locations ranging from those with extreme urban density to hard-to-

access sparsely populated areas.

•• We are affected by the regulatory and political environment in which we operate.

At PG&E, we actively work to identify, prepare for, and manage the risks and opportunities each of these creates, and 
you can see from the pages that follow that our compensation plans are strongly tied to our success in doing so. Our 
performance reflects the impact of these factors as well as the results of the work and planning we control and manage.
The companies’ operating results in 2017 were mixed. The companies achieved important targets in key measures of 
public safety and customer affordability, while missing goals in employee safety, customer satisfaction, and overall 
electric reliability. The companies also slightly exceeded their target range for earnings from operations. 
All of this, however, was overshadowed by the steep decline in shareholder value driven by uncertainties in the 
aftermath of the October 2017 Northern California wildfires. The causes of the fires, which were the most destructive 
and costly in the state’s history, have not yet been determined. However, under existing California law, PG&E could 
face substantial liability if our assets are found to be involved, even if all of the Utility’s practices and precautions met 
the applicable requirements for maintaining and operating the Utility system. 
We fully recognize the enormous adverse impact that these events have had on shareholders. PG&E Corporation’s 
stock price had lost more than 35 percent of its value by the end of 2017. PG&E Corporation and Utility shareholders 
have been further impacted by the necessary suspension of common and preferred stock dividends in light of the 
potential fire-related liabilities. 
Working toward a comprehensive resolution to the wildfire-related issues is a top priority for 2018, including revisiting 
the dividend suspension as more information about the fires becomes available. We are currently working through 
legal, regulatory, and legislative channels to pursue solutions, together with other California utilities, our labor unions, 
and other stakeholders.
In the meantime, we believe that PG&E’s core operations and performance are sound and that PG&E is well positioned 
to capitalize on the prevailing trends in our industry and California’s constructive energy agenda.
In 2017, we introduced a new framework for defining our mission, our vision, and the central pillars of our culture that 
are crucial to our success. Our Mission, Vision, and Culture statements affirm who we are, what we do, and what we 

39

2018 Joint Proxy StatementCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

aspire to. They define what it means for us to be successful and outline the beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that are 
vital to moving us forward. Most importantly, they guide our decisions and actions. 
Our 2017 performance included major accomplishments in each of these areas:

Mission
•• Created a new five-year safety action plan to further improve in public, employee, and contractor safety.

•• Delivered first quartile performance for both 911 (electric) emergency response and gas emergency response. This 
was accomplished despite the extremely high level of emergency calls in the first quarter due to severe storm activity.

Our Mission
To safely and reliably deliver 
affordable and clean energy 
to our customers and 
communities every single 
day, while building the 
energy network of tomorrow.

Our Vision
With a sustainable energy 
future as our North Star, 
we will meet the challenge 
of climate change while 
providing affordable energy 
for all customers.

Our Culture
We put safety first.

We are accountable. We act with integrity, transparency and humility.

We are here to serve our customers.

We embrace change. innovation and continuous improvement.

We value diversity and inclusion. We speak up, listen up and follow up.

We succeed through collaboration and partnership. We are one team.

The STIP is the annual cash incentive plan for executives. 
Performance is measured against targets previously 
approved by the Compensation Committee.

Overall safety performance exceeded target, with above-
target performance on 7 of the 10 measures. More 
specifically, performance for the Diablo Canyon Power 
Plant Reliability and Safety Indicator exceeded the stretch 
goal for both units. Performance for the Electric Overhead 
Conductor Index exceeded target by completing infrared 
inspections and vegetation management ahead of plan. 
Performance for the Gas In-Line Inspection and Upgrade 
Index exceeded target by inspecting and upgrading more 
miles than targeted and pulling forward work planned 
for 2018. Performance for the Gas Dig-Ins Reduction 
measure exceeded target through active engagement 
with customers, local government, and contractors in 
damage prevention. Performance for the Gas Emergency 
Response measure exceeded target, treating all calls as an

immediate response priority. Performance for the Serious 
Injuries and Fatalities Corrective Action Index exceeded 
the stretch goal through a focus on corrective actions 
and steady improvement throughout the year. While 911 
Emergency Response performance was strong, it fell 
short of target due to the high number of storm-related 
calls. Serious Preventable Motor Vehicle Incident Rate 
performance was below threshold due mainly to accidents 
involving rear-end collisions and striking stationary objects. 
Performance for the Timely Reporting of Injuries measure 
fell short of target but showed improvement from 2016.

Customer performance was below threshold. Satisfaction 
declined, primarily due to dissatisfaction with pricing 
changes and high winter bills. Reliability was impacted by 
late-winter weather events, record precipitation, record 
summer heat events, and wildfires.
Financial performance as measured by earnings from 
operations exceeded the 2017 STIP target, primarily 
driven by lower unit cost and by tax benefits related to 
LTIP stock-based compensation.
After reviewing overall company performance against the 
2017 STIP targets, the Committee approved a final 2017 
STIP score of 0.959.
In view of the overall corporate performance as described 
above, Geisha J. Williams, Chief Executive Officer and 
President of PG&E Corporation, respectfully recommended 
that she and Jason P. Wells, Senior Vice President and Chief 
Financial Officer of PG&E Corporation, not accept 2017 
STIP awards. While both were eligible for awards based 
on company and individual performance, she felt that this 
action was necessary to demonstrate accountability and 
alignment with shareholder interests in view of recent stock 
performance and the dividend suspension. The Committee, 
the Boards, and Mr. Wells accepted her recommendation.

Long-Term Performance and Pay

Our equity-based incentive plan is designed to link executive performance to long-term shareholder returns. Awards 
consist of (1) performance shares which cliff-vest following a three-year performance period and (2) RSUs with time-
based vesting.

2015 Performance Share Result - TSR
50 percent of LTIP awards granted in 2015 were allocated to performance shares with the payout determined by 
comparing PG&E Corporation’s TSR to that of the companies in its 2015 Performance Comparator Group. PG&E 
Corporation’s TSR ranked 14th in comparison to the 2015 Performance Comparator Group for the three-year period 
from 2015 to 2017, resulting in no payout in 2018 with respect to these performance shares.

2018 Joint Proxy StatementCEO Realizable Compensation

The Compensation Committee believes that analyzing 
realizable pay is important in understanding the relationship 
between the targeted compensation that was approved 
for the CEO of PG&E Corporation and the compensation 
that was actually earned, or may still be earned, based 
on company performance.
For the past three years in aggregate, CEO realizable pay 
was 57 percent of target. Target compensation for each 
year includes salary, non-equity incentives at target, the 
value of stock awards granted (at grant date fair market 
value), change in pension value, and all other compensation.
Realizable compensation for each year includes salary, non-
equity incentives earned, the value of stock awards (using 
the December 31, 2017 stock price for vested awards or, for 
outstanding unvested awards, the expected value at vesting 
based on the December 31, 2017 stock price), change in 
pension value, and all other compensation. Based on the 
significant reduction in TSR following the California wildfires, 
no payouts are assumed for performance shares granted 
in 2016 and 2017 using a TSR measure. Target payouts are 
assumed for performance shares granted in 2016 and 2017 
using safety and affordability or financial goals.

2.   COMPENSATION PROGRAM OBJECTIVES, PROCESS, 

AND COMPETITIVE MARKET REVIEW

2017 Officer Compensation Program Objectives

The Compensation Committee established PG&E Corporation’s officer compensation program for 2017 to meet three 
primary objectives:
•• Performance-Based Pay—A significant portion of total compensation is at risk based on PG&E Corporation and 
individual performance. Short- and long-term incentives reflect safety, customer, operational, and financial goals, 
and long-term shareholder returns, without promoting excessive risk-taking.

•• Shareholder Alignment—A significant component of every officer’s compensation is tied directly to PG&E Corporation’s 
performance for shareholders. Performance is defined as TSR, measured by stock price appreciation and dividends 
paid, relative to companies in the Performance Comparator Group.

•• Market-Competitive Compensation Levels—Target cash compensation (base salary and short-term incentive) should 
be competitive with the median target cash compensation for comparable officers in the Pay Comparator Group.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s 2017 compensation policies and practices described below and elsewhere in this 
Proxy Statement are designed to meet these objectives. These objectives are largely unchanged from 2016.
The Committee also considers shareholder advisory votes as part of its review of executive compensation programs and 
practices. In May 2017, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s shareholders approved the companies’ NEO compensation 
for 2016 with votes of 95.8 percent and 99.9 percent, respectively. The Committee considered these results and, given 
the level of shareholder support, made no material changes to compensation policies in 2017.

Executive Officer Compensation-Setting Process

Each year, the independent members of the applicable Board, based on the Compensation Committee’s advice and 
recommendation, approve the amounts of total target compensation for the CEO of PG&E Corporation and the 
CEO of the Utility (or, if the Utility CEO office is not filled, the Utility President). Such approvals are made following a 
review of comparative data, advice from the Committee’s independent compensation consultant, and an assessment 
of individual performance, objectives, and scope of responsibilities. The Committee also approves the amounts of 

43

2018 Joint Proxy StatementCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

total target compensation for all other executive officers based upon a review of comparative data, advice from its 
independent compensation consultant, and recommendations from the Corporation CEO and the Utility CEO (or, if the 
Utility CEO office is not filled, the Utility President), as applicable. The Committee uses comparative data throughout 
the year to set the total target compensation of new executive officers. The Committee also reviews other benefits 
provided to executive officers.
The PG&E Corporation Board has delegated to the Compensation Committee the authority to administer the 2014 
LTIP, under which equity-based awards have been made. In addition, the Corporation Board has delegated to the 
Corporation CEO the authority to grant LTIP awards to certain eligible participants within the guidelines adopted by 
the Committee.
The PG&E Corporation CEO and the Utility CEO (or, if the Utility CEO office is not filled, the Utility President) generally 
attend a portion of each Compensation Committee meeting, but excuse themselves from the Committee’s deliberations 
or decisions with respect to their own pay. At the Committee’s request, the Corporation CEO and the Utility CEO (or, if 
the Utility CEO office is not filled, the Utility President) review with the Committee the performance of the other NEOs. 
The Corporation CEO and the Utility CEO (or, if the Utility CEO office is not filled, the Utility President), as applicable, 
also recommend adjustments, if any, in base pay, annual incentive awards, and LTIP awards for the other NEOs.
These recommendations are given appropriate weight by the Committee in the compensation-setting process, given 
each CEO’s and President’s direct knowledge of the performance and contributions of each NEO. The Committee may 
exercise its discretion to accept, reject, or modify their recommendations based on the Committee members’ collective 
assessment of the NEOs’ performance and pay position relative to the peer group, as well as PG&E Corporation’s 
overall financial and operating performance and other factors that the Committee deems appropriate.
The Compensation Committee may delegate its authority with respect to ministerial matters under the 2014 LTIP to 
the PG&E Corporation CEO or the PG&E Corporation Senior Vice President, Human Resources.
The PG&E Corporation Board has delegated to the Corporation CEO the authority to approve compensation, within 
guidelines approved by the Compensation Committee, to lower-level officers excluding Section 16 Officers and to non-
officer employees. With respect to equity awards, such Committee-approved guidelines include the LTIP annual award 
value ranges for different categories of employees, an aggregate cap on the value of awards for any given year, and the 
terms and conditions of all LTIP awards to be made during the year. The guidelines also specify the grant date for annual 
LTIP awards. Actual awards are made within the range of target LTIP values previously approved by the Committee.

Consultants and Advisers

The Compensation Committee retains an independent compensation consultant to advise on compensation programs 
and practices, including pay levels for non-employee directors and for officers. Under a policy adopted by the 
Committee, this consultant must be “independent,” i.e., (1) the consultant must be retained by, and report solely to, the 
Compensation Committee, and (2) the consultant and its affiliates may not perform any work for PG&E Corporation 
or its affiliates, except at the request of the Committee or its Chair, and in the capacity of the Committee’s agent.
For establishing 2017 compensation, the Compensation Committee retained Pay Governance LLC (“Pay Governance”) as 
its independent consultant. Pay Governance did not provide services to management of PG&E Corporation, the Utility, 
or their affiliates, although Pay Governance has maintained a working relationship with management in order to fulfill 
Pay Governance’s primary role as adviser to the Compensation Committee. Pay Governance is a nationally recognized 
independent firm providing consulting assistance to corporations in order to develop compensation programs for 
senior executives, key employees, and boards of directors. Pay Governance was first selected as the Compensation 
Committee’s independent consultant in September 2014, following the Committee’s review of numerous candidate firms.
During 2017, Pay Governance advised the Compensation Committee on the following matters:
•• Non-employee director compensation,

•• Executive compensation competitive market,

•• Executive compensation emerging trends and best practices,

•• Shareholder advisory firms’ pay and performance analyses,

•• Compensation risk analysis,

•• Proxy statement disclosures relating to compensation,

•• Severance and change-in-control practices and policies,

•• Corporate governance best practices relating to compensation, and

•• Compensation matters relating to CEO transition.

44

2018 Joint Proxy StatementCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

The Compensation Committee determined that no conflicts of interest were raised by the work of Pay Governance 
during 2017.
The Compensation Committee also has discretion to engage other compensation consultants, as well as legal counsel 
and other advisers, although it did not do so during 2017. The Committee will take into account any such advisers’ and 
consultants’ independence, and whether the work of any compensation consultants will raise any conflict of interest. 
PG&E Corporation pays the reasonable compensation costs for any such advisers.
Management also may retain compensation consultants to assist management and the Compensation Committee in 
connection with compensation matters.

2017 NEO Compensation Competitive Market Review

For 2017, the Compensation Committee used a Pay Comparator Group of publicly traded gas and electric utilities to 
evaluate market practice and assess PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s competitive pay position, supplemented by 
data for the broader energy services sector or general industry, as appropriate. All elements of NEO total direct pay 
(base pay and short- and long-term incentive targets) were compared individually and in aggregate to the applicable 
benchmark data.
The Committee does not adhere strictly to formulas or survey data to determine the actual mix and amounts of 
compensation. The Committee considers various additional factors, including each NEO’s scope of responsibility and 
organizational impact, experience, and performance, as well as PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s overall safety, 
operating, and financial results. This flexibility is important in supporting the overall pay-for-performance philosophy 
and in meeting the Committee’s objectives of attracting, retaining, and motivating a talented executive leadership team.
In setting 2017 compensation levels, base pay and short-term incentive targets were aligned with the market median.
Target annual LTIP award values for 2017 reflect long-term incentive award trends of the market. Specifically, performance 
share awards using a TSR metric are designed to (1) provide payouts commensurate with PG&E Corporation’s TSR 
performance as compared to the 2017 Performance Comparator Group, and (2) deliver long-term incentive compensation 
at approximately the 60th percentile level of the 2017 Pay Comparator Group, upon achievement of 60th percentile 
TSR performance as compared to the 2017 Performance Comparator Group. If the Corporation’s TSR performance is 
at the median level of the 2017 Performance Comparator Group, participants will realize a payout below target award 
values. Actual amounts realized by NEOs depend on the Corporation’s performance, as measured by stock price and 
relative TSR performance as compared to the 2017 Performance Comparator Group and by actual safety and financial 
performance as compared to established targets.

Pay Comparator Group

For 2017, the Pay Comparator Group used to benchmark compensation elements consisted of all companies listed 
in the Philadelphia Utility Index, with two replacements. Sempra Energy and WEC Energy Group, Inc. were used as 
comparators in place of American Water Works, due to its dissimilar business model, and El Paso Electric because, 
with annual revenues under $1 billion, it is too small to be a reasonable comparator. The Philadelphia Utility Index, which 
is administered by NASDAQ, consists of a group of 20 companies (including PG&E Corporation) that are selected 
by NASDAQ on the basis of having a primary business in the electric utility sector and meeting minimum market 
capitalization criteria.
A total of 19 companies were included in the 2017 Pay Comparator Group.

In addition, supplemental data for the broader energy services segment, adjusted for PG&E Corporation’s revenues, 
was provided by Willis Towers Watson from its proprietary Energy Services executive compensation survey, which 
includes information from over 100 energy services companies. For Mr. Mistry and Ms. Austin, comparisons were made 
to data from Willis Towers Watson’s General Industry executive compensation survey, as their job scope and skills are 
easily transferable to other industries. Due to the proprietary nature of the data, Willis Towers Watson did not disclose 
the companies matching individual benchmark positions.

2018 Joint Proxy StatementCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Performance Comparator Group

Each year, PG&E Corporation and the Utility also identify a Performance Comparator Group that is used only for 
evaluating PG&E Corporation’s relative TSR performance to determine payouts for LTIP performance shares. In 
determining the composition of the Performance Comparator Group for 2017, the Compensation Committee decided 
that the Performance Comparator Group will include companies (1) that are categorized consistently by the investment 
community as “regulated,” as opposed to “less regulated,” based on analysis of revenue sources (i.e., the companies 
have business models similar to the Corporation and the Utility), and (2) that have a market capitalization of at least 
$4 billion. The Committee first selected companies listed on the Philadelphia Utility Index that meet these criteria 
and then selected additional companies that also meet these criteria. A total of 14 companies were included in the 
Performance Comparator Group for performance shares granted in 2017.

3. RISK AND GOVERNANCE APPROACH

The companies’ compensation programs emphasize sound governance practices. Our executive compensation practices, 
as aligned with best practices, include:

Our Compensation Practices

NOT Our Compensation Practices

✔ Pay for Performance. A majority of compensation is 

“at risk” and linked to shareholder interests.

✘ No Employment Contracts. Generally do not utilize 

employment contracts.

✔ Shareholder Outreach. Discussions with key 

institutional investors on a regular basis.

✔ Clawback Policy. Clawback policy with a three-year 
reach- back triggered by (1) financial restatement, 
(2) material miscalculation of performance measure, 
or (3) fraud or intentional misconduct resulting 
in material financial or reputation harm to either 
company. Revised February 2018.

✔ Double Trigger. Change-in-control severance requires 

a “double trigger.”

✘ No Unearned Dividends Paid. No dividends or 

dividend equivalents are paid on unvested equity 
awards.

✘ No Repricing of Options and Stock Appreciation 

Rights. Repricing requires shareholder approval.

✘ No Tax Gross-Ups. No tax gross-ups are provided, 

except for limited programs generally available to all 
management employees.

✔ Tally Sheets. The Compensation Committee reviews 

tally sheets and considers realizable pay.

✘ No Hedging or Pledging. Policy restricts hedging and 

pledging of either company’s stock.

✔ Limited Severance Benefits. Benefits are limited to 
one times base salary plus target STIP bonus, pro-
rata vesting of performance shares, and one-year 
continued vesting of RSUs.

✔ Compensation Consultant. The Compensation 

Committee engages an independent consultant and 
has a policy concerning independence.

✔ Ownership Guidelines. Share ownership and retention 
requirements (6X base salary for the CEO; 1.5X to 3X 
for other NEOs, except Mr. Thomason).

✘ No Additional Service Credit. Policy against granting 

additional credited service under the Supplemental 
Executive Retirement Plan.

46

2018 Joint Proxy StatementCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines
The 2010 Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines are designed to encourage senior executive officers to achieve and 
maintain a minimum investment in PG&E Corporation common stock at levels set by the Compensation Committee, 
and to further align executive interests with those of PG&E Corporation’s shareholders. Executive stock ownership 
guidelines are increasingly viewed as an important element of a company’s governance policies.
The stock ownership target for Ms. Williams is six times base salary, the target for Messrs. Stavropoulos, Wells, and 
Simon is three times base salary, and the target for Mr. Mistry and Ms. Austin is one and one-half times base salary. 
Mr. Thomason is not subject to stock ownership guidelines.
Until an executive meets the applicable stock ownership guideline, he or she must retain 50 percent of the net shares 
realized from the vesting of RSUs or stock units (including performance shares), after accounting for tax withholding. 
For the purpose of calculating compliance with the guidelines, unvested RSUs and unvested stock units are not taken 
into account, except in the case of RSUs after a participant is retirement-eligible (as defined in the applicable award 
agreement).

Clawback Policy
In 2017 a review of the companies’ Executive Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy (“Clawback Policy”) was 
conducted in comparison with prevalent market practices and recent legal developments. The prior policy, adopted in 
2010, focused on a restatement of financial results. In February 2018, the Compensation Committee approved changes 
to the Clawback Policy, broadening the scope of events to which recoupment applies, including events not predicated 
on a restatement. The policy now provides the Committee and Boards with the discretion to seek recoupment of 
payments made to a Section 16 Officer under the following circumstances:
•• if either company restates financial statements that were filed with the SEC for any of the past three completed 

fiscal years, or

•• if during any of the past three completed fiscal years a material miscalculation occurred with respect to the amount 

of any payment made to an individual who was a Section 16 Officer, or

•• if any individual in the past three fiscal years engaged in fraud or other intentional misconduct, and such fraud or 

intentional misconduct caused material financial or reputational harm to either company.

Compensation Risk Analysis

Pay Governance assists PG&E Corporation and the Utility with a review of the design of the companies’ incentive plans 
relative to general compensation plan risk factors (or the potential for unintended consequences). The companies 
reviewed the overall compensation pay structure, the overall mix of compensation vehicles, the structure of the 
incentive plans, other company pay plans, and governance for oversight of program design and administration. With 
respect to incentive plan structure, the companies specifically examined target and maximum compensation in each 
plan, the nature and mix of performance measures, the governance structure, the risk of earnings manipulation posed 
by the incentive structure, and the extent to which the NEO pay program rewards short-term decisions at the risk of 
long-term performance. The companies also generally considered other compensation policies (such as clawback 
and anti-hedging policies), other compensation plans relating to severance and change-in-control benefits, and 
compensation governance.
For 2017, Pay Governance concluded that there were no material issues regarding the companies’ executive pay 
programs, and that the design of the companies’ incentive pay plans has, overall, a low-risk profile.
To further ensure appropriate incentive metrics, the Compensation Committee also receives advice from the Safety 
and Nuclear Oversight Committees regarding appropriate safety and operational incentive measures.
Based on the foregoing, PG&E Corporation and the Utility concluded that the risks arising from the companies’ 
overall compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on either the 
Corporation or the Utility.

Tax Deductibility

In establishing compensation for 2017, the Committee appropriately weighed the tax-deductibility limitations imposed 
by Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Committee in its discretion awarded forms of compensation 
that are not intended to be deductible under Section 162(m) when it determined that such awards best carried out 
the goals and objectives of the companies’ officer compensation programs.

The Compensation Committee believes that these proportions of base salary relative to target short-term and long-
term incentives provide the right mix to attract, retain, and motivate officers with the necessary skills and experience 
for the development and successful operation of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s businesses. They also provide 
a direct connection between compensation and performance in both the achievement of key operating results and 
long-term shareholder value, as more fully described below.
A greater portion of the PG&E Corporation CEO’s 2017 target compensation is tied to the long-term performance of 
PG&E Corporation, which the Committee believes is appropriate given the CEO’s role.
Compensation paid to the NEOs was consistent with the types and forms of compensation provided during 2017 to 
all executive officers of the companies.

2018 Joint Proxy StatementCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Components of 2017 Officer Compensation – Cash

Base Salary
For NEO compensation, the base salary component falls within a range of 12 percent to 42 percent of target total 
compensation, depending on officer level.
This is consistent with the Compensation Committee’s objective of tying a significant portion of every NEO’s compensation 
directly to PG&E Corporation’s performance for shareholders through short-term and long-term incentives.
For 2017, the Committee approved a base salary increase budget of 3 percent. The comparative data indicated that 
the companies in the Pay Comparator Group expected to provide officers a 3 percent average salary increase in 2017.
In the case of NEOs, the base salary at PG&E Corporation and the Utility is generally within a range of between 15 
percent above and 15 percent below (the “15 percent band”) the median base salary of the appropriate benchmark 
position. The Committee believes that this level of comparability to the market is appropriate and consistent with its 
pay philosophy of taking into consideration factors other than market data in establishing individual pay levels, while 
delivering cash compensation that is competitive with market.

Short-Term Incentives
The STIP is an at-risk component of pay. NEOs and other eligible employees may earn annual performance-based 
cash incentive compensation under the STIP based on achievement of financial and operational goals approved by 
the Committee and an individual executive’s achievements for the year. The Committee retains complete discretion 
to determine and pay all STIP awards to NEOs and other eligible employees. This includes discretion to reduce the 
final score on any and all measures downward to zero.

2017 STIP Structure and Results
For 2017, the Committee adopted a STIP structure that continued PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s focus on 
improving public and employee safety and customer satisfaction. The weights of the components – Safety, Customer 
Satisfaction, and Financial – were unchanged from 2016 at 50 percent, 25 percent, and 25 percent, respectively.
The Safety component was structured to provide a strong focus on the safety of employees, customers, and communities. 
It was made up of four subcomponents: (1) Nuclear Operations Safety, (2) Electric Operations Safety, (3) Gas Operations 
Safety, and (4) Employee Safety. Two new safety measures were added for 2017 – Electric Overhead Conductor Index 
with a weight of 5 percent and Serious Injuries and Fatalities Corrective Action Index with a weight of 6 percent.
The Customer Satisfaction measures were designed to incent employees to be more responsive to customers’ needs.
As in prior years, corporate Financial performance was measured by PG&E Corporation’s actual earnings from 
operations compared to budget.
Each STIP measure has a threshold, target, and maximum level of performance used to arrive at a score ranging from 
zero to 2.0 for that measure. Performance below the minimum performance level, or threshold, results in a zero score. 
Performance at the threshold results in a STIP score of 0.5. Target performance results in a STIP score of 1.0, and 
performance at or above the maximum established level results in a score of 2.0. A score of 1.0 provides 100 percent of 
an executive’s target payout. Performance at the threshold and maximum levels delivers 50 percent and 200 percent 
of targeted payout, respectively. Linear interpolation is used to determine scores for performance between threshold 
and target, and between target and maximum.
The STIP overall performance score is the sum of the weighted cumulative average scores for performance on each 
of the STIP measures.
An NEO’s final STIP score also may be increased or decreased by an individual performance modifier, which can range 
from 0 percent to 150 percent. The individual performance modifier is determined by the Committee based upon the 
PG&E Corporation CEO’s assessment of an executive’s performance, or the applicable Board’s assessment in the case 
of the CEO’s or the Utility President’s performance, for the year.

System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI)—Total time that the average customer is without electric power 
during a given time period (measured in number of minutes).
Earnings from Operations (EFO)—PG&E Corporation’s actual earnings from operations, excluding items impacting 
comparability compared to budget. The measurement is non-GAAP. Please see Exhibit A for a reconciliation of PG&E 
Corporation’s earnings from operations to income available for common shareholders in accordance with GAAP.

Individual Awards Determination
STIP cash awards to NEOs are calculated as follows:
1.  Determine the executive’s individual participation rate, which is the NEO’s base salary earned during the year 

multiplied by the individual’s STIP target percentage.

2.  Calculate the overall enterprise-wide STIP performance score, which can range from 0 to 2.0 and is calculated 

based on final results compared to the threshold, target, and maximum of each weighted measure.

3.  Multiply the participation rate by the performance score to determine the 2017 calculated company award.
4.   Multiply the 2017 calculated company award by the NEO’s individual performance modifier.
5.  The Committee (and the independent members of the PG&E Corporation and Utility Boards of Directors in the 
case of the CEO and any President of the respective companies) approves all final awards and has discretion to 
adjust all STIP awards.

For 2017, the Committee approved NEO participation rates that ranged from 40 percent to 125 percent of base salary 
(the 125 percent participation rate applies only to the PG&E Corporation CEO). This range is within the 15 percent 
band of the Pay Comparator Group’s median annual incentive participation rates.
For 2017, STIP awards for the NEOs ranged from 0 percent to 150 percent of the 2017 calculated company award when 
adjusted for individual performance. The final awards for 2017 were paid to each of the NEOs in March 2018 and are 
reported in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 61.
Despite being eligible for awards based on company and individual performance, Ms. Williams (PG&E Corporation CEO 
and President), respectfully recommended that she and Mr. Wells (PG&E Corporation Senior Vice President and Chief 
Financial Officer) not accept 2017 STIP awards, feeling this action was necessary to demonstrate accountability and 
alignment with shareholder interests in view of recent stock performance and the dividend suspension. The Committee, 
the Boards, and Mr. Wells accepted her recommendation.

2018 STIP Structure
The Committee approved a STIP structure for 2018 that remains focused on improving public and employee safety 
and customer satisfaction. Component weightings remain unchanged from 2017, with achievement of safety goals at 
a 50 percent weighting, achievement of customer goals at a 25 percent weighting, and achievement of the corporate 
financial target at a 25 percent weighting. Three safety measures have been added for 2018: Public Safety Index (10 
percent weight), Asset Records Duration Index (10 percent weight), and Safe Driving Rate (5 percent weight). Five 
safety measures have been removed. The Electric Overhead Conductor Index (5 percent weight) was replaced by the 
new Public Safety Index. The Serious Preventable Motor Vehicle Incident Rate (6 percent weight) was replaced by 
Safe Driving Rate, a leading indicator. The measures for 911 Emergency Response (5 percent weight), Gas Emergency 
Response (5 percent weight), and Timely Reporting of Injuries (4 percent weight) were removed due to the achievement 
of long-term goals. The weighting of the Serious Injuries and Fatalities Corrective Action Index was increased to 10 
percent from 6 percent, and beginning in 2018 contractor SIFs will be included when calculating the Timely Completion 
of Corrective Actions measure score. The weighting of the Diablo Canyon Power Plant Reliability and Safety Indicator 
was decreased to 5 percent from 8 percent, and the weighting of the Gas In-Line Inspection and Upgrade Index was 
decreased to 5 percent from 6 percent. Regarding the customer component, a new measure – Customer Connection 
Cycle Time – replaces System Average Interruption Duration index with a 10 percent weight. The measures and related 
weightings are as follows:

In February 2017, the Compensation Committee (and the independent members of the PG&E Corporation Board in the 
case of Ms. Williams and Mr. Earley, and the independent members of the Utility Board in the case of Mr. Stavropoulos) 
approved annual LTIP awards for 2017, which were granted in May 2017.
Target annual LTIP award values for 2017 for the NEOs were determined based on competitive market data, internal 
equity considerations, and advice from Pay Governance. The annual LTIP awards for 2017 granted to the NEOs were 
comprised of 50 percent performance shares using a relative TSR measure, 10 percent performance shares using 
safety and financial measures based on grant date fair value, and 40 percent RSUs.
The Committee believes that this allocation of performance shares and RSUs for NEOs balances the interests of 
shareholders and officers by linking the value of all long-term compensation to stock price appreciation, and a significant 
portion of long-term compensation to relative TSR. Because performance shares and RSUs each vest over a three-year 
period and increase or decrease in value depending on the performance of PG&E Corporation common stock, these 
awards are at risk based on corporate performance, and align the interests of NEOs with performance for shareholders.
In February 2017, the Utility Board approved a $2,000,000 RSU award for Mr. Stavropoulos in connection with his 
promotion to Utility President and COO. In accordance with the PG&E Corporation Equity Grant Date Policy as in 
effect at that time, this award was granted on May 5, 2017. The award vests on May 5, 2019.
Additional details regarding RSUs and performance shares are provided below.

Performance Shares – TSR
Performance shares are hypothetical shares of PG&E Corporation common stock tied directly to PG&E Corporation’s 
performance for shareholders, and generally vest only at the end of a three-year performance period.
The number of performance shares with a TSR measure granted in May 2017 to each NEO was determined by multiplying 
the NEO’s actual annual LTIP award value for 2017 by 50 percent and dividing the result by the grant date fair value 
of a performance share as determined by a Monte Carlo simulation.
Performance shares with a TSR measure granted in May 2017 will vest, if at all, following completion of the three-year 
performance period starting January 1, 2017 and ending December 31, 2019 and upon certification of performance 
results by the Compensation Committee, which will occur no later than March 14, 2020. The payout value of any vested 
performance shares will be based on PG&E Corporation’s TSR relative to the 2017 Performance Comparator Group for 
the period. The payment for performance shares will be in the form of stock and will be calculated by multiplying (1) 
the number of vested performance shares by (2) a payout factor based on the Corporation’s relative TSR performance 
compared to the Performance Comparator Group.

As shown in the following 2017 Performance Share Payout Scale, payouts of performance shares are linked to PG&E

Interpolation will be used in the event that PG&E’s TSR performance does not fall directly on one of the listed 
performance percentiles.

Performance Shares – Safety and Financial
The number of performance shares with safety and financial measures granted in May 2017 to each NEO was determined 
by multiplying the NEO’s actual annual LTIP award value for 2017 by 10 percent and dividing the result by the closing 
price of a share of PG&E Corporation common stock on May 5, 2017.
Performance shares with safety and financial measures granted in May 2017 will vest, if at all, following completion of 
the three-year performance period starting January 1, 2017 and ending December 31, 2019 and upon certification of 
performance results by the Compensation Committee, which will occur no later than March 14, 2020. The measures 
were designed to provide a direct focus on long-term safety and financial goals. The payout value of any vested 
performance shares will be based on achievement of equally weighted safety and financial goals. The safety measure 
measures the number of repeat SIF actual or potential injury or near-hit events per 200,000 hours worked. The financial 
measure compares Earnings from Operations (EFO) per share in 2017, 2018, and 2019 to the mid-point of the guidance 
range for each year. In the event that guidance is not issued until after February of the target year, the target will be 
set based on the Board-approved EFO forecast for the year. Awards pay out at 25 percent for threshold (95 percent 
of mid-point) performance, 100 percent for target (mid-point) performance, and 200 percent for maximum (105 
percent of mid-point) performance. Interpolation will be used if results do not fall directly on the minimum, target, or 
maximum goal. The payment for performance shares will be in the form of stock and will be calculated by multiplying 
(1) the number of vested performance shares by (2) a payout factor based on achievement of performance goals.

Restricted Stock Units
RSUs are hypothetical shares of stock that are settled in an equal number of shares of PG&E Corporation common 
stock, and generally vest only if the officer remains employed over the vesting period. Because the value of RSUs 
varies with the price of PG&E Corporation common stock, RSUs align officers’ interests with those of shareholders (i.e., 
stock price appreciation and dividends). The multi-year vesting period also serves a retention purpose. The number 
of RSUs granted in May 2017 to each NEO was determined by multiplying the NEO’s actual annual LTIP award value 

54

2018 Joint Proxy StatementCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

for 2017 by 40 percent and dividing the result by the closing price of a share of PG&E Corporation common stock 
on May 5, 2017. Annual RSU awards granted in May 2017 will vest in three tranches, with one-third vesting on the first 
business day of March of each of the three years following the grant date. The $2,000,000 promotional RSU award 
granted to Mr. Stavropoulos on May 5, 2017 vests on May 5, 2019. 

Performance Shares Vested in 2017
The three-year performance cycle for annual performance share awards that were granted in 2014 under the 2006 LTIP 
ended on December 31, 2016. These awards vested on March 1, 2017, and payouts are reported in this Proxy Statement 
in the table entitled “Option Exercises and Stock Vested During 2017” on page 66.
For that performance period, PG&E Corporation’s TSR ranked 4th when compared to the 14 companies in the 2014 
Performance Comparator Group. This ranking resulted in a 160 percent payout with respect to the 2014 performance 
share awards. PG&E Corporation’s TSR performance for the three-year period was 67.5 percent, as compared to the 
median TSR of 59.9 percent among the 2014 Performance Comparator Group companies for the same period.

Performance Shares Vested in 2018
50 percent of awards granted under the LTIP in 2015 were allocated to performance shares using a relative TSR 
measure. The three-year performance cycle ended on December 31, 2017. These awards vested on February 20, 2018 
and any payouts for these awards are expected to be reflected in the 2019 proxy statement. For that period, PG&E 
Corporation’s TSR ranked 14th when compared to the 14 companies in the 2015 Performance Comparator Group. 
This ranking resulted in no payout with respect to the 2015 performance share awards using a TSR measure. PG&E 
Corporation’s TSR performance for the three-year period was 4.5 percent, as compared to the median TSR of 45.0 
percent among the 2015 Performance Comparator Group companies for the same period. For the purpose of the 
calculation, a 20-day average is used to determine the beginning and ending values.
10 percent of awards granted under the LTIP in 2015 were allocated to performance shares with the payout determined 
by measuring performance against equally weighted safety and affordability goals. Safety performance, as measured 
by the 2017 Lost Workday Case Rate was below the threshold target. Affordability, as measured by three-year efficiency 
gains versus a $100 million target, achieved a 0.301 score, with savings of $76.7 million which is slightly above the $75 
million threshold. The overall result was a 15.1 percent payout in 2018 for these performance shares.

2018 LTIP Structure
In February 2018, the Committee and the independent members of the PG&E Corporation and Utility Boards approved 
LTIP awards for 2018. The design and allocation were adjusted in recognition of the current challenging business 
environment. The allocation to performance shares with a TSR measure decreased to 20 percent from 50 percent. 
While it is important to retain this as a vehicle for shareholder alignment, the decrease in emphasis recognizes the 
uncertainty related to wildfire events that may persist longer than the three-year performance period and, as a result, 
the diminished retention value of such an award. The allocation to performance shares with a safety measure increased 
to 10 percent from 5 percent to reflect PG&E’s overall focus on safety. The safety measure continues to measure the 
effectiveness of corrective actions related to serious injuries and fatalities. The performance shares allocation to the 
financial metric measuring earnings from operations remains at 5 percent.
Non-qualified stock options were added with a 20 percent weight to the award mix to directly align compensation 
with shareholder value as reflected by PG&E Corporation’s common stock price and to recognize the longer-term 
view in light of the current business environment. The options vest over three years and have a maximum term of 10 
years. The allocation to RSUs, also a strong retention mechanism, increased to 45 percent from 40 percent.

2018 Joint Proxy StatementCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Equity Grant Dates
The PG&E Corporation Equity Grant Date Policy, as last amended in September 2017, generally provides that annual LTIP 
awards are granted once per year on March 1 (or if that day is not a business day, then on the following business day). 
The PG&E Corporation Board or the Compensation Committee may determine a different grant date if appropriate or 
necessary. The grant date for non-annual equity awards to employees (such as for newly hired or newly promoted officers 
or awards made for retention, recognition, or other purposes) is the later of (1) the date that the non-annual award is 
approved by the independent members of the PG&E Corporation or Utility Board, the Compensation Committee, or 
the PG&E Corporation CEO, as applicable, (2) the effective date of the LTIP award recipient’s employment, promotion, 
or recognition, or (3) the date otherwise specified by the applicable Board, the Committee, or the Corporation CEO. 
If the grant date of any non-annual LTIP award would occur during a trading blackout period, as defined under the 
PG&E Corporation Insider Trading Policy, then the actual grant date will be the first business day after the trading 
blackout period ends.

Other Elements of Executive Compensation

Perquisites and Related Compensation
NEOs generally receive a limited range of perquisite benefits, typically encompassing a partial subsidy for financial 
planning services from a third-party financial advisory firm, partial reimbursement of certain health club fees, on-site 
parking, and executive health services. The PG&E Corporation CEO, the PG&E Corporation Executive Chair of the 
Board, and the Utility President also may receive safety-and security-based car transportation services. The magnitude 
of these perquisites, including the lump-sum payment described in the following paragraph, is comparable to that 
provided to executive officers of companies in the Pay Comparator Group, and the value of these services is taxable 
to the recipient.
The Compensation Committee (and the independent members of the PG&E Corporation Board in the case of Ms. 
Williams and Mr. Earley, and the independent members of the Utility Board in the case of Mr. Stavropoulos) also 
approved a 2017 lump-sum annual stipend amount for each executive officer consistent with 2016, which ranged from 
$15,000 to $35,000 (the upper end applicable only to Ms. Williams and Mr. Earley). This stipend is provided in lieu of 
providing the NEOs with additional perquisite benefits. The NEOs have discretion to use this stipend as they see fit. 
This stipend is consistent with amounts paid historically.
The PG&E Corporation CEO and the Executive Chair of the Board are authorized to use private aircraft for business 
travel under appropriate circumstances. The Utility’s Corporate Aircraft Use policy prohibits use of Utility aircraft for 
personal travel.

Post-Retirement Benefits
NEOs are eligible to receive retirement benefits under the Utility’s tax-qualified defined benefit plan (Retirement Plan), 
which also provides benefits to other eligible employees of PG&E Corporation and the Utility. Retirement Plan benefits 
are in the form of either a final average pay pension benefit or a cash balance benefit. All NEOs except Mr. Thomason 
also are eligible to receive benefits under the PG&E Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”), 
which is a non-tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan that provides officers and key employees of the Corporation 
and its subsidiaries, including the Utility, with an additional pension benefit. These plans are described in the section 
entitled “Pension Benefits—2017” beginning on page 66.
In February 2010, the Committee adopted a policy against crediting additional years of service for participants in the 
SERP.
Effective January 1, 2013, SERP participation was closed to new participants. Individuals who did not participate in the 
SERP but who were newly hired or promoted to officer after January 1, 2013 are eligible for non-tax-qualified defined 
contribution pension payments under the 2013 PG&E Corporation Defined Contribution Executive Supplemental 
Retirement Plan (“DC-ESRP”). Mr. Thomason is the only NEO who participates in the DC-ESRP. The DC-ESRP is 
described in more detail in the section entitled “Non-qualified Deferred Compensation – 2017” beginning on page 68.
NEOs and other officers and employees also are eligible to participate in the PG&E Corporation Retirement Savings 
Plan (“RSP”), a tax-qualified 401(k) plan. PG&E Corporation provides a maximum matching contribution of 75 cents 
for each dollar contributed, up to 6 percent of base salary for individuals eligible for the final average pay pension 
benefit and up to 8 percent of base salary for individuals eligible for a cash balance pension benefit. To the extent 
that the Internal Revenue Code limits prevent an NEO from making contributions to his or her RSP account and, as a 
result, company matching funds are not contributed to that NEO’s RSP account, the matching funds will instead be 
contributed to the NEO’s account in the PG&E Corporation 2005 Supplemental Retirement Savings Plan (“SRSP”), a 
non-qualified deferred compensation plan.

56

2018 Joint Proxy StatementCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Upon retirement, NEOs also may be eligible for post-retirement health, welfare, insurance, and similar benefits, pursuant 
to plans that generally provide benefits to all employees. Additional details regarding the retirement programs and 
post-retirement benefits, and the value of pension benefits accumulated as of December 31, 2017 for the NEOs, can be 
found in the table entitled “Pension Benefits—2017” beginning on page 66, the table entitled “Non-qualified Deferred 
Compensation – 2017” beginning on page 68, and the section entitled “Potential Payments—Resignation/Retirement” 
on page 72.
The majority of companies in the 2017 Pay Comparator Group provide tax-qualified pensions or similar plans, other tax-
qualified defined contribution plans (i.e., 401(k) plans), and non-tax-qualified retirement plans for NEOs. The Committee 
believes that these defined benefit and defined contribution plans offer significant recruiting and retention incentives.

Officer Severance Program
General severance benefits are provided to NEOs through the 2012 PG&E Corporation Officer Severance Policy (“Officer 
Severance Policy”) and specific LTIP award agreements and guidelines. Upon termination by either company (other 
than for cause), NEOs may be eligible for cash severance payments, continued or accelerated vesting for LTIP awards, 
and other post-employment benefits. If an NEO is terminated for cause (i.e., for dishonesty, a criminal offense, or 
violation of a work rule) or resigns before becoming retirement-eligible, the NEO forfeits any unvested performance 
shares and RSUs, and would not receive any associated dividends.

Officer Severance Policy
The purpose of the Officer Severance Policy is to (1) attract and retain senior management by providing severance 
benefits that are part of a competitive total compensation package, (2) provide consistent treatment for all terminated 
officers, and (3) minimize potential litigation costs in connection with terminations of employment by conditioning 
payments upon a general release of claims.
The Officer Severance Policy, in combination with LTIP award agreements generally provides the following benefits 
upon termination without cause:
•• Cash severance of one year’s salary and target STIP bonus.

•• Pro-rata vesting of performance shares.

•• Continued vesting of unvested RSUs for one year.

•• Limited COBRA benefits and outplacement services.

Additional details regarding severance benefits can be found in the section entitled “Potential Payments—Termination 
Without Cause” beginning on page 74.

Change in Control
Providing change-in-control severance benefits is a key part of the companies’ officer compensation program. In a 
hostile takeover or other change-in-control situation, it is important for management to remain focused on maximizing 
shareholder value and aligning management’s interests with shareholders’ interests, and not to be distracted by 
concerns about job security.
Change-in-control benefits require a “double trigger” and are not payable based on a change-in-control event alone, 
as described below. The Compensation Committee believes that the “double trigger” requirement aligns our change-
in-control benefits with shareholder interests and reflects current market practices.
The Officer Severance Policy provides enhanced cash severance benefits if the officer’s employment is terminated 
(including constructive termination by the officer for good reason) in connection with a Change in Control (as defined 
in the Policy). These enhanced benefits replace general severance benefits and are available only to officers in bands 1 
or 2, which, as of December 31, 2017, include Ms. Williams and Messrs. Stavropoulos, Wells, and Simon. These covered 
officers are eligible to receive (1) change-in-control cash severance benefits equal to two times the sum of base salary 
and target annual STIP bonus, and (2) prorated STIP bonus for the year of termination. Mr. Earley waived his rights 
under the Officer Severance Policy in return for reasonable costs for relocation to Detroit, Michigan upon separation 
from employment. Other NEOs receive general severance benefits only.
All LTIP award agreements contain the same change-in-control provisions, which accelerate vesting of all awards if there 
is a Change in Control, and either the award is not continued, assumed, or substituted, or the recipient’s employment is 
terminated in connection with a Change in Control. This practice aligns PG&E Corporation and the Utility with market 
practices and (1) better balances the interests of award recipients and shareholders, (2) provides security for award 
recipients in a time of uncertainty, and (3) preserves the incentive for award recipients to stay with the Corporation 
or the Utility even following a transaction.

57

2018 Joint Proxy StatementCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

The Golden Parachute Restriction Policy requires shareholder approval of certain executive severance payments (as 
defined in the Golden Parachute Restriction Policy) provided in connection with a change in control of PG&E Corporation, 
to the extent that those payments exceed 2.99 times the sum of a covered officer’s base salary and target STIP award.
Additional details regarding Change-in-Control benefits can be found in the section entitled “Potential Payments—
Severance in Connection with Change in Control” beginning on page 74.

5.  COMMITTEE CONCLUSION

The Compensation Committee believes that the amount and design of executive compensation provided for 2017 
to the NEOs of PG&E Corporation and the Utility are consistent with the Committee’s compensation objectives and 
policies to (1) provide long-term incentives to align shareholders’ and officers’ interests and enhance total return 
for shareholders, (2) attract, retain, and motivate officers with the necessary mix of skills and experience for the 
development and successful operation of the Corporation’s and the Utility’s businesses, and (3) compensate NEOs in 
a competitive, cost-efficient, and transparent manner.

(8)  During 2017, consistent with the CPUC decision adopted on January 11, 2018 in connection with the retirement of the Diablo Canyon 
Power Plant, the Utility recorded a disallowance of $47 million (before the tax impact of $15 million) comprised of cancelled projects

$9 million).

(9)  During 2017, as a result of the CPUC’s final phase two decision in the GT&S rate case, the Utility recorded revenues of $150 million 
(before the tax impact of $62 million) in excess of the 2017 authorized revenue requirement, which includes the final component of 
under-collected revenues retroactive to January 1, 2015.

(10)  During 2017, PG&E Corporation recorded proceeds from insurance, net of plaintiff payments, of $65 million (before the tax impact of 
$27 million) associated with the settlement agreement in connection with the shareholder derivative litigation that was approved by 
the court on July 18, 2017. This includes $90 million (before the tax impact of $37 million) for insurance recoveries partially offset by 
$25 million (before the tax impact of $10 million) for plaintiff legal fees paid in connection with the settlement.

(11)  “Earnings from operations” is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated as income available for common shareholders less items 
impacting comparability as described in Note (1) above. PG&E Corporation uses earnings from operations to understand and compare 
operating results across reporting periods for various purposes, including internal budgeting and forecasting, short- and long-term 
operating plans, and employee incentive compensation.

2018 Joint Proxy StatementEXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION INFORMATION

SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE – 2017 (Continued)

Includes payments for accrued vacation.

(1) 
(2)  Represents the grant date fair value of performance shares and RSUs measured in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, without 
taking into account an estimate of forfeitures related to service-based vesting. For performance shares using safety and affordability 
measures, and for RSUs, grant date fair value is measured using the closing price of PG&E Corporation common stock on the grant 
date. Assumptions made in valuation of reported performance shares with a relative TSR measure are described in footnote 4 to the 
table entitled “Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2017.” Assuming that the highest level of performance conditions would be achieved, 
the estimated maximum grant date value of performance shares granted in 2017 would be: Ms. Williams $7,089,030, Mr. Stavropoulos 
$2,454,027, Mr. Wells $2,181,251, Mr. Thomason $327,250, Mr. Simon $2,181,251, Mr. Mistry $872,667, Ms. Austin $927,135, Mr. Earley 
$3,271,944, and Mr. Park $1,090,693.

(3)  Amounts represent payments received or deferred in 2018, 2017, and 2016 for achievement of corporate and organizational objectives 

in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, under the STIP.

(4)  Amounts reported for 2017 consist of (i) the change in pension value during 2017 (Ms. Williams $996,603, Mr. Stavropoulos $537,191, 
Mr.  Wells  $462,213,  Mr.  Thomason  $170,516,  Mr.  Simon  $544,753,  Mr.  Mistry  $730,437,  Ms.  Austin  $309,101,  Mr.  Earley  $871,444, 
and  Mr.  Park  $493,129),  and  (ii)  the  above-market  earnings  on  compensation  deferred  into  the  PG&E  Corporation  Supplemental 
Retirement Savings Plan and invested in the AA Utility Bond Fund (Ms. Williams $207, Mr. Stavropoulos $1,502, Mr. Simon $4,676,  
Mr. Mistry $4, and Mr. Park $388). The AA Utility Bond Fund accrues interest based on the long-term corporate bond yield average 
for AA utilities reported by Moody’s Investors Service. The above-market earnings are calculated as the difference between actual 
earnings from the AA Utility Bond Fund investment option and hypothetical earnings that would have resulted using an interest rate

Table in the “Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation” column. Threshold represents a 0.5 enterprise-wide STIP performance score

(2)  Represents performance shares granted under the 2014 LTIP.
(3)  Represents RSUs granted under the 2014 LTIP.
(4)  For performance shares with a relative TSR measure, the grant date fair value is based on the probable outcome of the applicable 
performance conditions, measured using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model. The assumed per-share value for the May 5, 2017 
annual awards was $79.38. The simulation model applies a risk-free interest rate and an expected volatility assumption. The risk-free 
rate is assumed to equal the yield on a three-year Treasury bond on the grant date. Volatility is based on historical volatility for the 
36-month period preceding the grant date.

Detailed information regarding compensation reported in the tables entitled “Summary Compensation Table—2017” 
and “Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2017,” including the relative amounts apportioned to different elements of 
compensation, can be found in the CD&A. Information regarding specific grants and arrangements is provided below.

GRANTS OF PLAN-BASED AWARDS IN 2017 (Continued)
STIP Awards
Information regarding the terms and basis of STIP awards can be found in the CD&A.

Performance Shares
Annual performance shares granted in 2017 will vest, if at all, at the end of a three-year period. Upon vesting, performance 
shares are settled in shares of PG&E Corporation common stock, net of the number of shares having a value equal to 
required withholding taxes. For performance shares using a relative TSR measure, the number of shares issued will 
depend on PG&E Corporation’s TSR relative to the 2017 Performance Comparator Group for the three-year performance 
period. For performance shares with safety and financial measures, the number of shares issued will depend on 
achievement of equally weighted safety and financial goals. The specific payout formulas are discussed in the CD&A.
Each time that a cash dividend is paid on PG&E Corporation common stock, an amount equal to the cash dividend 
per share multiplied by the number of performance shares granted to the recipient will be accrued on behalf of the 
recipient. At the end of the vesting period, the amount of accrued dividend equivalents will be increased or decreased 
by the same payout factor used to increase or decrease the number of vested performance shares for the period.

Restricted Stock Units
Annual RSU awards granted in May 2017 will vest in three tranches, with one-third vesting on the first business day 
of March of each of the three years following the grant date. The $2,000,000 promotional RSU award granted to Mr. 
Stavropoulos on May 5, 2017 vests on May 5, 2019. Upon vesting, RSUs are settled in an equivalent number of shares 
of PG&E Corporation common stock, net of the number of shares having a value equal to required withholding taxes.
Each time that a cash dividend is paid on PG&E Corporation common stock, an amount equal to the cash dividend 
per share multiplied by the number of outstanding RSUs granted to the recipient will be accrued on behalf of the 
recipient. Accrued dividends are paid in cash at the time that the related RSUs are settled.

assuming that the NEOs retire at the earliest unreduced retirement age, using mortality and interest assumptions 
consistent with those used in preparing PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial statements. The RP-2014 
“Employees” mortality table was used without collar or amount adjustments (adjusted to 2011 using a variation of 
MP-2014). Rates were projected on a generational basis from 2011 using a variation of MP-2014. Interest discount rates 
of 3.64 percent and 3.61 percent were used for the Pacific Gas and Electric Company Retirement Plan (“Retirement 
Plan”) and the PG&E Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”), respectively.

The pension benefits described in the above table are provided to officers under two plans.

The Utility provides retirement benefits to all of its employees, including its officers, under the Retirement Plan, which is 
a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. The Retirement Plan historically also has provided benefits to a significant 
number of PG&E Corporation’s employees and officers. As of April 1, 2007, all PG&E Corporation employees and officers 
are eligible to participate in the Retirement Plan.

With respect to the Retirement Plan’s final pay benefit formula, a participating officer may begin receiving tax-qualified 
pension benefits at age 55, but benefits will be reduced unless the individual has at least 35 years of service. At age 
65, a participant becomes eligible for an unreduced pension, irrespective of the years of service. Between age 55 and 
age 65, any pension benefit may be reduced based on the number of years of service, and in accordance with the 
Retirement Plan’s early retirement reduction factors. The benefit formula is 1.7 percent of the average annual salary 
for the last 36 months of service multiplied by years of credited service. The default form of benefit is a single-life 
annuity for participants who are unmarried at retirement or a 50 percent joint spousal annuity for married participants. 
However, other types of joint pensions are available, and participants may designate non-spousal joint pensioners 
(subject to spousal consent).

Effective January 1, 2013, a cash balance benefit was added to the Retirement Plan. Employees hired or re-hired on 
or after January 1, 2013 participate in the cash balance benefit. Employees hired before January 1, 2013 were given a 
one-time opportunity during 2013 to irrevocably select to switch to the cash balance benefit on a going-forward basis, 
effective January 1, 2014, or to retain the final pay benefit to which they were otherwise entitled. On the last day of each 
year (or on the date of benefit commencement, if earlier), an employee’s cash balance account is credited with pay 
credits based on a point system of age plus service and eligible pay during the year. At the end of each calendar quarter, 
the account is credited with interest credits, based on an average of the 30-year Treasury rates for the three months 
before the calendar quarter. Special interest credit rules apply in the quarter in which benefit payment commences. 
The default forms of payment are similar to those under the final pay benefit formula. Additionally, however, a cash 
balance participant may elect a lump-sum payout that is eligible for rollover into an Individual Retirement Account or 
other tax-advantaged employer plan. Cash balance participants may elect to receive their vested benefit when they 
leave employment with any participating employer, regardless of whether they have attained age 55. No current NEOs 
elected to switch to the cash balance benefit.

PG&E Corporation’s non-qualified SERP provides benefits to certain officers and key employees. The SERP benefit 
formula is 1.7 percent of the average of the three highest combined salary and annual STIP payments during the last 
10 years of service, multiplied by years of credited service. Payments are in the form of a single-life annuity or, at the 
election of the officer, a joint spousal annuity. Normal retirement age is 65. Benefits may begin earlier, on the later 
of the NEO’s reaching age 55 or separation from the company, subject to reduction depending on years of credited 
service, in accordance with the Retirement Plan’s early retirement reduction factors.

Effective January 1, 2013, SERP participation was closed to new participants. Individuals who do not participate in the 
SERP but who are newly hired or promoted to officer after January 1, 2013 may be eligible to participate in the 2013 
PG&E Corporation Defined Contribution Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan (“DC-ESRP”), a non-tax-qualified 
deferred compensation plan. Mr. Thomason is the only NEO who participates in the DC-ESRP. See the table entitled 
“Non-qualified Deferred Compensation—2017” beginning on page 68 and the accompanying narrative for additional 
DC-ESRP details.

At December 31, 2017, Ms. Williams, Mr. Stavropoulos, Mr. Mistry, and Ms. Austin were eligible for early retirement under 
the Retirement Plan and the SERP. If Ms. Williams, Mr. Stavropoulos, Mr. Mistry, and Ms. Austin had retired on December 31, 
2017, their benefits would have been subject to early retirement reductions of 25.75 percent, 15.75 percent, 22.67 percent 
and 26.25 percent, respectively. Mr. Park’s benefits under both plans were subject to a 27.00 percent reduction when 
his employment ended. Mr. Earley was eligible for unreduced benefits when his employment ended.

The table presents balances from both the PG&E Corporation Supplemental Retirement Savings Plan for deferrals 
made prior to January 1, 2005 and the PG&E Corporation 2005 Supplemental Retirement Savings Plan (together, the 
“SRSP Plans”) for deferrals made on and after January 1, 2005 and from the PG&E Corporation Defined Contribution 
Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan (“DC-ESRP”).

Under the SRSP Plans, officers may defer 5 percent to 75 percent of their base salary, and all or part of their perquisite 
allowance, STIP payment, and performance share award if settled in cash.

PG&E Corporation also will contribute an amount equal to any employer contributions due under the 401(k) plan that 
were not made due to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Sections 401(m), 401(a)(17), or 415. Under the SRSP 
Plans, officers may elect deferrals to be distributed in 1 to 10 installments commencing in January of the year following 
termination of employment. For deferrals made in 2005 and thereafter, distributions may commence seven months 
after termination of employment or in January of a year specified by the officer. Earlier distributions may be made in 
the case of an officer’s death. The plan administrator may, in its discretion, permit earlier withdrawals as requested by 
participants to meet unforeseen emergencies.

Under the DC-ESRP, each time salary or STIP is paid, PG&E Corporation credits the participant’s account with an 
amount equal to 7 percent of the payment. Benefits vest after three years of cumulative service with the companies, and 
benefits are paid in a single lump sum upon the officer’s separation from service commencing as soon as reasonably 
practicable, following a date seven months after the separation from service. Officers may also elect deferrals to be 
distributed in 2 to 10 equal annual installments. Earlier distributions may be made in the case of an officer’s death.

Earnings on amounts in participant accounts under the SRSP Plans and the DC-ESRP are calculated based on the 
performance of the following funds available in the 401(k) plan: Large Company Stock Index Fund (2017 return of 21.8 
percent), Small Company Stock Index Fund (2017 return of 18.1 percent), International Stock Index Fund (2017 return 
of 24.6 percent), Total U.S. Stock Index Fund (2017 return of 21.1 percent), Emerging Markets Enhanced Index Fund 
(2017 return of 34.5 percent), World Stock Index Fund (2017 return of 24.3 percent), Bond Index Fund (2017 return of 
3.5 percent), U.S. Government Bond Index Fund (2017 return of 2.2 percent), Short Term Bond Index Fund (2017 return 
of 0.8 percent), Money Market Investment Fund (2017 return of 0.8 percent), Target Date Fund 2015 (2017 return of 
9.9 percent), Target Date Fund 2020 (2017 return of 13.1 percent), Target Date Fund 2025 (2017 return of 16.3 percent), 
Target Date Fund 2030 (2017 return of 18.0 percent), Target Date Fund 2035 (2017 return of 19.4 percent), Target 
Date Fund 2040 (2017 return of 20.4 percent), Target Date Fund 2045 (2017 return of 21.3 percent), Target Date Fund

2050 (2017 return of 21.3 percent), Target Date Fund 2055 (2017 return of 21.2 percent), Target Date Fund 2060 (2017 
return of 20.8 percent), and Retirement Income Fund (2017 return of 8.3 percent). Other available measures are the 
PG&E Corporation Phantom Stock Fund, which mirrors an investment in PG&E Corporation common stock (2017 
return of negative 24.0 percent), and the AA Utility Bond Fund. The AA Utility Bond Fund accrues interest based on 
the long-term corporate bond yield average for AA utilities reported by Moody’s Investors Service (yields reported 
during 2017 ranged from 3.7 percent to 4.1 percent). Pre-2005 deferrals under the SRSP Plans are limited to the Large 
Company Stock Index Fund, the PG&E Corporation Phantom Stock Fund, and the AA Utility Bond Fund. In general, the 
earnings measures are selected by the officer and may be reallocated subject to restrictions imposed by regulations 
of the SEC. However, deferrals of Special Incentive Stock Ownership Premiums received under the prior Executive 
Stock Ownership Program before December 31, 2012 only may be invested in the PG&E Corporation Phantom Stock 
Fund and may not be reallocated.

The NEOs are eligible to receive certain benefits upon termination, or when a Change in Control (as defined in the Officer 
Severance Policy) occurs and either (1) the officer’s employment is terminated (including constructive termination by 
the officer for good reason) in connection with the Change in Control, or (2) the acquiring company does not continue 
or assume outstanding LTIP awards, or substitute the LTIP awards with substantially equivalent awards.

The following table estimates potential payments for each NEO as if, effective December 31, 2017, that individual’s 
employment was terminated or an acquiror did not assume, continue, or grant substitute awards for LTIP awards 
previously granted by PG&E Corporation or the Utility. Estimates assume that the value of any stock-based compensation 
received was $44.83 per share, which was the closing price of PG&E Corporation common stock on December 31, 
2017. The table generally excludes (1) payments for services already rendered (such as unpaid and earned salary), 
which would be due to the NEO even if the individual had remained employed with the companies, (2) post-retirement 
benefits that would be available to employees generally, and (3) any deferred compensation that was previously 
earned but would become payable due to the termination (these deferred amounts are reflected in the table entitled 
“Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation—2017”).

The value of actual cash and equity received on or shortly after December 31, 2017 would be less than the “total” 
amount listed below because (1) pension benefits are paid over time in the form of a life annuity, and (2) stock awards 
reflected in the table will be payable only after vesting, which may occur in subsequent years.

Since Mr. Earley retired on December 15, 2017, only payments that he received upon retirement are shown. Since 
Mr. Park’s employment was terminated without cause on September 1, 2017, only payments that he received upon 
such termination are shown.

(1)  Payments made in connection with a Change in Control may require shareholder approval, pursuant to the PG&E Corporation 
Golden Parachute Restriction Policy, discussed below. If excise taxes are levied in connection with Internal Revenue Code 
Section 4999, the aggregate benefits shown may be reduced to a level that does not trigger the excise tax, but only if doing 
so would be more beneficial to the officer on an after-tax basis.

(2)  For  pension  payments,  the  number  reflects  the  value  of  aggregated  benefits  upon  termination  due  to  death.  Pension 

payments upon termination due to disability would be the same as in the event of resignation.

(3)  Reflects the value of outstanding equity awards for which vesting is continued or accelerated due to the termination event. 
Based on performance through December 31, 2017, no payments would be made with respect to outstanding performance 
shares using a TSR measure. Payments would be made with respect to 15.1 percent of outstanding performance shares 
granted in 2015 using safety and affordability measures. Outstanding performance shares granted in 2016 and 2017 using 
safety, affordability, and financial measures are included assuming a 100 percent payout.

(4)  Assumes an overall STIP performance score of 1.0.
(5)  Lump-sum cash payment equal to the present value of a post-retirement life insurance policy with coverage equal to the 

NEO’s last 12 months of salary.

(6)  Mr.  Earley  waived  his  rights  under  the  Officer  Severance  Policy  in  return  for  reasonable  costs  for  relocation  to  Detroit,

Pension Benefits in General

If any NEO is terminated for any reason, that officer generally is entitled to receive accrued and vested pension benefits, 
as described in the narrative accompanying the “Pension Benefits—2017” table. The value of the pension benefit will 
be paid out over time in the form of an annuity, consistent with payment elections made by the NEO. The qualified 
plan is funded by contributions from both PG&E Corporation and the Utility. Payments from the non-qualified plan 
are paid by PG&E Corporation and are reduced by any benefit payable from the qualified plan.

The value of pension benefits reported in the table above is identical in all termination scenarios, except if an NEO’s 
employment is terminated due to that officer’s death. In that case, if (1) the officer was at least 55 years of age, or 
(2) the combined total of his or her age and the number of years worked exceeded 70, then the officer’s surviving 
spouse or beneficiary would be entitled to an immediate commencement of payment of 50 percent of the single-life 
pension benefit that would otherwise have been available to the officer at age 65. For all other officers, the value of 
this pre-retirement survivor’s benefit would be 50 percent of the single life pension benefit that would otherwise have 
been available to the officer at age 55, and the benefit would commence in the month that starts the day after that 
officer would have reached age 55.

Officer Severance Policy

The Officer Severance Policy provides for severance payments and the treatment of certain LTIP awards upon termination 
with cause, termination without cause, and termination in connection with a Change in Control (unless such benefits 
have been waived). Benefits under the Officer Severance Policy are paid by the individual’s former employer.

Mr. Earley generally waived his rights under the Officer Severance Policy.

Potential Payments – Resignation/Retirement

Ltip awards
Unvested performance shares and RSUs generally are cancelled upon resignation, unless that individual’s resignation 
qualifies as a “retirement.” For these purposes, “retirement” for the NEOs means a termination of employment, other 
than for cause, when an employee is at least 55 years old and has been employed for at least the last five consecutive 
years immediately before termination. If the individual “retires,” then:

•• Unvested performance shares continue to vest and will become payable as if the officer remained employed,
•• Unvested annual RSU awards continue to vest and will become payable as if the officer remained employed (unless 
retirement occurs within two years following a Change in Control, in which case shares underlying the RSUs vest 
and are paid out within 60 days following the retirement).

With respect to the RSUs granted to Ms. Williams and Mr. Stavropoulos in August 2015 and to Mr. Mistry in February 
2016, and the RSUs granted as a promotional award to Mr. Stavropoulos in May 2017, the retirement provision does 
not apply and any unvested RSUs would be cancelled upon resignation.

Ms. Williams, Mr. Stavropoulos, Mr. Mistry, and Ms. Austin were the only NEOs who were retirement-eligible under the 
LTIP as of December 31, 2017. Mr. Earley and Mr. Park were retirement-eligible at the time their employment ended.

stip
If an NEO resigns or retires on or after December 31 of a performance year, that officer will be entitled to receive a 
lump-sum STIP payment for that calendar year.

If an NEO resigns prior to December 31 of any calendar year, potential STIP payments for that year generally are 
forfeited. However, if the NEO is at least 55 years of age at the time of resignation, then potential STIP payments will 
be treated in the same manner as for a “retirement.”

If an NEO retires before December 31 of any calendar year, then the Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, 
approve providing the retired NEO with a lump-sum STIP payment for that calendar year. Any such STIP payment 
generally would reflect actual earnings, and thus be prorated to reflect the amount of time that the retired NEO was 
employed during the performance period.

Any STIP payment generally would reflect the STIP performance score applicable to active employees, and would be 
paid by the former employer at the same time as for active employees.

post-retirement Life insurance Benefits
Upon retirement (as defined under the qualified pension plan), all employees of PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and 
certain subsidiaries are eligible to receive a life insurance coverage benefit under the Post-Retirement Life Insurance 
Plan of Pacific Gas and Electric Company. If an employee retires at age 55 or older with at least 15 years of service 
(“qualifying retirement”) with the companies and their respective subsidiaries, the employee may qualify for a different 
“benefit level” and the value of the benefit may increase. Each retiree’s applicable “benefit level” is determined based 
on factors such as the participant’s position with the company at retirement and the date of hire or promotion. Prior 
to December 31, 2008, upon qualifying retirement, certain benefit levels also permitted the retiree to elect to receive 
the benefit in the form of a lump-sum cash payment equal to the present value of the insurance coverage benefit. 
Participants no longer may elect the cash payment upon retirement, but certain individuals who were employees as 
of December 31, 2008 and who were likely upon retirement to qualify for the benefit levels that previously offered 
the cash alternative were given the opportunity to make a one-time election as to whether to receive future benefits 
(if any) as insurance coverage or in the form of a lump-sum cash payment. Benefits are paid by the former employer.

Upon qualifying retirement, Ms. Williams, Mr. Simon, and Mr. Mistry would receive a lump-sum cash benefit equal to the 
present value of a post-retirement life insurance policy with coverage equal to his or her last 12 months of salary. Upon 
qualifying for retirement, all other NEOs would be entitled to receive a life insurance benefit in the amount of $50,000.

Mr. Mistry would have been eligible for such life insurance-related benefits if he had retired on December 31, 2017.

Potential Payments – Termination for Cause

If an officer is terminated for cause, all outstanding performance shares and RSUs are cancelled, no severance payment 
is available, and the officer is not eligible to receive a STIP payment for that year.

As provided in the Officer Severance Policy, in general, an officer is terminated “for cause” if the employer determines 
in good faith that the officer has engaged in, committed, or is responsible for:

•• Serious misconduct, gross negligence, theft, or fraud against PG&E Corporation and/or the officer’s employer,
•• Refusal or unwillingness to perform his or her duties,
•• Inappropriate conduct in violation of the Corporation’s equal employment opportunity policy, 
•• Conduct that reflects adversely upon, or making any remarks disparaging of, the Corporation, its Board, officers, 

or employees, or its affiliates or subsidiaries,

•• Insubordination,
•• Any willful act that is likely to injure the reputation, business, or business relationship of the Corporation or its 

subsidiaries or affiliates, or

•• Violation of any fiduciary duty, or breach of any duty of loyalty.

With respect to vesting of LTIP awards, “cause” generally is determined in the sole discretion of PG&E Corporation, 
and typically includes dishonesty, a criminal offense, or violation of a work rule. For Mr. Earley’s LTIP awards, “cause” 
is specifically defined in the same manner as in the Officer Severance Policy.

Potential Payments – Termination Without Cause

Ltip awards
Termination provisions are described in the Officer Severance Policy and LTIP award agreements.

•• Unvested performance shares generally vest based on actual performance proportionately based on the number of 
months during the performance period that the officer was employed divided by 36 months. Any vested performance 
shares are settled, if at all, at the end of the applicable performance period.

•• Unvested RSUs generally continue to vest for 12 months.

However, if the officer is at least 55 years of age with at least five years of service, his or her termination without cause is 
treated as a retirement under the terms of the LTIP. (Please see the section entitled “Potential Payments—Resignation/ 
Retirement” for a discussion of vesting provisions.) Ms. Williams, Mr. Stavropoulos, Mr. Mistry, and Ms. Austin were 
the only NEOs who were retirement-eligible under the LTIP as of December 31, 2017. Mr. Earley and Mr. Park  
were retirement-eligible at the time their employment ended.

severance payment
All NEOs, except Mr. Earley, would be entitled to a lump-sum payment of one times annual base salary and STIP target. 
Mr. Earley waived his rights to cash severance payments.

stip
If an officer is terminated without cause before December 31 of a given year and has at least six months of service in 
that year, the officer is eligible to receive a prorated lump-sum STIP award for that year. Such STIP payment generally 
would reflect the STIP performance score applicable to active employees, and would be prorated to reflect the amount 
of time that the officer was employed during the performance period. Payments would be paid by the former employer 
and at the same time as for active employees.

miscellaneous Benefits
The officer is entitled to receive a lump-sum cash payment equal to the estimated value of 18 months of COBRA 
premiums, based on the officer’s benefit levels at the time of termination (with such payment subject to taxation under 
applicable law), and career transition services. Mr. Earley waived his rights to these benefits.

covenants
In consideration for severance benefits other than those relating to LTIP awards, (1) the officer agrees not to divulge 
any confidential or privileged information obtained during his or her employment, unless required or permitted by law, 
(2) during a period of 12 months following severance, the officer agrees to a covenant to, among other things, refrain 
from soliciting customers and employees, (3) the officer agrees to assist in legal proceedings as reasonably required 
during this period, (4) the officer must sign a release of claims, and (5) the officer must agree not to compete with 
the companies to the extent permitted by law. 

Potential Payments – Severance in Connection with Change in Control

Change-in-Control benefits require a “double trigger” and are not payable based on a Change-in-Control event alone. 
Benefits in connection with a Change in Control are provided by the Officer Severance Policy, the LTIPs, and related 
LTIP award agreements and guidelines. Benefits may be limited by the PG&E Corporation Golden Parachute Restriction 
Policy, which is discussed further below.

Definition of change in control
A Change in Control occurs upon any of the following events:

1.  Any person or entity (excluding employee benefit plans or a plan fiduciary) becomes the direct or indirect owner 

of more than 30 percent of PG&E Corporation’s outstanding common stock.

2.  Over any two-year period, a majority of the PG&E Corporation directors in office at the beginning of the period  
are no longer in office (unless each new director was elected or nominated for shareholder election by at least  
two-thirds of the remaining active directors who also were in office at the beginning of the period or who were 
elected or nominated by at least two-thirds of the active directors at the time of election or nomination).

3. Following any shareholder-approved consolidation or merger of PG&E Corporation, the former Corporation 
shareholders own less than 70 percent of the voting power in the surviving entity (or parent of the surviving entity).
4. (a)  Consummation of the sale, lease, exchange, or other transfer of all or substantially all of PG&E Corporation’s 

assets, or 

 

(b) shareholder approval of a plan of liquidation or dissolution of PG&E Corporation.

Ltip awards
Following a Change in Control, LTIP awards generally accelerate or automatically vest if either (a) the successor 
company fails to assume, continue, or substitute previously granted awards in a manner that preserves the value of those 
awards, or (b) the award recipient is terminated (including constructive termination) in connection with a Change in 
Control during a set period of time before or after the Change in Control. Specific acceleration, vesting, and settlement 
provisions are as follows (subject to any delays necessary to comply with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A):

severance payment
The Officer Severance Policy provides enhanced Change-in-Control severance benefits to “covered officers” who 
are in officer compensation bands 1 or 2. Such covered officers include Ms. Williams, Mr. Stavropoulos, Mr. Wells, and 
Mr. Simon. Mr. Earley waived his rights to Change-in-Control severance benefits under the Officer Severance Policy. 
Mr. Park was a covered officer prior to the end of his employment. If Mr. Thomason, Mr. Mistry, or Ms. Austin had been 
terminated in connection with a Change in Control as of December 31, 2017, each would have been eligible for standard 
severance benefits, as discussed in the section entitled “Potential Payments—Termination Without Cause.”

If a covered officer is terminated without cause or is constructively terminated in connection with a Change in Control 
(which includes termination prior to a Potential Change in Control, as defined in the Officer Severance Policy), the 
officer generally would be eligible for a lump-sum payment equal to the total of:

1.  Unpaid base salary earned through the termination date,
2.  Any accrued but unpaid vacation pay, and
3.  Two times the sum of (a) target STIP for the fiscal year in which termination occurs, and (b) the officer’s annual base 

salary in effect immediately before either the date of termination or the Change in Control, whichever is greater.

However, in connection with the elimination of reimbursement payments for excise taxes levied in connection with 
Internal Revenue Code Section 4999, eligible officers either (1) are responsible for paying any such excise taxes, or 
(2) have their aggregate Change-in-Control benefits reduced to a level that does not trigger the excise tax, but only 
if doing so would be more beneficial to the officer on an after-tax basis.

For these purposes, “cause” means:

(i)   The covered officer’s willful and continued failure to substantially perform the officer’s duties with PG&E Corporation 

or one of its affiliates, after a written Board demand for substantial performance is delivered to the officer, or

(ii) The willful engagement in illegal conduct or gross misconduct that is materially injurious to PG&E Corporation.
Constructive termination includes resignation in connection with conditions that constitute Good Reason as defined 
in the Officer Severance Policy (which includes, among other things, a material diminution in duties, authority, or base 
compensation).

stip
If a covered officer is terminated without cause or is constructively terminated in connection with a Change in Control, 
the Officer Severance Policy provides that the officer will receive a lump-sum payment equal to the officer’s prorated 
target STIP calculated for the fiscal year in which termination occurs. Mr. Earley waived his rights to Change-in-Control 
severance benefits under the Officer Severance Policy. If Mr. Thomason, Mr. Mistry, or Ms. Austin had been terminated 
in connection with a Change in Control as of December 31, 2017, each would have been eligible for STIP payments, as 
discussed in the section entitled “Potential Payments—Termination Without Cause.”

pG&E corporation Golden parachute restriction policy
The Golden Parachute Restriction Policy requires shareholder approval of executive severance payments provided in 
connection with any change in control, to the extent that those payments exceed 2.99 times the sum of a covered 
officer’s base salary and target annual bonus. This Policy was adopted by the PG&E Corporation Board in February 2006.

The policy applies to the value of cash, special benefits, or perquisites that are due to the executive following or in 
connection with both (1) a change in control, and (2) the termination or constructive termination of an officer of PG&E 
Corporation, the Utility, or their respective subsidiaries at the level of Senior Vice President or higher. It does not apply 
to the value of benefits that would be triggered by a change in control without severance, or to the value of benefits 
that would be triggered by severance in the absence of a change in control. The Golden Parachute Restriction Policy 
also does not apply to certain enumerated payments, including, among others, compensation for services rendered 
prior to termination, tax restoration payments, and accelerated vesting or settlement of equity awards.

Potential Payments – Termination Due to Death or Disability

Ltip awards
If an officer’s employment is terminated due to death or disability, LTIP awards are treated as follows:

•• Unvested performance shares vest immediately. Vested shares are payable, if at all, as soon as practicable after 

completion of the performance period relevant to the performance shares.

•• If a participant’s death or disability (as defined under Internal Revenue Code Section 409A) occurs while employed, 

unvested RSUs vest immediately and will be settled within 60 days.

Vested LTIP awards are payable to the officer’s designated beneficiary(ies) in the case of death, or otherwise in 
accordance with the officer’s instructions or by law.

stip
If an officer’s employment is terminated due to death or disability before December 31 of the STIP performance year, 
a prorated portion of the target STIP award will become payable to the officer, or, in the case of death, to the officer’s 
beneficiary(ies), by the former employer and at the same time as STIP payments are made to active employees.

principaL ExEcutivE OfficErs’ (pEO)  
paY ratiO – 2017

The PG&E Corporation PEO’s 2017 total compensation was $8,597,220. The total compensation of the median employee 
was $140,263. The ratio of PEO pay to median worker pay for PG&E Corporation was 61:1.

The Utility PEO’s 2017 total compensation was $6,413,256. The total compensation of the median employee was 
$140,263. The ratio of PEO pay to median worker pay for the Utility was 46:1.

December 31, 2017 was selected as the date to identify the “median employee.” Medicare wages from tax records 
were utilized to make the identification. Of the companies’ total of 23,361 employees, an insignificant number (24) 
were employed by PG&E Corporation, so the same employee was used as the “median employee” for both PG&E 
Corporation and the Utility. After identifying the median employee, all of the elements of compensation, including 
cash compensation and change in pension value, for 2017 were combined in accordance with the requirements of Item 
402(c)(2)(x) of SEC Regulation S-K. There were multiple PEOs during 2017. Because the PEO of each company as of 
December 31, 2017 (Geisha Williams, CEO and President of PG&E Corporation, and Nickolas Stavropoulos, President 
and COO of the Utility) assumed her or his position on March 1, 2017, PEO compensation, specifically salary and non-
equity incentive plan compensation, was annualized to project the amount of compensation that would have been 
earned if each of the PEOs had been in her or his positions for the full year.

These ratios are reasonable estimates calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.

2018 Joint Proxy StatementItem Nos. 4 and 5: PG&E Corporation 
Shareholder Proposals

to Be voted on by pG&E corporation shareholders Only

The following shareholder proposals and related supporting statements represent the views of the shareholders who 
submitted them, and not the views of PG&E Corporation. PG&E Corporation is not responsible for, and does not 
endorse, the content of any shareholder proposal or supporting statement. The shareholder proposals and supporting 
statements are included in this Proxy Statement pursuant to rules established by the SEC.

Item No. 4: Shareholder Proposal

Mr. Thomas Strobhar, 3183 Beaver Vu Drive, Ste. A, Beavercreek, Ohio 45434, beneficial owner of 65 shares of PG&E 
Corporation common stock, has given notice of his intention to present the following proposal for action at the PG&E 
Corporation annual meeting:

Whereas, charitable contributions are made possible largely by the utility bills our customers pay to keep their homes 
and businesses safe and comfortable. Our service alone is a great benefit to millions of people.

Whereas, many of our customers are of moderate or low income and struggle to pay their bills.

Whereas, PG&E distributes over twenty million dollars a year to a long list of charities, most of which would not be 
recognizable to many of our customers. In the past, we have given funds to LGBT groups to fund film festivals some 
might characterize as gay porn. We have also contributed tens of thousands of dollars to the Center for American 
Progress. According to SourceWatch, the Center, “is a liberal think tank created and led by John Podesta, the head of 
Barack Obama’s Presidential Transition Team and a former Chief of Staff for President Bill Clinton.”

Whereas, other controversial charities we might give to include Planned Parenthood, which does over 300,000 
abortions a year, or the Human Rights Campaign, which often characterizes people who oppose same-sex marriage 
as haters and bigots. This might include millions of our customers.

Whereas, less controversial contributions have gone to the International Bird Rescue and Research Center and the 
Marin Boating council. However, this later group might not appear to some as particularly needy.

Whereas, we have never asked our customers if they would like a lower utility bill or have a portion of their remittance 
given to charities chosen by PG&E.

Resolved, it is requested the board of directors discontinue the charitable giving program unless a majority of our 
customers positively affirm it through a public vote.

the Board of Directors of pG&E corporation recommends a vote aGainst this proposal.
The Board believes shareholders should vote against this proposal for the following reasons:

The proponent’s statements regarding customer rates funding PG&E Corporation’s charitable program are misplaced. 
Under CPUC decisions, customer rates cannot be, and are not, used to fund PG&E Corporation’s charitable giving 
program. In fact, shareholder dollars are used to fund the charitable giving program. Therefore, to give customers 
approval rights over PG&E’s charitable giving program would be contrary to how the program is funded and structured 
under CPUC decisions. It is not in the shareholders’ interest to give customers the authority to determine whether and 
how shareholder dollars can be used for charitable purposes.

PG&E Corporation’s charitable giving program supports and reflects PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s (together, 
“PG&E”) mission, vision, and culture, and is an integral part of PG&E’s business. PG&E’s charitable programs not only 
address the needs of our customers and the communities PG&E serves, but they also enhance PG&E’s ability to 
deliver safe, reliable, affordable, and clean energy by: building partnerships with other essential service providers and 
first responders in local communities, fostering community involvement with civic leaders, and enhancing employee 
engagement both in and out of the workplace.

78

2018 Joint Proxy StatementitEm nOs. 4 anD 5: pG&E cOrpOratiOn sHarEHOLDEr prOpO saLs

Furthermore, PG&E is proud of the breadth of its charitable giving program and the impact it has on communities.

•• PG&E provides grants that support 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations, schools, and local governments across Northern 
and Central California every year. PG&E’s charitable giving programs specifically focus on the following four areas 
that are key to vigorous community health: education and workforce development, economic and community 
vitality, the environment, and emergency preparedness and safety. 

•• In 2017, PG&E provided more than 1,700 grants totaling $28 million in these areas, with a focus on supporting 
underserved communities. Many of PG&E’s charitable grants support the critical safety net organizations that low 
to moderate income families rely on in times of need. 

•• PG&E’s charitable giving program incorporates many different types of activities, including cash contributions from 
directors, officers, employees, and retirees; corporate sponsorships; and various categories of in-kind donations, 
including volunteer hours, facility rental, and donations of vehicles, surplus equipment, and tools. 

•• Development of PG&E’s charitable giving program reflects many points of view and considers many types of potential 
impacts and benefits. For example, the program is designed to (1) concentrate on four areas that are designed to 
support communities, (2) align with strategic business objectives, (3) enhance employee engagement, retention, 
and employee development, (4) support marketing and public relations activities and create opportunities for PG&E 
to engage with the community, and (5) support diversity and inclusion programs. 

•• PG&E has a robust and detailed system of internal governance that helps ensure that charitable giving programs 
are consistent with corporate business lines and goals, internal policies, and legal requirements, and are subject to 
appropriate oversight, including by the Board of Directors. 

Suspending the charitable giving program, even temporarily, would deprive PG&E and its shareholders of the many 
benefits provided by this program, could cause PG&E to violate any promises and signed contractual obligations to 
make future contributions, and would suspend needed support to the communities that PG&E serves.

For these reasons, the PG&E Corporation Board unanimously recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal.

Item No. 5: Shareholder Proposal

Mr. John Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo Beach, CA 90278, beneficial owner of 80 shares of PG&E 
Corporation common stock, has given notice of his intention to present the following proposal for action at the PG&E 
Corporation annual meeting:

proposal 5 – Enhance shareholder proxy access
RESOLVED: Stockholders ask the board of directors to amend its proxy access bylaw provisions and any associated 
documents, to include the following changes for the purpose of decreasing the average amount of Company common 
stock the average member of a nominating group would be required to hold for 3-years to satisfy the aggregate 
ownership requirements to form a nominating group and to increase the possible number of proxy access director 
candidates:

•• No limitation shall be placed on the number of stockholders that can aggregate their shares to achieve the 3% of 

common stock required to nominate directors under our Company’s proxy access provisions.

•• The number of shareholder-nominated candidates eligible to appear in proxy materials will be 25% of Directors 

(rounded down) but not less than 2.

Even if the 20 largest public pension funds were able to aggregate their shares, they would not meet the current 3% 
criteria for a continuous 3-years at most companies according to the Council of Institutional Investors. This proposal 
addresses the contradiction that our company now has with proxy access for only the largest shareholders who are 
probably the least likely shareholders to use it.

For 20 shareholders to make use of our current proxy access – the average holding for such a group of 20 PG&E 
shareholders would be $39 million each. Yet it might take an average current holding of $78 million each or more 
when any stock held for less than 3 continuous years is subtracted.

Proxy access needs to be enhanced because the PG&E Board seems to lack leadership in catastrophic risk management. 
California fire officials and utility regulators are still investigating the cause of the Northern California wildfires in 
October 2017. These fires killed more than 40 people. Several lawsuits were promptly filed against PG&E in connection 
with the October fires.

79

2018 Joint Proxy StatementitEm nOs. 4 anD 5: pG&E cOrpOratiOn sHarEHOLDEr prOpO saLs

Investors reacted negatively to PG&E’s potential liability. Shortly after the blazes began, investors sent PG&E stock 
down sharply. In September 2017 PG&E shares were at $70. In December 2017 the price had fallen to $52.

PG&E management spent a 5-digit dollar amount to prevent us from voting on the topic of this proposal in 2017. 
Meanwhile this proposal topic won substantial support at 6 major companies in 2017 – including Apple.

This may be an opportune time to adopt this proposal since our stock declined in a year in which the market was up.

Please vote to improve catastrophic risk management accountability to shareholders:

Enhance shareholder proxy access – proposal 5

the Board of Directors of pG&E corporation recommends a vote aGainst this proposal.
The Board believes shareholders should vote against this proposal for the following reasons:

PG&E Corporation’s current proxy access bylaw provisions strike an appropriate balance between the benefits and 
risks of proxy access, and are consistent with current proxy access market standards. The proposal seeks the adoption 
of provisions that would unnecessarily disrupt that balance and are inconsistent with current market practice. Further, 
given the composition of PG&E Corporation’s shareholder base, the proposed changes would not significantly increase 
the ability for our shareholders to take advantage of proxy access, and therefore are unnecessary.

Our shareholders already have meaningful and appropriate proxy access rights. On February 17, 2016, the PG&E 
Corporation Board adopted proxy access bylaw provisions that permit shareholders owning 3 percent or more of 
the Corporation’s outstanding common stock for at least three years to nominate the greater of two directors or  
20 percent of the Board, and to include these nominees in the Corporation’s proxy materials. The number of shareholders 
who may aggregate their shares to meet the ownership threshold is limited to 20. Nominations are subject to the 
eligibility, procedural, and disclosure requirements set forth in the Corporation’s Bylaws.

Our proxy access bylaw provisions’ specific requirements reflect a broad range of perspectives, including (1) current 
practices among other large companies and (2) the views of PG&E Corporation’s largest investors. The Board 
considered and weighed these perspectives when developing the Corporation’s proxy access bylaws provisions, and 
believes that these provisions strike an appropriate and meaningful balance between enhancing shareholder rights 
and adequately protecting the best interests of the Corporation and its shareholders through reasonable procedures 
for conducting election contests. 

PG&E Corporation is committed to strong corporate governance practices, including accountability to our shareholders. 
In addition to proxy access, shareholders have other ways to provide input to us. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines 
reflect the Board’s commitment to open communications with shareholders, and provide opportunities for direct 
communication and dialogue with the Board and management.

Removing the shareholder aggregation limit from the Corporation’s proxy access bylaw provisions would not 
significantly increase benefits to shareholders because the current 20-shareholder limit is not prohibitive, given the 
Corporation’s current shareholder base. As of December 2017, three of PG&E Corporation’s institutional shareholders 
each had owned more than 5 percent of the Corporation’s outstanding common stock for at least three years, and 
our 35 largest institutional shareholders held approximately 58 percent of the Corporation’s outstanding common 
stock. As a practical matter, some of these shareholders could utilize proxy access individually, and a number of the 
others could easily form a group among themselves to submit a proxy access nomination. More importantly, any 
shareholder seeking to form a nominating group, regardless of the size of its holdings, could achieve the 3 percent 
minimum required ownership by combining with one or more of the 35 largest investors. Of course, nominating groups 
are not limited to these large institutional investors, and a shareholder seeking to nominate a director candidate may 
approach any other shareholders to meet the 3 percent ownership threshold. 

Therefore, the 20-shareholder aggregation limit does not unduly restrict any shareholder from forming a group to 
submit a proxy access nomination, and provides ample opportunities for all holders of less than 3 percent of the 
Corporation’s common stock to combine with other shareholders to reach the 3 percent ownership threshold. 

For the reasons stated above, we believe it is in the best interests of the Corporation and our shareholders to maintain 
the current proxy access bylaw provisions, and to make no changes at this time.

For these reasons, the PG&E Corporation Board unanimously recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal.

In accordance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC regulations, PG&E Corporation’s and 
the Utility’s directors and certain officers, as well as persons who own greater than 10 percent of the Corporation’s 
or the Utility’s equity securities, must file reports of ownership and changes in ownership of such equity securities 
with the SEC and the principal national securities exchange on which those securities are registered, and must furnish 
the Corporation or the Utility with copies of all such reports that they file.

Based solely on review of copies of such reports received or written representations from certain reporting persons, 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that during 2017, all filing requirements applicable to their respective directors, 
officers, and 10 percent shareholders were satisfied. No information is reported for individuals during periods in which 
they were not directors, officers, or 10 percent shareholders of the applicable company.

2018 Joint Proxy StatementRelated Party Transactions

Approval Policies

The Boards of PG&E Corporation and the Utility each adopted a written policy (the companies’ Related Party Transaction 
Policy (“Policy”)) which generally requires Audit Committee approval or ratification of transactions that would require 
disclosure under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Item 404(a)”), except 
that the Policy has a lower dollar threshold than Item 404(a).

Under the Policy, at the first meeting of each year, each company’s Audit Committee reviews, approves, and/or ratifies 
related party transactions (other than the types of transactions that are excluded from disclosure under Item 404(a), 
as described below) with values exceeding $10,000 in which either company participates and in which any “Related 
Party” has a material direct or indirect interest. For these purposes, “Related Party” generally includes (1) any director, 
nominee for director, or executive officer, (2) holders of greater than 5 percent of that company’s voting securities, 
and (3) those parties’ immediate family members.

After the annual review and approval of related party transactions, if either company wishes to enter into a new related 
party transaction, then that transaction must be either pre-approved or ratified by the applicable Audit Committee. 
If a transaction is not ratified in accordance with the Policy, management will make all reasonable efforts to cancel or 
annul that transaction.

Where it is not practical or desirable to wait until the next Audit Committee meeting to obtain approval or ratification, 
the Chair of the applicable Audit Committee may elect to approve a particular related party transaction. If the Chair of 
the applicable Audit Committee has an interest in the proposed related party transaction, then that transaction may 
be reviewed and approved by another independent and disinterested member of the applicable Audit Committee. 
In either case, the individual approving the transaction must report such approval to the full Committee at the next 
regularly scheduled meeting.

When reviewing any related party transaction, the Audit Committees consider whether the transaction is on terms 
comparable to those that could be obtained in arm’s-length dealings with an unrelated third party. The Policy also 
requires that each Audit Committee disclose to the respective Board any material related party transactions.

As provided in Item 404(a), the following types of transactions are excluded:

•• Transactions where the rates or charges are determined by competitive bids,
•• Transactions for the rendering of services as a common or contract carrier, or public utility, at rates or charges fixed 

in conformity with law or governmental authority,

•• Transactions for services as a bank depository of funds, transfer agent, registrar, trustee under a trust indenture, 

or similar services,

•• Benefits received on a pro rata basis by holders of PG&E Corporation or Utility securities,
•• Transactions where the individual’s interest arises solely (1) from such person’s position as a director of another 
corporation or organization which is a party to the transaction, (2) from the direct or indirect ownership of such 
person and a specific group (consisting of directors, nominees for director, and executive officers of the corporation, 
or any member of their immediate families), in the aggregate, of less than a 10 percent equity interest in another 
person (other than a partnership) that is a party to the transaction, or (3) from both such position and ownership,
•• Transactions where the individual’s interest arises solely from the holding of an equity interest (including a limited 
partnership interest, but excluding a general partnership interest) or a creditor interest in another person that is 
party to the transaction with PG&E Corporation, the Utility, or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates, and 
the transaction is not material to such other person,

•• Transactions where the individual’s interest arises only from such person’s position as a limited partner in a partnership 
engaged in a transaction with PG&E Corporation or the Utility, in which the individual’s interest (when aggregated 
with any other Related Parties) is less than 10 percent and the individual does not serve as a general partner of, nor 
hold another position in, the partnership,

•• An employment relationship or transaction involving an executive officer of the respective company (and any related 
compensation resulting solely from that relationship or transaction), if the compensation is reported pursuant to 
Regulation S-K, Item 402,

84

2018 Joint Proxy StatementRelated PaRty tRansactions

•• An employment relationship or transaction involving an executive officer of the respective company (and any related 
compensation resulting solely from that relationship or transaction), if the compensation would have been reported 
pursuant to Regulation S-K, Item 402 as compensation earned for services if that individual were an executive officer 
named in the Summary Compensation Table, and such compensation had been approved or recommended to the 
Board by the PG&E Corporation Compensation Committee (and the executive officer is not an immediate family 
member of another Related Party), or

•• Compensation provided to a director, provided that such compensation is reported pursuant to Regulation S-K, 

Item 407.

Since January 1, 2017, all related party transactions have been approved or ratified by the applicable Audit Committee 
in accordance with this Policy.

Related Person Transactions

Since January 1, 2017, three providers of asset management services in excess of $120,000 have been beneficial owners 
of at least 5 percent of PG&E Corporation common stock: BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”), T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. 
(“Price Associates”), and The Vanguard Group, Inc. (“Vanguard”). The nature and value of services provided by these 
5 percent shareholders and their affiliates since January 1, 2017 are described below.

•• BlackRock (including its affiliates) provided asset management services to various trusts associated with PG&E 
Corporation’s and the Utility’s employee benefit plans and to the Utility’s nuclear decommissioning trusts. In exchange 
for these services, BlackRock’s affiliates earned approximately $4.0 million in fees during 2017.

•• Price Associates (including its affiliates) provided asset management services to various trusts associated with 
the companies’ employee benefit plans and to the Utility’s nuclear decommissioning trusts. In exchange for these 
services, Price Associates’ affiliates earned approximately $1.7 million in fees during 2017.

•• Vanguard (including its affiliates), provided asset management services to grantor trusts associated with certain 
of the companies’ non-qualified and deferred income benefit plans, and to The PG&E Corporation Foundation. In 
exchange for these services, Vanguard earned approximately $123,000 in fees during 2017.

In each of these cases, the services were (1) approved by the PG&E Corporation Audit Committee, and (2) subject 
to terms comparable to those that could be obtained in arm’s-length dealings with an unrelated third party. PG&E 
Corporation expects that these entities will continue to provide similar services and products in the future, at similar 
levels, in the normal course of business operations.

Kathy Thomason is employed by the Utility as a Business Finance Analyst, Expert, and she is the spouse of 
David S. Thomason, who is Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Controller of the Utility. Since January 1, 2017, 
Ms. Thomason received compensation and related payments and benefits from the Utility with a value of approximately 
$120,000. Any payments to Ms. Thomason for services rendered during 2018 are expected to be similar in nature and 
value to payments provided during 2017, consistent with the Utility’s policies and practices that apply to employee 
compensation generally.

2018 Joint Proxy StatementLegal Proceedings

Two derivative lawsuits for breach of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment were filed in the San Francisco County 
Superior Court on November 16, 2017 and November 20, 2017, respectively, in connection with the wildfires that spread 
through Northern California beginning on October 8, 2017. The first lawsuit is filed against the members of the Board 
of Directors and certain officers of PG&E Corporation. PG&E Corporation is identified as a nominal defendant in that 
action. The second lawsuit is filed against the members of the Board of Directors, certain former members of the 
Board of Directors, and certain officers of both PG&E Corporation and the Utility. PG&E Corporation and the Utility 
are identified as nominal defendants in that action. On February 14, 2018, the court consolidated the two lawsuits and 
ordered plaintiffs to file a consolidated complaint by April 13, 2018.

Board’s Voting
Recommendation
FOR all nominees
FOR this proposal
FOR this proposal

A majority voting standard applies to the election of each director nominee and to the approval of Item Nos. 2, 3, 4, 
and 5. Under a majority voting standard, approval occurs if the shares voted “for” a director nominee or other item 
exceed the number of shares voted “against” that nominee or item. In addition, the shares voting affirmatively must 
equal at least a majority of the quorum that is required to conduct business at each meeting. This means that the 
shares voting affirmatively must be greater than 25 percent of the outstanding shares entitled to vote.

In determining whether a majority of the shares represented and voting have elected a director nominee or approved 
a proposal, abstentions and any broker non-votes (see the definition below under “What is a broker non-vote”) will 
not be considered. As explained below, broker non-votes do not apply to the ratification of the appointment of the 
Independent Auditor.

Abstentions and broker non-votes that occur with respect to the election of a director nominee or a proposal could 
prevent the election of a nominee or the approval of a proposal if the number of shares voting affirmatively does not 
constitute a majority of the required quorum.

Abstentions and broker non-votes also are considered in determining whether a quorum is present at each meeting.

Where shareholders are being asked for an advisory vote or for ratification (Item Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5), any voting results 
with respect to these items will be non-binding on the affected company but will be considered by that company’s 
Board.

If any incumbent director fails to receive the votes required to be elected, then that director’s term will end 90 days 
after the election results are certified, unless he or she resigns before that time.

What is a broker non-vote?

If you hold your shares indirectly through your broker, then your broker is the registered holder of your shares and 
submits the Proxy to vote your shares. You are the beneficial owner of the shares, and typically you will be asked to 
provide your broker with instructions as to how you want your shares to be voted. Under the rules of the NYSE, if you 
fail to provide your broker with voting instructions, your broker can use its discretion to vote your shares on certain 
routine matters, like the ratification of the appointment of the Independent Auditor. However, your broker may not 
use its discretion to vote your shares on certain other matters, like director elections, advisory votes on executive 
compensation, and shareholder proposals. When a broker votes your shares on routine matters but is unable to vote 
your shares on other matters because you have failed to provide instructions, a “broker non-vote” occurs with respect 
to these other matters.

What shares am I entitled to vote?

If you are a PG&E Corporation registered shareholder, you are entitled to vote all the shares of PG&E Corporation 
common stock in your account as of the close of business on March 23, 2018 (the “record date”). If you are a Utility 
registered shareholder, you are entitled to vote all the shares of Utility preferred stock in your account as of the  
record date.

If you are a registered holder of both PG&E Corporation common stock and Utility preferred stock, you are entitled to 
vote separately on each company’s proposals. If you receive more than one copy of the Notice of Internet Availability 
or more than one Proxy Card for either company, it means that your shares are held in more than one account. You 
should vote the shares in all of your accounts.

How many copies of the Proxy Statement and the 2017 Annual Report 
(together, the “2018 Proxy Materials”) will I receive?

Registered holders and 401(k) Plan Participants

If you receive your proxy materials through Broadridge Investor Communication Solutions (“Broadridge”), and there 
are multiple beneficial owners at the same address, you may receive fewer Notices of Internet Availability or fewer 
copies of the 2018 Proxy Materials than the number of beneficial owners at that address. SEC rules permit Broadridge 
to deliver only one Notice of Internet Availability or only one copy of the 2018 Proxy Materials to multiple beneficial 
owners sharing an address, unless the applicable company receives contrary instructions from any beneficial owner 
at that address.

If you receive your proxy materials through Broadridge and (1) you currently receive only one copy of the Notice 
of Internet Availability or only one copy of the 2018 Proxy Materials at a shared address but you wish to receive an 
additional copy of the Notice of Internet Availability or of the 2018 Proxy Materials or any future notices or proxy 
materials, or (2) you share an address with other beneficial owners who also receive their separate notices of Internet 
availability or proxy materials through Broadridge and you wish to request delivery of a single copy of any notice 
of Internet availability or of the proxy materials to the shared address in the future, please contact the office of the

contest if the other party does not agree to comply with the confidential voting policy, and (4) where disclosure may 
be necessary for either company to assert or defend claims. The policy allows the companies to engage shareholders, 
and to directly or indirectly (1) accept voting information that is voluntarily provided by shareholders, or (2) request 
and obtain final shareholder voting information that is or will be publicly disclosed pursuant to law, regulation, or 
similar requirements.

Who will count the votes?

2018 Joint Proxy Statement2019 annual meetinGs

There will be a general question and answer period. Questions and comments should pertain to corporate performance, 
items for consideration at the 2018 Annual Meetings, or other matters of interest to shareholders generally. The meetings 
are not a forum to present general economic, political, or other views that are not directly related to the business of 
the Corporation or the Utility.

Shareholders will be recognized on a rotating basis. When you are called upon, please direct your questions and 
comments to the individual moderating the question and answer period. Each person called upon during the meetings 
will have a maximum of three minutes on any one question or comment.

Can shareholders introduce other proposals (including director nominations) 
during the 2018 Annual Meetings?

The Bylaws of PG&E Corporation and the Utility each require advance written notice of the intention to introduce 
a shareholder proposal or bring other matters for action (including introducing nominees for director) at an annual 
meeting. The notice for proposals and other matters to be considered by shareholders at the 2018 Annual Meetings 
must have been received at the principal executive office of the applicable company no earlier than January 30, 2018 
and no later than 5:00 p.m., Pacific time, on March 1, 2018. The companies did not receive timely advance written 
notice of any shareholder matters that will be introduced at the 2018 Annual Meetings.

How much will this Proxy solicitation cost?

PG&E Corporation and the Utility hired D.F. King to assist in the distribution of proxy materials and solicitation of votes. 
The estimated fee is $17,000 plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. In addition, the Corporation and the Utility will 
reimburse brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees, and fiduciaries for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses 
for forwarding proxy and solicitation materials to shareholders. The companies solicitation of Proxies also may be 
made in person, by telephone, or by electronic communications by the companies’ respective directors, officers, and 
employees, who will not receive additional compensation for those solicitation activities.

2019 Annual Meetings

What is the date of the 2019 annual meetings?

PG&E Corporation and the Utility currently anticipate that the date of their 2019 annual meetings will be roughly 
one year after the date of the 2018 Annual Meetings. Exact dates will be communicated to shareholders in the proxy 
materials for that meeting.

Can I submit nominees for inclusion in proxy materials for the  
2019 annual meetings?

PG&E Corporation’s Bylaws include proxy access provisions. Under these provisions, shareholders of PG&E Corporation 
who meet the requirements set forth in the Bylaws may submit director nominations for inclusion in the Corporation’s 
proxy materials. Proxy access nominations for the Corporation’s 2019 annual meeting must be provided to the PG&E 
Corporation Corporate Secretary no earlier than November 12, 2018 and no later than December 11, 2018, and must 
meet all requirements set forth in the Bylaws. However, if the Corporation’s 2019 annual meeting is scheduled on a date 
that is more than 30 days before or after the anniversary date of the 2018 annual meeting, a proxy access nomination 
for the 2019 meeting generally will be timely if it is received no later than the close of the business on the date that 
is 180 days prior to the 2019 annual meeting date or the 10th day after the date on which the date of the 2019 annual 
meeting is disclosed, whichever is later. The Utility did not adopt proxy access bylaw provisions, given the fact that 
over 95 percent of the Utility’s common stock is held by PG&E Corporation; no Utility shareholders may submit director 
nominations via proxy access.

of the matter be received at the principal executive office of the applicable company no earlier than January 22, 2019

notice will be timely if it is received no later than the 10th day after the date on which that company publicly discloses 
the date of its 2019 annual meeting. You must also provide information regarding your proposal, and satisfy other 
requirements as set forth in the applicable company’s Bylaws.
