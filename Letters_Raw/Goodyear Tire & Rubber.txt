ON THE COVER  Wingfoot Lake, Suffield, Ohio  | For more than 60 years, Goodyear’s iconic blimps have provided breathtaking aerial
coverage of many of the most-watched sports, entertainment and news events. In 2018, Goodyear will launch the third of its all-new, 
state-of-the-art blimps. The new blimps feature faster speeds, quieter engines, advanced on-board avionics and increased passenger
capacity compared to the now-retired fleet of 1970’s-era GZ model blimps. The new blimps continue Goodyear’s legacy as the world’s
leading builder and operator of lighter-than-air airships.

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS

The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company’s results in 2017
reflected our unwavering commitment to our long-term
strategy of pursuing growth in the tire industry’s most
attractive market segments while ensuring that we capture
the value of our brands, our technology, and our services 
in the marketplace. During the year, our business was
affected by a significant increase in raw material costs and
weak demand in many of our key markets. Despite these 
transitory headwinds, I am optimistic about the positive
long-term trends that are influencing our industry.  

We believe our innovation, technology leadership and
award-winning products are as strong as they have ever
been and are the core of the global strength of the
Goodyear brand. 

For the full year, our segment operating income exceeded
$1.5 billion and we delivered $1.2 billion in cash flow from
operating activities. Sales increased from 2016 to $15.4 
billion. These results enabled us to continue rewarding our
shareholders. Since reinstating our dividend in 2013, 
we have returned $332 million to shareholders through 
dividends and $1.3 billion through share repurchases.

Given where we see the market trajectory today, we have a
high degree of confidence in our ability to deliver results in
the future and will work to capitalize on all opportunities to
capture upside to our plan. There is ample reason for our
optimism, including:

• a relatively healthy automotive industry in North America

and Europe;

• an on-going market shift to larger-rim-diameter tires; 
• continued successful execution on key initiatives, 

including utilizing our leading distribution, technology,
innovation, and brand capabilities to gain market share 
in 17-inch and larger rim size tires;

• and our sustained efforts to reduce costs and increase

efficiency.

Growth in the global consumer tire industry is strongest in
the premium segment, where Goodyear can distinguish 
itself from the competition. In the U.S. and EMEA consumer
replacement markets, industry growth in the 17-inch-and-
larger segment was 7 percent in 2017.  

The trend towards larger, more complex tires has been 
driven by original equipment manufacturers. Consistent 
with our strategy, we will continue to target profitable 
fitments that have high loyalty rates and pull-though in 
the replacement market; these vehicles depend on the 
performance characteristics of Goodyear’s premium, 
larger-rim-diameter tires. In 2017, we claimed original
equipment positions on four of the five top-selling vehicles
in the U.S. and our 2018 fitment launches will further 
support our OE leadership.  

The strength of the Goodyear brand, our strategy of winning
in the most profitable segments of the market, our aligned
distribution network and innovating to meet the needs of 
our most demanding customers will be among the most
important drivers of our growth in the years ahead.

GLOBAL BUSINESSES
AMERICAS

In 2017, our segment operating income in the Americas
decreased from the previous year’s levels, primarily because
of higher raw material costs and the effect of lower volume.
Our fourth-quarter performance ended the year with a
recovery, highlighted by an 8 percent increase in consumer
replacement shipments in the U.S.  

Looking ahead, we expect moderate overall industry growth
in the U.S. and robust demand in larger-rim-diameter 
consumer tires. We are well positioned to take advantage 
of this trend with new products that are being embraced 
by our customers and consumers. The launch of Assurance
WeatherReady in late 2017 was a tremendous success —
our most successful premium tire launch ever. 

In 2018, we are introducing new products such as the
Goodyear Assurance MaxLife, which includes technology to
deliver more miles of all-season traction and will offer one
of the best treadwear warranties in the business. 

Also, we anticipate our positive momentum to continue in
the U.S. commercial truck business. We expect double digit
growth in our OE business and have won multiple new
national fleet accounts that will help support our OE and
replacement growth in 2018 and beyond.

Outside the U.S., we expect both the consumer OE and
replacement industry in Latin America to grow in the low
single digits in 2018. Our team in Brazil continues to focus
on expanding its aligned dealer and distributor network 
and building capabilities to drive value with these 
important customers.

Goodyear Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & President

EMEA

ASIA PACIFIC

The most impressive performance of the past year came in
our Asia Pacific business, which posted full-year segment
operating income of $342 million. In addition, it delivered
record fourth-quarter segment operating income of $117
million and its fourth-quarter volume was its best in any
quarter in history.

In 2018, we will continue to build on our capabilities to 
capitalize on the long-term growth trends in the region,
especially in key markets in China and India. We are 
strategically expanding our retail network and points of 
distribution to drive growth in those countries.

Asia Pacific is also launching two important products this
year with its introduction of the Assurance TripleMax2 
and the E-Max Comfort, targeted toward the middle and
premium segments of the market.  These will also fuel 
our growth.

We are energized by our growth plans in Asia Pacific. Our
plan is supported by investments in assets and capability 
for 2018 and beyond. We remain focused on our strategy
and execution for each of our key markets to build the 
foundation for continued growth in the region.

In our Europe, Middle East and Africa business in 2017, we
continued to take strategic actions to shift our resources, 
re-align our go-to-market approach and strengthen our
value proposition. We reduced our exposure to declining,
less-profitable market segments in EMEA, including the 
closure of our Philippsburg, Germany manufacturing facility.
To strengthen our position in the competitive EMEA region,
we are in the process of establishing a connected 
business model to make the tire buying process easier 
for customers and consumers. We believe this will help 
create a sustainable competitive advantage.  

As is the case in the Americas, EMEA is growing in the 
larger-rim-size segments of the consumer business. We 
are seeing margin improvement and growth in replacement
volumes, driven by our award-winning product offerings
across the region.

In OE, we are increasing our presence on ultra-high-
performance fitments with our most discriminating OEM
customers, including Porsche, Maserati and Alfa Romeo.
Our competitive advantage in this market is our ability to
design and manufacture outstanding products that are 
recognized through tire labeling and magazine test scores.
That remains a strong foundation of our business.

We expect over the long-term, EMEA’s recalibration will
strengthen and further differentiate our value proposition
through our distribution and service network. We are looking
forward to the continued execution of EMEA’s strategic 
plan with a focus on returning the region to historical 
margin performance.

NEW MOBILITY ECOSYSTEM
While the shift to larger-rim-diameter tires and increasing
vehicle complexity are currently the biggest trends in the
global tire industry, a much larger evolution has begun that
will redefine personal transportation. Rapidly changing 
consumer attitudes and behavior are driving a shift from
individual vehicle ownership to ride-sharing, as well as the
adoption of connected, autonomous and electric vehicles.
This shift in preference will create a “new mobility 
ecosystem” that takes advantage of technology, increases
convenience, reduces cost and improves safety to give 
consumers more personalized transportation options 
than simply owning a vehicle.

Experts have differing opinions about when such features 
as consumer vehicle fleets and driverless cars will be 
pervasive, but the change is real. We believe the value of
the technology and expertise we offer will increase our 
value in the marketplace. 

We also believe that Goodyear is well positioned to take
advantage of the opportunities created in a new mobility
ecosystem. Our decades of experience helping commercial
fleets and airlines around the world operate more efficiently
provides the foundation to do the same with passenger
fleets.  

During 2017, we launched several innovative relationships
to prepare us to win in a new transportation environment.
For example:
• We began working with Tesloop — a shared mobility 

fleet of Tesla vehicles — on a tire equipped with a 
sensor to capture data and analytics;

• We acquired Ventech, a provider of an innovative 
commercial truck tire inspection and monitoring 
system to help fleets operate more efficiently;

• And we’ve started collaborating with Stratim, an 
app-based tire maintenance program that helps 
consumer fleets accurately predict when their tires 
need service or replacement.

These examples are just the beginning. We are committed
to strengthening the value of our brand, our products and
our aligned network of customers, both now and in a new
mobility ecosystem. The groundwork is already laid to
increase our competitive advantage in a changing world.

OUR PEOPLE
Of course, Goodyear’s greatest advantage is our people. 
Our associates around the world together are the source of
our innovation, the foundation of our confidence and the
backbone of our strategy. Whether they are in our factories,
in the field working with customers, or in one of our office
locations, Goodyear associates are the DNA of our value
proposition. They embody the spirit of Goodyear by 
collaborating with consumers, customers and each other 
to deliver the highest quality products, processes and 
programs.  

As Goodyear begins its 120th year, I can confidently say 
that we are much more than a tire company. We are a 
team that works together to provide solutions that allow 
the world to keep moving forward. We are excited about 
the opportunities ahead and believe in our ability to make
the most of them.  

Thank you for your continued trust, confidence and support.

Respectfully submitted,

Richard J. Kramer

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS.

OVERVIEW

The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of tires, with one of the most
recognizable brand names in the world and operations in most regions of the world. We have a broad global
footprint with 48 manufacturing facilities in 22 countries, including the United States. We operate our business
through three operating segments representing our regional tire businesses: Americas; Europe, Middle East and
Africa; and Asia Pacific.

Results of Operations

In 2017, we experienced challenging global industry conditions, including higher raw material costs, increased
competition and weak demand in many of our key markets. We experienced weakening demand for original
equipment and consumer replacement tires in the United States and Europe despite favorable trends in miles
driven, gasoline prices and unemployment.

In order to continue to drive growth in our business and address the challenging economic environment, we
remain focused on our key strategies by:

• Developing great products and services that anticipate and respond to the needs of consumers;

• Building the value of our brand, helping our customers win in their markets, and becoming consumers’

preferred choice; and

• Improving our manufacturing efficiency and creating an advantaged supply chain focused on reducing our

total delivered costs, optimizing working capital levels and delivering best in industry customer service.

In EMEA, we continued to pursue our strategy of focusing on more profitable segments of the market, such as
larger rim diameter tires, and closed our manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany in July 2017.

During the third quarter of 2017, the United Steelworkers ratified a new five-year master collective bargaining
agreement with us in the United States. The new contract, which expires in July 2022, provides increased
stability by changing from a four-year to a five-year agreement, operational
increase
manufacturing flexibility, and health care changes to help manage costs.

improvements that

On February 8, 2018, we announced our 2018-2020 capital allocation plan that provides for growth capital
expenditures of $700 million to $900 million, debt repayments of $400 million to $600 million, restructuring
payments of approximately $400 million and, subject to our performance, common stock dividends and share
repurchases of $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion. We also announced a 40% increase in the quarterly cash dividend on
our common stock, from $0.10 per share to $0.14 per share, beginning with the December 1, 2017 payment date.

Our 2017 results reflect a 4.2% decrease in tire unit shipments compared to 2016. In 2017, we realized
approximately $259 million of cost savings, including raw material cost saving measures of approximately
$107 million, which exceeded the impact of general inflation. Our raw material costs, including cost saving
measures, increased by approximately 16% in 2017 compared to 2016.

Net sales were $15,377 million in 2017, compared to $15,158 million in 2016. Net sales increased in 2017 due to
an increase in price and product mix, primarily driven by the impact of higher raw material costs on pricing,
favorable foreign currency translation, primarily in EMEA and Americas, and higher sales in other tire-related
businesses, driven by higher prices for third-party chemical sales in Americas. These increases were partially
offset by lower tire unit volume, primarily in EMEA and Americas.

Goodyear net income in 2017 was $346 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, compared to $1,264 million, or $4.74
per diluted share, in 2016. The decrease in Goodyear net income in 2017 was driven by an increase in income tax
expense, primarily due to the recognition of a net discrete tax charge of $299 million in 2017 in connection with
changes in U.S. income tax law compared to the recognition of discrete tax benefits of $458 million in 2016,

primarily due to the release of certain valuation allowances, and lower segment operating income, primarily in
Americas and EMEA. Refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 6, Income Taxes. Partially
offsetting these items were a decrease in rationalization charges and lower corporate selling, administrative and
general expense (“SAG”), primarily due to lower incentive compensation.

Our total segment operating income for 2017 was $1,522 million, compared to $1,985 million in 2016. The
$463 million, or 23.3%, decrease in segment operating income was primarily due to the impact of higher raw
material costs of $618 million, which more than offset the effect of higher price and product mix of $420 million,
lower tire unit volume of $166 million, and higher conversion costs of $139 million, primarily due to increased
under-absorbed overhead resulting from lower production volumes. These impacts were partially offset by lower
SAG of $75 million, driven by lower advertising costs, savings from rationalization plans and lower incentive
compensation. Refer to “Results of Operations — Segment Information” for additional information.

Liquidity

At December 31, 2017, we had $1,043 million in Cash and cash equivalents as well as $3,196 million of unused
availability under our various credit agreements, compared to $1,132 million and $2,970 million, respectively, at
December 31, 2016. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $89 million from December 31, 2016 due primarily
to capital expenditures of $881 million, common stock repurchases of $400 million, and dividends paid on our
common stock of $110 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash flows from operating activities
of $1,158 million and net borrowings of $129 million. Refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional
information.

Outlook

We expect that our full-year tire unit volume for 2018 will be up approximately 3.0% compared to 2017, and for
unabsorbed fixed overhead costs to be approximately $60 million lower in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the
anticipated volume increases. We also expect cost savings to more than offset general inflation in 2018 by
approximately $130 million. Based on current spot rates, we expect foreign currency translation to positively
affect segment operating income by approximately $15 million in 2018 compared to 2017.

Based on current raw material spot prices, for the full year of 2018, we expect our raw material costs will be
about flat compared to 2017, excluding raw material cost saving measures, and we expect a benefit of
approximately $25 million from price and product mix net of raw material costs. Natural and synthetic rubber
prices and other commodity prices historically have experienced significant volatility, and this estimate could
change significantly based on fluctuations in the cost of these and other key raw materials. We are continuing to
focus on price and product mix, to substitute lower cost materials where possible, to work to identify additional
substitution opportunities, to reduce the amount of material required in each tire, and to pursue alternative raw
materials.

Given our significant deferred tax assets, we previously had not expected to pay cash taxes in the U.S. through
2020. With the change in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 as a result of
U.S. tax reform, we now do not expect to pay cash taxes in the U.S. through 2025.

Refer to “Forward-Looking Information — Safe Harbor Statement” for a discussion of our use of forward-
looking statements.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — CONSOLIDATED

All per share amounts are diluted and refer to Goodyear net income (loss).

2017 Compared to 2016

Goodyear net income in 2017 was $346 million, or $1.37 per share, compared to $1,264 million, or $4.74 per
share, in 2016. The decrease in Goodyear net income in 2017 was driven by an increase in income tax expense,
primarily due to recognition of discrete tax charges in 2017 in connection with changes in U.S. income tax law

7

compared to the recognition of discrete tax benefits in 2016, primarily due to the release of certain valuation
allowances, and lower segment operating income, primarily in Americas and EMEA. These items were partially
offset by a decrease in rationalization charges and lower corporate SAG, primarily due to lower incentive
compensation.

Net Sales

Net sales in 2017 of $15,377 million increased $219 million, or 1.4%, compared to $15,158 million in 2016 due
to an increase in price and product mix of $521 million, primarily driven by the impact of higher raw material
costs on pricing, favorable foreign currency translation of $178 million, primarily in EMEA and Americas, and
higher sales in other tire-related businesses of $89 million, driven by higher prices for third-party chemical sales
in Americas. These increases were partially offset by lower tire unit volume of $569 million, primarily in EMEA
and Americas. Goodyear worldwide tire unit net sales were $12,958 million and $12,832 million in 2017 and
2016, respectively. Consumer and commercial net sales, which are included in worldwide tire unit net sales, were
$9,285 million and $2,928 million,
in 2017. Consumer and commercial net sales were
$9,414 million and $2,806 million, respectively, in 2016.

The decrease in worldwide tire unit sales of 6.9 million units, or 4.2%, compared to 2016, included a decrease of
3.8 million replacement tire units, or 3.3%, comprised primarily of decreases in EMEA and Americas. OE tire
units decreased 3.1 million units, or 6.4%, comprised primarily of decreases in Americas and EMEA. The overall
volume decreases in EMEA and Americas were primarily related to lower consumer tire sales, driven by
increased competition and changes in OEM production. Consumer and commercial unit sales in 2017 were
145.9 million and 11.5 million, respectively. Consumer and commercial unit sales in 2016 were 153.0 million
and 11.6 million, respectively.

Cost of Goods Sold

increasing $747 million, or 6.8%,

Cost of goods sold (“CGS”) was $11,719 million in 2017,
from
$10,972 million in 2016. CGS was 76.2% of sales in 2017 compared to 72.4% of sales in 2016. CGS in 2017
increased due to higher raw material costs of $618 million, foreign currency translation of $141 million,
primarily in EMEA and Americas, higher conversion costs of $139 million, primarily due to increased under-
absorbed overhead resulting from lower production volumes in Americas and EMEA, higher costs in other tire-
related businesses of $107 million, driven by an increase in raw material prices related to third-party chemical
sales in Americas, and higher costs related to product mix of $101 million. These increases were partially offset
by lower volume of $403 million, primarily in EMEA and Americas. CGS in 2017 also included pension expense
of $49 million which increased from $44 million in 2016, primarily in Americas. Pension expense excluded

8

pension settlement charges in CGS of $8 million ($5 million after-tax and minority) and $16 million in 2017 and
2016, respectively.

CGS in 2017 included accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs of $40 million ($28 million after-tax and
minority), primarily related to our plan to close our manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany.
Accelerated depreciation was $20 million ($20 million after-tax and minority) in 2016, primarily related to our
plan to close our manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany and our plan to close our Wolverhampton,
U.K. mixing and retreading facility.

Selling, Administrative and General Expense

SAG was $2,302 million in 2017, decreasing $105 million, or 4.4%, from $2,407 million in 2016. SAG was
15.0% of sales in 2017 compared to 15.9% of sales in 2016. The decrease in SAG was due to lower wages and
benefits of $105 million, primarily related to lower incentive compensation and savings from rationalization
plans, and lower advertising costs of $49 million. These decreases were partially offset by foreign currency
translation of $27 million, primarily in EMEA, and increases due to general inflation. SAG in 2017 included
pension expense of $37 million which increased compared to $31 million in 2016, primarily in Americas.
Pension expense excluded pension settlement charges in SAG of $11 million ($7 million after-tax and minority)
and $1 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Rationalizations

We recorded net rationalization charges of $135 million ($93 million after-tax and minority) in 2017. Net
rationalization charges include charges of $46 million related to plans to reduce manufacturing headcount in
EMEA, $35 million related to the closure of our tire manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany,
$32 million related to global plans to reduce SAG headcount, and $20 million related to SAG headcount
reductions in EMEA.

We recorded net rationalization charges of $210 million ($198 million after-tax and minority) in 2016. Net
rationalization charges included charges of $116 million related to the plan to close our tire manufacturing
facility in Philippsburg, Germany, $34 million related to a global plan to reduce SAG headcount, and $25 million
related to manufacturing headcount reductions in EMEA.

Upon completion of the 2017 plans, we estimate that annual segment operating income will improve by
approximately $56 million ($37 million SAG and $19 million CGS), primarily related to our global plans to
reduce SAG headcount. The savings realized in 2017 from rationalization plans totaled $91 million ($49 million
CGS and $42 million SAG).

For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 2, Costs Associated with
Rationalization Programs.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was $335 million in 2017, decreasing $37 million from $372 million in 2016. The decrease was
due primarily to a decrease in the average interest rate to 5.58% in 2017 compared to 6.23% in 2016. This
decrease was partially offset by higher average debt balances of $6,001 million in 2017 compared to
$5,972 million in 2016. Interest expense in 2017 and 2016 included $6 million ($4 million after-tax and
minority) and $12 million ($8 million after-tax and minority), respectively, of expense related to the write-off of
deferred financing fees and unamortized discounts related to the redemption of various debt instruments.

Other (Income) Expense

Other (Income) Expense in 2017 was expense of $8 million, increasing $18 million from income of $10 million
in 2016. The increase in Other (Income) Expense was primarily due to lower gains on general and product
liability (income) expense—discontinued products of $27 million and lower gains on asset sales of $17 million.
These increases were partially offset by lower financing fees and financial instruments expense of $28 million.

9

General and product liability (income) expense—discontinued products in 2017 includes a benefit of $5 million
($3 million after-tax and minority) for the recovery of past costs from certain asbestos insurers, as compared to a
benefit in 2016 of $24 million ($15 million after-tax and minority) for the recovery of past costs from certain
asbestos insurers and a benefit of $10 million related to changes in assumptions for probable insurance recoveries
for asbestos claims in future periods.

Net (gains) losses on asset sales was a gain of $14 million ($13 million after-tax and minority) in 2017 as
compared to a gain of $31 million ($26 million after-tax and minority) in 2016. Net gains (losses) on asset sales
in 2017 included a gain of $6 million related to the sale of a former wire plant site in Luxembourg. Net gains
(losses) on asset sales in 2016 included a gain of $16 million related to the sale of the former wire plant site and a
gain of $9 million related to the sale of our interest in a supply chain logistics company.

Financing fees and financial instruments expense in 2017 includes a premium of $25 million ($15 million
after-tax and minority) related to the redemption of our $700 million 7% senior notes due 2022, as compared to
premiums of $53 million ($37 million after-tax and minority) in 2016 related to the redemption of our
$900 million 6.5% senior notes due 2021 and our €250 million 6.75% senior notes due 2019.

Other (Income) Expense in 2017 included charges of $14 million ($11 million after-tax and minority) for
hurricane related expenses.

For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 4, Other (Income)
Expense.

Income Taxes
Income tax expense in 2017 was $513 million on income before income taxes of $878 million. In 2017, tax
expense was unfavorably impacted by net discrete adjustments of $294 million due primarily to a net tax charge
of $299 million related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) on December 22, 2017 in
the United States.

Effective January 1, 2018, the Tax Act establishes a corporate income tax rate of 21%, replacing the current 35%
rate, and creates a territorial tax system rather than a worldwide system, which generally eliminates the U.S.
federal income tax on dividends from foreign subsidiaries. The transition to the territorial system includes a
one-time transition tax on certain of our foreign earnings previously untaxed in the United States. While our
accounting for the Tax Act is not complete, we have made reasonable estimates for certain provisions and we
have recorded a non-cash net charge to tax expense of $299 million related to its enactment. This net charge
includes a deferred tax charge of $384 million primarily from revaluing our net U.S. deferred tax assets to reflect
the new U.S. corporate tax rate. We believe this calculation is complete except for changes in estimates that can
result from finalizing the filing of our 2017 U.S. income tax return, which are not anticipated to be material, and
changes that may be a direct impact of other provisional amounts recorded due to the enactment of the Tax Act.
The net charge also includes a provisional deferred tax benefit of $162 million to reverse reserves maintained for
the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings under prior law net of reserves established for foreign withholding
taxes consistent with our revised indefinite reinvestment assertion, and a provisional deferred tax charge of
$77 million related to the one-time transition tax.

For 2016, the income tax benefit was $77 million on income before income taxes of $1,207 million. The net tax
benefit in 2016 was driven by net discrete adjustments of $458 million ($459 million after minority interest), due
primarily to a tax benefit of $331 million from the December 31, 2016 release of the valuation allowances on
certain subsidiaries in England, France, Luxembourg and New Zealand. The release of the valuation allowances
on these subsidiaries is net of 2016 tax law changes that reduced deferred tax assets by $23 million. The 2016
income tax benefit also included a $163 million tax benefit resulting from changing our election for our 2009,
2010 and 2012 U.S. tax years from deducting foreign taxes to crediting foreign taxes. The 2016 income tax
benefit was net of a $39 million tax charge to establish a valuation allowance in the U.S. on deferred tax assets
related to receivables from our deconsolidated Venezuelan operations.

At December 31, 2017, our valuation allowance on certain of our U.S. Federal, state and local deferred tax assets
was $88 million primarily related to our investment in our deconsolidated subsidiary in Venezuela, and our

10

valuation allowance on our foreign deferred tax assets was $230 million. Based on positive evidence and future
sources of income it is more likely than not that our foreign tax credits of approximately $750 million will be
fully utilized.

Our losses in various foreign taxing jurisdictions in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to
require us to maintain a full valuation allowance against certain of our net deferred tax assets. Each reporting
period we assess available positive and negative evidence and estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be
generated to utilize these existing deferred tax assets. If recent positive evidence provided by the profitability in
our Brazilian subsidiary continues, it will provide us the opportunity to apply greater significance to our forecasts
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. We believe it is reasonably possible that sufficient positive
evidence required to release all, or a portion, of its valuation allowance will exist within the next twelve months.
This may result in a reduction of the valuation allowance and one-time tax benefit of up to $30 million.

For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 6, Income Taxes.

Minority Shareholders’ Net Income

Minority shareholders’ net income was $19 million in 2017, compared to $20 million in 2016.

2016 Compared to 2015

Goodyear net income in 2016 was $1,264 million, or $4.74 per share, compared to $307 million, or $1.12 per
share, in 2015. The increase in Goodyear net income in 2016 was primarily driven by recognition of a loss in
2015 related to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary, a decrease in income tax expense in 2016,
primarily due to the recognition of various discrete tax benefits including the release of certain valuation
allowances, and a decrease in pension curtailment/settlement expense. Partially offsetting these items were a
reduction in royalty income of $155 million that was recognized in 2015 due to the termination of a licensing
agreement associated with the sale of our former Engineered Products business and an increase in rationalization
charges in 2016, primarily related to our plan to close our manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany.

Net Sales

Net sales in 2016 of $15,158 million decreased $1,285 million, or 7.8%, compared to $16,443 million in 2015
due primarily to lower sales of $531 million as a result of the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary,
unfavorable foreign currency translation of $258 million, primarily in EMEA and Americas, a decline in price
and product mix of $230 million, primarily in EMEA and Americas, driven by the impact of lower raw material
costs on pricing, lower sales in other tire-related businesses of $188 million, primarily related to motorcycle tire
sales in Americas due to the dissolution of the global alliance with SRI, and lower tire unit volume of
$75 million. Consumer and commercial net sales in 2016 were $9,414 million and $2,806 million, respectively.
Consumer and commercial net sales in 2015 were $9,907 million and $3,342 million, respectively.

The decrease in worldwide tire unit sales of 0.1 million units, or 0.1%, compared to 2015, included a decrease of
1.9 million OE tire units, or 3.7%, comprised primarily of decreases in Americas, partially offset by increases in
Asia Pacific. Replacement tire units increased 1.8 million units, or 1.6%, comprised primarily of increases in
Asia Pacific, partially offset by decreases in Americas. The volume increases in Asia Pacific were primarily
related to replacement units in Japan due to the acquisition of NGY and growth in China and India in both OE
and replacement. The volume decreases in Americas were primarily related to the deconsolidation of our
Venezuelan subsidiary, lower consumer tire sales in the United States and Canada and the impact of the
dissolution of the global alliance with SRI. Consumer and commercial unit sales in 2016 were 153.0 million and
11.6 million, respectively. Consumer and commercial unit sales in 2015 were 152.4 million and 12.4 million,
respectively.

Cost of Goods Sold

Cost of goods sold was $10,972 million in 2016, decreasing $1,192 million, or 9.8%, from $12,164 million in
2015. CGS was 72.4% of sales in 2016 compared to 74.0% of sales in 2015. CGS in 2016 decreased due to lower
costs of $373 million as a result of the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary, lower raw material costs of
$346 million, foreign currency translation of $201 million, primarily in EMEA and Americas, lower costs in
other tire-related businesses of $127 million, primarily related to motorcycle tire sales in Americas due to the
dissolution of the global alliance with SRI, and lower volume of $51 million. CGS in 2016 included an out of
period adjustment of $24 million ($15 million after-tax and minority) of expense related to the elimination of
intracompany profit in Americas, primarily related to the years 2012 to 2015, with the majority attributable to
2012. CGS in 2016 also included pension expense of $44 million which decreased from $85 million in 2015
primarily due to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary and the change in calculating interest and
service costs in the measurement of pension expense effective January 1, 2016. Pension expense excluded
pension settlement charges in CGS of $16 million ($16 million after-tax and minority) and $91 million in 2016
and 2015, respectively.

CGS in 2016 included accelerated depreciation of $20 million ($20 million after-tax and minority), primarily
related to our plan to close our manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany and our plan to close our
Wolverhampton, U.K. mixing and retreading facility. Accelerated depreciation was $8 million ($7 million
after-tax and minority) in 2015, primarily related to our plan to close our Wolverhampton, U.K. mixing and
retreading facility.

Selling, Administrative and General Expense

SAG was $2,407 million in 2016, decreasing $207 million, or 7.9%, from $2,614 million in 2015. SAG was
15.9% of sales in both 2016 and 2015. The decrease in SAG was due to lower wages and benefits of $66 million,

12

primarily related to lower incentive compensation and savings from rationalization plans,
lower pension
settlement charges of $49 million related to a settlement that occurred in 2015, lower costs of $39 million due to
the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary, foreign currency translation of $27 million, primarily in
EMEA, and lower advertising costs of $12 million. SAG in 2016 included pension expense of $31 million which
decreased compared to $50 million in 2015, primarily due to the change in calculating interest and service costs
in the measurement of pension expense effective January 1, 2016. Pension expense excluded pension settlement
charges in SAG of $1 million ($1 million after-tax and minority) and $49 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Rationalizations

We recorded net rationalization charges of $210 million in 2016 ($198 million after-tax and minority). Net
rationalization charges included charges of $116 million related to the plan to close our tire manufacturing
facility in Philippsburg, Germany, $34 million related to a plan to reduce global SAG headcount, and $25 million
related to manufacturing headcount reductions in EMEA.

We recorded net rationalization charges of $114 million in 2015 ($85 million after-tax and minority). Net
rationalization charges included charges of $38 million related to the plan to close our Wolverhampton, U.K.
mixing and retreading facility and a plan to transfer consumer tire production from our manufacturing facility in
Wittlich, Germany to other manufacturing facilities in EMEA. We also initiated plans in 2015 for manufacturing
and SAG headcount reductions in EMEA and Americas.

For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 2, Costs Associated with
Rationalization Programs.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was $372 million in 2016, decreasing $66 million from $438 million in 2015. The decrease was
due primarily to lower average debt balances of $5,972 million in 2016 compared to $6,053 million in 2015, and
a decrease in average interest rates to 6.23% in 2016 compared to 7.22% in 2015. Interest expense in 2016 and
2015 included $12 million ($8 million after-tax and minority) and $16 million ($10 million after-tax and
minority), respectively, of expense related to the write-off of deferred financing fees and unamortized discounts
related to the redemption of various debt instruments.

Other Income

Other Income in 2016 was $10 million, decreasing $131 million from Other Income of $141 million in 2015. The
decrease in Other Income was due, in part, to 2016 royalty income of $23 million, which decreased $169 million
from $192 million of royalty income in 2015. Royalty income in 2015 included a one-time pre-tax gain of
$155 million ($99 million after-tax and minority) on the recognition of deferred royalty income resulting from
the termination of a licensing agreement associated with the sale of our former Engineered Products business.

Other Income in 2016 included net gains on asset sales of $31 million ($26 million after-tax and minority)
compared to net gains on asset sales of $71 million ($60 million after-tax and minority) in 2015. Net gains on
asset sales in 2016 included a gain of $16 million related to the sale of a former wire plant site in Luxembourg
and a gain of $9 million related to the sale of our interest in a supply chain logistics company. Net gains on asset
sales in 2015 included a net gain of $48 million ($38 million after-tax and minority) related to the dissolution of
the global alliance with SRI and a gain of $30 million ($32 million after-tax and minority) on the sale of our
investment in shares of SRI. Net gains on asset sales in 2015 also included losses of $14 million in EMEA,
primarily related to the sales of certain sub-Saharan Africa retail businesses.

Other Income included net foreign currency exchange gains of $13 million in 2016, an improvement of
$90 million from net foreign currency exchange losses of $77 million in 2015. Foreign currency exchange
reflects net gains and losses resulting from the effect of exchange rate changes on various foreign currency
transactions worldwide, including $34 million of losses in 2015 related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan
bolivar fuerte against the U.S. dollar.

13

Other Income in 2016 included charges of $53 million ($37 million after-tax and minority) for premiums related
to the redemption of various debt instruments and $10 million ($6 million after-tax and minority) for legal claims
unrelated to operations. Other Income in 2016 also included gains of $24 million ($15 million after-tax and
minority) for the recovery of past costs from several of our asbestos insurers. Other Income in 2015 included
charges of $4 million ($4 million after-tax and minority) for labor claims related to a previously closed facility in
Greece.

Expense.

Income Taxes

Income tax benefit in 2016 was $77 million on income before income taxes of $1,207 million. For 2015, income
tax expense was $232 million on income before income taxes of $608 million. The decrease in income taxes for
2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to net discrete adjustments of $458 million ($459 million after
minority interest), due primarily to a tax benefit of $331 million from the December 31, 2016 release of the
valuation allowances on certain subsidiaries in England, France, Luxembourg and New Zealand. The release of
the valuation allowances on these subsidiaries is net of 2016 tax law changes that reduced deferred tax assets by
$23 million. As of each reporting date, management considers new evidence that could affect our view of
realization of our deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2016, these subsidiaries, on which we have previously
maintained a full valuation allowance, were located in jurisdictions with unlimited carryforward periods for
utilization of tax losses and have achieved earnings of a duration and magnitude that they were in a position of
cumulative profits for the most recent three-year period. As a consequence of this profitability in recent periods
and our future business plans forecasting sustainable profitability, we concluded that it was more likely than not
that our deferred tax assets in these entities will be realized. The 2016 income tax benefit included a $163 million
tax benefit resulting from changing our election for our 2009, 2010 and 2012 U.S. tax years from deducting
foreign taxes to crediting foreign taxes. Since making our initial election to deduct foreign taxes paid, as opposed
to taking them as a credit, the profitability of our U.S. operations has significantly improved. In 2014, as a
consequence of our U.S. operations being in a position of cumulative profits for the most recent three-year
period, we released our U.S. valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets including our foreign tax credits. Our
U.S. profitability has continued and the Company forecasts sufficient income of the appropriate character that
will allow us to fully utilize these additional foreign tax credits before expiration. Based on these facts, we
elected to claim a credit instead of deducting these foreign taxes in 2016. The 2016 income tax benefit included a
$39 million tax charge to establish a valuation allowance in the U.S. on deferred tax assets related to receivables
from our deconsolidated Venezuelan operations. These receivables were written off in the fourth quarter of 2015
when Venezuela was deconsolidated and the Company, at that time, recorded deferred tax assets for a potential
bad debt deduction in the U.S. During the third quarter of 2016,
these receivables were contributed to
Venezuela’s capital, necessitating the need for a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets due to
uncertainty as to whether we will be able to generate sufficient future capital gains to fully realize the deduction
that is now characterized as a potential capital loss. The 2016 income tax benefit also included a $7 million tax
benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance in Brazil due to the collection of a receivable that had
previously been written off as uncollectible.

Income tax expense for 2015 included discrete net tax benefits of $18 million ($18 million after minority
interest), due primarily to a $9 million benefit from the conclusion of non-U.S. tax claims and an $8 million
benefit from the release of a valuation allowance related to U.S. state deferred tax assets.

In 2015, in addition to the items noted above, the difference between our effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory
rate was primarily due to certain of our foreign subsidiaries continuing to maintain a full valuation allowance
against their net deferred tax assets, the realization of $55 million of U.S. tax credits primarily as a result of
dividend inclusions from Brazil and U.S. legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $69 million of tax
benefits related to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary.

At December 31, 2016, our valuation allowance on certain of our U.S. Federal, state and local deferred tax assets
was $139 million primarily related to our investment in our deconsolidated subsidiary in Venezuela, and our

14

valuation allowance on our foreign deferred tax assets was $187 million. As discussed above, during 2016
foreign tax credits increased due to a change in election.

For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 6, Income Taxes.

Minority Shareholders’ Net Income

Minority shareholders’ net income was $20 million in 2016, compared to $69 million in 2015. Minority
shareholders’ net income no longer includes the minority interests of Goodyear Dunlop Tires North America,
Ltd. (“GDTNA”) and Goodyear Dunlop Tires Europe B.V. (“GDTE”) following the dissolution of the global
alliance with SRI on October 1, 2015.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — SEGMENT INFORMATION

Segment information reflects our strategic business units (“SBUs”), which are organized to meet customer
requirements and global competition and are segmented on a regional basis.

Results of operations are measured based on net sales to unaffiliated customers and segment operating income.
Each segment exports tires to other segments. The financial results of each segment exclude sales of tires
exported to other segments, but include operating income derived from such transactions. Segment operating
income is computed as follows: Net Sales less CGS (excluding asset write-off and accelerated depreciation
charges) and SAG (including certain allocated corporate administrative expenses). Segment operating income
also includes certain royalties and equity in earnings of most affiliates. Segment operating income does not
include net rationalization charges (credits), asset sales and certain other items.

Total segment operating income was $1,522 million in 2017, $1,985 million in 2016 and $2,020 million in 2015.
Total segment operating margin (segment operating income divided by segment sales) in 2017 was 9.9%,
compared to 13.1% in 2016 and 12.3% in 2015.

Management believes that total segment operating income is useful because it represents the aggregate value of
income created by our SBUs and excludes items not directly related to the SBUs for performance evaluation
purposes. Total segment operating income is the sum of the individual SBUs’ segment operating income. Refer
to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 8, Business Segments, for further information and for a
reconciliation of total segment operating income to Income before Income Taxes.

2017 Compared to 2016

Americas unit sales in 2017 decreased 3.2 million units, or 4.4%, to 70.9 million units. OE tire volume decreased
1.7 million units, or 9.0%, primarily in consumer OE in the United States, driven by changes in OEM production.
Replacement tire volume decreased 1.5 million units, or 2.8%, primarily in consumer replacement in the United
States, Mexico and Canada. Declines in consumer replacement volumes in the United States were primarily
driven by increased competition and lower volumes in 16 inch and below rim size tires.

Net sales in 2017 were $8,212 million, increasing $40 million, or 0.5%, compared to $8,172 million in 2016. The
increase in net sales was driven by improvements in price and product mix of $168 million, primarily due to the

15

impact of higher raw material costs on pricing, higher sales in other tire-related businesses of $104 million,
primarily driven by an increase in price for third-party sales of chemical products, and favorable foreign currency
translation of $49 million, primarily in Brazil. These increases in net sales were partially offset by lower tire
volume of $281 million.

Operating income in 2017 was $825 million, decreasing $326 million, or 28.3%, from $1,151 million in 2016.
The decrease in operating income was due to increased raw material costs of $266 million, which more than
offset improvements in price and product mix of $131 million, unfavorable conversion costs of $108 million,
primarily due to increased under-absorbed overhead resulting from lower production volumes, lower tire unit
volume of $79 million, and incremental start-up costs of $28 million associated with our new plant in San Luis
Potosi, Mexico. These decreases in operating income were partially offset by the impact of an out of period
adjustment in 2016 of $24 million of expense related to the elimination of intracompany profit, primarily related
to the years 2012 to 2015, with the majority attributable to 2012, and lower SAG of $16 million, primarily related
to lower incentive compensation and lower advertising expense. SAG included incremental savings from
rationalization plans of $23 million. During the third quarter of 2017, several Company facilities were directly
impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which negatively impacted Americas operating income by about
$6 million in 2017.

Operating income in 2017 excluded rationalization charges of $6 million and net gains on asset sales of
$4 million. Operating income in 2016 excluded rationalization charges of $15 million, net gains on asset sales of
$4 million and accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs of $1 million.

Americas’ results are highly dependent upon the United States, which accounted for approximately 81% and
82% of Americas’ net sales in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Results of operations in the United States are
expected to continue to have a significant impact on Americas’ future performance.

2016 Compared to 2015

Americas unit sales in 2016 decreased 5.0 million units, or 6.3%, to 74.1 million units. Americas unit volume
decreased 1.4 million units due to the impact of the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary and 0.9 million
units due to the dissolution of the global alliance with SRI. OE tire volume decreased 2.6 million units, or 12.1%,
primarily driven by the dissolution of the global alliance with SRI, continuing weakness in Brazil, lower sales in
Canada and a decline in commercial tire volume in the United States. Replacement tire volume decreased
2.4 million units, or 4.1%, primarily due to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary and lower
consumer sales in the United States and Canada. Declines in consumer volume related to sales of 16 inch and
below rim size tires in the U.S. and Canada were partially offset by increases in volume related to sales of 17
inch and above rim size tires.

Net sales in 2016 were $8,172 million, decreasing $1,198 million, or 12.8%, compared to $9,370 million in 2015.
The decrease in net sales was due to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary of $531 million, lower
volume of $317 million, lower sales in other tire-related businesses of $169 million, primarily driven by a
$113 million decrease in motorcycle tire sales due to the dissolution of the global alliance with SRI and
$45 million related to our retail and retread businesses, unfavorable foreign currency translation of $102 million,
primarily in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil, and a decline in price and product mix of $78 million, primarily
driven by the impact of lower raw material costs on pricing.

Operating income in 2016 was $1,151 million, decreasing $115 million, or 9.1%, from $1,266 million in 2015.
The decrease in operating income was due to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary of $119 million,
lower volume of $84 million, lower income in other tire-related businesses of $57 million, primarily due to
decreased motorcycle tire sales as a result of the dissolution of the global alliance with SRI and reduced margins
in our commercial retail business, and unfavorable conversion costs of $46 million primarily due to lower
production volume and general inflation. Operating income was also negatively impacted by an out of period
adjustment in the second quarter of 2016 of $24 million of expense related to the elimination of intracompany
profit, primarily related to the years 2012 to 2015, with the majority attributable to 2012, lower price and product
mix of $18 million and incremental start-up costs of $14 million associated with our new plant being constructed

16

in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. These decreases in operating income were partially offset by lower raw material
costs of $189 million and lower SAG of $70 million, primarily due to a decrease in wages and other benefits,
including incentive compensation. Conversion costs and SAG included incremental savings from rationalization
plans of $1 million and $19 million, respectively.

Operating income in 2016 excluded rationalization charges of $15 million, net gains on asset sales of $4 million
and accelerated depreciation of $1 million. Operating income in 2015 excluded net pension settlement charges of
$137 million, rationalization charges of $15 million and net gains on asset sales of $2 million.

2017 Compared to 2016

Europe, Middle East and Africa unit sales in 2017 decreased 4.0 million units, or 6.5%, to 57.1 million units.
Replacement tire volume decreased 2.4 million units, or 5.5%, primarily in our consumer business caused by
decreased industry demand for 16 inch and below rim size tires and increased competition. OE tire volume
decreased 1.6 million units, or 9.0%, primarily in our consumer business, driven by 16 inch and below rim size
tires, as a result of the continuation of our OE selectivity strategy, increased competition and reduced OEM
production due to certain customers managing inventory levels.

Net sales in 2017 were $4,928 million, increasing $48 million, or 1.0%, compared to $4,880 million in 2016. Net
sales increased due to improvements in price and product mix of $244 million, due to our increased focus on 17
inch and above rim size tires and the impact of higher raw material costs on pricing, and favorable foreign
currency translation of $112 million, primarily related to strengthening of the euro. These increases were
partially offset by the impact of lower tire unit volume of $303 million.

Operating income in 2017 was $355 million, decreasing $106 million, or 23.0%, compared to $461 million in
2016. Operating income decreased due to higher raw material costs of $229 million, which more than offset
improvements in price and product mix of $176 million, lower sales volume of $91 million and higher
conversion costs of $31 million, primarily related to under-absorbed overhead due to lower production levels.
These decreases were partially offset by lower SAG of $59 million, primarily driven by lower advertising costs
and lower wages and benefits due to restructuring savings and lower incentive compensation, and favorable
foreign currency translation of $9 million, primarily related to the strengthening of the euro. SAG and conversion
costs included savings from rationalization plans of $19 million and $49 million, respectively.

Operating income in 2017 excluded net rationalization charges of $111 million, primarily related to programs
initiated to streamline operations and reduce complexity across EMEA. Operating income in 2017 also excluded
charges for accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs of $40 million, related to the closure of our plant in
Philippsburg, Germany, as well as gains on asset sales of $10 million, driven by the sale of a former wire plant
site in Luxembourg. Operating income in 2016 excluded net rationalization charges of $184 million, which
primarily related to the plan to close our tire manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany and programs
initiated to streamline operations and reduce complexity across EMEA. Operating income in 2016 also excluded
charges for accelerated depreciation of $19 million, primarily related to our plan to close our tire manufacturing
facility in Philippsburg, Germany and the closure of our Wolverhampton, U.K. mixing and retreading facility, as
well as gains on asset sales of $17 million, primarily related to the sale of a former wire plant site in
Luxembourg.

17

EMEA’s results are highly dependent upon Germany, which accounted for approximately 38% of EMEA’s net
sales in 2017 and 2016. Results of operations in Germany are expected to continue to have a significant impact
on EMEA’s future performance.

2016 Compared to 2015

Europe, Middle East and Africa unit sales in 2016 were consistent with 2015 at 61.1 million units. OE tire
volume was consistent with the prior year. Replacement tire volume was also consistent with the prior year as
increases in sales of 17 inch and above rim size tires were offset by decreases in sales of 16 inch and below rim
size tires that were driven by lower industry demand and increased competition.

Net sales in 2016 were $4,880 million, decreasing $235 million, or 4.6%, compared to $5,115 million in 2015.
Net sales decreased due primarily to unfavorable foreign currency translation of $110 million, primarily related
to devaluation of the British pound and the South African rand, unfavorable price and product mix of
$107 million, driven by the impact of lower raw material costs on pricing, and lower sales from other tire related
business of $19 million, primarily related to our retread business.

Operating income in 2016 was $461 million, increasing $26 million, or 6.0%, compared to $435 million in 2015.
Operating income increased primarily due to lower conversion costs of $29 million related to higher production
levels in the first half of the year and lower SAG of $17 million, driven by lower incentive compensation and
fees for professional services. The increase in operating income was partially offset by the effect of lower price
and product mix of $114 million, which more than offset a decline in raw material costs of $110 million,
unfavorable foreign currency translation of $8 million and higher pension costs of $6 million. SAG and
conversion costs included incremental savings from rationalization plans of $13 million and $10 million,
respectively, primarily related to the closure of our Wolverhampton, U.K. mixing and retreading facility and
programs initiated to streamline operations and reduce complexity across EMEA.

Operating income in 2016 excluded net rationalization charges of $184 million, which primarily related to the
plan to close our tire manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany and programs initiated to streamline
operations and reduce complexity across EMEA. Operating income in 2016 also excluded charges for accelerated
depreciation of $19 million, primarily related to our plan to close our tire manufacturing facility in Philippsburg,
Germany and the closure of our Wolverhampton, U.K. mixing and retreading facility, as well as gains on asset
sales of $17 million, primarily related to the sale of a former wire plant site in Luxembourg. Operating income in
2015 excluded net rationalization charges of $95 million, primarily related to the closure of our Wolverhampton,
U.K. mixing and retreading facility and one of our Amiens, France manufacturing facilities, and charges for
accelerated depreciation of $8 million. Operating income in 2015 also excluded net losses on asset sales of
$14 million, primarily related to the sales of certain sub-Saharan Africa retail businesses and charges of
$4 million related to labor claims with respect to a previously closed facility in Greece.

lower volumes in the commercial business. OE tire volume increased 0.2 million units, or 1.1%, primarily due to
growth in India, partially offset by lower volumes in China.

18

Net sales in 2017 were $2,237 million, increasing $131 million, or 6.2%, from $2,106 million in 2016. Net sales
increased by $109 million due to improvements in price and product mix, primarily due to the impact of higher
raw material costs on pricing, $17 million due to favorable foreign currency translation, and $15 million due to
higher tire volume. These increases were partially offset by lower sales in other tire-related businesses of
$11 million, primarily in retail.

Operating income in 2017 was $342 million, decreasing $31 million, or 8.3%, from $373 million in 2016.
Operating income decreased due to higher raw material costs of $123 million, which more than offset
improvements in price and product mix of $113 million, a decrease in incentives recognized for the expansion of
our factory in China of $13 million, and lower income in other tire-related businesses of $9 million, primarily in
retail. These decreases were partially offset by higher volume of $4 million.

Operating income in 2017 excluded net rationalization charges of $2 million. Operating income in 2016 excluded
net gains on asset sales of $1 million and net rationalization charges of $1 million.

Asia Pacific’s results are highly dependent upon China and Australia. China accounted for approximately 28%
and 29% of Asia Pacific’s net sales in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Australia accounted for approximately 27%
of Asia Pacific’s net sales in 2017 and 2016. Results of operations in China and Australia are expected to
continue to have a significant impact on Asia Pacific’s future performance.

2016 Compared to 2015

Asia Pacific unit sales in 2016 increased 4.9 million units, or 18.9%, to 30.9 million units. Replacement tire
volume increased 4.2 million units, or 28.7%, primarily in the consumer business, due to the acquisition of a
controlling interest in NGY in Japan, which increased tire volume by 3.2 million units, and growth in China and
India. OE tire volume increased 0.7 million units, or 6.9%, primarily in the consumer business, which reflected
growth in China and India.

Net sales in 2016 were $2,106 million, increasing $148 million, or 7.6%, from $1,958 million in 2015. Net sales
increased by $239 million due to higher tire volume, including $129 million related to the acquisition of a
controlling interest in NGY. This increase was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of
$46 million, primarily related to the strong U.S. dollar against most Asian currencies except the Japanese yen,
and lower price and product mix of $45 million, driven primarily by the impact of lower raw material costs on
pricing.

Operating income in 2016 was $373 million, increasing $54 million, or 16.9%, from $319 million in 2015.
Operating income increased due primarily to higher tire volume of $62 million, lower raw material costs of
$47 million, which offset the effects of lower price and product mix of $46 million, lower conversion costs of
$18 million, due to the favorable impact of higher production levels on absorbed overhead, and an increase of
$18 million related to incentives for the expansion of our factory in China. These increases were partially offset
by higher SAG of $31 million, primarily driven by the acquisition of a controlling interest in NGY, and
unfavorable foreign currency translation of $10 million.

Operating income in 2016 excluded net gains on asset sales of $1 million and net rationalization charges of
$1 million. Operating income in 2015 excluded net gains on asset sales of $5 million and net rationalization
charges of $4 million.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and related notes to the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates,
based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may alter such estimates and affect
our results of operations and financial position in future periods. Our critical accounting policies relate to:

• general and product liability and other litigation,

19

• workers’ compensation,

• recoverability of goodwill,

• deferred tax asset valuation allowances and uncertain income tax positions, and

• pensions and other postretirement benefits.

General and Product Liability and Other Litigation. We have recorded liabilities totaling $316 million,
including related legal fees expected to be incurred, for potential product liability and other tort claims, including
asbestos claims, at December 31, 2017. General and product liability and other litigation liabilities are recorded
based on management’s assessment that a loss arising from these matters is probable. If the loss can be
reasonably estimated, we record the amount of the estimated loss. If the loss is estimated within a range and no
point within the range is more probable than another, we record the minimum amount in the range. As additional
information becomes available, any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are
revised, if necessary. Loss ranges are based upon the specific facts of each claim or class of claims and are
determined after review by counsel. Court rulings on our cases or similar cases may impact our assessment of the
probability and our estimate of the loss, which may have an impact on our reported results of operations,
financial position and liquidity. We record receivables for insurance recoveries related to our litigation claims
when it is probable that we will receive reimbursement from the insurer. Specifically, we are a defendant in
numerous lawsuits alleging various asbestos-related personal injuries purported to result from alleged exposure
to asbestos in certain products manufactured by us or present in certain of our facilities. Typically, these lawsuits
have been brought against multiple defendants in Federal and state courts.

In determining the estimate of our asbestos liability, we evaluated claims over the next ten year period. Due to
the difficulties in making these estimates, analysis based on new data and/or changed circumstances arising in the
future may result in an increase in the recorded obligation, and that increase may be significant. We had recorded
gross liabilities for both asserted and unasserted asbestos claims, inclusive of defense costs, totaling $167 million
at December 31, 2017.

We maintain certain primary and excess insurance coverage under coverage-in-place agreements, and also have
additional excess liability insurance with respect to asbestos liabilities. We record a receivable with respect to
such policies when we determine that recovery is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of a
particular recovery. This determination is based on consultation with our outside legal counsel and taking into
consideration agreements with certain of our insurance carriers, the financial viability and legal obligations of our
insurance carriers and other relevant factors.

As of December 31, 2017, we recorded a receivable related to asbestos claims of $113 million, and we expect
that approximately 70% of asbestos claim related losses would be recoverable through insurance through the
period covered by the estimated liability. Of this amount, $15 million was included in Current Assets as part of
Accounts Receivable at December 31, 2017. The recorded receivable consists of an amount we expect to collect
under coverage-in-place agreements with certain primary and excess insurance carriers as well as an amount we
believe is probable of recovery from certain of our other excess insurance carriers. Although we believe these
amounts are collectible under primary and certain excess policies today, future disputes with insurers could result
in significant charges to operations.

Workers’ Compensation. We had recorded liabilities, on a discounted basis, of $243 million for anticipated
costs related to U.S. workers’ compensation claims at December 31, 2017. The costs include an estimate of
expected settlements on pending claims, defense costs and a provision for claims incurred but not reported. These
estimates are based on our assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with
respect to pending claims, historical experience and current cost trends. The amount of our ultimate liability in
respect of these matters may differ from these estimates. We periodically, and at least annually, update our loss
development factors based on actuarial analyses. The liability is discounted using the risk-free rate of return.

For further information on general and product liability and other litigation, and workers’ compensation, refer to
the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 19, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.

Recoverability of Goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an indicator of
impairment is present. Goodwill totaled $595 million at December 31, 2017.

We test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis, with the option to perform a qualitative assessment
to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary or to perform a quantitative assessment by
comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. Under the qualitative
assessment, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that
it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50%) that its fair value is less than its carrying
amount. If under the quantitative assessment the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount,
then the amount of the impairment loss, if any, must be measured.

At October 31, 2017, after considering changes to assumptions used in our most recent quantitative annual
testing for each reporting unit, including the capital markets environment, economic conditions, tire industry
competition and trends, changes in our results of operations, the magnitude of the excess of fair value over the
carrying amount of each reporting unit as determined in our most recent quantitative annual testing, and other
factors, we concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were less than
their respective carrying values and, therefore, did not perform a quantitative analysis.

Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowances and Uncertain Income Tax Positions. At December 31, 2017, we had
valuation allowances aggregating $318 million against certain of our U.S. Federal, state and local and foreign net
deferred tax assets.

We record a reduction to the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based
on the available evidence, it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized. The valuation of deferred tax
assets requires judgment in assessing future profitability and the tax consequences of events that have been
recognized in either our financial statements or tax returns.

We consider both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance. The weight
given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it may be objectively verified. Current and
cumulative financial reporting results are a source of objectively verifiable evidence. We give operating results
during the most recent three-year period a significant weight in our analysis. We typically only consider forecasts
of future profitability when positive cumulative operating results exist in the most recent three-year period. We
perform scheduling exercises to determine if sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character exists in the
periods required in order to realize our deferred tax assets with limited lives (tax loss carryforwards and tax
credits) prior to their expiration. We consider tax planning strategies available to accelerate taxable amounts if
required to utilize expiring deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is not required to the extent that, in our
judgment, positive evidence exists with a magnitude and duration sufficient to result in a conclusion that it is
more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized.

We recognize the effects of changes in tax rates and laws on deferred tax balances in the period in which
legislation is enacted. We remeasure existing deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the tax rates at which
they will be realized. We also consider the effects of enacted tax laws in our analysis of the need for valuation
allowances. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted in the United States, which establishes a corporate
income tax rate of 21% effective January 1, 2018, replacing the current 35% rate, and creates a territorial tax
system rather than a worldwide system. Certain impacts of the new legislation would generally require
accounting to be completed in the period of enactment, however in response to the complexities of this new
legislation, the SEC issued guidance to provide companies with relief. Specifically, when the initial accounting
for items under the new legislation is incomplete, the guidance allows us to include provisional amounts when
reasonable estimates can be made. The SEC has provided up to a one year window for companies to finalize the
accounting for the impacts of this new legislation and we anticipate finalizing our accounting over the coming
quarters. While our accounting for the Tax Act is not complete, we have made reasonable estimates for certain
provisions and we have recorded a non-cash net charge to tax expense of $299 million related to its enactment.
This net charge includes a deferred tax charge of $384 million primarily from revaluing our net U.S. deferred tax
assets to reflect the new U.S. corporate tax rate. We believe this calculation is complete except for changes in
estimates that can result from finalizing the filing of our 2017 U.S. income tax return, which are not anticipated

21

to be material, and changes that may be a direct impact of other provisional amounts recorded due to the
enactment of the Tax Act. The net charge also includes a provisional deferred tax benefit of $162 million to
reverse reserves maintained for the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings under prior law net of reserves
established for foreign withholding taxes consistent with our revised indefinite reinvestment assertion, and a
provisional deferred tax charge of $77 million related to the one-time transition tax.

Effective January 1, 2018, the Tax Act subjects a U.S. parent to current tax on its “global intangible low-taxed
income” (“GILTI”). We do not anticipate incurring a GILTI liability, however, to the extent that we incur
expense under the GILTI provisions we will treat it as a component of income tax expense in the period incurred.

The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax
regulations, including those for transfer pricing. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on
our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If we ultimately determine that
payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in
which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We also recognize income tax benefits to the extent
that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained when challenged by the taxing authorities. We
derecognize income tax benefits when, based on new information, we determine that it is no longer more likely
than not that our position will be sustained. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been
established, or determine we need to derecognize tax benefits recorded in prior periods, our results of operations
and effective tax rate in a given period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require
use of our cash, and lead to recognition of expense to the extent the settlement amount exceeds recorded
liabilities, resulting in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. To reduce our risk of an
unfavorable transfer price settlement, the Company applies consistent transfer pricing policies and practices
globally, supports pricing with economic studies and seeks advance pricing agreements and joint audits to the
extent possible. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction of expense to the extent the
settlement amount is lower than recorded liabilities and, in the case of an income tax settlement, would result in a
reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. We report interest and penalties related to uncertain
income tax positions as income taxes.

For additional information regarding uncertain income tax positions and valuation allowances, refer to the Note
to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 6, Income Taxes.

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. We have recorded liabilities for pension and other postretirement
benefits of $656 million and $282 million, respectively, at December 31, 2017. Our recorded liabilities and net
periodic costs for pensions and other postretirement benefits are based on a number of assumptions, including:

• life expectancies,

• retirement rates,

• discount rates,

• long term rates of return on plan assets,

• inflation rates,

• future compensation levels,

• future health care costs, and

• maximum company-covered benefit costs.

Certain of these assumptions are determined with the assistance of independent actuaries. Assumptions about life
expectancies, retirement rates, future compensation levels and future health care costs are based on past
experience and anticipated future trends. The discount rate for our U.S. plans is based on a yield curve derived
from a portfolio of corporate bonds from issuers rated AA or higher as of December 31 and is reviewed annually.
Our expected benefit payment cash flows are discounted based on spot rates developed from the yield curve. The
mortality assumption for our U.S. plans is based on actual historical experience, an assumed long term rate of

22

future improvement based on published actuarial tables, and current government regulations related to lump sum
payment factors. The long term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is based on estimates of future long term rates
of return similar to the target allocation of substantially all fixed income securities. Actual U.S. pension fund
asset allocations are reviewed on a monthly basis and the pension fund is rebalanced to target ranges on an
as-needed basis. These assumptions are reviewed regularly and revised when appropriate. Changes in one or
more of them may affect the amount of our recorded liabilities and net periodic costs for these benefits. Other
assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age and turnover are evaluated periodically and
are updated to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. If the actual experience differs from
expectations, our financial position, results of operations and liquidity in future periods may be affected.

The weighted average discount rate used in estimating the total liability for our U.S. pension and other
postretirement benefit plans was 3.56% and 3.44%, respectively, at December 31, 2017, compared to 3.99% and
3.72%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. The decrease in the discount rate at December 31, 2017 was due
primarily to lower yields on highly rated corporate bonds. Interest cost included in our U.S. net periodic pension
cost was $160 million in 2017, compared to $164 million in 2016 and $238 million in 2015. Interest cost
included in our worldwide net periodic other postretirement benefits cost was $13 million in 2017, compared to
$12 million in 2016 and $15 million in 2015. 2017 and 2016 interest costs reflect the election to measure interest
cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to
the relevant projected cash flows for plans that utilize a yield curve approach.

The following table presents the sensitivity of our U.S. projected pension benefit obligation, accumulated other
postretirement benefits obligation, and annual expense to the indicated increase/decrease in key assumptions:

Changes in general interest rates and corporate (AA or better) credit spreads impact our discount rate and thereby
our U.S. pension benefit obligation. Our U.S. pension plans are invested in a portfolio of substantially all fixed
income securities designed to offset the impact of future discount rate movements on liabilities for these plans. If
corporate (AA or better) interest rates increase or decrease in parallel (i.e., across all maturities), the investment
portfolio described above is designed to mitigate a substantial portion of the expected change in our U.S. pension
benefit obligation. For example, if corporate (AA or better) interest rates increased or decreased by 0.50%, the
actions described above would be expected to mitigate more than 85% of the expected change in our U.S.
pension benefit obligation.

At December 31, 2017, our net actuarial loss included in AOCL related to global pension plans was $3,272 million,
$2,603 million of which related to our U.S. pension plans. The net actuarial loss included in AOCL related to our
U.S. pension plans is a result of declines in U.S. discount rates and plan asset losses that occurred prior to 2015, plus
the impact of prior increases in estimated life expectancies. For purposes of determining our 2017 U.S. pension total
benefits cost, we recognized $140 million of the net actuarial losses in 2017. We will recognize approximately
$114 million of net actuarial losses in 2018 U.S. net periodic pension cost. If our future experience is consistent
with our assumptions as of December 31, 2017, actuarial loss recognition over the next few years will remain at an
amount near that to be recognized in 2018 before it begins to gradually decline. In addition, if annual lump sum
payments from a pension plan exceed annual service and interest cost for that plan, accelerated recognition of net
actuarial losses will be required through a settlement in total benefits cost.

23

The actual rate of return on our U.S. pension fund was 8.7%, 6.9% and (2.1%) in 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, as compared to the expected rate of 5.08%, 5.33% and 5.00% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
We use the fair value of our pension assets in the calculation of pension expense for all of our U.S. pension plans.

The weighted average amortization period for our U.S. pension plans is approximately 18 years.

Net periodic pension costs were recorded in CGS, as part of the cost of inventory sold during the period, or SAG
in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, based on the specific roles (i.e., manufacturing vs.
non-manufacturing) of employee groups covered by each of our pension plans. In 2017, 2016 and 2015,
approximately 60% and 40% of net periodic pension costs are included in CGS and SAG, respectively. Effective
January 1, 2018, non-service related net periodic pension costs will be recorded in Other (Income) Expense in
line with the accounting standards update issued by the FASB to improve the financial statement presentation of
pension and post retirement benefits cost. Refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 1,
Accounting Policies.

Globally we expect our 2018 net periodic pension cost to be approximately $100 million to $125 million,
compared to $88 million in 2017. The increase is primarily due to the impact of lower discount rates for our U.S.
pension plans.

We experienced a decrease in our U.S. discount rate at the end of 2017 and a large portion of the net actuarial
loss included in AOCL of $47 million for our worldwide other postretirement benefit plans as of December 31,
2017 is a result of the overall decline in U.S. discount rates over time. For purposes of determining 2017
worldwide net periodic other postretirement benefits cost, we recognized $6 million of net actuarial losses in
2017. We will recognize approximately $5 million of net actuarial losses in 2018. If our future experience is
consistent with our assumptions as of December 31, 2017, actuarial loss recognition over the next few years will
remain at an amount near that to be recognized in 2018 before it begins to gradually decline.

Financial Statements No. 17, Pension, Other Postretirement Benefits and Savings Plans.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

OVERVIEW

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating and financing activities. Our cash flows
from operating activities are driven primarily by our operating results and changes in our working capital
requirements and our cash flows from financing activities are dependent upon our ability to access credit or other
capital.

On February 8, 2018, we announced our 2018-2020 capital allocation plan that
is intended to increase
shareholder value by investing in high-return growth capital projects, strengthening our balance sheet and
providing for direct returns to shareholders. The capital allocation plan provides for:

• Growth capital expenditures of $700 million to $900 million.

• Debt repayments of $400 million to $600 million, which advances our objective of achieving an

investment grade credit rating.

• Restructuring payments of approximately $400 million.

• Common stock dividends and share repurchases of $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion, subject to our performance.

We announced a 40% increase in the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock, from $0.10 per share to
$0.14 per share, beginning with the December 1, 2017 payment date.

In March 2017, we issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2027. These
notes were sold at 100% of the principal amount and will mature on March 15, 2027. These notes are unsecured
senior obligations and are guaranteed by our U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries that also guarantee our obligations
under our U.S. senior secured credit facilities.

24

In May 2017, we used the proceeds from the $700 million 4.875% senior notes due 2027, together with cash and
cash equivalents, to redeem in full our $700 million 7% senior notes due 2022, which included the payment of a
$25 million redemption premium plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. We also recorded
$6 million of expense for the write-off of deferred financing fees as a result of the redemption.

For further information on the other strategic initiatives we pursued in 2017, refer to “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview.”

At December 31, 2017, we had $1,043 million of Cash and Cash Equivalents, compared to $1,132 million at
December 31, 2016. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $89 million was primarily due to cash used for
investing activities of $879 million, primarily related to capital expenditures of $881 million; cash used for
financing activities of $415 million, primarily related to common stock repurchases of $400 million and common
stock dividends of $110 million, partially offset by net borrowings of $129 million. These uses of cash were
partially offset by cash flows from operating activities of $1,158 million, which included net income of
$365 million and non-cash depreciation and amortization of $781 million.

At December 31, 2017 and 2016 we had $3,196 million and $2,970 million, respectively, of unused availability
under our various credit agreements. The table below provides unused availability by our significant credit
facilities as of December 31:

We have deposited our cash and cash equivalents and entered into various credit agreements and derivative
contracts with financial institutions that we considered to be substantial and creditworthy at the time of such
transactions. We seek to control our exposure to these financial institutions by diversifying our deposits, credit
agreements and derivative contracts across multiple financial institutions, by setting deposit and counterparty
credit limits based on long term credit ratings and other indicators of credit risk such as credit default swap
spreads, and by monitoring the financial strength of these financial institutions on a regular basis. We also enter
into master netting agreements with counterparties when possible. By controlling and monitoring exposure to

nonperformance by a financial institution. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience
losses or delays in accessing our deposits or lines of credit due to the nonperformance of a financial institution.
Our inability to access our cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit, or the inability of a counterparty to
fulfill its contractual obligations to us, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition
or results of operations in the period in which it occurs.

institutions in this manner, we believe that we effectively manage the risk of

We expect our 2018 cash flow needs to include capital expenditures of approximately $1.0 billion. We also
expect
interest expense to range between $335 million and $360 million, restructuring payments to be
approximately $200 million, dividends on our common stock to be approximately $135 million, and
contributions to our funded non-U.S. pension plans to be approximately $25 million to $50 million. We expect
working capital to be a use of cash of approximately $100 million in 2018. We intend to operate the business in a
way that allows us to address these needs with our existing cash and available credit if they cannot be funded by
cash generated from operations.

We believe that our liquidity position is adequate to fund our operating and investing needs and debt maturities in
2018 and to provide us with flexibility to respond to further changes in the business environment.

25

Our ability to service debt and operational requirements is also dependent, in part, on the ability of our
subsidiaries to make distributions of cash to various other entities in our consolidated group, whether in the form
of dividends, loans or otherwise. In certain countries where we operate, such as China and South Africa, transfers
of funds into or out of such countries by way of dividends, loans, advances or payments to third-party or
affiliated suppliers are generally or periodically subject to certain requirements, such as obtaining approval from
the foreign government and/or currency exchange board before net assets can be transferred out of the country. In
addition, certain of our credit agreements and other debt instruments limit the ability of foreign subsidiaries to
make distributions of cash. Thus, we would have to repay and/or amend these credit agreements and other debt
instruments in order to use this cash to service our consolidated debt. Because of the inherent uncertainty of
satisfactorily meeting these requirements or limitations, we do not consider the net assets of our subsidiaries,
including our Chinese and South African subsidiaries, which are subject to such requirements or limitations, to
be integral to our liquidity or our ability to service our debt and operational requirements. At December 31, 2017,
approximately $807 million of net assets, including $103 million of cash and cash equivalents, were subject to
such requirements. The requirements we must comply with to transfer funds out of China and South Africa have
not adversely impacted our ability to make transfers out of those countries.

Cash Position

At December 31, 2017, significant concentrations of cash and cash equivalents held by our international
subsidiaries included the following amounts:

• $355 million or 34% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, primarily Belgium ($310 million or 27% at

December 31, 2016),

• $344 million or 33% in Asia Pacific, primarily India, China and Australia ($427 million or 38% at

December 31, 2016), and

• $169 million or 16% in Americas, primarily Canada and Brazil ($203 million or 18% at December 31,

2016).

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,158 million in 2017, compared to $1,557 million in 2016 and
$1,728 million in 2015. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2017 decreased $399 million compared to
2016 primarily due to a $463 million decrease in segment operating income.

Cash used for working capital in 2017 was $106 million compared to $117 million in 2016. Cash used for
working capital in 2017 reflects the impacts of higher raw materials on our costs and pricing, driving year-over-
year increases in cash used for accounts receivable of $358 million and cash provided by accounts payable of
$241 million, as the balances of each remaining on our year-end balance sheet are higher compared to the prior
year. Cash used for inventory decreased $128 million during 2017 as the impacts of higher raw materials were
more than offset by the impact of reduced production levels.

The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2016 versus 2015 was primarily due to an increased use
of cash for working capital of $75 million and lower segment operating income of $35 million.

The increased use of cash for working capital in 2016 was due to an increase in cash used for accounts payable of
$234 million, primarily due to the timing of payments and 2015 payables that were paid in 2016 which reflected
higher average raw material prices, and inventories of $83 million, driven by an increase in year-end inventory
units for finished goods in 2016. These uses of cash were partially offset by positive year-over-year cash flow
from accounts receivable of $242 million, primarily due to increased factoring activity in 2016.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $879 million in 2017, compared to $979 million in 2016 and
$1,256 million in 2015. Capital expenditures were $881 million in 2017, compared to $996 million in 2016 and
$983 million in 2015. Beyond expenditures required to sustain our facilities, capital expenditures in 2017

26

primarily related to the construction, expansion and modernization of manufacturing capacity in the United
States, Mexico, China and India. Capital expenditures in 2016 primarily related to the construction, expansion
and modernization of manufacturing capacity in the United States, Brazil, China and Mexico. Capital
expenditures in 2015 primarily related to the construction, expansion and modernization of manufacturing
capacity in the United States, Brazil, China, Germany and Mexico. Proceeds from asset sales were $12 million in
2017. Proceeds from asset sales were $35 million in 2016, primarily related to the sale of a former wire plant site
in Luxembourg and the sale of our interest in a supply chain logistics company. Proceeds from asset sales were
$62 million in 2015, primarily related to the sale of our investment in shares of SRI.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $415 million in 2017, compared to net cash used of $876 million in
2016 and net cash used of $1,026 million in 2015. Financing activities in 2017 included net borrowings of
$129 million. Financing activities in 2016 included net debt repayments of $256 million. Financing activities in
2015 included net debt repayments of $477 million and a payment related to the dissolution of the global alliance
with SRI of $271 million. In 2017, we paid dividends on our common stock of $110 million and repurchased
$400 million of our common stock, as compared to dividend payments of $82 million and common stock share
repurchases of $500 million in 2016. In 2015, dividend payments were $68 million and common stock share
repurchases were $180 million.

Credit Sources

In aggregate, we had total credit arrangements of $8,963 million available at December 31, 2017, of which
$3,196 million were unused, compared to $8,491 million available at December 31, 2016, of which
$2,970 million were unused. At December 31, 2017, we had long term credit arrangements totaling
$8,346 million, of which $2,841 million were unused, compared to $7,932 million and $2,656 million,
respectively, at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, we had short term committed and uncommitted
credit arrangements totaling $617 million, of which $355 million were unused, compared to $559 million and
$314 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016. The continued availability of the short term uncommitted
arrangements is at the discretion of the relevant lender and may be terminated at any time.

Outstanding Notes

At December 31, 2017, we had $3,325 million of outstanding notes, compared to $3,287 million at December 31,
2016.

$2.0 Billion Amended and Restated First Lien Revolving Credit Facility due 2021

Our amended and restated first lien revolving credit facility is available in the form of loans or letters of credit,
with letter of credit availability limited to $800 million. Availability under the facility is subject to a borrowing
base, which is based primarily on (i) eligible accounts receivable and inventory of The Goodyear Tire & Rubber
Company and certain of its U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries, (ii) the value of our principal trademarks, and
(iii) certain cash in an amount not to exceed $200 million. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and
inventory and other components of the borrowing base decline in value, our borrowing base will decrease and the
availability under the facility may decrease below $2.0 billion. In addition, if the amount of outstanding
borrowings and letters of credit under the facility exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to prepay
borrowings and/or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess. As of December 31, 2017,
our borrowing base, and therefore our availability, under the facility was $296 million below the facility’s stated
amount of $2.0 billion. Based on our current liquidity, amounts drawn under this facility bear interest at LIBOR
plus 125 basis points, and undrawn amounts under the facility will be subject to an annual commitment fee of 30
basis points.

At December 31, 2017, we had no borrowings and $37 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving
credit facility. At December 31, 2016, we had $85 million of borrowings and $40 million of letters of credit
issued under the revolving credit facility.

27

During 2016, we began entering into bilateral letter of credit agreements. At December 31, 2017, we had
$368 million in letters of credit issued under these agreements.

Amended and Restated Second Lien Term Loan Facility due 2019

In March 2017, we amended our second lien term loan facility. As a result of the amendment, the term loan now
bears interest, at our option, at (i) 200 basis points over LIBOR or (ii) 100 basis points over an alternative base
rate (the higher of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate or the overnight bank funding rate plus
50 basis points or (c) LIBOR plus 100 basis points). In addition, if the Total Leverage Ratio is equal to or less
than 1.25 to 1.00, we have the option to further reduce the spreads described above by 25 basis points. “Total
Leverage Ratio” has the meaning given it in the facility.

At December 31, 2017 and 2016,
$399 million, respectively.

the amounts outstanding under this facility were $400 million and

€550 Million Amended and Restated Senior Secured European Revolving Credit Facility due 2020

Our amended and restated €550 million European revolving credit facility consists of (i) a €125 million German
tranche that is available only to Goodyear Dunlop Tires Germany GmbH (“GDTG”) and (ii) a €425 million
all-borrower tranche that is available to Goodyear Dunlop Tires Europe B.V. (“GDTE”), GDTG and Goodyear
Dunlop Tires Operations S.A. Up to €150 million of swingline loans and €50 million in letters of credit are
available for issuance under the all-borrower tranche. Amounts drawn under the facility will bear interest at
LIBOR plus 175 basis points for loans denominated in U.S. dollars or pounds sterling and EURIBOR plus 175
basis points for loans denominated in euros, and undrawn amounts under the facility will be subject to an annual
commitment fee of 30 basis points.

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no borrowings and no letters of credit issued under the European
revolving credit facility.

Each of our first lien revolving credit facility and our European revolving credit facility have customary
representations and warranties including, as a condition to borrowing, that all such representations and warranties
are true and correct, in all material respects, on the date of the borrowing, including representations as to no
material adverse change in our business or financial condition since December 31, 2015 under the first lien
facility and December 31, 2014 under the European facility.

Accounts Receivable Securitization Facilities (On-Balance Sheet)

GDTE and certain other of our European subsidiaries are parties to a pan-European accounts receivable
securitization facility that provides the flexibility to designate annually the maximum amount of funding
available under the facility in an amount of not less than €30 million and not more than €450 million. For the
period beginning October 16, 2016 to October 15, 2017, the designated maximum amount of the facility was
€320 million. Effective October 16, 2017, the designated maximum amount of the facility was reduced to
€275 million.

The facility involves an ongoing daily sale of substantially all of the trade accounts receivable of certain GDTE
subsidiaries. Utilization under the facility is based on eligible receivable balances.

The funding commitments under the facility will expire upon the earliest to occur of: (a) September 25, 2019, (b)
the non-renewal and expiration (without substitution) of all of the back-up liquidity commitments, (c) the early
termination of the facility according to its terms (generally upon an Early Amortisation Event (as defined in the
facility), which includes, among other things, events similar to the events of default under our senior secured
credit facilities; certain tax law changes; or certain changes to law, regulation or accounting standards), or (d) our
request for early termination of the facility. The facility’s current back-up liquidity commitments will expire on
October 15, 2018.

At December 31, 2017, the amounts available and utilized under this program totaled $224 million (€187
million). At December 31, 2016, the amounts available and utilized under this program totaled $198 million

28

(€188 million). The program does not qualify for sale accounting, and accordingly, these amounts are included in
Long Term Debt and Capital Leases.

Accounts Receivable Factoring Facilities (Off-Balance Sheet)

We have sold certain of our trade receivables under off-balance sheet programs. For these programs, we have
concluded that there is generally no risk of loss to us from non-payment of the sold receivables. At December 31,
2017 and 2016, the gross amount of receivables sold was $572 million and $502 million, respectively.

Supplier Financing

We have entered into payment processing agreements with several financial institutions. Under these agreements,
the financial institution acts as our paying agent with respect to accounts payable due to our suppliers. These
agreements also allow our suppliers to sell their receivables to the financial institutions at the sole discretion of
both the supplier and the financial institution on terms that are negotiated between them. We are not always
notified when our suppliers sell receivables under these programs. Our obligations to our suppliers, including the
amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by our suppliers’ decisions to sell their receivables
under the program. Agreements for such supplier financing programs totaled up to $500 million at December 31,
2017 and 2016.

Further Information

For a further description of the terms of our outstanding notes, first lien revolving credit facility, second lien term
loan facility, European revolving credit facility and pan-European accounts receivable securitization facility,
refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 15, Financing Arrangements and Derivative
Financial Instruments.

Covenant Compliance

Our first and second lien credit facilities and some of the indentures governing our notes contain certain
covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock,
pay dividends, repurchase shares or make certain other restricted payments or investments, incur liens, sell
assets, incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us, enter
into affiliate transactions, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, and consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. These covenants are subject to significant exceptions and
qualifications. Our first and second lien credit facilities and the indentures governing our notes also have
customary defaults, including cross-defaults to material indebtedness of Goodyear and its subsidiaries.

We have additional financial covenants in our first and second lien credit facilities that are currently not
applicable. We only become subject to these financial covenants when certain events occur. These financial
covenants and related events are as follows:

• We become subject to the financial covenant contained in our first lien revolving credit facility when the
aggregate amount of our Parent Company (The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company) and guarantor
subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents (“Available Cash”) plus our availability under our first lien
revolving credit facility is less than $200 million. If this were to occur, our ratio of EBITDA to
Consolidated Interest Expense may not be less than 2.0 to 1.0 for any period of four consecutive fiscal
quarters. As of December 31, 2017, our availability under this facility of $1,667 million plus our
Available Cash of $208 million totaled $1,875 million, which is in excess of $200 million.

• We become subject to a covenant contained in our second lien credit facility upon certain asset sales. The
covenant provides that, before we use cash proceeds from certain asset sales to repay any junior lien,
senior unsecured or subordinated indebtedness, we must first offer to use such cash proceeds to prepay
borrowings under the second lien credit facility unless our ratio of Consolidated Net Secured Indebtedness
to EBITDA (Pro Forma Senior Secured Leverage Ratio) for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters
is equal to or less than 3.0 to 1.0.

29

In addition, our European revolving credit facility contains non-financial covenants similar to the non-financial
covenants in our first and second lien credit facilities that are described above and a financial covenant applicable
only to GDTE and its subsidiaries. This financial covenant provides that we are not permitted to allow GDTE’s
ratio of Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness to Consolidated European J.V. EBITDA for a period of four
consecutive fiscal quarters to be greater than 3.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter. Consolidated Net J.V.
Indebtedness is determined net of the sum of cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million held by GDTE
and its subsidiaries, cash and cash equivalents in excess of $150 million held by the Parent Company and its U.S.
subsidiaries and availability under our first lien revolving credit facility if the ratio of EBITDA to Consolidated
Interest Expense described above is not applicable and the conditions to borrowing under the first lien revolving
credit facility are met. Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness also excludes loans from other consolidated Goodyear
entities. This financial covenant is also included in our pan-European accounts receivable securitization facility.
At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with this financial covenant.

Our credit facilities also state that we may only incur additional debt or make restricted payments that are not
otherwise expressly permitted if, after giving effect to the debt incurrence or the restricted payment, our ratio of
EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense for the prior four fiscal quarters would exceed 2.0 to 1.0. Certain of
our senior note indentures have substantially similar limitations on incurring debt and making restricted
payments. Our credit facilities and indentures also permit the incurrence of additional debt through other
provisions in those agreements without regard to our ability to satisfy the ratio-based incurrence test described
above. We believe that these other provisions provide us with sufficient flexibility to incur additional debt
necessary to meet our operating, investing and financing needs without regard to our ability to satisfy the ratio-
based incurrence test.

Covenants could change based upon a refinancing or amendment of an existing facility, or additional covenants
may be added in connection with the incurrence of new debt.

As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with the currently applicable material covenants imposed by
our principal credit facilities and indentures.

The terms “Available Cash,” “EBITDA,” “Consolidated Interest Expense,” “Consolidated Net Secured
Indebtedness,” “Pro Forma Senior Secured Leverage Ratio,” “Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness” and
“Consolidated European J.V. EBITDA” have the meanings given them in the respective credit facilities.

Potential Future Financings

In addition to our previous financing activities, we may seek to undertake additional financing actions that could
include restructuring bank debt or capital markets transactions, possibly including the issuance of additional debt
or equity. Given the challenges that we face and the uncertainties of the market conditions, access to the capital
markets cannot be assured.

Our future liquidity requirements may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. However, a substantial
portion of our assets are already subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our
ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness. In addition, no assurance
can be given as to our ability to raise additional unsecured debt.

Dividends and Common Stock Repurchase Program

Under our primary credit facilities and some of our note indentures, we are permitted to pay dividends on and
repurchase our capital stock (which constitute restricted payments) as long as no default will have occurred and
be continuing, additional indebtedness can be incurred under the credit facilities or indentures following the
payment, and certain financial tests are satisfied.

During 2017, 2016 and 2015 we paid cash dividends of $110 million, $82 million and $68 million, respectively,
on our common stock. On January 16, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee
thereof) declared cash dividends of $0.14 per share of our common stock, or approximately $34 million in the
aggregate. The cash dividend will be paid on March 1, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business
on February 1, 2018. Future quarterly dividends are subject to Board approval.

30

On September 18, 2013, the Board of Directors approved our common stock repurchase program. From time to
time, the Board of Directors has approved increases in the amount authorized to be purchased under that
program. On February 2, 2017, the Board of Directors approved a further increase in that authorization to
$2.1 billion. This program expires on December 31, 2019. We intend to repurchase shares of common stock in
open market transactions in order to offset new shares issued under equity compensation programs and to provide
for additional shareholder returns. During 2017, we repurchased 12,755,547 shares at an average price, including
commissions, of $31.37 per share, or $400 million in the aggregate. Since 2013, we repurchased 43,969,657
shares at an average price, including commissions, of $29.87 per share, or $1,313 million in the aggregate.

The restrictions imposed by our credit facilities and indentures did not affect our ability to pay the dividends on
or repurchase our capital stock as described above, and are not expected to affect our ability to pay similar
dividends or make similar repurchases in the future.

Asset Dispositions

The restrictions on asset sales imposed by our material indebtedness have not affected our strategy of divesting
non-core businesses, and those divestitures have not affected our ability to comply with those restrictions.

(1) Debt obligations include Notes Payable and Overdrafts, and excludes the impact of deferred financing fees

and unamortized discounts.

(2) The minimum lease payments for capital lease obligations are $67 million.
(3) These amounts represent future interest payments related to our existing debt obligations and capital leases
based on fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt and lease agreements. The amounts
provided relate only to existing debt obligations and do not assume the refinancing or replacement of such
debt or future changes in variable interest rates.

(4) Operating lease obligations have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $12 million, $8 million,
$6 million, $3 million, $2 million and $7 million in each of the periods above, respectively, for a total of
$38 million. Payments, net of minimum sublease rentals, total $1,008 million. The present value of the net
operating lease payments is $847 million. The operating leases relate to, among other things, real estate,
vehicles, data processing equipment and miscellaneous other assets. No asset is leased from any related
party.

31

(5) The obligation related to pension benefits is actuarially determined and is reflective of obligations as of
December 31, 2017. Although subject to change, the amounts set forth in the table represent the mid-point
of the range of our expected contributions for funded U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, plus expected cash
funding of direct participant payments to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans.

We made significant contributions to fully fund our U.S. pension plans in 2013 and 2014. We have no
minimum funding requirements for our funded U.S. pension plans under current ERISA law or the
provisions of our USW collective bargaining agreement, which requires us to maintain an annual ERISA
funded status for the hourly U.S. pension plan of at least 97%.

Future U.S. pension contributions will be affected by our ability to offset changes in future interest rates
with asset returns from our fixed income portfolio, and any changes to ERISA law. For further information
on the U.S. pension investment strategy, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 17,
Pension, Other Postretirement Benefits and Savings Plans.

Future non-U.S. contributions are affected by factors such as:

•

•

•

future interest rate levels,

the amount and timing of asset returns, and

how contributions in excess of the minimum requirements could impact the amount and timing of
future contributions.

(6) The payments presented above are expected payments for the next 10 years. The payments for other
postretirement benefits reflect the estimated benefit payments of the plans using the provisions currently in
effect. Under the relevant summary plan descriptions or plan documents we have the right to modify or
terminate the plans. The obligation related to other postretirement benefits is actuarially determined on an
annual basis.

(7) The payments for workers’ compensation obligations are based upon recent historical payment patterns on

claims. The present value of anticipated claims payments for workers’ compensation is $243 million.

(8) Binding commitments are for raw materials, capital expenditures, utilities, and various other types of
contracts. The obligations to purchase raw materials include supply contracts at both fixed and variable
prices. Those with variable prices are based on index rates for those commodities at December 31, 2017.

(9) These amounts primarily represent expected payments with interest for uncertain tax positions as of
December 31, 2017. We have reflected them in the period in which we believe they will be ultimately
settled based upon our experience with these matters.

Additional other long term liabilities include items such as general and product liabilities, environmental
liabilities and miscellaneous other long term liabilities. These other liabilities are not contractual obligations by
nature. We cannot, with any degree of reliability, determine the years in which these liabilities might ultimately
be settled. Accordingly, these other long term liabilities are not included in the above table.

In addition, pursuant to certain long term agreements, we will purchase varying amounts of certain raw materials
and finished goods at agreed upon base prices that may be subject to periodic adjustments for changes in raw
material costs and market price adjustments, or in quantities that may be subject to periodic adjustments for
changes in our or our suppliers’ production levels. These contingent contractual obligations, the amounts of
which cannot be estimated, are not included in the table above.

We do not engage in the trading of commodity contracts or any related derivative contracts. We generally
purchase raw materials and energy through short term, intermediate and long term supply contracts at fixed
prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices. We may, however, from time to time,
enter into contracts to hedge our energy costs.

32

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an
unconsolidated entity under which a company has:

• made guarantees,

• retained or held a contingent interest in transferred assets,

• undertaken an obligation under certain derivative instruments, or

• undertaken any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that
provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing,
hedging or research and development arrangements with the company.

We have entered into certain arrangements under which we have provided guarantees that are off-balance sheet
arrangements. Those guarantees totaled approximately $82 million at December 31, 2017. For further
information about our guarantees, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 19,
Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.

We concluded that effective as of December 31, 2015, we no longer met the accounting criteria for control of our
Venezuelan subsidiary, and its assets and liabilities are no longer reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as
of December 31, 2015. Subsequent to its deconsolidation, we maintained a variable interest in our Venezuelan
subsidiary. Our exposure to future losses resulting from our Venezuelan subsidiary is limited to the extent that
we decide to provide raw materials or finished goods to, or make future investments in, our Venezuelan
subsidiary. For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 1, Accounting
Policies.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION — SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT

Certain information in this Annual Report (other than historical data and information) may constitute forward-
looking statements regarding events and trends that may affect our future operating results and financial position.
The words “estimate,” “expect,” “intend” and “project,” as well as other words or expressions of similar
meaning, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report. Such statements are based on
current expectations and assumptions, are inherently uncertain, are subject to risks and should be viewed with
caution. Actual results and experience may differ materially from the forward-looking statements as a result of
many factors, including:

• if we do not successfully implement our strategic initiatives, our operating results, financial condition and

liquidity may be materially adversely affected;

• we face significant global competition and our market share could decline;

• deteriorating economic conditions in any of our major markets, or an inability to access capital markets or
third-party financing when necessary, may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial
condition and liquidity;

• raw material and energy costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial

condition;

• if we experience a labor strike, work stoppage or other similar event our business, results of operations,

financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected;

• our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results,

financial condition and liquidity;

• we have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our

operating results, financial condition and liquidity;

33

• our long term ability to meet our obligations, to repay maturing indebtedness or to implement strategic
initiatives may be dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our
operating results;

• financial difficulties, work stoppages, supply disruptions or economic conditions affecting our major OE

customers, dealers or suppliers could harm our business;

• our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be

implemented in a timely or cost-effective manner;

• we have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive

disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health;

• any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our debt instruments, or a
material reduction in the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, could have a material adverse
effect on our liquidity and operations;

• our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service

obligations to increase significantly;

• we have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with

changes in our net sales;

• we may incur significant costs in connection with our contingent liabilities and tax matters;

• our

reserves for contingent

to various
uncertainties, the outcome of which may result in our actual costs being significantly higher than the
amounts recorded;

recorded insurance assets are subject

liabilities and our

• we are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating

results;

• we may be adversely affected by any disruption in, or failure of, our information technology systems due

to computer viruses, unauthorized access, cyber-attack, natural disasters or other similar disruptions;

• if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business could be materially adversely

affected; and

• we may be impacted by economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such

as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters.

It is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors. We will not revise or update any forward-looking
statement or disclose any facts, events or circumstances that occur after the date hereof that may affect the
accuracy of any forward-looking statement.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

We utilize derivative financial instrument contracts and nonderivative instruments to manage interest rate,
foreign exchange and commodity price risks. We have established a control environment that includes policies
and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument
activities. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Commodity Price Risk

The raw materials costs to which our operations are principally exposed include the cost of natural rubber,
synthetic rubber, carbon black, fabrics, steel cord and other petrochemical-based commodities. Approximately
two-thirds of our raw materials are oil-based derivatives, the cost of which may be affected by fluctuations in the
price of oil. We currently do not hedge commodity prices. We do, however, use various strategies to partially
offset cost increases for raw materials, including centralizing purchases of raw materials through our global
procurement organization in an effort to leverage our purchasing power, expanding our capabilities to substitute
lower-cost raw materials and reducing the amount of material required in each tire.

34

Interest Rate Risk

We carefully monitor our fixed and floating rate debt mix. Within defined limitations, we manage the mix using
refinancing. At December 31, 2017, 34% of our debt was at variable interest rates averaging 4.42% compared to
33% at an average rate of 6.34% at December 31, 2016.

The pro forma information assumes a 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates at December 31 of each
year, and reflects the estimated fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption. The
sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates was determined using current market pricing models.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

We will enter into foreign currency contracts in order to manage the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates
on our consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency-denominated cash flows. These contracts
reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency-denominated assets, liabilities, firm
commitments and forecasted transactions resulting primarily from trade purchases and sales, equipment
acquisitions, intercompany loans and royalty agreements. Contracts hedging short term trade receivables and
payables normally have no hedging designation.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Accounting Policies

A summary of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated
financial statements follows:

Basis of Presentation

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

Effective January 1, 2017, we adopted an accounting standards update with new guidance on the transition to the
equity method of accounting. The new guidance eliminates the requirement for an investor to retrospectively
apply equity method accounting when an investment that it had accounted for by another method initially
qualifies for the equity method. Instead, the investor is required to apply the equity method prospectively from
the date the investment qualifies for the equity method. In addition, an entity that has an available-for-sale equity
security that becomes qualified for the equity method must recognize through earnings the unrealized holding
gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment qualifies for the equity
method. The adoption of this standards update did not impact our consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2017, we adopted an accounting standards update with new guidance on the measurement of
inventory. Inventory within the scope of this update is required to be measured at the lower of its cost or net
realizable value, with net realizable value being the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business,
less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The adoption of this standards
update did not impact our consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2017, we early adopted an accounting standards update with new guidance on how certain
cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This update provides
guidance on eight specific cash flow issues. As a result of the adoption, premiums for debt extinguishment of
$53 million and $41 million were reclassified from Operating Activities to Financing Activities in the statement
of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The other seven specific cash flow
issues were either not applicable to Goodyear or the treatment has not materially changed from our current
practice.

Effective January 1, 2017, we early adopted an accounting standards update with new guidance on the
presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The standards update requires that
the
reconciliation of the beginning and end of period cash amounts shown in the statement of cash flows include
restricted cash. When restricted cash is presented separately from cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet,
a reconciliation is required between the amounts presented on the statement of cash flows and the balance sheet.
Also, the new guidance requires the disclosure of information about the nature of the restrictions.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an accounting standards update
with new guidance intended to reduce complexity in hedge accounting and make hedge results easier to
understand. This includes simplifying how hedge results are presented and disclosed in the financial statements,
expanding the types of hedge strategies allowed and providing relief around the documentation and assessment
requirements. The standards update is effective using a modified retrospective approach, with the presentation
and disclosure guidance required prospectively, for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15,
2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the impact of this standards update on our
consolidated financial statements.

In May 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standards update with new guidance to clarify when changes to the
terms or conditions of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as a modification. The new guidance
requires the application of modification accounting if the value, vesting conditions or classification of the award

44

THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

changes. The standards update is effective prospectively for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standards update will not have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In March 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standards update intended to improve the financial statement
presentation of pension and postretirement benefits cost. The standards update requires employers that offer
defined benefit pension or other postretirement benefit plans to report service cost in the same income statement
line as compensation costs and to report non-service related costs separately from service cost outside a sub-total
of income from operations, if one is presented. Currently, the Company records both service and non-service
related costs in selling, administrative and general expense (“SAG”) and cost of goods sold (“CGS”), as
appropriate. In addition, the new guidance allows only service cost to be capitalized. The standards update is
effective retrospectively for the financial statement presentation of benefits cost and prospectively for the
capitalization of service cost for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early
adoption permitted.

In alignment with the financial statement presentation provisions of the new standards update, beginning in 2018
only service related costs of approximately $35 million per year, including approximately $5 million per year of
corporate related costs, will remain in SAG and CGS. As such, $62 million and $35 million of non-service
related costs, including $28 million and $24 million of corporate related costs, will be reclassified from SAG and
CGS to Other (Income) Expense for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Further, we expect approximately $90 million
of non-service related costs, including approximately $15 million of corporate related costs and excluding any
potential settlement/curtailment charges, to be classified in Other (Income) Expense for 2018. The provision of
the new standards update to allow only service costs to be capitalized is not expected to have a significant impact
on our consolidated financial statements.

In January 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standards update with new guidance intended to simplify the
subsequent measurement of goodwill. The standards update eliminates the requirement for an entity to calculate
the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, an entity will perform its
annual, or interim, goodwill impairment testing by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying
amount and recording an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.
The standards update is effective prospectively for annual and interim goodwill impairment testing performed in
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standards
update is not expected to impact our consolidated financial statements.

In October 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update with new guidance on the accounting for the
income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory, including the elimination of the
prohibition on recognition of current and deferred income taxes on such transfers. The standards update is
effective using the modified retrospective approach for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standards update will not have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update with new guidance intended to increase
transparency and comparability among organizations relating to leases. Lessees will be required to recognize a
liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing the right to use the underlying asset for the
lease term. The FASB retained a dual model for lease classification, requiring leases to be classified as finance or
operating leases to determine recognition in the statements of operations and cash flows; however, substantially
all leases will be required to be recognized on the balance sheet. Lessor accounting is largely unchanged from the
current accounting model. The standards update will also require quantitative and qualitative disclosures
regarding key information about leasing arrangements. In 2018, the FASB issued an amendment that provided an
optional transition practical expedient regarding land easements. The standards update is effective using a
modified retrospective approach for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with
early adoption permitted. The standard provides for certain practical expedients. The transition will require
application at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented at the time of adoption. We have

45

THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

completed aggregating our worldwide lease contracts, are in the process of evaluating these lease contracts and
are in the early stages of implementing a new lease accounting system to support the accounting and disclosure
requirements of this standards update. The adoption of this standards update is expected to have a material
impact on our financial statements as the Company has significant operating lease commitments that are
off-balance sheet in accordance with current U.S. GAAP.

In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update with new guidance on recognizing revenue from
contracts with customers. The standards update outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to utilize to
recognize revenue when it transfers goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
that will be received in exchange for the goods and services. Additional disclosures will also be required to
enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from
contracts with customers. In 2016, the FASB issued several amendments which provide clarification, additional
guidance, practical expedients and technical corrections. In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of
this standards update to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The
standard permits the use of either a retrospective or modified retrospective approach. We will use the modified
retrospective approach. The adoption of this standards update will not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements, however it will require new disclosures, which we are in the process of finalizing.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all legal entities in which we hold a controlling
financial interest. A controlling financial interest generally arises from our ownership of a majority of the voting
shares of our subsidiaries. We would also hold a controlling financial interest in variable interest entities if we
are considered to be the primary beneficiary. Investments in companies in which we do not own a majority
interest and we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are
accounted for using the equity method. Investments in other companies are carried at cost. All intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Deconsolidation of Venezuelan Subsidiary

Our wholly-owned subsidiary, C.A. Goodyear de Venezuela, manufactures, markets and distributes consumer
and commercial tires throughout Venezuela. Conditions in Venezuela, including currency exchange control
regulations and continued reductions in access to U.S. dollars through official currency exchange mechanisms,
have resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte and the
U.S. dollar, and have restricted the ability of our Venezuelan subsidiary to pay dividends and royalties and to
settle liabilities. These currency exchange regulations, combined with other government regulations such as price
and profit margin controls and strict labor laws, have significantly limited our ability to make and execute
operational decisions at our Venezuelan subsidiary. This lack of currency exchangeability, combined with these
other operating restrictions, have significantly limited our Venezuelan subsidiary’s ability to maintain normal
production and control over its operations. We expect these conditions to continue for the foreseeable future.

As a result of these conditions, we concluded that effective as of December 31, 2015, we did not meet the
accounting criteria for control over our Venezuelan subsidiary and began reporting the results of our Venezuelan
subsidiary using the cost method of accounting. This change resulted in a pre-tax charge of $646 million in the
fourth quarter of 2015. We have determined the fair value of our investment in, and receivables from, our
Venezuelan subsidiary to be insignificant based on our expectations of dividend payments and settlements of
such receivables in future periods.

Reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2015 do not include the operating results of our Venezuelan
subsidiary. We now record income from sales of inventory and raw materials or from dividends or royalties to
the extent cash is received from our Venezuelan subsidiary. Our exposure to future losses resulting from our
Venezuelan subsidiary is limited to the extent that we decide to provide raw materials or finished goods to, or
make future investments in, our Venezuelan subsidiary.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and related notes to the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, including those related to:

• recoverability of intangibles and other long-lived assets,

• deferred tax asset valuation allowances and uncertain income tax positions,

• workers’ compensation,

• general and product liabilities and other litigation,

• pension and other postretirement benefits, and

• various other operating allowances and accruals, based on currently available information.

Changes in facts and circumstances may alter such estimates and affect results of operations and financial
position in future periods.

Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Valuation

Revenues are recognized when finished products are shipped to unaffiliated customers, both title and the risks
and rewards of ownership are transferred or services have been rendered and accepted, and collectability is
reasonably assured. A provision for sales returns, discounts and allowances is recorded at the time of sale.
Appropriate provisions are made for uncollectible accounts based on historical
loss experience, portfolio
duration, economic conditions and credit risk. The adequacy of the allowances are assessed quarterly.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Costs incurred for transportation of products to customers are recorded as a component of CGS.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs include, among other things, materials, equipment, compensation and contract
services. These costs are expensed as incurred and included as a component of CGS. Research and development
expenditures were $406 million, $388 million and $382 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Warranty

Warranties are provided on the sale of certain of our products and services and an accrual for estimated future
claims is recorded at the time revenue is recognized. Tire replacement under most of the warranties we offer is on
a prorated basis. Warranty reserves are based on past claims experience, sales history and other considerations.
Refer to Note 19.

Environmental Cleanup Matters

We expense environmental costs related to existing conditions resulting from past or current operations and from
which no current or future benefit is discernible. Expenditures that extend the life of the related property or
mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination are capitalized. We determine our liability on a site by
site basis and record a liability at the time when it is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Our estimated
liability is reduced to reflect the anticipated participation of other potentially responsible parties in those
instances where it is probable that such parties are legally responsible and financially capable of paying their
respective shares of the relevant costs. Our estimated liability is not discounted or reduced for possible recoveries
from insurance carriers. Refer to Note 19.

47

THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Legal Costs

We record a liability for estimated legal and defense costs related to pending general and product liability claims,
environmental matters and workers’ compensation claims. Refer to Note 19.

Advertising Costs

Costs incurred for producing and communicating advertising are generally expensed when incurred as a
component of SAG. Costs incurred under our cooperative advertising programs with dealers and franchisees are
generally recorded as reductions of sales as related revenues are recognized. Advertising costs, including costs
for our cooperative advertising programs with dealers and franchisees, were $320 million, $355 million and
$385 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Rationalizations

We record costs for rationalization actions implemented to reduce excess and high-cost manufacturing capacity
and operating and administrative costs. Associate-related costs include severance, supplemental unemployment
compensation and benefits, medical benefits, pension curtailments, postretirement benefits, and other termination
benefits. For ongoing benefit arrangements, a liability is recognized when it is probable that employees will be
entitled to benefits and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For one-time benefit arrangements, a liability is
incurred and must be accrued at the date the plan is communicated to employees, unless they will be retained
beyond a minimum retention period. In this case, the liability is calculated at the date the plan is communicated
to employees and is accrued ratably over the future service period. Other costs generally include non-cancelable
lease costs, contract terminations, and relocation costs. A liability for these costs is recognized in the period in
which the liability is incurred. Rationalization charges related to accelerated depreciation and asset impairments
are recorded in CGS or SAG. Refer to Note 2.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are recognized during the year in which transactions enter into the determination of financial
statement income, with deferred taxes being provided for temporary differences between carrying values of
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such carrying values as measured under applicable tax
laws. The effect on deferred tax assets or liabilities of a change in the tax law or tax rate is recognized in the
period the change is enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount
that is more likely than not to be realized. The calculation of our tax liabilities also involves considering
uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain income tax
positions based on our estimate of whether it is more likely than not that additional taxes will be required and we
report related interest and penalties as income taxes.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted on December 22, 2017, subjects a U.S. parent to current tax on its
“global intangible low-taxed income,” or GILTI. We do not anticipate incurring a GILTI liability, however, to
the extent that we incur expense under the GILTI provisions we will treat it as a component of income tax
expense in the period incurred. Refer to Note 6.

Cash and Cash Equivalents / Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and marketable securities with original maturities of three
months or less. Substantially all of our cash and short-term investment securities are held with investment grade-
rated counterparties. At December 31, 2017, our cash investments with any single counterparty did not exceed
$218 million.

Cash flows associated with derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of identifiable transactions or
events are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items. Cash flows associated
with derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges are classified as operating activities. Bank

48

THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

overdrafts, if any, are recorded within Notes Payable and Overdrafts. Cash flows associated with bank overdrafts
are classified as financing activities.

Customer prepayments for products and government grants received that are related to operations are reported as
operating activities. Government grants received that are solely related to capital expenditures are reported as
investing activities. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are presented net of capital leases of $5 million,
$3 million and $3 million originating in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cash
flows from investing activities in 2017 exclude $265 million of accrued capital expenditures remaining unpaid at
December 31, 2017, and include payment for $264 million of capital expenditures that were accrued and unpaid
at December 31, 2016. Cash flows from investing activities in 2016 exclude $264 million of accrued capital
expenditures remaining unpaid at December 31, 2016, and include payment for $254 million of capital
expenditures that were accrued and unpaid at December 31, 2015.

Restricted Cash, which is included in Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets, primarily represents amounts required to be set aside in connection with accounts receivable factoring
programs and funds obtained under certain Chinese credit facilities for plant expansion in China. The restrictions
lapse when cash from factored accounts receivable is remitted to the purchaser of those receivables or when
funds are used for plant expansion expenditures, respectively.

Restricted Net Assets

In certain countries where we operate, transfers of funds into or out of such countries by way of dividends, loans
or advances are generally or periodically subject to various governmental regulations. In addition, certain of our
credit agreements and other debt instruments limit the ability of foreign subsidiaries to make cash distributions.
At December 31, 2017, approximately $807 million of net assets were subject to such regulations or limitations.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out or
the average cost method. Costs include direct material, direct
labor and applicable manufacturing and
engineering overhead. We allocate fixed manufacturing overheads based on normal production capacity and
recognize abnormal manufacturing costs as period costs. We determine a provision for excess and obsolete
inventory based on management’s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales.
Refer to Note 10.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill is recorded when the cost of acquired businesses exceeds the fair value of the identifiable net assets
acquired. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are assessed for
impairment annually with the option to perform a qualitative assessment
to determine whether further
impairment testing is necessary or to perform a quantitative assessment by comparing the fair value of the

49

THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible to its carrying amount. Under the qualitative assessment, an entity is
not required to calculate the fair value unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that the fair
value is less than the carrying amount. If under the quantitative assessment the fair value is less than the carrying
amount, then the amount of the impairment loss, if any, must be measured.

In addition to annual testing, impairment testing is conducted when events occur or circumstances change that
would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Goodwill and intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives would be written down to fair value if considered impaired. Intangible assets
with finite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over such finite lives, and reviewed for
impairment whenever events or circumstances warrant such a review. Refer to Note 11.

Investments

Investments in marketable securities are stated at fair value. Fair value is determined using quoted market prices
at the end of the reporting period and, when appropriate, exchange rates at that date. Unrealized gains and losses
on marketable securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded in AOCL, net of tax. We regularly review
our investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary. If the
decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary, the cost basis of the security is written down to fair
value and the amount of the write-down is included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Refer to
Notes 16 and 21.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method.
Additions and improvements that substantially extend the useful life of property, plant and equipment, and
interest costs incurred during the construction period of major projects are capitalized. Government grants to us
that are solely related to capital expenditures are recorded as reductions of the cost of the associated assets.
Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated to their
estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives, and reviewed for impairment whenever events or
circumstances warrant such a review. Depreciation expense for property, plant and equipment was $779 million,
$726 million and $697 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Refer to Notes 3 and 13.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency for most subsidiaries outside the United States is the local currency. Financial statements
of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date for assets
and liabilities and a weighted average exchange rate for each period for revenues, expenses, gains and losses. The
U.S. dollar is used as the functional currency in countries with a history of high inflation and in countries that
predominantly sell into the U.S. dollar export market. For all operations, gains or losses from remeasuring
foreign currency transactions into the functional currency are included in Other (Income) Expense. Translation
adjustments are recorded in AOCL. Income taxes are generally not provided for foreign currency translation
adjustments.

Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

To qualify for hedge accounting, hedging instruments must be designated as hedges and meet defined correlation
and effectiveness criteria. These criteria require that the anticipated cash flows and/or changes in fair value of the
hedging instrument substantially offset those of the position being hedged.

Derivative contracts are reported at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts Receivable, Other
Assets, Other Current Liabilities or Other Long Term Liabilities. Deferred gains and losses on contracts
designated as cash flow hedges are recorded net of tax in AOCL. Ineffectiveness in hedging relationships is
recorded in Other (Income) Expense in the current period.

50

THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Interest Rate Contracts — Gains and losses on contracts designated as cash flow hedges are initially deferred and
recorded in AOCL. Amounts are transferred from AOCL and recognized in income as Interest Expense in the
same period that the hedged item is recognized in income. Gains and losses on contracts designated as fair value
hedges are recognized in income in the current period as Interest Expense. Gains and losses on contracts with no
hedging designation are recorded in the current period in Other (Income) Expense.

Foreign Currency Contracts — Gains and losses on contracts designated as cash flow hedges are initially
deferred and recorded in AOCL. Amounts are transferred from AOCL and recognized in income in the same
period and on the same line that the hedged item is recognized in income. Gains and losses on contracts
designated as fair value hedges, excluding premiums and discounts, are recorded in Other (Income) Expense in
the current period. Gains and losses on contracts with no hedging designation are also recorded in Other
(Income) Expense in the current period. We do not include premiums or discounts on forward currency contracts
in our assessment of hedge effectiveness. Premiums and discounts on contracts designated as hedges are
recognized in Other (Income) Expense over the life of the contract.

Net Investment Hedging — Nonderivative instruments denominated in foreign currencies are used from time to
time to hedge net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Gains and losses on these instruments are deferred and
recorded in AOCL as Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments. These gains and losses are only recognized in
income upon the complete or partial sale of the related investment or the complete liquidation of the investment.

Termination of Contracts — Gains and losses (including deferred gains and losses in AOCL) are recognized in
Other (Income) Expense when contracts are terminated concurrently with the termination of the hedged position.
To the extent that such position remains outstanding, gains and losses are amortized to Interest Expense or to
Other (Income) Expense over the remaining life of that position. Gains and losses on contracts that we
temporarily continue to hold after the early termination of a hedged position, or that otherwise no longer qualify
for hedge accounting, are recognized in Other (Income) Expense. Refer to Note 15.

Stock-Based Compensation

We measure compensation cost arising from the grant of stock-based awards to employees at fair value and
recognize such cost in income over the period during which the service is provided, usually the vesting period.
We recognize compensation expense using the straight-line approach.

Stock-based awards to employees include grants of performance share units, restricted stock units and stock
options. We measure the fair value of grants of performance share units and restricted stock units based primarily
on the closing market price of a share of our common stock on the date of the grant, modified as appropriate to
take into account the features of such grants.

We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Assumptions used to
estimate compensation expense are determined as follows:

• Expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on

our historical experience of option exercises;

• Expected volatility is measured using the weighted average of historical daily changes in the market price
of our common stock over the expected term of the award and implied volatility calculated for our
exchange traded options with an expiration date greater than one year;

• Risk-free interest rate is equivalent to the implied yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bonds with a

remaining maturity equal to the expected term of the awards; and

• Forfeitures are based substantially on the history of cancellations of similar awards granted in prior years.

Refer to Note 18.

51

THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Earnings Per Share of Common Stock

Basic earnings per share are computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per share primarily reflects the dilutive impact of outstanding stock options and other stock
based awards. All earnings per share amounts in these notes to the consolidated financial statements are diluted,
unless otherwise noted. Refer to Note 7.

Fair Value Measurements

Valuation Hierarchy

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified using the following hierarchy, which is based upon the
transparency of inputs to the valuation as of the measurement date.

• Level 1 — Valuation is based upon quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active

markets.

• Level 2 — Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or
other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the
full term of the financial instrument.

• Level 3 — Valuation is based upon other unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value

measurement.

The classification of fair value measurements within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is
significant to the measurement. Valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value are
as follows:

Investments

Where quoted prices are available in an active market, investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation
hierarchy. Level 1 securities include highly liquid government bonds, certain mortgage products and exchange-
traded equities. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are estimated using quoted prices of
securities with similar characteristics or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the security, and
would be classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. In certain cases where there is limited activity or
less transparency around inputs to the valuation, securities would be classified within Level 3 of the valuation
hierarchy.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Exchange-traded derivative financial instruments that are valued using quoted prices would be classified within
Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Derivative financial instruments valued using internally-developed models
that use as their basis readily observable market parameters are classified within Level 2 of the valuation
hierarchy. Derivative financial instruments that are valued based upon models with significant unobservable
market parameters, and that are normally traded less actively, would be classified within Level 3 of the valuation
hierarchy. Refer to Notes 15 and 16.

Reclassifications and Adjustments

Certain items previously reported in specific financial statement captions have been reclassified to conform to the
current presentation. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2016, we recorded an out of period adjustment of
$24 million of expense related to the elimination of intracompany profit in Americas. The adjustment primarily
relates to the years, and interim periods therein, of 2012 to 2015, with the majority attributable to 2012. The
adjustment did not have a material effect on any of the periods impacted.

Rationalization actions accrued at December 31, 2017 include $90 million related to the closure of our tire
manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany, which was in furtherance of our strategy to capture the growing
demand for premium, large-rim diameter tires in part by reducing excess capacity in declining, less profitable
segments of the tire market. The remainder of the accrual balance at December 31, 2017 includes $53 million
related to plans to reduce manufacturing headcount in Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), $29 million
related to global plans to reduce SAG headcount, and $13 million related to a SAG headcount reduction plan in
EMEA.

The accrual balance at December 31, 2017 is expected to be substantially utilized in the next 12 months.

for their originally intended purposes. Ongoing rationalization plans had approximately $730 million in charges
through 2017 and approximately $35 million is expected to be incurred in future periods.

Approximately 600 associates will be released under new plans initiated in 2017, of which approximately 200
were released through December 31, 2017. In 2017, approximately 1,300 associates were released under plans
initiated in prior years, primarily related to the closure of our tire manufacturing facility in Philippsburg,
Germany. Approximately 700 associates remain to be released under all ongoing rationalization plans.

At December 31, 2017, approximately 840 former associates of the closed Amiens, France manufacturing facility
have asserted wrongful termination or other claims against us. Refer to Note 19.

Asset write-off and accelerated depreciation charges in 2017 primarily related to the closure of our tire
manufacturing facility in Philippsburg, Germany. Asset write-off and accelerated depreciation charges for all
periods were recorded in CGS.

Financing fees and financial
instruments expense consists of commitment fees and charges incurred in
connection with financing transactions. Financing fees and financial instruments expense in 2017 includes a
premium of $25 million related to the redemption of our $700 million 7% senior notes due 2022 in May 2017.
Financing fees and financial instruments expense in 2016 included premiums of $53 million related to the
redemption of our $900 million 6.5% senior notes due 2021 in June 2016 and our €250 million 6.75% senior
notes due 2019 in January 2016. Financing fees and financial instruments expense in 2015 included a premium of
$41 million related to the redemption of our $1,000 million 8.25% senior notes due 2020 in December 2015.

Royalty income is derived primarily from licensing arrangements related to divested businesses as well as other
licensing arrangements. Royalty income in 2015 included a one-time pre-tax gain of $155 million on the
recognition of deferred income resulting from the termination of a licensing agreement associated with the sale of
our former Engineered Products business (“Veyance”). The licensing agreement was terminated following the
acquisition of Veyance by Continental AG in January 2015.

Net (gains) losses on asset sales in 2017 include a gain of $6 million related to the sale of a former wire plant site
in Luxembourg. Net (gains) losses on asset sales in 2016 included a gain of $16 million related to the sale of the

55

THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

former wire plant site and a gain of $9 million related to the sale of our interest in a supply chain logistics
company. Net (gains) losses on asset sales in 2015 included a gain of $48 million related to the dissolution of the
global alliance with SRI and a gain of $30 million on the sale of our investment in shares of SRI. Refer to Note 5.
Net gains on asset sales in 2015 also included losses of $14 million in EMEA, primarily related to the sales of
certain sub-Saharan Africa retail businesses.

Interest income consists primarily of amounts earned on cash deposits.

Foreign currency exchange in all periods reflects net gains and losses resulting from the effect of exchange rate
changes on various foreign currency transactions worldwide, including $34 million of losses in 2015 resulting
from the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte against the U.S. dollar.

General and product liability (income) expense — discontinued products includes charges for claims against us
related primarily to asbestos personal injury claims, net of probable insurance recoveries. General and product
liability (income) expense — discontinued products in 2017 includes a benefit of $5 million for the recovery of
past costs from certain asbestos insurers.

General and product
liability (income) expense — discontinued products in 2016 included a benefit of
$24 million for the recovery of past costs from certain asbestos insurers and a benefit of $10 million related to
changes in assumptions for probable insurance recoveries for asbestos claims in future periods. General and
product liability (income) expense — discontinued products in 2015 included a benefit of $25 million for the
recovery of past costs from one of our asbestos insurers and a benefit of $21 million related to changes in
assumptions for probable insurance recoveries for asbestos claims in future periods. The 2015 benefits were
partially offset by an $8 million increase in the net asbestos liability based on updated assumptions for defense
and indemnity costs in future periods based on historical cost data and trends.

Miscellaneous expense in 2017 includes $14 million related to expenses incurred by the Company as a direct
result of hurricanes Harvey and Irma during 2017.

Note 5. Dissolution of Global Alliance with Sumitomo Rubber Industries

On October 1, 2015, the Company completed the previously announced dissolution of its global alliance with
SRI in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Framework Agreement, dated as of June 4, 2015,
by and between the Company and SRI.

Prior to the dissolution, the Company owned 75% and SRI owned 25% of two companies, Goodyear Dunlop
Tires Europe B.V. (“GDTE”) and Goodyear Dunlop Tires North America, Ltd. (“GDTNA”). GDTE owns and
operates substantially all of the Company’s tire businesses in Europe. GDTNA had rights to the Dunlop brand
and operated certain related businesses in the United States, Canada and Mexico. In Japan, the Company owned
25% and SRI owned 75% of two companies, one, Nippon Goodyear Ltd. (“NGY”), for the sale of Goodyear-
brand passenger and truck tires for replacement in Japan and the other, Dunlop Goodyear Tires Ltd. (“DGT”), for
the sale of Goodyear-brand and Dunlop-brand tires to vehicle manufacturers in Japan.

Pursuant to the Framework Agreement, the Company sold to SRI its 75% interest in GDTNA for $125 million,
25% interest in DGT for $14 million and Huntsville, Alabama test track used by GDTNA for $6 million.
Accordingly, the Company no longer has any remaining ownership interests in GDTNA, DGT or the Huntsville,
Alabama test track. With the sale of GDTNA, SRI obtained full ownership of the Dunlop motorcycle tire
business in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and the rights to sell Dunlop-brand tires to Japanese vehicle
manufacturers in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The Company retained exclusive rights to sell Dunlop-
brand tires in both the consumer and commercial replacement markets of the United States, Canada and Mexico
as well as to non-Japanese vehicle manufacturers in those countries.

The Company also acquired SRI’s 75% interest in NGY for $29 million and 25% interest in GDTE for
$387 million. Accordingly, the Company now has full ownership interests in NGY and GDTE. In addition, SRI
obtained exclusive rights to sell Dunlop-brand tires in those countries that were previously non-exclusive under
the global alliance, including Russia, Turkey and certain countries in Africa.

THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

We paid SRI a net amount of $271 million upon closing of the transactions described above. In addition, we
delivered a promissory note to GDTNA in an initial principal amount of $56 million, with a maturity date three
years following the date of dissolution and at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.1%, that represented SRI’s 25%
interest in a GDTNA loan receivable from the Company.

The contractual net consideration paid of $271 million, discussed above, represented an amount agreed to by the
Company and SRI as a result of arm’s length negotiations for the dissolution of the global alliance. In order to
appropriately account for the various components of the dissolution transaction within its consolidated financial
statements, the Company independently estimated the fair value of each component of the dissolution transaction
as of the October 1, 2015 closing date using commonly used fair value measurement techniques, such as
discounted cash flow methods and market approaches based on comparable companies, in order to determine the
fair value of consideration for each component and the gain or loss on the dissolution transaction.

The Framework Agreement also provided that we and SRI would conduct an orderly sale of the SRI common
stock held by us and the Goodyear common stock held by SRI. As of December 31, 2015, the Company sold all
of its common stock in SRI resulting in total proceeds of $47 million and a pre-tax gain of $30 million that was
recorded within Other (Income) Expense.

In addition to the gain recognized on the sale of SRI common stock, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of
$48 million on the transactions described above that was recorded in Other (Income) Expense. The net gain on
the transaction, after taxes, was $38 million. The net pre-tax gain on the dissolution transaction of $48 million is
comprised of the following:

Pursuant to the Framework Agreement, the Company will defend product liability claims related to GDTNA’s
historical operations. We recorded a net liability of $28 million reflecting the estimated cost of the Company’s
obligation to defend those product liability claims net of the amount recorded for the indemnification of those
claims provided by SRI to the Company under the Framework Agreement.

Prior to October 1, 2015, GDTE’s assets and liabilities were included in our consolidated balance sheets and
GDTE’s results of operations were included in our consolidated statements of operations, which also reflected
SRI’s minority interest in GDTE. Subsequent to October 1, 2015, we continue to include GDTE in our
consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations; however, there is no minority interest
impact to our results of operations related to GDTE. Additionally, prior to October 1, 2015, we accounted for
NGY under the equity method as we did not have a controlling financial interest in NGY. Subsequent to
October 1, 2015, we have a controlling interest in NGY and, accordingly, NGY’s assets and liabilities are
included in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, and NGY’s results of operations are
included in our consolidated statements of operations. The effects of the acquisition of NGY were not material to
our consolidated balance sheet or results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company had classified the closing payment of $271 million as cash
flows from financing activities as the acquisition of the minority shareholder’s equity in GDTE represents the
predominant use of these proceeds.

The Company and SRI entered into various supply agreements, licenses, transition services agreements, releases
and other ancillary agreements in connection with the Framework Agreement to give effect to the dissolution

57

THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

and/or to set forth arrangements between the Company and SRI following the dissolution. The Company and SRI
also each agreed to indemnify the other for certain losses arising out of breaches of representations and
warranties, covenants and other specified matters, including product liability matters. The Company recorded an
indemnification asset of $32 million for SRI’s obligation to reimburse the Company for certain product liability
claims related to periods prior to the dissolution, subject to certain caps and restrictions. At December 31, 2017, a
total indemnification asset of $35 million is recorded within Accounts Receivable of $5 million and Other Assets
of $30 million. The range of possible outcomes for the indemnification receivable is not material to the
Company’s financial statements.

As a result of the sale of GDTNA and the acquisition of the minority interest in GDTE in 2015, we recognized a
net decrease in AOCL of $77 million, comprised of a reduction of $184 million for GDTNA accumulated
pension-related losses that were recognized in the net gain on sale for the transaction, partially offset by an
increase of $107 million primarily for GDTE pension-related losses that were reclassified from minority
shareholders’ equity into AOCL. We also recognized an increase in our capital surplus of $60 million related to
our acquisition of the minority interest in GDTE.

United States and Foreign Tax (Benefit) Expense . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

$513

$ (77)

$232

In 2017,
income tax expense of $513 million was unfavorably impacted by net discrete adjustments of
$294 million, due to a net non-cash charge of $299 million related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
(the “Tax Act”) in the United States, and $5 million, net benefit, of other miscellaneous discrete tax items.

Effective January 1, 2018, the Tax Act establishes a corporate income tax rate of 21%, replacing the current 35%
rate, and creates a territorial tax system rather than a worldwide system, which generally eliminates the U.S.
federal income tax on dividends from foreign subsidiaries. The transition to the territorial system includes a
one-time transition tax on certain of our foreign earnings previously untaxed in the United States. Certain
impacts of the new legislation would generally require accounting to be completed in the period of enactment,
however, in response to the complexities of this new legislation, the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) issued guidance to provide companies with relief. Specifically, when the initial accounting for items
under the new legislation is incomplete, the guidance allows us to include provisional amounts when reasonable
estimates can be made. The SEC has provided up to a one-year measurement period for companies to finalize the
accounting for the impacts of this new legislation and we anticipate finalizing our accounting over the coming
quarters. While our accounting for the Tax Act is not complete, we have made reasonable estimates for certain
provisions and we have recorded a non-cash net charge to tax expense of $299 million related to its enactment.
This net charge includes a deferred tax charge of $384 million primarily from revaluing our net U.S. deferred tax
assets to reflect the new U.S. corporate tax rate. We believe this calculation is complete except for changes in
estimates that can result from finalizing the filing of our 2017 U.S. income tax return, which are not anticipated
to be material, and changes that may be a direct impact of other provisional amounts recorded due to the
enactment of the Tax Act. The net charge also includes a provisional deferred tax benefit of $162 million to
reverse reserves maintained for the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings under prior law net of reserves
established for foreign withholding taxes consistent with our revised indefinite reinvestment assertion, and a
provisional deferred tax charge of $77 million related to the one-time transition tax. In general, the one-time
transition tax imposed by the Tax Act results in the taxation of our accumulated foreign earnings and profits
(“E&P”) at a 15.5% rate on liquid assets and 8% on the remaining unremitted foreign E&P, both net of foreign
tax credits. At this time, we have not yet gathered, prepared and analyzed the necessary information with respect
to 2017 in sufficient detail to complete the complex calculations necessary to finalize the amount of our
transition tax. We also anticipate that further guidance may become available in this and other areas. We believe
that our preliminary calculations result in a reasonable estimate of the transition tax and related foreign tax credit
and, as such, have included those amounts in our year-end income tax provision. As the analysis of accumulated
foreign E&P and related foreign taxes paid are completed on an entity by entity basis and we finalize the amount

59

THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

held in cash or other specified assets, we will update our provisional estimate of the transition tax and related
foreign tax credit.

In 2016,
the income tax benefit of $77 million was favorably impacted by net discrete adjustments of
$458 million, due primarily to a tax benefit of $331 million from the December 31, 2016 release of the valuation
allowance on certain subsidiaries in England, France, Luxembourg and New Zealand. As of December 31, 2016,
these subsidiaries on which we have maintained a full valuation allowance have achieved earnings of a duration
and magnitude that they were in a position of cumulative profits for the most recent three-year period. As a
consequence of this profitability in recent periods and our future business plans forecasting sustainable
profitability, we concluded that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets in these entities will be
realized. The 2016 income tax benefit also included a $163 million tax benefit resulting from changing our
election for our 2009, 2010 and 2012 U.S. tax years from deducting foreign taxes to crediting foreign taxes, a
$39 million tax charge related to establishing a valuation allowance in the United States on deferred tax assets
related to receivables from our deconsolidated Venezuelan operations which were contributed to its capital, and a
$7 million tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance in Brazil due to the collection of a receivable
that had previously been written off as uncollectible.

In 2015, income tax expense of $232 million included net discrete tax benefits of $18 million unrelated to current
year income, due primarily to a $9 million benefit from the conclusion of non-U.S. tax claims and an $8 million
benefit from the release of a valuation allowance related to certain state deferred tax assets. Our tax expense for
2015 also included a U.S. tax benefit of $69 million related to the pre-tax loss of $646 million on the
deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary (refer to Note 1), and a current year benefit of $10 million related
to recently enacted U.S. legislation extending the research and development credit.

At December 31, 2017, we had $605 million of tax assets for net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit
carryforwards related to certain foreign subsidiaries. These carryforwards are primarily from countries with
unlimited carryforward periods, but include $53 million of tax credits in various European countries that are
subject to expiration from 2018 to 2027. A valuation allowance totaling $230 million has been recorded against
these and other deferred tax assets where recovery of the asset or carryforward is uncertain. In addition, we had

60

THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

$816 million of Federal and $94 million of state tax assets for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
The Federal carryforwards consist of $749 million of foreign tax credits that are subject to expiration from 2018
to 2025 and $67 million of tax assets related to research and development credits and other Federal credits that
are subject to expiration from 2030 to 2037. The state carryforwards are subject to expiration from 2018 to 2035.
A valuation allowance of $88 million has been recorded against Federal and state deferred tax assets where
recovery is uncertain.

At December 31, 2017, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $52 million that if recognized, would have a
favorable impact on our tax expense of $37 million. We had accrued interest of $2 million as of December 31,
2017. If not favorably settled, $5 million of the unrecognized tax benefits and all of the accrued interest would
require the use of our cash. We do not expect changes during 2018 to our unrecognized tax benefits to have a
significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.

We are open to examination in the United States for 2017 and in Germany from 2013 onward. Generally, for our
remaining tax jurisdictions, years from 2012 onward are still open to examination.

Prior to the enactment of the Tax Act, our assertion regarding the potential U.S. Federal taxation of certain
undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries required a reserve of $181 million which was established to
account for potential strategies which may have been implemented to utilize certain U.S. tax attributes. With the
enactment of the Tax Act, including a transition to the territorial system and a one-time transition tax on our
foreign earnings previously untaxed in the United States, the reserve for the U.S. tax related to our prior assertion
was no longer required and therefore released. As of December 31, 2017, we have changed our assertion and
have established a reserve of $19 million related to foreign withholding taxes (net of foreign tax credits) that we
would incur should we repatriate certain earnings.

We have undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately $1 billion where no provision for
foreign withholding tax is required because such earnings have been or will be reinvested in property, plant and
equipment and working capital. A withholding tax charge of approximately $74 million (net of foreign tax
credits) would be required if these earnings were to be distributed.

Net cash payments for income taxes were $144 million, $153 million and $113 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.

Note 8. Business Segments

Segment information reflects our strategic business units (“SBUs”), which are organized to meet customer
requirements and global competition. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we operated our business through
three operating segments representing our regional tire businesses: Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa;
and Asia Pacific. Segment information is reported on the basis used for reporting to our Chief Executive Officer.
Each of the three regional business segments is involved in the development, manufacture, distribution and sale
of tires. Certain of the business segments also provide related products and services, which include retreads and
automotive and commercial truck maintenance and repair services. Each segment also exports tires to other
segments.

Americas manufactures and sells tires for automobiles,
trucks, buses, earthmoving, mining and industrial
equipment, aircraft, and for various other applications. Americas also provides related products and services
including retreaded tires, tread rubber, automotive and commercial truck maintenance and repair services, as well
as sells chemical and natural rubber products to our other business segments and to unaffiliated customers.

(1) Corporate includes substantially all of our U.S. net deferred tax assets.

Results of operations are measured based on net sales to unaffiliated customers and segment operating income.
Each segment exports tires to other segments. The financial results of each segment exclude sales of tires
exported to other segments, but include operating income derived from such transactions. Segment operating
income is computed as follows: Net sales less CGS (excluding asset write-offs and accelerated depreciation
charges) and SAG (including certain allocated corporate administrative expenses). Segment operating income
also includes certain royalties and equity in earnings of most affiliates. Segment operating income does not
include net rationalization charges, asset sales, pension curtailments/settlements and certain other items.

The following table presents geographic information. Net sales by country were determined based on the location
of the selling subsidiary. Long-lived assets consisted of property, plant and equipment. Besides Germany,
management did not consider the net sales of any other individual countries outside the United States to be
significant to the consolidated financial statements. For long-lived assets only, China and Germany were
considered to be significant.

Our annual impairment analyses for 2017, 2016 and 2015 indicated no impairment of goodwill or intangible
assets with indefinite lives. In addition, there were no events or circumstances that indicated the impairment tests
should be re-performed for goodwill or for intangible assets with indefinite lives for any reporting unit at
December 31, 2017.

Note 12. Other Assets and Investments

Dividends received from our consolidated subsidiaries were $558 million, $66 million and $46 million in 2017,

We enter into leases primarily for our wholesale distribution facilities, administrative offices, retail stores,
vehicles and data processing equipment under varying terms and conditions. Many of the leases require us to pay
taxes assessed against leased property and the cost of insurance and maintenance. A portion of our retail
distribution network is sublet to independent dealers.

While substantially all subleases and some operating leases are cancelable for periods beyond 2018, management
expects that in the normal course of its business nearly all of its independent dealer distribution network will be
actively operated. As leases and subleases for existing locations expire, we would normally expect to evaluate
such leases and either renew the leases or substitute another more favorable retail location.

CREDIT FACILITIES

$2.0 billion Amended and Restated First Lien Revolving Credit Facility due 2021

Our amended and restated first lien revolving credit facility is available in the form of loans or letters of credit,
with letter of credit availability limited to $800 million. Subject to the consent of the lenders whose commitments
are to be increased, we may request that the facility be increased by up to $250 million. Amounts drawn under
this facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 125 basis points, based on our current liquidity as described below.

Our obligations under the facility are guaranteed by most of our wholly-owned U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries.
Our obligations under the facility and our subsidiaries’ obligations under the related guarantees are secured by
first priority security interests in collateral that includes, subject to certain exceptions:

• U.S. and Canadian accounts receivable and inventory;

• certain of our U.S. manufacturing facilities;

• equity interests in our U.S. subsidiaries and up to 65% of the equity interests in our directly owned foreign

subsidiaries; and

• substantially all other tangible and intangible assets, including equipment, contract rights and intellectual

property.

Availability under the facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based primarily on (i) eligible accounts
receivable and inventory of The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company and certain of its U.S. and Canadian
subsidiaries, after adjusting for customary factors that are subject to modification from time to time by the
administrative agent or the majority lenders at their discretion (not to be exercised unreasonably), (ii) the value of
our principal trademarks, and (iii) certain cash in an amount not to exceed $200 million. Modifications are based
on the results of periodic collateral and borrowing base evaluations and appraisals. To the extent that our eligible
accounts receivable, inventory and other components of the borrowing base decline in value, our borrowing base
will decrease and the availability under the facility may decrease below $2.0 billion. In addition, if the amount of
outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under the facility exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to
prepay borrowings and/or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient
to eliminate the excess. As of
December 31, 2017, our borrowing base, and therefore our availability, under this facility was $296 million
below the facility’s stated amount of $2.0 billion.

The facility, which matures on April 7, 2021, contains certain covenants that, among other things, limit our
ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to (i) incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred
stock, (ii) pay dividends, repurchase shares or make certain other restricted payments or investments, (iii) incur
liens, (iv) sell assets, (v) incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other
payments to us, (vi) enter into affiliate transactions, (vii) engage in sale and leaseback transactions, and
(viii) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. These covenants are
subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. In addition, in the event that the availability under the facility
plus the aggregate amount of our Available Cash is less than $200 million, we will not be permitted to allow our
ratio of EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense to be less than 2.0 to 1.0 for any period of four consecutive
fiscal quarters. “Available Cash,” “EBITDA” and “Consolidated Interest Expense” have the meanings given
them in the facility.

The facility has customary representations and warranties including, as a condition to borrowing, that all such
representations and warranties are true and correct, in all material respects, on the date of the borrowing,
including representations as to no material adverse change in our business or financial condition since

73

THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

December 31, 2015. The facility also has customary defaults, including a cross-default to material indebtedness
of Goodyear and our subsidiaries.

If Available Cash (as defined in the facility) plus the availability under the facility is greater than $1.0 billion,
amounts drawn under the facility will bear interest, at our option, at (i) 125 basis points over LIBOR or (ii) 25
basis points over an alternative base rate (the higher of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate or
the overnight bank funding rate plus 50 basis points or (c) LIBOR plus 100 basis points), and undrawn amounts
under the facility will be subject to an annual commitment fee of 30 basis points. If Available Cash plus the
availability under the facility is equal to or less than $1.0 billion, then amounts drawn under the facility will bear
interest, at our option, at (i) 150 basis points over LIBOR or (ii) 50 basis points over an alternative base rate, and
undrawn amounts under the facility will be subject to an annual commitment fee of 25 basis points.

At December 31, 2017, we had no borrowings and $37 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving
credit facility. At December 31, 2016, we had $85 million of borrowings and $40 million of letters of credit
issued under the revolving credit facility.

Amended and Restated Second Lien Term Loan Facility due 2019

In March 2017, we amended our second lien term loan facility. As a result of the amendment, the term loan now
bears interest, at our option, at (i) 200 basis points over LIBOR or (ii) 100 basis points over an alternative base
rate (the higher of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate or the overnight bank funding rate plus
50 basis points or (c) LIBOR plus 100 basis points). In addition, if the Total Leverage Ratio is equal to or less
than 1.25 to 1.00, we have the option to further reduce the spreads described above by 25 basis points. “Total
Leverage Ratio” has the meaning given it in the facility.

Our obligations under our second lien term loan facility are guaranteed by most of our wholly-owned U.S. and
Canadian subsidiaries and are secured by second priority security interests in the same collateral securing the
$2.0 billion first lien revolving credit facility.

The facility, which matures on April 30, 2019, contains covenants, representations, warranties and defaults
similar to those in the $2.0 billion first lien revolving credit facility. In addition, if our Pro Forma Senior Secured
Leverage Ratio (the ratio of Consolidated Net Secured Indebtedness to EBITDA) for any period of four
consecutive fiscal quarters is greater than 3.0 to 1.0, before we may use cash proceeds from certain asset sales to
repay any junior lien, senior unsecured or subordinated indebtedness, we must first offer to use such cash
proceeds to prepay borrowings under the second lien term loan facility. “Pro Forma Senior Secured Leverage
Ratio,” “Consolidated Net Secured Indebtedness” and “EBITDA” have the meanings given them in the facility.

The amounts outstanding under this facility were $400 million and $399 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016,
respectively.

€550 million Amended and Restated Senior Secured European Revolving Credit Facility due 2020

Our amended and restated €550 million European revolving credit facility consists of (i) a €125 million German
tranche that is available only to Goodyear Dunlop Tires Germany GmbH (“GDTG”) and (ii) a €425 million
all-borrower tranche that is available to GDTE, GDTG and Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations S.A. Up to
€150 million of swingline loans and €50 million in letters of credit are available for issuance under the
all-borrower tranche. Amounts drawn under this facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus 175 basis points for
loans denominated in U.S. dollars or pounds sterling and EURIBOR plus 175 basis points for loans denominated
in euros, and undrawn amounts under the facility will be subject to an annual commitment fee of 30 basis points.

GDTE and certain of its subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, France and Germany provide
guarantees to support the facility. GDTE’s obligations under the facility and the obligations of its subsidiaries
under the related guarantees are secured by security interests in collateral that includes, subject to certain
exceptions:

• the capital stock of the principal subsidiaries of GDTE; and

74

THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

• a substantial portion of the tangible and intangible assets of GDTE and certain of its subsidiaries in the
United Kingdom, Luxembourg, France and Germany, including real property, equipment, inventory,
contract rights, intercompany receivables and cash accounts, but excluding accounts receivable and
certain cash accounts in subsidiaries that are or may become parties to securitization or factoring
transactions.

The German guarantors secure the German tranche on a first-lien basis and the all-borrower tranche on a second-
lien basis. GDTE and its other subsidiaries that provide guarantees secure the all-borrower tranche on a first-lien
basis and generally do not provide collateral support for the German tranche. The Company and its U.S. and
Canadian subsidiaries that guarantee our U.S. senior secured credit facilities described above also provide
unsecured guarantees in support of the facility.

The facility, which matures on May 12, 2020, contains covenants similar to those in our first lien revolving credit
facility, with additional limitations applicable to GDTE and its subsidiaries. In addition, under the facility,
GDTE’s ratio of Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness to Consolidated European J.V. EBITDA for a period of four
consecutive fiscal quarters is not permitted to be greater than 3.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter.
“Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness” and “Consolidated European J.V. EBITDA” have the meanings given
them in the facility.

The facility has customary representations and warranties including, as a condition to borrowing, that all such
representations and warranties are true and correct, in all material respects, on the date of the borrowing,
including representations as to no material adverse change in our business or financial condition since
December 31, 2014. The facility also has customary defaults, including a cross-default to material indebtedness
of Goodyear and our subsidiaries.

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no borrowings and no letters of credit issued under the European
revolving credit facility.

Accounts Receivable Securitization Facilities (On-Balance Sheet)

GDTE and certain other of our European subsidiaries are parties to a pan-European accounts receivable
securitization facility that expires in 2019. The terms of the facility provide the flexibility to designate annually
the maximum amount of funding available under the facility in an amount of not less than €30 million and not
more than €450 million. For the period beginning October 16, 2016 to October 15, 2017, the designated
maximum amount of the facility was €320 million. For the period beginning October 16, 2017 to October 15,
2018, the designated maximum amount of the facility is €275 million.

The facility involves an ongoing daily sale of substantially all of the trade accounts receivable of certain GDTE
subsidiaries to a bankruptcy-remote French company controlled by one of the liquidity banks in the facility.
These subsidiaries retain servicing responsibilities. Utilization under this facility is based on eligible receivable
balances.

The funding commitments under the facility will expire upon the earliest to occur of: (a) September 25, 2019, (b)
the non-renewal and expiration (without substitution) of all of the back-up liquidity commitments, (c) the early
termination of the facility according to its terms (generally upon an Early Amortisation Event (as defined in the
facility), which includes, among other things, events similar to the events of default under our senior secured
credit facilities; certain tax law changes; or certain changes to law, regulation or accounting standards), or (d) our
request for early termination of the facility. The facility’s current back-up liquidity commitments will expire on
October 15, 2018.

At December 31, 2017, the amounts available and utilized under this program totaled $224 million (€187
million). At December 31, 2016, the amounts available and utilized under this program totaled $198 million
(€188 million). The program does not qualify for sale accounting, and accordingly, these amounts are included in
Long Term Debt and Capital Leases.

THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Accounts Receivable Factoring Facilities (Off-Balance Sheet)

We have sold certain of our trade receivables under off-balance sheet programs. For these programs, we have
concluded that there is generally no risk of loss to us from non-payment of the sold receivables. At December 31,
2017 and 2016, the gross amount of receivables sold was $572 million and $502 million, respectively.

Other Foreign Credit Facilities

A Mexican subsidiary and a U.S. subsidiary have several financing arrangements in Mexico. At December 31,
2017, the amounts available and utilized under these facilities were $340 million. At December 31, 2016, the
amounts available and utilized under these facilities were $190 million and $138 million, respectively. The
facilities ultimately mature in 2020. The facilities contain covenants relating to the Mexican and U.S. subsidiary
and have customary representations and warranties and default provisions relating to the Mexican and U.S.
subsidiary’s ability to perform its respective obligations under the applicable facilities.

A Chinese subsidiary has several financing arrangements in China. At December 31, 2017, these non-revolving
credit facilities had total unused availability of $217 million and can only be used to finance the expansion of our
manufacturing facility in China. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the amounts outstanding under these facilities
were $212 million and $315 million, respectively. The facilities ultimately mature in 2025 and principal
amortization began in 2015. The facilities contain covenants relating to the Chinese subsidiary and have
customary representations and warranties and defaults relating to the Chinese subsidiary’s ability to perform its
obligations under the facilities. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, restricted cash related to funds obtained under
these credit facilities was $7 million and $8 million, respectively.

Debt Maturities

The annual aggregate maturities of our debt (excluding the impact of deferred financing fees and unamortized
discounts) and capital leases for the five years subsequent to December 31, 2017 are presented below. Maturities
of debt credit agreements have been reported on the basis that the commitments to lend under these agreements
will be terminated effective at the end of their current terms.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

We utilize derivative financial instrument contracts and nonderivative instruments to manage interest rate,
foreign exchange and commodity price risks. We have established a control environment that includes policies
and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument
activities. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Foreign Currency Contracts

We enter into foreign currency contracts in order to manage the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on
our consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency-denominated cash flows. These contracts may
be used to reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency-denominated assets,
liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted transactions resulting primarily from trade purchases and sales,
equipment acquisitions,
term trade
receivables and payables normally have no hedging designation.

The estimated net amount of the deferred losses at December 31, 2017 that is expected to be reclassified to
earnings within the next twelve months is $9 million.

The counterparties to our foreign currency contracts were considered by us to be substantial and creditworthy
financial institutions that are recognized market makers at the time we entered into those contracts. We seek to
control our credit exposure to these counterparties by diversifying across multiple counterparties, by setting
counterparty credit limits based on long term credit ratings and other indicators of counterparty credit risk such
as credit default swap spreads, and by monitoring the financial strength of these counterparties on a regular basis.
We also enter into master netting agreements with counterparties when possible. By controlling and monitoring

77

THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

exposure to counterparties in this manner, we believe that we effectively manage the risk of loss due to
nonperformance by a counterparty. However, the inability of a counterparty to fulfill its contractual obligations
to us could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position or results of operations in the period
in which it occurs.

respectively, of which $110 million and $123 million, respectively, are at fixed rates and $152 million and
$122 million, respectively, are at variable rates. The carrying value of notes payable and overdrafts
approximates fair value due to the short term nature of the facilities.

Long term debt with a fair value of $3,857 million and $3,804 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016,
respectively, was estimated using quoted Level 1 market prices. The carrying value of the remaining long term
debt approximates fair value since the terms of the financing arrangements are similar to terms that could be
obtained under current lending market conditions.

Note 17. Pension, Other Postretirement Benefits and Savings Plans

We provide employees with defined benefit pension or defined contribution savings plans. Our hourly
U.S. pension plans are frozen and provide benefits based on length of service. The principal salaried U.S. pension
plans are frozen and provide benefits based on final five-year average earnings formulas. Salaried employees

78

THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

who made voluntary contributions to these plans receive higher benefits. We also provide certain U.S. employees
and employees at certain non-U.S. subsidiaries with health care benefits or life insurance benefits upon
retirement. Substantial portions of the health care benefits for U.S. salaried retirees are not insured and are
funded from operations.

During 2017, we recognized settlement charges of $32 million, primarily related to our frozen salaried U.S.
pension plan. The settlement charges resulted from total lump sum benefit payments exceeding annual interest
cost. Of the total settlement charges, $13 million was included in rationalization charges for employees who
terminated service as a result of ongoing rationalization plans.

During the second quarter of 2016, annuities were purchased from existing plan assets to settle $41 million in
obligations of one of our U.K. pension plans which resulted in a settlement charge of $14 million.

During 2015, we offered lump sum payments over a limited time to certain former employees in our U.S. pension
plans. Payments of $190 million related to this offer were made from existing plan assets in the fourth quarter of
2015. As a result, total lump sum payments from these plans exceeded annual service and interest cost in 2015,
and we recognized a pre-tax corporate pension settlement charge of $137 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.

THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Total benefits (credit) cost for our other postretirement benefits was $(17) million, $(31) million and $(28)
million for our U.S. plans in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $10 million, $8 million and $8 million for
our non-U.S. plans in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The estimated net actuarial loss for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from AOCL into
benefits cost in 2018 is $114 million for our U.S. plans and $30 million for our non-U.S. plans.

The estimated prior service credit and net actuarial loss for the other postretirement benefit plans that will be
amortized from AOCL into benefits cost in 2018 are a benefit of $8 million and expense of $5 million,
respectively.

The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act provides plan sponsors a federal subsidy
for certain qualifying prescription drug benefits covered under the sponsor’s postretirement health care plans.
Our other postretirement benefits cost is presented net of this subsidy, which is approximately $1 million
annually.

Effective January 1, 2016, we changed the method used to measure the service and interest components of net
periodic cost for pension and other postretirement benefits for plans that utilize a yield curve approach. We
elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the measurement of these components by applying the specific
spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash
flows. We believe this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning
the timing of projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. This change did not
affect the measurement of our plan benefit obligations and reduced our 2016 net periodic pension cost by
approximately $65 million. We have accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate.

For 2017, a weighted average discount rate of 3.18% was used to determine interest cost for the U.S. pension
plans. This rate was derived from spot rates along a yield curve developed from a portfolio of bonds from issuers
rated AA or higher by established rating agencies as of December 31, 2016, applied to our expected benefit
payment cash flows. For our non-U.S. locations, a weighted average discount rate of 2.70% was used. This rate
was developed based on the nature of the liabilities and local environments, using available bond indices, yield
curves, projected cash flows, and long term inflation.

For 2017, an assumed weighted average long term rate of return of 5.08% was used for the U.S. pension plans. In
developing the long term rate of return, we evaluated input from our pension fund consultant on asset class return
expectations, including determining the appropriate rate of return for our plans, which are primarily invested in
fixed income securities. For our non-U.S. locations, an assumed weighted average long term rate of return of
3.12% was used. Input from local pension fund consultants concerning asset class return expectations and long
term inflation form the basis of this assumption.

The U.S. pension plan mortality assumption is based on our actual historical experience and expected future
mortality improvements based on published actuarial tables. For our non-U.S. locations, mortality assumptions
are based on published actuarial tables which include projections of future mortality improvements.

Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries maintain unfunded pension plans consistent with local practices and requirements.
At December 31, 2017, these plans accounted for $227 million of our accumulated pension benefit obligation,
$251 million of our projected pension benefit obligation, and $59 million of our AOCL adjustment. At
December 31, 2016, these plans accounted for $219 million of our accumulated pension benefit obligation,
$239 million of our projected pension benefit obligation, and $65 million of our AOCL adjustment.

We expect to contribute approximately $25 million to $50 million to our funded non-U.S. pension plans in 2018.

Our pension investment policy recognizes the long term nature of pension liabilities,
the benefits of
diversification across asset classes and the effects of inflation. The portfolio for plans that are fully funded is
designed to offset the future impact of discount rate movements on the funded status for those plans. The
diversified portfolio for plans that are not fully funded is designed to maximize returns consistent with levels of
liquidity and investment risk that are prudent and reasonable. All assets are managed externally according to
target asset allocation guidelines we have established. Manager guidelines prohibit the use of any type of
investment derivative without our prior approval. Portfolio risk is controlled by having managers comply with
guidelines, establishing the maximum size of any single holding in their portfolios and by using managers with
different investment styles. We periodically undertake asset and liability modeling studies to determine the
appropriateness of the investments.

The portfolio of our U.S. pension plan assets includes holdings of global high quality and high yield fixed
income securities, short term interest bearing deposits, and private equities. The target asset allocation of our
U.S. pension plans is 94% in duration-matched fixed income securities and 6% in equity securities. Actual
U.S. pension fund asset allocations are reviewed on a periodic basis and the pension funds are rebalanced to
target ranges on an as needed basis.

The portfolios of our non-U.S. pension plans include holdings of U.S. and non-U.S. equities, global high quality
and high yield fixed income securities, hedge funds, currency derivatives, insurance contracts, repurchase
agreements, and short term interest bearing deposits. The weighted average target asset allocation of the
non-U.S. pension funds is approximately 10% equities and 90% fixed income.

THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Plans did not directly hold any of our common stock.

The classification of fair value measurements within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is
significant to the measurement. Investments that are measured at NAV as a practical expedient to estimate fair
value are not classified in the fair value hierarchy. Under the practical expedient approach, the NAV is based on
the fair value of the underlying investments held by each fund less its liabilities. This practical expedient would
not be used when it is determined to be probable that the fund will sell the investment for an amount different
than the reported NAV. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the
fair value hierarchy to total plan assets. Valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair
value are as follows:

• Cash and Short Term Securities: Cash and cash equivalents consist of U.S. and foreign currencies.
Foreign currencies are reported in U.S. dollars based on currency exchange rates readily available in
active markets. Short term securities held in commingled funds are valued at the NAV of units held at
year end, as determined by the investment manager.

• Equity Securities: Common and preferred stock are valued at the closing price reported on the active
market on which the individual securities are traded. Commingled funds are valued at the NAV of units
held at year end, as determined by a pricing vendor or the fund family. Mutual funds are valued at the
NAV of shares held at year end, as determined by the closing price reported on the active market on
which the individual securities are traded, or a pricing vendor or the fund family if an active market is not
available. Partnership interests are priced based on valuations using the partnership’s available financial
statements coinciding with our year end and the plan’s percent ownership, adjusted for any cash
transactions which occurred between the date of those financial statements and our year end.

• Debt Securities: Corporate and government bonds, including asset backed securities, are valued at the
closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded, or based on
institutional bid evaluations using proprietary models if an active market is not available. Repurchase
agreements are valued at
the contract price plus accrued interest. These secured borrowings are
collateralized by government bonds held by the non-U.S. plans and have maturities less than one year.
Commingled funds are valued at the NAV of units held at year end, as determined by a pricing vendor or
the fund family. Mutual funds are valued at the NAV of shares held at year end, as determined by the
closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded, or a pricing
vendor or the fund family if an active market is not available.

• Alternatives: Commingled funds are invested in hedge funds and currency derivatives, which are valued
based on the NAV as determined by the fund manager using the most recent financial information
available. Participation in real estate funds are valued based on institutional bid evaluations or the NAV as
determined by the fund manager using the most recent financial information available. Other investments
include derivative financial instruments, which are primarily valued using independent pricing sources
which utilize industry standard derivative valuation models, and directed insurance contracts, which are
valued as reported by the issuer.

The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable
value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are
appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to
determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the
reporting date.

Other postretirement benefits plan assets at December 31, 2017 and 2016, which relate to a non-U.S. plan, are
invested primarily in mutual funds, which are traded on an active market, and are considered a Level 1
investment.

Savings Plans

Substantially all employees in the U.S. and employees of certain non-U.S. locations are eligible to participate in a
defined contribution savings plan. Expenses recognized for contributions to these plans were $111 million,
$122 million and $125 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Note 18. Stock Compensation Plans

Our stock compensation plans (collectively, the “Plans”) permit the grant of stock options, stock appreciation
rights (“SARs”), performance share units, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards to
employees and directors. Our current stock compensation plan, the 2017 Performance Plan, was adopted on
April 10, 2017 and expires on April 9, 2027. A total of 18,000,000 shares of our common stock may be issued in
respect of grants made under the 2017 Performance Plan. Any shares of common stock that are subject to awards
of stock options or SARs will be counted as one share for each share granted for purposes of the aggregate share
limit and any shares of common stock that are subject to any other awards will be counted as 2 shares for each
share granted for purposes of the aggregate share limit. In addition, shares of common stock that are subject to

88

THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

awards issued under the 2017 Performance Plan or certain prior stock compensation plans that expire according
to their terms or are forfeited, terminated, canceled or surrendered or are settled, or can be paid, only in cash, or
are surrendered in payment of taxes associated with such awards (other than stock options or SARs) will be
available for issuance pursuant to a new award under the 2017 Performance Plan. Shares issued under our stock
compensation plans are usually issued from shares of our common stock held in treasury.

Stock Options

Grants of stock options and SARs (collectively referred to as “options”) under the Plans generally have a graded
vesting period of four years whereby one-fourth of the awards vest on each of the first four anniversaries of the
grant date, an exercise price equal to the fair market value of one share of our common stock on the date of grant
(calculated as the average of the high and low price or the closing market price on that date depending on the
terms of the related Plan) and a contractual term of ten years. The exercise of tandem SARs cancels an equivalent

Performance Share Units

Performance share units granted under the Plans are earned over a three-year period beginning January 1 of the
year of grant. Total units earned for grants made in 2017, 2016 and 2015, may vary between 0% and 200% of the
units granted based on the attainment of performance targets during the related three-year period and continued
service. The performance targets are established by the Board of Directors. All of the units earned will be settled
through the issuance of an equivalent number of shares of our common stock and are equity classified.

Note 19. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

Environmental Matters

We have recorded liabilities totaling $46 million and $55 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for
anticipated costs related to various environmental matters, primarily the remediation of numerous waste disposal
sites and certain properties sold by us. Of these amounts, $10 million and $21 million were included in Other
Current Liabilities at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The costs include legal and consulting fees, site
studies, the design and implementation of remediation plans, post-remediation monitoring and related activities, and
will be paid over several years. The amount of our ultimate liability in respect of these matters may be affected by
several uncertainties, primarily the ultimate cost of required remediation and the extent to which other responsible
parties contribute. We have limited potential insurance coverage for future environmental claims.

Since many of the remediation activities related to environmental matters vary substantially in duration and cost
from site to site and the associated costs for each vary depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, in
some cases we cannot reasonably estimate a range of possible losses. Although it is not possible to estimate with
certainty the outcome of all of our environmental matters, management believes that potential losses in excess of
current reserves for environmental matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse
effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

Workers’ Compensation

We have recorded liabilities, on a discounted basis, totaling $243 million and $248 million for anticipated costs
related to workers’ compensation at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Of these amounts, $45 million
and $48 million were included in Current Liabilities as part of Compensation and Benefits at December 31, 2017
and 2016, respectively. The costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims, defense costs
and a provision for claims incurred but not reported. These estimates are based on our assessment of potential
liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims, historical experience, and
current cost trends. The amount of our ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these
estimates. We periodically, and at least annually, update our loss development factors based on actuarial
analyses. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the liability was discounted using a risk-free rate of return. At
December 31, 2017, we estimate that it is reasonably possible that the liability could exceed our recorded
amounts by approximately $30 million.

General and Product Liability and Other Litigation

We have recorded liabilities totaling $316 million, including related legal fees expected to be incurred, for
potential product liability and other tort claims, including asbestos claims, at both December 31, 2017 and 2016.
Of these amounts, $55 million and $49 million were included in Other Current Liabilities at December 31, 2017
and 2016, respectively. The amounts recorded were estimated based on an assessment of potential liability using
an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims, historical experience and, where available,
recent and current trends. Based upon that assessment, at December 31, 2017, we do not believe that estimated
reasonably possible losses associated with general and product liability claims in excess of the amounts recorded
will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. However, the
amount of our ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates. We have recorded an
indemnification asset within Accounts Receivable of $5 million and within Other Assets of $30 million for SRI’s
obligation to indemnify us for certain product liability claims related to products manufactured by GDTNA
during the existence of the global alliance with SRI, subject to certain caps and restrictions.

92

THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Asbestos. We are a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging various asbestos-related personal injuries purported
to result from alleged exposure to asbestos in certain products manufactured by us or present in certain of our
facilities. Typically, these lawsuits have been brought against multiple defendants in state and Federal courts. To
date, we have disposed of approximately 134,700 claims by defending and obtaining the dismissal thereof or by
entering into a settlement. The sum of our accrued asbestos-related liability and gross payments to date, including
legal costs, by us and our insurers totaled approximately $529 million and $517 million through December 31,
2017 and 2016, respectively.

A summary of recent approximate asbestos claims activity follows. Because claims are often filed and disposed
of by dismissal or settlement in large numbers, the amount and timing of settlements and the number of open
claims during a particular period can fluctuate significantly.

(1) Represents amount spent by us and our insurers on asbestos litigation defense and claim resolution.

We periodically, and at least annually, review our existing reserves for pending claims, including a reasonable
estimate of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims, and estimate our receivables from probable
insurance recoveries. We recorded gross liabilities for both asserted and unasserted claims, inclusive of defense
costs, totaling $167 million and $171 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In determining the
estimate of our asbestos liability, we evaluated claims over the next ten year period. Due to the difficulties in
making these estimates, analysis based on new data and/or changed circumstances arising in the future may result
in an increase in the recorded obligation, and that increase may be significant.

We maintain certain primary and excess insurance coverage under coverage-in-place agreements, and also have
additional excess liability insurance with respect to asbestos liabilities. After consultation with our outside legal
counsel and giving consideration to agreements with certain of our insurance carriers, the financial viability and
legal obligations of our insurance carriers and other relevant factors, we determine an amount we expect is
probable of recovery from such carriers. We record a receivable with respect to such policies when we determine
that recovery is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of a particular recovery.

We recorded a receivable related to asbestos claims of $113 million and $123 million at December 31, 2017 and
2016, respectively. We expect that approximately 70% of asbestos claim related losses would be recoverable
through insurance during the period covered by the estimated liability. Of these amounts, $15 million and
$12 million were included in Current Assets as part of Accounts Receivable at December 31, 2017 and 2016,
respectively. The recorded receivable consists of an amount we expect to collect under coverage-in-place
agreements with certain primary carriers and excess insurance carriers as well as an amount we believe is
probable of recovery from certain of our other excess insurance carriers.

We believe that, at December 31, 2017, we had approximately $440 million in excess level policy limits
applicable to indemnity and defense costs for asbestos products claims under coverage-in-place agreements. We
also had additional unsettled excess level policy limits potentially applicable to such costs. We had coverage
under certain primary policies for indemnity and defense costs for asbestos products claims under remaining
aggregate limits pursuant to a coverage-in-place agreement, as well as coverage for indemnity and defense costs
for asbestos premises claims pursuant to coverage-in-place agreements.

93

THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

We believe that our reserve for asbestos claims, and the receivable for recoveries from insurance carriers
recorded in respect of these claims, reflects reasonable and probable estimates of these amounts. The estimate of
the assets and liabilities related to pending and expected future asbestos claims and insurance recoveries is
subject to numerous uncertainties, including, but not limited to, changes in:

• the litigation environment,

• Federal and state law governing the compensation of asbestos claimants,

• recoverability of receivables due to potential insolvency of carriers,

• our approach to defending and resolving claims, and

• the level of payments made to claimants from other sources, including other defendants and 524(g) trusts.

As a result, with respect to both asserted and unasserted claims, it is reasonably possible that we may incur a
material amount of cost in excess of the current reserve; however, such amounts cannot be reasonably estimated.
Coverage under insurance policies is subject to varying characteristics of asbestos claims including, but not
limited to, the type of claim (premise vs. product exposure), alleged date of first exposure to our products or
premises and disease alleged. Depending upon the nature of these characteristics, as well as the resolution of
certain legal issues, some portion of the insurance may not be accessible by us.

Amiens Labor Claims

Approximately 840 former employees of the closed Amiens, France manufacturing facility have asserted wrongful
termination or other claims totaling €118 million ($142 million) against Goodyear Dunlop Tires France. We intend
to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims, and any additional claims that may be asserted against us, and
cannot estimate the amounts, if any, that we may ultimately pay in respect of such claims.

Other Actions

We are currently a party to various claims, indirect tax assessments and legal proceedings in addition to those
noted above. If management believes that a loss arising from these matters is probable and can reasonably be
estimated, we record the amount of the loss, or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using
a range, and no point within the range is more probable than another. As additional information becomes
available, any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary.
Based on currently available information, management believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters,
individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall
trends in results of operations.

Our recorded liabilities and estimates of reasonably possible losses for the contingent liabilities described above
are based on our assessment of potential liability using the information available to us at the time and, where
applicable, any past experience and recent and current trends with respect to similar matters. Our contingent
liabilities are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable judicial or administrative decisions could occur
which we did not anticipate. Such an unfavorable decision could include monetary damages, fines or other
penalties or an injunction prohibiting us from taking certain actions or selling certain products. If such an
unfavorable decision were to occur, it could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and
results of operations in the period in which the decision occurs, or in future periods.

Income Tax Matters

The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax
regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the
extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is
unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the

94

THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

liability is no longer necessary. We also recognize income tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not
that our positions will be sustained when challenged by the taxing authorities. We derecognize income tax
benefits when based on new information we determine that it is no longer more likely than not that our position
will be sustained. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established, or determine we
need to derecognize tax benefits recorded in prior periods, our results of operations and effective tax rate in a
given period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash, and lead
to recognition of expense to the extent the settlement amount exceeds recorded liabilities and, in the case of an
income tax settlement, result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax
settlement would be recognized as a reduction of expense to the extent the settlement amount is lower than
recorded liabilities and, in the case of an income tax settlement, result in a reduction in our effective tax rate in
the period of resolution.

While the Company applies consistent transfer pricing policies and practices globally, supports transfer prices
through economic studies, seeks advance pricing agreements and joint audits to the extent possible and believes
its transfer prices to be appropriate, such transfer prices, and related interpretations of tax laws, are occasionally
challenged by various taxing authorities globally. We have received various tax assessments challenging our
interpretations of applicable tax laws in various jurisdictions. Although we believe we have complied with
applicable tax laws, have strong positions and defenses and have historically been successful in defending such
claims, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in the case we are unsuccessful in the
defense of existing or future claims.

Binding Commitments and Guarantees

At December 31, 2017, we had binding commitments for raw materials, capital expenditures, utilities and various
other types of contracts. Total commitments on contracts that extend beyond 2018 are expected to total
approximately $2,500 million. In addition, we have other contractual commitments, the amounts of which cannot
be estimated, pursuant to certain long term agreements under which we will purchase varying amounts of certain
raw materials and finished goods at agreed upon base prices that may be subject to periodic adjustments for
changes in raw material costs and market price adjustments, or in quantities that may be subject to periodic
adjustments for changes in our or our suppliers’ production levels.

We have off-balance sheet financial guarantees and other commitments totaling approximately $82 million and
$40 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We issue guarantees to financial institutions or other
entities on behalf of certain of our affiliates, lessors or customers. Normally there is no separate premium
received by us as consideration for the issuance of guarantees.

In 2017, we issued a guarantee of approximately $47 million in connection with an indirect tax assessment in
EMEA. We have concluded our performance under this guarantee is not probable and, therefore, have not
recorded a liability for this guarantee. In 2015, as a result of the dissolution of the global alliance with SRI, we
issued a guarantee of approximately $46 million to an insurance company related to SRI’s obligation to pay
GDTNA’s outstanding workers’ compensation claims arising during the existence of the global alliance. As of
December 31, 2017, this guarantee has been reduced to $33 million. We have concluded the probability of our
performance to be remote and, therefore, have not recorded a liability for this guarantee. While there is no fixed
duration of this guarantee, we expect the amount of this guarantee to decrease over time as GDTNA pays its
outstanding claims.

If performance under our guarantees is triggered by non-payment or another specified event, we would be
obligated to make payment to the financial institution or the other entity, and would typically have recourse to
the affiliate, lessor, customer, or SRI. Except for the workers’ compensation guarantee described above, the
guarantees expire at various times through 2020. We are unable to estimate the extent to which our affiliates’,
lessors’, customers’, or SRI’s assets would be adequate to recover any payments made by us under the related
guarantees.

Indemnifications

At December 31, 2017, we were a party to various agreements under which we had assumed obligations to
indemnify the counterparties from certain potential claims and losses. These agreements typically involve
standard commercial activities undertaken by us in the normal course of business; the sale of assets by us; the
formation or dissolution of joint venture businesses to which we had contributed assets in exchange for
ownership interests; and other financial
to these
agreements relate to various matters including, among other things, environmental, tax and shareholder matters;
intellectual property rights; government regulations; employment-related matters; and dealer, supplier and other
commercial matters.

transactions. Indemnifications provided by us pursuant

Certain indemnifications expire from time to time, and certain other indemnifications are not subject to an
expiration date. In addition, our potential liability under certain indemnifications is subject to maximum caps,
while other indemnifications are not subject to caps. Although we have been subject to indemnification claims in
the past, we cannot reasonably estimate the number, type and size of indemnification claims that may arise in the
future. Due to these and other uncertainties associated with the indemnifications, our maximum exposure to loss
under these agreements cannot be estimated.

We have determined that there are no indemnifications or guarantees other than liabilities for which amounts are
already recorded or reserved in our consolidated financial statements under which it is probable that we have
incurred a liability.

Warranty

We recorded $17 million and $19 million for potential claims under warranties offered by us at December 31,
2017 and 2016, respectively, the majority of which is recorded in Other Current Liabilities.

Note 20. Capital Stock

Dividends

During 2017, 2016 and 2015 we paid cash dividends of $110 million, $82 million and $68 million, respectively,
on our common stock. On January 16, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee
thereof) declared cash dividends of $0.14 per share on our common stock, or approximately $34 million in the
aggregate. The cash dividend will be paid on March 1, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business
on February 1, 2018. Future quarterly dividends are subject to Board approval.

Common Stock Repurchases

On September 18, 2013, the Board of Directors approved our common stock repurchase program. From time to
time, the Board of Directors has approved increases in the amount authorized to be purchased under that
program. On February 2, 2017, the Board of Directors approved a further increase in that authorization to
$2.1 billion. This program expires on December 31, 2019. We intend to repurchase shares of common stock in

THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

open market transactions in order to offset new shares issued under equity compensation programs and to provide
for additional shareholder returns. During 2017, we repurchased 12,755,547 shares at an average price, including
commissions, of $31.37 per share, or $400 million in the aggregate. Since 2013, we repurchased 43,969,657
shares at an average price, including commissions, of $29.87 per share, or $1,313 million in the aggregate.

In addition, we may repurchase shares delivered to us by employees as payment for the exercise price of stock
options and the withholding taxes due upon the exercise of stock options or the vesting or payment of stock
awards. During 2017, we did not repurchase any shares from employees.

THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Note 22. Consolidating Financial Information

Certain of our subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the $282 million outstanding principal amount
of 8.75% notes due 2020, the $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due 2023, the
$900 million outstanding principal amount of 5% senior notes due 2026 and the $700 million outstanding
principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2027 (collectively, the “notes”). The following presents the
condensed consolidating financial information separately for:

(i) The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (the “Parent Company”), the issuer of the guaranteed

obligations;

(ii) Guarantor subsidiaries, on a combined basis, as specified in the indentures related to Goodyear’s

obligations under the notes;

(iii) Non-guarantor subsidiaries, on a combined basis;

(iv) Consolidating entries and eliminations representing adjustments to (a) eliminate intercompany
transactions between or among the Parent Company,
the guarantor subsidiaries and the
non-guarantor subsidiaries, (b) eliminate the investments in our subsidiaries, and (c) record
consolidating entries; and

(v) The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company and Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

Each guarantor subsidiary is 100% owned by the Parent Company at the date of each balance sheet presented.
The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by each guarantor subsidiary. The
guarantees of the guarantor subsidiaries are subject to release in limited circumstances only upon the occurrence
of certain customary conditions. Each entity in the consolidating financial
information follows the same
accounting policies as described in the consolidated financial statements, except for the use by the Parent
Company and guarantor subsidiaries of the equity method of accounting to reflect ownership interests in
subsidiaries which are eliminated upon consolidation. Changes in intercompany receivables and payables related
to operations, such as intercompany sales or service charges, are included in cash flows from operating activities.
Intercompany transactions reported as investing or financing activities include the sale of capital stock, loans and
other capital transactions between members of the consolidated group.

During the first quarter of 2017, one of our guarantor subsidiaries merged with the Parent Company. We have
changed the prior year consolidating financial statements to conform to the current structure. As a result, Parent
Company Total Assets decreased $113 million and Guarantor Subsidiaries Total Assets decreased $358 million,
with corresponding offsetting adjustments presented on the same line items in the Consolidating Entries and
Eliminations column, as of December 31, 2016. In addition, Parent Company Total Liabilities decreased
$113 million, Guarantor Subsidiaries Total Liabilities decreased $46 million and Guarantor Subsidiaries Total
Shareholders’ Equity decreased $312 million, with corresponding offsetting adjustments presented on the same
line items in the Consolidating Entries and Eliminations column, as of December 31, 2016. Furthermore, Net
Income increased $17 million and $1 million for Guarantor Subsidiaries, with corresponding offsetting
adjustments presented on the same line items in the Consolidating Entries and Eliminations column, for the year
ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The change did not impact the Non-Guarantor
Subsidiaries presentation in the previously issued consolidating financial statements.

Certain non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Parent Company are limited in their ability to remit funds to it by
means of dividends, advances or loans due to required foreign government and/or currency exchange board
approvals or limitations in credit agreements or other debt instruments of those subsidiaries.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended.

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with appropriate
authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Because of its inherent
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

limitations,

Management conducted an assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2017 using the framework specified in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013),
published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on such
assessment, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31, 2017.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 has been
audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their
report which is presented in this Annual Report.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes and financial statement
schedule, of The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company and its subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index
(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control—
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in
all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to
be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are
free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts
and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance

109

with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
