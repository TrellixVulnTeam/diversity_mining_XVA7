Nationwide’s evolution over the last 90 years 
has provided a strong foundation for success. 
The speed and magnitude of disruption in 
our industries is unprecedented, and we must 
continue to anticipate and adapt to serve our 
members far into the future.

We are a big company, yet we have big hearts.
We have a long history, yet we are forward thinking.
We are strong and stable, yet evolving.
We are conservative, yet fearless.

We are Nationwide.

NATIONWIDE 
2017 ANNUAL REPORT

We are building on our foundation, yet planning for the future.

Looking back at 2017, it was a year of extremes for Nationwide. Our financial 
services business achieved record growth as more members than ever relied 
on us to help prepare for retirement. Our property and casualty business 
helped our members, partners and communities rebuild following the wrath 
of two hurricanes and historic wildfires. In the end, this year marked one 
more in which Nationwide was true to our mission and continued to fulfill 
our promise to protect what’s most important to our members.

Although adverse weather took a toll on our property and casualty results, 
Nationwide’s diverse portfolio again demonstrated its value. All of our 
businesses had a solid year in terms of sales, and overall results were bolstered 
by our growth in retirement plans, annuities and corporate life insurance. 

Additionally, the improvements we’ve been implementing are working, and 
our business fundamentals are strong. We are paving the way for the future 
as we transform our company to create enhanced member experiences and 
more efficient operations. 

Our success has always been rooted in our heritage and culture. This year, 
Nationwide was proud to be recognized by Fortune as one of the Top 100 
Best Companies to Work For for the fourth consecutive year. This honor is 
a result of our strong values and talented associates who are dedicated to 
serving our members. 

As we continue to focus on the foundation that has made Nationwide great, 
we recognize that the pace of change in our industry is unprecedented. 
We are leading the way by thinking differently. In 2017, we were pleased to 
officially welcome Jefferson National to our family, operating as Nationwide 
Advisory Solutions. This addition expands our distribution channels into 
the registered investment advisor domain. Investments in venture capital 

opportunities, first-ever online retirement savings 
solutions — Guaranteed Retirement Income from 
Nationwide® — new technology and other areas are 
just a few other examples of how we are exploring this 
new environment.

Looking ahead, I couldn’t be more optimistic. Our 
industry is changing, and so is Nationwide. We’re 
making an important transformation. One for the 
better. And most important, one that plants the seeds 
for future success. Nationwide will most certainly be a 
different organization when we reach our centennial in 
2026. We’ll offer a full range of products and services, 
including some that may not exist today. We’ll do so, 
however, by staying true to the values and heritage that 
have made us an industry leader for nearly 100 years.

eight investments to date, including blooom, Insurify, Matic,

In 2017, Nationwide acquired Jefferson National, an industry-

“This move helps us meet the needs of more savers and

Encouraging safe 
driving with smart 
technology. 

Nationwide has long been committed to encouraging safe 
driving, and it’s this commitment that led to our integration 
with Amazon Alexa. 

Nationwide SmartRide members who use the SmartRide 
plug-in device can now use Alexa to access personalized 
driving information. 

Members can ask Alexa about their driving habits and get 
information on a variety of statistics, including mileage, 
hard braking and accelerating, idle time, nighttime driving 
and discounts. For example:

“Alexa, ask Nationwide how many miles I’ve driven.”

“Alexa, ask Nationwide to check my nighttime driving.”

“Alexa, ask Nationwide what my final discount is.”

Through SmartRide, Nationwide’s usage-based 
insurance program, the company collects critical pieces of 
data that have been identified as leading contributors to 
auto accidents.

Providing drivers with information about their driving 
habits can help them adjust their habits behind the 
wheel, making roads safer for everyone and providing the 
potential for lower premiums.

“SmartRide is an industry-leading effort to help make us all 
better and safer drivers,” said Sam Rassekh, vice president 
of digital optimization for Nationwide.

“We put our members at the center of every decision, so 
our commitment to digital advancement creates a better

 For your small 
business side, 
there’s Nationwide.

As the No. 1 total small business insurer, Nationwide is 
experienced at helping small business owners recover when 
trouble strikes. 

However, we’re also partnering to help small business 
owners proactively protect themselves from a variety of 
threats and find ways to operate more successfully. 

As part of this effort, Nationwide launched the Business 
Solutions Center in 2017, a new website that can support 
small businesses during key stages of development. 
The site provides information and tools on topics from 
marketing to cash flow management plus other industry-
specific resources. It also links users to other sources 
of information that support entrepreneurs, including 
Nationwide’s My Loss Control Services website and team 
of risk management and safety consultants.

“The simplicity of this site is helpful,” said Kenny Sipes, 
founder of The Roosevelt Coffeehouse, an Ohio business 

and social enterprise that fights hunger, works to combat 
human trafficking and supports clean water initiatives. “I 
was able to determine exactly what I would use and how 
I would use it. I don’t think there are any big sites that are 
providing this information as simply.”

While becoming informed is a good first step, more than 
500,000 small businesses have taken the next step to 
work with Nationwide to protect and continue to build 
their businesses.

“Business owners are the backbone of our economy,” 
said Mark Berven, president and chief operating officer 
of property and casualty for Nationwide. “Whether 
it’s planning for leadership succession or enduring an 
unexpected event like a cyberattack, the viability of 
businesses across the country is a requirement for a healthy 
economy that we can’t ignore.”

Making it easier to 
protect the things 
you care about.

Apartment shoppers can now shop for and purchase renters insurance with 
Nationwide from the palm of their hand. 

Earlier this year, Nationwide joined forces with Sure — the 
developer of the nation’s first on-demand insurance mobile 
app — to enable consumers in select states to purchase 
renters insurance from their mobile device. 

By making renters insurance more readily available, 
Nationwide is filling a big need — a recent survey 
conducted by the company indicates that more than half 
of the 1,000 millennials surveyed do not have it. 

Using the Sure app, consumers can now get a quote, 
purchase a policy and pay their Nationwide renters 
insurance premiums via a mobile app. 

This new offering expands the relationship Nationwide had 
with Sure when the company launched a travel insurance 
product in 2016 to protect members against the costs of 
travel-related accidents.

Nationwide is the first national carrier to offer renters 
insurance via a mobile app. 

However, more than two-thirds of those surveyed indicated 
they stood to lose more than $5,000 worth of belongings 
should an unfortunate event occur, while three-fourths did 
not know the relatively low cost of renters insurance.

“The new offering on Sure’s platform is designed to enable 
renters with insurance options through a fast, automated 
and secure mobile experience,” said Wayne Slavin, CEO 
of Sure. “This partnership with Nationwide will allow us to 
provide customers the stability and credibility to protect 
their most valuable possessions.”

Saving lives in 
rural America.

Nationwide was founded by farmers, so we’ve always paid 
special attention to the needs of the agriculture community.

It’s part of what has made us the No. 1 farm insurer in the 
U.S. and a leading commercial agribusiness insurer. 

That attention includes helping farmers and those who 
work in agribusiness stay safe. Each year, with the help 
of other sponsors, Nationwide provides grain bin rescue 
tubes and training to fire departments serving large rural 
farming communities. Since 2014, we’ve reached 48 fire 
departments in 18 states through our annual Grain Bin 
Safety Week — Nominate Your Fire Department contest.

“The program that’s out there for these tubes and training 
is such a life-saving resource in our county,” Glenville 
(Minn.) Fire Chief Matt Webb said. 

Webb’s fire department saved a local farmer in August, 
two years after the department was awarded the rescue 
equipment and training through Nationwide. It was the 
second life saved by participating departments to date.

“It only takes seconds to become entrapped in grain and 
less than a minute to become completely engulfed,” said

“

Brad Liggett, president of agribusiness for Nationwide. 
“Until we can convince all farmers and other grain handlers 
to develop a zero-entry mentality, we will strive to make 
tubes and rescue training as widely available as possible.”

In another effort to increase safety, Nationwide also 
introduced Hazard SpotterSM — a first-of-its-kind training 
app for both iPhone and Android devices. It’s a realistic, 
first-person view of an employee who must complete 
maintenance tasks in a grain storage facility.

“I grew up with Atari and Nintendo,” said Ryan Janssen, a 
40-year-old Gen Xer who helped test the app and works 
as the environmental health and safety director at Key 
Cooperative in Iowa. “That’s what got me excited about 
this initially. It teaches our employees the skills we want 
them to have in a format they are familiar with — and it 
has the potential to bridge the gap between older and 
younger generations.”

Until we can convince all farmers 
and other grain handlers to 
develop a zero-entry mentality, 
we will strive to make tubes 
and rescue training as widely 
available as possible.

Innovating to 
solve retirement 
challenges.

Nationwide is a leader in helping Americans save for 
retirement, and we continued that tradition in 2017 while 
also introducing tools to help make retirement easier once 
savers reach that milestone.

Saving for retirement can be difficult, especially for 
middle-income consumers. Retirement products are 
often complex, and many workers struggle to balance the 
financial demands of today with saving for tomorrow while 
also worrying about market volatility.

So we launched Guaranteed Retirement Income from 
Nationwide — a direct-to-consumer pilot program to 
provide guaranteed retirement income every month for life 
in exchange for small, consistent contributions over time.

It’s an example of how we’re taking a different approach to 
addressing retirement savings challenges.

“Nationwide is committed to providing innovative solutions 
that can help bridge the gap between what people need to 
live a financially secure retirement and what they’re actually 
saving,” said Kirt Walker, president and chief operating 
officer of financial services for Nationwide.

Our Care Concierge program is another progressive 
approach to addressing challenges retirees may have. 
Introduced in 2017, Care Concierge is a no-cost service for 
owners of select variable annuities.

The Nationwide Care Concierge service helps members 
navigate through trouble spots such as finding a nursing 
home for ailing parents, resolving health care issues and 
accessing counseling services. It is a confidential service 
that provides 24-hour access to help with many of the 
questions and issues that come up in retirement.

“We’re always looking for ways to help people be more 
prepared for retirement,” Walker said. “And enjoy the 
retirement they deserve.”

In times of crisis, 
Nationwide is there.

The Tubbs Wildfire that struck northern California took 
Ralph Casale’s house fast. 

 “When we left, I really thought we’d be coming back at 
some point,” Casale said. “We literally only had the clothes 
on our back and maybe one or two other things in a duffel 
bag, and that was it.”

But Nationwide was there to help Casale’s family and 
thousands of others across the country deal with an 
unprecedented level of destruction from hurricanes, 
wildfires and other natural disasters in 2017. 

Deploying claims associates, activating mobile catastrophe 
response units and providing basic necessities for members 
in their devastated communities were all components of 
delivering on our On Your Side® Promise.

Advancements in technology such as drones, aerial 
imagery and remote video consultation helped Nationwide 
assist members with their claims.

“Nationwide has been a parachute for us, really,” Casale 
said. “We felt like they were able to stop that freefall or at 
least slow it down and help us get started again.”

Nationwide is built for stability — even when dealing 
with a once-in-a-lifetime series of events.

“Being there for our members at times like this is why we 
exist,” CEO Steve Rasmussen said. “We have the strength to 
be able to focus on helping our members solve their crises 
and not have to worry about facing one ourselves.”

Nationwide will be part of the Casales’ recovery 
from the wildfire.

“When it’s time to rebuild — and we want to rebuild — 
having Nationwide backing us up is going to be a huge 
thing going forward, and we really appreciate that,” 
Casale said.

There’s strength in our numbers.

Enterprise financials

Nationwide’s breadth of financial services, commercial and personal lines 
solutions enabled us to continue to drive strong results during a year 
marked by significant weather activity and several macroeconomic and 
industry disruptions.

Nationwide drove profitable growth and maintains an exceptionally strong 
capital position, despite record property and casualty industry catastrophe 
losses in 2017. Many product lines performed well, helping to offset those 
few areas that were pressured during the year. 

A few highlights include:

Total sales of $46.5 billion and $27.5 billion in operating revenue, 
with solid sales results across all major product lines

Financial services’ sales growth of 17 percent was driven by 
strong competitive products and a focus on new and emerging 
distribution channels

Steady improvement in standard auto profitability, driven by efforts to 
address industrywide loss trends in this product line

The impact of tax reform on our 2017 results was not significant due to the 
diversity of our product offerings. While catastrophe activity put pressure 
on our profitability in certain lines, our financial foundation is strong 
because we reserve capital for these types of losses. As a result, we are able 
to continue our focus on protecting what’s most important for our members 
and building for the future.

NATIONWIDE 
2017 ANNUAL REPORT

Statutory  
financial highlights

Nationwide prepares financial statements using generally accepted accounting 
principles (GAAP), which are a common set of accounting principles, standards 
and procedures that companies across different industries use to compile their 
financial statements. 

As an insurance company, Nationwide also prepares financial statements 
following statutory accounting principles, which are a set of accounting rules 
for insurance companies set forth by the National Association of Insurance 
Commissioners (NAIC).

Statutory accounting principles are generally regarded as more conservative 
than GAAP. Statutory financial information is the basis for state regulation of 
insurance companies’ solvency throughout the U.S. Additionally, rating agencies 
use statutory financial information in their evaluation of an insurance company’s 
financial strength.

Combined statutory surplus is a financial measure of Nationwide’s ability to 
meet future obligations, which is calculated based on accounting practices

domicile. Each of the states where Nationwide’s insurance companies are 
domiciled has adopted the NAIC statutory accounting principles as the basis of 
its statutory accounting practices.

Combined statutory assets
Combined statutory assets is a financial measure that is calculated by 
combining the net admitted statutory assets of Nationwide’s property and 
casualty and financial services subsidiaries.
