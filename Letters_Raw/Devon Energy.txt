Devon Strategy

Devon is committed to delivering consistent top-quartile shareholder return among its peer group through a 

highly engaged culture focused on innovation, safety, operational excellence, environmental stewardship and social 
responsibility. We also maintain a strong commitment to financial strength and flexibility through all commodity

tier capital-efficient, cash-flow growth. Our 2020 Vision is focused on the following strategic priorities:

•
•

•
•
•

Maximize cash flow by optimizing base production and reducing per-unit cash costs;
Improve capital efficiency with a concentration of investment on highest-returning development 
projects in the Delaware Basin and STACK;
Simplify our portfolio by monetizing non-core assets; 
Improve financial strength by reducing debt; and
Return cash to shareholders.

Our portfolio of exploration and production assets and operations provides stable, environmentally responsible 

production and a platform for future growth. In 2017, we continued the development of our world-class operations 
in the STACK and Delaware Basin. These assets provide us with a sustainable, multi-decade growth platform that 
continues to improve with our successful drilling programs. During 2017, we delivered the best well productivity in 
Devon’s 46-year history and continued a five-year streak of increasing Devon’s initial 90-day production rates. With 
investments in proprietary data tools, predictive analytics and artificial intelligence, we are delivering industry-
leading, initial-rate well productivity and improving the performance of our established wells. Devon has more than 
doubled its onshore North American oil production since 2012 and has a deep inventory of development 
opportunities to deliver future oil growth. 

6

As we enter 2018 and look toward the future, we expect to achieve additional efficiencies across our portfolio. 
We expect to fund activity within our cash flow, and remain committed to allocating capital in a disciplined manner 
to maximize value and return. We believe we capture the full value of our assets and improve returns through 
maximizing our base production and optimizing our capital program. The activities that support this strategy include 
minimizing controllable downtime, enhancing well productivity, ensuring disciplined project execution, performing 
premier technical work, focusing on developmental drilling and reducing our operating and capital costs.

We also continue to implement new shareholder-friendly initiatives, which include new returns-based metrics 

aligned to employee compensation and the conversion to successful efforts accounting which provides greater 
transparency into our financial performance.

EnLink Strategy

EnLink focuses on providing gathering, transmission, processing, storage, fractionation and marketing to 

upstream oil and natural gas producers, including Devon.  

EnLink connects the wells of natural gas producers in its market areas to its gathering systems, processes 

natural gas for the removal of NGLs, fractionates NGLs into purity products and markets those products for a fee, 
transports natural gas and ultimately provides natural gas to a variety of markets. Furthermore, EnLink purchases 
natural gas from natural gas producers and other supply sources and sells that natural gas to utilities, industrial 
consumers, other marketers and pipelines.

EnLink’s primary business objective is to provide stable cash flow, while growing through prudent and 

profitable investments. EnLink accomplishes its objectives through long-term, fee-based contracts and maintaining a 
strong financial position through a conservative and balanced capital structure highlighted by its investment grade 
status. EnLink has consistently demonstrated expertise within the MLP space and continues to employ a proven 
business model that includes growing, expanding and executing on its strategy within top basins where Devon and 
other successful upstream producers operate.

Led by results from our franchise assets, STACK and Delaware Basin, Devon achieved the best drilling 
results in our 46-year history. Our initial 90-day production rates in 2017 increased more than 400% from 2012 
levels. These productivity improvements were driven by activity focused in top resource plays, improved subsurface 
reservoir characterization, leading-edge completion designs and improvements in lateral placement. The most 
significant reserves growth came from our U.S. operations, where we replaced approximately 150% of our 2017 
production with proved reserves additions from the drill bit. 

Delaware Basin – The Delaware Basin is one of Devon’s top-two franchise assets and continues to offer 

exploration and low-risk development opportunities from many geologic reservoirs and play types, including the oil-
rich Bone Spring, Delaware, Wolfcamp and Leonard formations. We expect these oil and liquids-rich opportunities 
across our acreage in the Delaware Basin to deliver high-margin growth for many years to come. During 2017, our 
continued appraisal and development work enabled us to increase our proved reserves by approximately 60%. At 

8

December 31, 2017, we had eight operated rigs developing this asset. In 2018, we plan to invest approximately $725 
million of capital in the Delaware Basin as we shift to expanded development operations, primarily focused on the 
Bone Spring formation.

STACK – The STACK development, located primarily in Oklahoma’s Canadian, Kingfisher and Blaine 
counties, is one of Devon’s top-two franchise assets. Devon is currently targeting the Woodford Shale and the 
Meramec zones. Our STACK position is one of the largest and best in the industry, providing visible long-term 
growth. Completion design enhancements have resulted in greater productivity and improved economics. Drilling 
activity in the Meramec has produced record setting initial production across our core position in the oil and liquids 
window. At December 31, 2017, we had nine operated rigs with drilling focused in the Meramec formation. In 2018, 
we plan approximately $700 million of capital investment and expect to accelerate full-field development activity.

Heavy Oil – Our operations in Canada are focused on our heavy oil assets in Alberta, Canada. Our most 

significant Canadian operation is our Jackfish complex, an industry-leading thermal heavy oil operation in the non-
conventional oil sands of east central Alberta. We employ a recovery method known as steam-assisted gravity 
drainage at Jackfish. The Jackfish operation consists of three facilities. We expect Jackfish to maintain a reasonably 
flat production profile for greater than 20 years requiring approximately $200 million of annual maintenance capital 
based on current economic conditions. 

Our Pike oil sands acreage is situated directly to the southeast of our Jackfish acreage in east central Alberta 
and has similar reservoir characteristics to Jackfish. The Pike leasehold is currently undeveloped and has no proved 
reserves or production as of December 31, 2017. With our 50% partner, we continue to evaluate our development 
timeline for Pike. The majority of our Pike leasehold does not expire until 2025 and 2026. 

In addition to Jackfish and Pike, we hold acreage and own producing assets in the Bonnyville region, located 
to the south and east of Jackfish in eastern Alberta. Bonnyville is a low-risk, high margin oil development play that 
produces heavy oil by conventional means, without the need for steam injection.

In 2018, we plan approximately $275 million of capital investment in our Canadian Heavy Oil business.

Eagle Ford – We acquired our position in the Eagle Ford in 2014, with acres located in DeWitt and Lavaca 
counties in south Texas. In 2017, we closed on the sale of our Lavaca assets for approximately $200 million. Since 
acquiring these assets, we have delivered tremendous results by producing 119 million oil-equivalent barrels. Our 
excellent results are driven by our development in DeWitt County, located in the economic core of the play. With 
the highest margins in our portfolio, our Eagle Ford assets generated significant cash flow in 2017. In 2018, we plan 
approximately $250 million of capital investment. 

Rockies Oil – Our acreage in the Rockies is focused on emerging oil opportunities in the Powder River Basin 
and the Wind River Basin. Recent drilling success in these formations has expanded our drilling inventory, and we 
expect further growth as we continue to de-risk this emerging light-oil opportunity. As of December 31, 2017, we 
had one operated rig targeting the Turner formation in northern Converse County of the Powder River Basin. In 
2018, we plan approximately $150 million of capital investment.

Barnett Shale – This is our largest property in terms of production and proved reserves. Our leases are located 

primarily in Denton, Johnson, Parker, Tarrant and Wise counties in north Texas. The Johnson County assets are 
currently being marketed as part of our non-core divestiture program. Since acquiring a substantial position in this 
field in 2002, we continue to introduce technology and new innovations to optimize production operations and have 
transformed this asset into one of the top producing gas fields in North America. Given the sustained low gas price 
environment, we continue to focus on enhancing existing well performance through re-fracturing, artificial lift and 
line pressure reduction projects. In 2018, we plan on minimal development activity, with planned capital investment 
of up to $50 million to optimize base production and further de-risk future development resources.

Proved Reserves

For estimates of our proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves and the discussion of the contribution 

by each property, see Note 24 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.

Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil, gas and NGLs which, by analysis of geoscience and 

engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs 
under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. To be considered proved, oil 
and gas reserves must be economically producible before contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless 
evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. Also, the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have 
commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.

The process of estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves is complex and requires significant judgment, as 

discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this report. As a result, we have developed internal policies for estimating 
and recording reserves. Such policies require proved reserves to be in compliance with the SEC definitions and 
guidance. Our policies assign responsibilities for compliance in reserves bookings to our Reserve Evaluation Group, 
(the “Group”). These same policies also require that reserve estimates be made by professionally qualified reserves 
estimators, as defined by the Society of Petroleum Engineers’ standards.

The Group, which is led by Devon’s Director of Reserves and Economics, is responsible for the internal 

review and certification of reserves estimates. We ensure the Director and key members of the Group have 
appropriate technical qualifications to oversee the preparation of reserves estimates. The Group reports to and is 
managed through our finance department. No portion of the Group’s compensation is directly dependent on the 
quantity of reserves booked.

The Director of the Group has approximately 30 years of industry experience with positions of increasing 

responsibility for the estimation and evaluation of reserves. He has been employed by Devon for the past 17 years, 
including the past 10 in his current position. His further professional qualifications include a degree in petroleum 
engineering, registered professional engineer, member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and experience in 
reserves estimation for projects in the U.S. (both onshore and offshore), as well as in Canada, Asia, the Middle East 
and South America.  

Throughout the year, the Group performs internal reserves reviews of each operating country’s reserves. The 

Group also oversees audits and reserves estimates performed by qualified third-party petroleum consulting firms. 
During 2017, we engaged two such firms to audit approximately 88% of our proved reserves in accordance with 
generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation methods and procedures. LaRoche Petroleum Consultants, 
Ltd. audited approximately 85% of our 2017 U.S. reserves, and Deloitte LLP audited approximately 99% of our 
Canadian reserves.

In addition to conducting these internal reviews and external reserves audits, we also have a Reserves 
Committee that consists of three independent members of our Board of Directors. This committee provides 
additional oversight of our reserves estimation and certification process. The members of our Reserves Committee 
have educational backgrounds in geology or petroleum engineering, as well as experience relevant to the reserves 
estimation process. The Reserves Committee meets a minimum of twice a year to discuss reserves issues and 
policies and meets at least once a year separately with our senior reserves engineering personnel and separately with 
our third-party petroleum consultants.

Includes 821 and 367 gross oil and gas wells, respectively, which had multiple completions.

The day-to-day operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under 

pooling or operating agreements. The operator supervises production, maintains production records, employs field 
personnel and performs other functions. We are the operator of approximately 14,600 gross wells. As operator, we 
receive reimbursement for direct expenses incurred to perform our duties, as well as monthly per-well producing, 
drilling, and construction overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the respective areas. In presenting 
our financial data, we record the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of G&A, which is a common 
industry practice.

Acreage Statistics

The following table sets forth our developed and undeveloped lease and mineral acreage as of December 31, 
2017. Of our 4.3 million net acres, approximately 2.3 million acres are held by production. The acreage in the table 
includes 0.1 million, 0.2 million and 0.1 million net acres subject to leases that are scheduled to expire during 2018, 
2019 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, there were no proved undeveloped reserves associated with 
our expiring acreage. Of the 0.4 million net acres set to expire by December 31, 2020, we anticipate performing 
operational and administrative actions to continue the lease terms for portions of the acreage that we intend to 
further assess. However, we do expect to allow a portion of the acreage to expire in the normal course of business. 
In 2017, we allowed approximately 0.2 million acres to expire.

Title to Properties

Title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry, liens for taxes 
not yet due and, in some instances, other encumbrances. We believe that such burdens do not materially detract from 
the value of properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation 
of the business.

 As is customary in the industry, a preliminary title investigation, typically consisting of a review of local title 

records, is made at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties. More thorough title investigations, which 
generally include a review of title records and the preparation of title opinions by outside counsel, are made prior to 
the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on 
undeveloped properties.

Marketing Activities

Oil, Gas and NGL Marketing

The spot markets for oil, gas and NGLs are subject to volatility as supply and demand factors fluctuate. As 

detailed below, we sell our production under both long-term (one year or more) and short-term (less than one year) 
agreements at prices negotiated with third parties. Regardless of the term of the contract, the vast majority of our 
production is sold at variable, or market-sensitive, prices.

Additionally, we may enter into financial hedging arrangements or fixed-price contracts associated with a 
portion of our oil, gas and NGL production. These activities are intended to support targeted price levels and to 
manage our exposure to price fluctuations. See Note 4 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of 
this report for further information.

As of January 2018, our production was sold under the following contract terms.

We expect to fulfill our delivery commitments primarily with production from our proved developed reserves. 

Moreover, our proved reserves have generally been sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments during the three 
most recent years, and we expect such reserves will continue to be the primary means of fulfilling our future 
commitments. However, where our proved reserves are not sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments, we can 
and may use spot market purchases to satisfy the commitments.

Customers

During 2017, 2016 and 2015, no purchaser accounted for over 10% of our consolidated sales revenue.

Public Policy and Government Regulation

Our industry is subject to a wide range of regulations. Laws, rules, regulations, taxes, fees and other policy 

implementation actions affecting our industry have been pervasive and are under constant review for amendment or 
expansion. Numerous government agencies have issued extensive regulations which are binding on our industry and 
its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. These laws and regulations 
increase the cost of doing business and consequently affect profitability. Because public policy changes are 
commonplace, and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended, we are unable to predict the future cost or 
impact of compliance. However, we do not expect that any of these laws and regulations will affect our operations 
materially differently than they would affect other companies with similar operations, size and financial strength. 
The following are significant areas of government control and regulation affecting our operations.

Exploration and Production Regulation

Our operations are subject to federal, tribal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations. These laws and 

regulations relate to matters that include:
acquisition of seismic data;
location, drilling and casing of wells;
well design;
hydraulic fracturing;
well production;
spill prevention plans;
emissions and discharge permitting;
use, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil and gas operations;
surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled;
calculation and disbursement of royalty payments and production taxes;
plugging and abandoning of wells;
transportation of production; and
endangered species and habitat.

Our operations also are subject to conservation regulations, including the regulation of the size of drilling and 

spacing units or proration units; the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit; the rate of production allowable 
from oil and gas wells; and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties. In the U.S., some states allow the 
forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration, while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands 
and leases, which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties. In addition, federal and state 
conservation laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and state conservation laws impose certain 
requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production. These regulations limit the amounts of oil and gas we can 
produce from our wells and the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill.

Certain of our U.S. natural gas and oil leases are granted or approved by the federal government and 
administered by the BLM or Bureau of Indian Affairs of the Department of the Interior. Such leases require 
compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders that regulate, among other matters, drilling and operations 
on lands covered by these leases and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government, 
tribes or tribal members. The federal government has been particularly active in recent years in evaluating and, in 
some cases, promulgating new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding, venting and flaring, oil 
and gas measurement and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands. In addition, permitting 
activities on federal lands are subject to frequent delays.

Royalties and Incentives in Canada

The royalty calculation in Canada is a significant factor in the profitability of Canadian oil and gas production. 
Oil sands crown royalties are determined by government regulations and are generally calculated as a percentage of 
the value of the gross production, net of allowed deductions. The royalty percentage is determined on a sliding-scale 
based on crown posted prices. For pre-payout oil sands projects, the regulations prescribe lower royalty rates for oil 
sands projects until allowable capital costs have been recovered. In early 2016, the Alberta government adopted the 
recommendation of its Royalty Review Panel. The new royalty framework preserves the existing royalty structure 
and rates for oil sands. For conventional oil and gas royalty calculations, wells drilled after January 1, 2017 would 
use the Modernized Royalty Framework (MRF) which prescribes a lower royalty rate until allowable costs have 
been recovered. The calculation for wells post payout is based on a percentage of production net of allowed 
deductions and varies with commodity price. 

Marketing in Canada

Any oil or gas export requires an exporter to obtain export authorizations from Canada’s National Energy 

Board. 

Environmental, Pipeline Safety and Occupational Regulations

We are subject to many federal, state, provincial, tribal and local laws and regulations concerning 

occupational safety and health as well as the discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment and 
natural resources. Environmental laws and regulations relate to:

•
•
•
•
•

the discharge of pollutants into federal, provincial and state waters;
assessing the environmental impact of seismic acquisition, drilling or construction activities;
the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of waste materials, including hazardous substances;
the emission of certain gases into the atmosphere;
the monitoring, abandonment, reclamation and remediation of well and other sites, including sites of 
former operations;

16

•
•
•
•

the development of emergency response and spill contingency plans;
the monitoring, repair and design of pipelines used for the transportation of oil and natural gas;
the protection of threatened and endangered species; and 
worker protection.

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can lead to the imposition of remedial liabilities, 

administrative, civil or criminal fines or penalties or injunctions limiting our operations in affected areas. Moreover, 
multiple environmental laws provide for citizen suits, which allow environmental organizations to act in the place of 
the government and sue operators for alleged violations of environmental law. We consider the costs of 
environmental protection and safety and health compliance necessary, manageable parts of our business. We have 
been able to plan for and comply with environmental, safety and health initiatives without materially altering our 
operating strategy or incurring significant unreimbursed expenditures. However, based on regulatory trends and 
increasingly stringent laws, our capital expenditures and operating expenses related to the protection of the 
environment and safety and health compliance have increased over the years and may continue to increase. We 
cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future exposure concerning such matters.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Our business and operations, and our industry in general, are subject to a variety of risks. The risks described 
below may not be the only risks we face, as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not 
yet know of, or that we currently believe are immaterial. If any of the following risks should occur, our business, 
financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely impacted. As a result, 
holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in Devon.

Volatile Oil, Gas and NGL Prices Significantly Impact our Business

Our financial condition, results of operations and the value of our properties are highly dependent on the 
general supply and demand for oil, gas and NGLs, which impact the prices we ultimately realize on our sales of 
these commodities. Historically, market prices and our realized prices have been volatile. For example, in recent 
years, NYMEX WTI oil and NYMEX Henry Hub prices ranged from a high of over $100 per Bbl and $6 per 
MMBtu, respectively, to a low of under $27 per Bbl and $1.70 per MMBtu, respectively. Such volatility is likely to 
continue in the future due to numerous factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to:

•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•
•

supply of and demand for oil, gas and NGLs, including consumer demand in emerging markets, such as 
China and India;
volatility and trading patterns in the commodity-futures markets;
conservation and environmental protection efforts;
production levels of members of OPEC, Russia or other producing countries;
geopolitical risks, including political and civil unrest in the Middle East, Africa and South America;
adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes;
regional pricing differentials;
differing quality of production, including NGL content of gas produced;
the level of imports and exports of oil, gas and NGLs and the level of global oil, gas and NGL 
inventories;
the price and availability of alternative fuels;
technological advances affecting energy consumption and production;

17

•
•

the overall economic environment; and
governmental regulations and taxes.

Commodity prices began to decline in the second half of 2014 and, despite a moderate recovery, have 

generally been pressured since then. This commodity price decline adversely affected our business and results of 
operations and led to substantial impairments to our oil and gas properties during 2015. A sustained weakness or 
further deterioration in commodity prices could materially and adversely impact our business by resulting in, or 
exacerbating, the following effects:

•
•
•
•

•

reducing the amount of oil, gas and NGLs that we can produce economically;
limiting our financial flexibility, liquidity and access to sources of capital, such as equity and debt;
reducing our revenues, operating cash flows and profitability;
causing us to decrease our capital expenditures or maintain reduced capital spending for an extended 
period, resulting in lower future production of oil, gas and NGLs; and
reducing the carrying value of our properties, resulting in additional noncash write-downs.

Estimates of Oil, Gas and NGL Reserves Are Uncertain and May Be Subject to Revision

The process of estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves is complex and requires significant judgment in the 

evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir, particularly for new 
discoveries. Because of the high degree of judgment involved, different reserve engineers may develop different 
estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data. In addition, the reserve estimates for a 
given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of several factors, including additional development 
and appraisal activity, the viability of production under varying economic conditions, including commodity price 
declines, and variations in production levels and associated costs. Consequently, material revisions to existing 
reserve estimates may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors. Such revisions to proved reserves could 
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the value of our properties, as well as the estimates of 
our future net revenue and profitability. Our policies and internal controls related to estimating and recording 
reserves are included in “Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties” of this report.

Discoveries or Acquisitions of Reserves Are Needed to Avoid a Material Decline in Reserves and Production

The production rates from oil and gas properties generally decline as reserves are depleted, while related per 

unit production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors. Therefore, our 
estimated proved reserves and future oil, gas and NGL production will decline materially as reserves are produced 
unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities, such as identifying additional producing zones 
in existing wells, utilizing secondary or tertiary recovery techniques or acquiring additional properties containing 
proved reserves. Consequently, our future oil, gas and NGL production and related per unit production costs are 
highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves.

18

Oil and Gas Operations Are Uncertain and Involve Substantial Costs and Risks

Our operating activities are subject to numerous costs and risks, including the risk that we will not encounter 
commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. Drilling for oil, gas and NGLs can be unprofitable, not only from dry 
holes, but from productive wells that do not return a profit because of insufficient revenue from production or high 
costs. Substantial costs are required to locate, acquire and develop oil and gas properties, and we are often uncertain 
as to the amount and timing of those costs. Our cost of drilling, completing, equipping and operating wells is often 
uncertain before drilling commences. Declines in commodity prices and overruns in budgeted expenditures are 
common risks that can make a particular project uneconomic or less economic than forecasted. While both 
exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of 
dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. In addition, our oil and gas properties can 
become damaged, our operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled and the costs of such operations may 
increase as a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:

•
•
•

•

•
•

•
•

•

unexpected drilling conditions, pressure conditions or irregularities in reservoir formations;
equipment failures or accidents;
fires, explosions, blowouts, cratering or loss of well control, as well as the mishandling or underground 
migration of fluids and chemicals;
adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes and 
extreme temperatures;
issues with title or in receiving governmental permits or approvals;
restricted takeaway capacity for our production, including due to inadequate midstream infrastructure or 
constrained downstream markets;
environmental hazards or liabilities;
restrictions in access to, or disposal of, water used or produced in drilling and completion operations; 
and
shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment.

The occurrence of one or more of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a 

particular property, as well as significant liabilities. Moreover, certain of these events could result in environmental 
pollution and impact to third parties, including persons living in proximity to our operations, our employees and 
employees of our contractors, leading to possible injuries, death or significant damage to property and natural 
resources.

We Are Subject to Extensive Governmental Regulation, Which Can Change and Could Adversely Impact 
Our Business

Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial, tribal, local and other laws, rules and 

regulations, including with respect to environmental matters, worker health and safety, wildlife conservation, the 
gathering and transportation of oil, gas and NGLs, conservation policies, reporting obligations, royalty payments, 
unclaimed property and the imposition of taxes. Such regulations include requirements for permits to drill and to 
conduct other operations and for provision of financial assurances (such as bonds) covering drilling, completion and 
well operations. If permits are not issued, or if unfavorable restrictions or conditions are imposed on our drilling or 
completion activities, we may not be able to conduct our operations as planned. In addition, we may be required to 
make large expenditures to comply with applicable governmental laws, rules, regulations, permits or orders. For 
example, certain regulations require the plugging and abandonment of wells and removal of production facilities by 
current and former operators, which may result in significant costs associated with the removal of tangible 
equipment and other restorative actions at the end of operations.

19

In addition, changes in public policy have affected, and in the future could further affect, our operations. 
Regulatory developments could, among other things, restrict production levels, impose price controls, change 
environmental protection requirements and increase taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or 
governmental agencies. Our operating and other compliance costs could increase further if existing laws and 
regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. 
Although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations, such changes could significantly impact 
our profitability, financial condition and liquidity, particularly changes related to hydraulic fracturing, pipeline 
safety, seismic activity, income taxes and climate change, as discussed below.

Hydraulic Fracturing – In recent years, the EPA has made proposals that subject hydraulic fracturing to 

further regulation and that could potentially restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing. For example, the EPA has 
issued final regulations under the federal Clean Air Act establishing performance standards for oil and gas activities, 
including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing and finalized in 2016 
regulations that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned 
wastewater treatment plants. The EPA also released a study in 2016 finding that certain aspects of hydraulic 
fracturing, such as water withdrawals and wastewater management practices, could result in impacts to water 
resources, although the report did not identify a direct link between hydraulic fracturing and impacts to groundwater 
resources. The BLM previously finalized regulations to regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal lands, but 
subsequently issued a repeal of those regulations in 2017. Several states in which we operate have already adopted 
and more states are considering adopting laws and/or regulations that require disclosure of chemicals used in 
hydraulic fracturing and impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well-construction requirements on 
hydraulic fracturing operations. In addition, some states and municipalities have significantly limited drilling 
activities and/or hydraulic fracturing or are considering doing so. Although it is not possible at this time to predict 
the final outcome of these proposals, any new federal, state or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be 
imposed in areas in which we conduct business could potentially result in increased compliance costs, delays in 
development or restrictions on our operations.

Pipeline Safety – The pipeline assets in which we own interests, through EnLink or otherwise, are subject to 

stringent and complex regulations related to pipeline safety and integrity management. The PHMSA has established 
a series of rules that require pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs for gas, 
NGL and condensate transmission pipelines as well as certain low stress pipelines and gathering lines transporting 
hazardous liquids, such as oil, that, in the event of a failure, could affect “high consequence areas.” Additional 
action by PHMSA with respect to pipeline integrity management requirements may occur in the future. For 
example, in 2016 PHMSA proposed new rules for gas pipelines that extend pipeline safety programs beyond high 
consequence areas to newly proposed “moderate consequence areas” and would also impose more rigorous testing 
and reporting requirements on such pipelines. To date, no further action has been taken. More recently, in January 
2017, PHMSA finalized regulations for hazardous liquid pipelines that significantly extend and expand the reach of 
certain PHMSA integrity management requirements (i.e., periodic assessments, leak detection and repairs), 
regardless of the pipeline’s proximity to a high consequence area. The final rule also imposes new reporting 
requirements for certain unregulated pipelines, including all hazardous liquid gathering lines. Following the change 
in presidential administrations, implementation of this rule was delayed, but the final rule is expected to be 
published in the Federal Register and become effective during the first quarter of 2018. At this time, we cannot 
predict the cost of such requirements, but they could be significant. Moreover, violations of pipeline safety 
regulations can result in the imposition of significant penalties.

Seismic Activity – Earthquakes in northern and central Oklahoma and elsewhere have prompted concerns 
about seismic activity and possible relationships with the energy industry. Legislative and regulatory initiatives 
intended to address these concerns may result in additional levels of regulation or other requirements that could lead 
to operational delays, increase our operating and compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations. In 
addition, we are currently defending against certain third-party lawsuits and could be subject to additional claims, 
seeking alleged property damages or other remedies as a result of alleged induced seismic activity in our areas of 
operation.

Changes to Tax Laws – We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income or capital taxes in various 
state and foreign jurisdictions, and our operating cash flow is sensitive to the amount of income taxes we must pay. 
In the jurisdictions in which we operate, income taxes are assessed on our earnings after consideration of all 

20

allowable deductions and credits. Changes in the types of earnings that are subject to income tax, the types of costs 
that are considered allowable deductions or the rates assessed on our taxable earnings would all impact our income 
taxes and resulting operating cash flow. Recently enacted legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs 
Act (the “Tax Reform Legislation”) significantly affects U.S. tax law by changing how the U.S. imposes income tax 
on multinational corporations. These changes include, among others, a permanent reduction to the corporate income 
tax offset by other items intended to broaden the tax base (for example, by imposing significant additional 
limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and limiting the ability to deduct net operating losses).

The U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may 

significantly impact how we will apply the law and impact our results of operations in the period issued. Further, 
compliance with the Tax Reform Legislation and the accounting for such provisions require complex computations 
and accumulation of information not previously required or regularly produced. As a result, we have provided a 
provisional estimate in our financial statements of the effect of the Tax Reform Legislation. As additional regulatory 
guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authorities, as accounting treatment is clarified, as we perform additional 
analysis on the application of the law, and as we refine estimates in calculating the effect, our final analysis, which 
will be recorded in the period completed, may be different from our current provisional amounts, which could 
materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate.

Climate Change – Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in 

legislative, regulatory and other initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide and methane. 
Policy makers at both the U.S. federal and state levels have introduced legislation and proposed new regulations 
designed to quantify and limit the emission of greenhouse gases through inventories, limitations and/or taxes on 
greenhouse gas emissions. For example, both the EPA and the BLM have issued regulations for the control of 
methane emissions, which also include leak detection and repair requirements, for the oil and gas industry; however, 
following the change in presidential administrations, both agencies have published proposed rules that seek to delay 
implementation of their previously issued methane standards while the agencies review and reconsider both rules. 
Nevertheless, several states where we operate, including Wyoming, have imposed venting and flaring limitations 
designed to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas exploration and production activities. Legislative and state 
initiatives to date have generally focused on the development of cap-and-trade and/or carbon tax programs. A cap-
and-trade program generally would cap overall greenhouse gas emissions on an economy-wide basis and require 
major sources of greenhouse gas emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances. 
Carbon taxes could likewise affect us by being based on emissions from our equipment and/or emissions resulting 
from the use of our products by our customers. 

In Canada, greenhouse gas emissions are also being addressed at both the federal and provincial level. Recent 

climate policies include a legislated oil sands emission limit, and forthcoming policies include methane emissions 
reduction targets. Beginning January 1, 2018, large industrial emitters are subject to the Carbon Competitiveness 
Incentive Regulation (CCIR). This regulation prices carbon, but provides cost protection to emission-intensive / 
trade-exposed industries, including Devon’s oil sands operations. The impact to our operations from these 
regulations is expected to be minimal in the near term. Oil and gas facilities that are not subject to the CCIR are 
exempt from the economy-wide carbon levy until 2023.

In addition, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at 
sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and 
other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Ultimately, this 
could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities. These various legislative, 
regulatory and other activities addressing greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect our business, including 
by imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, our equipment and 
operations, which could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our 
operations. Limitations on greenhouse gas emissions could also adversely affect demand for oil and gas, which 
could lower the value of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and 
liquidity.

21

Our Hedging Activities Limit Participation in Commodity Price Increases and Involve Other Risks 

We enter into hedging activities with respect to a portion of our production to manage our exposure to oil, gas 
and NGL price volatility. To the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from 
commodity price declines, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of commodity price increases 
above the prices established by our hedging contracts. In addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the 
risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the contract counterparties fail to 
perform under the contracts. Moreover, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection 
Act and other legislation, hedging transactions and many of our contract counterparties have become subject to 
increased governmental oversight and regulations in recent years. Although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of 
these laws and the related rulemaking, some of which is ongoing, existing or future regulations may adversely affect 
the cost and availability of our hedging arrangements, including by causing our contract counterparties, which are 
generally financial institutions and other market participants, to curtail or cease their derivatives activities.

The Credit Risk of Our Counterparties Could Adversely Affect Us

We enter into a variety of transactions that expose us to counterparty credit risk. For example, we have 
exposure to financial institutions and insurance companies through our hedging arrangements, our syndicated 
revolving credit facility and our insurance policies. Disruptions in the financial markets or otherwise may impact 
these counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations and their willingness to enter into 
future transactions with us.

In addition, we are exposed to the risk of financial loss from trade, joint interest billing and other receivables. 

We sell our oil, gas and NGLs to a variety of purchasers, and, as an operator, we pay expenses and bill our non-
operating partners for their respective share of costs. We also frequently look to buyers of oil and gas properties 
from us to perform certain obligations associated with the disposed assets, including the removal of production 
facilities and plugging and abandonment of wells. Certain of these counterparties may experience insolvency, 
liquidity problems or other issues and may not be able to meet their obligations and liabilities (including contingent 
liabilities) owed to, and assumed from, us, particularly during a depressed or volatile commodity price environment. 
Any such default by these counterparties may result in us being forced to cover the costs of those obligations and 
liabilities, which could adversely impact our financial results and condition.

Our Debt May Limit Our Liquidity and Financial Flexibility, and Any Downgrade of Our Credit Rating 
Could Adversely Impact Us

As of December 31, 2017, we had total consolidated indebtedness of $10.4 billion. Our indebtedness and other 

financial commitments have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to:

•

•

•

requiring us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flows from operations to debt service 
payments, thereby limiting our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, investments or 
acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;
increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including low 
commodity price environments; and
limiting our ability to obtain additional financing due to higher costs and more restrictive covenants.

In addition, we receive credit ratings from rating agencies in the U.S. with respect to our debt. Factors that 

may impact our credit ratings include, among others, debt levels, planned asset sales and purchases, liquidity, 
forecasted production growth and commodity prices. We are currently required to provide letters of credit or other 
assurances under certain of our contractual arrangements. Any credit downgrades could adversely impact our ability 
to access financing and trade credit, require us to provide additional letters of credit or other assurances under 
contractual arrangements and increase our interest rate under any credit facility borrowing as well as the cost of any 
other future debt. 

22

Environmental Matters and Related Costs Can Be Significant

As an owner, lessee or operator of oil and gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, provincial, 

tribal and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. 
These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of remediating pollution that 
results from our operations. Environmental laws may impose strict, joint and several liability, and failure to comply 
with environmental laws and regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal fines and 
penalties, as well as injunctions limiting operations in affected areas. Any future environmental costs of fulfilling 
our commitments to the environment are uncertain and will be governed by several factors, including future changes 
to regulatory requirements. Changes in or additions to public policy regarding the protection of the environment 
could have a significant impact on our operations and profitability.

Cyber Attacks May Adversely Impact Our Operations

Our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies, and we anticipate expanding our use 

of technology in our operations, including through process automation and data analytics. Concurrent with this 
growing dependence on technology is greater sensitivity to cyberattack activities, which have been increasing 
against our industry. Cyber attackers often attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of 
misappropriating sensitive information, intellectual property or other assets, corrupting data or causing operational 
disruptions. These attacks may be perpetrated by third parties or insiders. Techniques used in these attacks range 
from highly sophisticated efforts to electronically circumvent network security to more traditional intelligence 
gathering and social engineering aimed at obtaining information necessary to gain access. Cyber attacks may also be 
carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as by causing denial-of-service 
attacks. In addition, our vendors, midstream providers and other business partners may separately suffer disruptions 
or breaches from cyber attacks, which, in turn, could adversely impact our operations and compromise our 
information. Although we have not suffered material losses related to cyber attacks to date, if we were successfully 
attacked, we could incur substantial remediation and other costs or suffer other negative consequences, including 
litigation risks. Moreover, as the sophistication of cyber attacks continues to evolve, we may be required to expend 
significant additional resources to further enhance our digital security or to remediate vulnerabilities.

Limited Control on Properties Operated by Others

Certain of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve third-party 

working interest owners. We have limited influence and control over the operation or future development of such 
properties, including compliance with environmental, health and safety regulations or the amount and timing of 
required future capital expenditures. These limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working 
interest owners for these properties could result in unexpected future costs and delays, curtailments or cancellations 
of operations or future development, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Midstream Capacity Constraints and Interruptions Impact Commodity Sales

We rely on midstream facilities and systems to process our gas production and to transport our oil, gas and 

NGL production to downstream markets. Such midstream systems include EnLink’s systems, as well as other 
systems operated by us or third parties. Regardless of who operates the midstream systems we rely upon, a portion 
of our production in any region may be interrupted or shut in from time to time due to losing access to plants, 
pipelines or gathering systems. Such access could be lost due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, 
weather conditions and natural disasters, accidents, field labor issues or strikes. Additionally, we and third parties 
may be subject to constraints that limit our or their ability to construct, maintain or repair midstream facilities 
needed to process and transport our production. Such interruptions or constraints could negatively impact our 
production and associated profitability.

23

Insurance Does Not Cover All Risks

As discussed above, our business is hazardous and is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated 

with the exploration, development, production, processing and transportation of oil, gas and NGLs. 

To mitigate financial losses resulting from these operational hazards, we maintain comprehensive general 

liability insurance, as well as insurance coverage against certain losses resulting from physical damages, loss of well 
control, business interruption and pollution events that are considered sudden and accidental. We also maintain 
workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insurance. However, our insurance coverage does not provide 100% 
reimbursement of potential losses resulting from these operational hazards. Additionally, insurance coverage is 
generally not available to us for pollution events that are considered gradual, and we have limited or no insurance 
coverage for certain risks such as political risk and war. Our insurance does not cover penalties or fines assessed by 
governmental authorities. The occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a 
material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and liquidity.

Competition for Assets, Materials, People and Capital Can Be Significant

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry. We compete with major integrated and 

independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties. We also compete for the 
equipment and personnel required to explore, develop and operate properties. Typically, during times of rising 
commodity prices, drilling and operating costs will also increase. During these periods, there is often a shortage of 
drilling rigs and other oilfield services, which could adversely affect our ability to execute our development plans on 
a timely basis and within budget. Competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil, gas and NGLs. Certain of our 
competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours. They also may have established 
strategic long-term positions and relationships in areas in which we may seek new entry. As a consequence, we may 
be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for assets or services and accessing capital. In addition, many of our 
larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas 
production, such as changing worldwide price and production levels, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and 
the application of government regulations.

Our Acquisition and Divestiture Activities Involve Substantial Risks

Our business depends, in part, on making acquisitions that complement or expand our current business and 

successfully integrating any acquired assets or businesses. If we are unable to make attractive acquisitions, our 
future growth could be limited. Furthermore, even if we do make acquisitions, they may not result in an increase in 
our cash flow from operations or otherwise result in the benefits anticipated due to various risks, including, but not 
limited to:

•

•

•

mistaken estimates or assumptions about reserves, potential drilling locations, revenues and costs, 
including synergies and the overall costs of equity or debt;
difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired assets or 
business; and
unknown and unforeseen liabilities or other issues related to any acquisition for which contractual 
protections prove inadequate, including environmental liabilities and title defects.

In addition, from time to time, we may sell or otherwise dispose of certain of our properties as a result of an 

evaluation of our asset portfolio and to help enhance our liquidity. These transactions also have inherent risks, 
including possible delays in closing, the risk of lower-than-expected sales proceeds for the disposed assets and 
potential post-closing claims for indemnification. Moreover, volatility in commodity prices may result in fewer 
potential bidders, unsuccessful sales efforts and a higher risk that buyers may seek to terminate a transaction prior to 
closing.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Introduction

The following discussion and analysis presents management’s perspective of our business, financial condition 

and overall performance. This information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past 
performance, current financial condition and outlook for the future and should be read in conjunction with “Item 8. 
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.

Overview of 2017 Results

During 2017, we generated solid operating results with our strategy of operating in North America’s best 
resource plays, delivering superior execution, continuing disciplined capital allocation and maintaining a high 
degree of financial strength. Led by our development in the STACK and Delaware Basin, we continued to improve 
our 90-day initial production rates. With investments in proprietary data tools, predictive analytics and artificial 
intelligence, we are delivering industry-leading, initial-rate well productivity performance and improving the 
performance of our established wells. 

Compared to 2016, commodity prices increased significantly and were the primary driver for improvements in 

Devon’s earnings and cash flow during 2017. We exited 2017 with liquidity comprised of $2.7 billion of cash and 
$2.9 billion of available credit under our Senior Credit Facility. We have no significant debt maturities until 2021.

We further enhanced our financial strength by completing approximately $415 million of our announced $1 

billion asset divestiture program in 2017. We anticipate closing the remaining divestitures in 2018.

In 2018 and beyond, we have the financial capacity to further accelerate investment across our best-in-class 

U.S. resource plays. We are increasing drilling activity and will continue to shift our production mix to high-margin 
products. We will continue our premier technical work to drive capital allocation and efficiency and industry-
leading well productivity results. We will continue to maximize the value of our base production by sustaining the 
operational efficiencies we have achieved. Finally, we will continue to manage activity levels within our cash flows. 
We expect this disciplined approach will position us to deliver capital-efficient, cash-flow expansion over the next 
two years. 

Key measures of our financial performance in 2017 are summarized in the following table. Increased 

commodity prices as well as continued focus on our production expenses improved our 2017 financial performance 
as compared to 2016, as seen in the table below. More details for these metrics are found within the “Results of 
Operations – 2017 vs. 2016”, below.

Business and Industry Outlook 

Devon marked its 46th anniversary in the oil and gas business and its 29th year as a public company during 

2017. As an established company with a strong leadership team, we have experience operating in periods of 
challenged commodity prices. With our focused strategy and portfolio of quality assets, we are focused on 
navigating the current environment while ensuring our long-term financial strength.

Market prices for crude oil and natural gas are inherently volatile. Therefore, we cannot predict with certainty 
the future prices for the commodities we produce and sell. During 2017, WTI oil prices ranged from approximately 
$42.00/Bbl to $60.00/Bbl, supported by increasing global demand and historically high OPEC compliance with its 
oil production cuts that were put in place in 2016 for the first half of 2017. Following the decision by both OPEC 
and non-OPEC producers to extend the agreement to reduce output by nearly 1.8 million barrels per day through the 
end of 2018, oil prices increased approximately 15% in the fourth quarter of 2017, averaging $55.49/Bbl. Current 
market fundamentals indicate improved prices for crude oil in 2018; however, changes in OPEC production 
strategies, the macro-economic environment, geopolitical risks or other factors could impact current forecasts. As 
such, we anticipate continued volatility into 2018 and we continue to execute on our hedging strategy to mitigate 
such volatility. 

Leveraging the success of our 2017 results, we have a solid financial condition and anticipate expanding our 

oil and gas investment by approximately 10% in 2018, while drilling and completing approximately 25% more 
wells. Our 2018 outlook is focused on our high returning assets in the STACK and Delaware Basin and achieving 
top-line oil-equivalent production growth of 6%-9%, on a retained asset basis, through some of our best-in-class 
positions. Additionally, we continued to execute our hedging program in 2017 and now have approximately 40% of 
our oil and 50% of our gas production hedged for 2018. With our anticipated results and hedging program, we 
intend to fully fund our increased activity with our operating cash flow. Additionally, we are targeting reducing our 
debt by approximately $1 billion.

Finally, EnLink continues to be a strategic advantage for us. With annual distributions to us of approximately 

$270 million, EnLink provides a visible cash flow stream to be further invested in our upstream capital programs.

Production declines reduced our upstream 

Retained assets

revenues by $427 million primarily as a result of our 
U.S. non-core divestitures that occurred throughout 
2016 and 2017. Retained production volumes decreased 
due to reduced completion activity in the Eagle Ford 
and natural production declines in the Barnett Shale. 
These decreases were partially offset by expanded 
drilling and performance in the STACK.

Upstream revenues increased $1.4 billion as a 
result of higher unhedged, realized prices across our 
entire portfolio. The increase in oil and bitumen sales 
primarily resulted from higher average WTI crude 
index prices, which were 18% higher in 2017. 
Additionally, our oil and bitumen sales benefited from 
tighter differentials to the WTI index. The increase in 
gas sales were driven by higher North American 
regional index prices upon which our gas sales are 
based and higher NGL prices at the Mont Belvieu, 
Texas hub. 

As further discussed in Note 1 in “Item 8. 

 

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this 
report, in 2018 the presentation of certain processing 
arrangements will change from a net to a gross 
presentation. We estimate the change to increase our 
upstream revenues and production expenses by 
approximately $250 million annually with no impact to 
net earnings.

LOE decreased $100 million primarily due to our 
non-core U.S. property divestitures in 2016. Continued 
well optimization and cost reduction initiatives across 
our portfolio have offset industry inflation. These 
initiatives have been primarily focused on reducing 
costs associated with water disposal, power and fuel, 
compression and workovers.

Percent of oil, gas and NGL sales:

Production taxes

 

Gathering and transportation expense increased 
$92 million primarily due to a full year of the Access 
Pipeline transportation tolls, which commenced in the 
fourth quarter of 2016 subsequent to the sale of our 
interest in the pipeline. Our Access transportation 
agreement contains a base transportation commitment, 
which for the initial five years averages $110 million 
annually. 

Production taxes increased on an absolute dollar 
basis primarily due to the increase in our U.S. upstream 
revenues, on which the majority of our production taxes 
are assessed. 

Property taxes decreased as a result of lower 

property value assessments from the local taxing 
authorities across our key operating areas and as a 
result of our U.S. non-core divestitures.

Devon margin

operating margin was primarily due to an increase in 
EnLink’s throughput volumes related to gas processing 
and transmission activities. Devon’s margins continue 
to be negatively impacted by downstream marketing 
commitments. We are actively engaged in optimization 
activities to reduce the costs of downstream 
commitments; however, we expect such commitments 
will continue to negatively impact our margin in 2018. 
As further discussed in Note 1 in “Item 8. Financials 
Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report, in 
2018 EnLink’s marketing and midstream revenues are 
estimated to decrease by 6-10% with a corresponding 
decrease to marketing and midstream expenses as a 
result of complying with the new revenue recognition 
accounting standard.

of the workforce reduction that occurred in February 
2016 as discussed in Note 7 in “Item 8. Financial

Non-labor costs were higher due to an increase in costs 
related to automation and process improvements. 
Reimbursed G&A decreased primarily due the 
divestitures of operated properties in 2016. EnLink 
G&A increased primarily due to higher compensation 
costs.

Financing costs, net decreased $409 million 
primarily as a result of our $2.1 billion early debt

to EnLink’s business. Additional information regarding 
the impairments is discussed in Note 6 in “Item 8. 
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this 
report.

We recognized gains in conjunction with our 

non-core U.S. upstream asset dispositions in both 2016 
and 2017 and the divestiture of our 50% interest in the 
Access Pipeline in 2016. For further discussion, see 
Note 3 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and 
Supplementary Data” of this report.

During 2016, we recognized restructuring and 

transaction costs of $267 million primarily as a result of 
our workforce reduction. For discussion of our 
reorganization programs and the associated 
restructuring costs, see Note 7 in “Item 8. Financial

Production declines reduced our upstream 
revenues by $620 million. Production volumes 
decreased due to our reduction in exploration and 
development activity related to our retained assets 
during 2016. While expanded drilling in the STACK 
and the performance of our Jackfish assets drove 
production increases, these production increases were 
more than offset by reduced completion activity in the 
Eagle Ford and natural production declines in the 
Barnett Shale and Rockies Oil. Additionally, our 
production decreased as a result of our U.S. non-core 
divestitures that occurred throughout 2016.

Unproved impairments primarily relate to a 

portion of acreage in our non-core U.S. operations upon 
which we do not intend to pursue further exploration 
and development. Geological and geophysical costs 
were lower due to a reduced exploration capital

Upstream revenues decreased $580 million as a 

result of lower unhedged, realized prices for oil, 
bitumen and gas. The decrease in oil and bitumen sales 
primarily resulted from lower average WTI crude index 
prices, which were 11% lower in 2016 as compared to 
2015. The decrease in gas sales was driven by lower 
North American regional index prices upon which our 
gas sales are based. These decreases were partially 
offset by slightly higher NGL prices at the Mont 
Belvieu, Texas hub.

LOE and LOE per BOE decreased as a result of 
our cost reduction initiatives, well optimization and our 
non-core oil and gas property divestitures. On an 
absolute dollar basis, LOE decreased approximately 
$200 million as a result of our U.S. upstream 
divestitures. 

Gathering and transportation decreased primarily 
as a result of U.S. upstream asset divestitures partially 
offset by $28 million of Access Pipeline transportation 
tolls which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2016 
subsequent to the sale of our interest in the pipeline.

Production taxes decreased on an absolute dollar 
basis primarily due to the decrease in our U.S. upstream 
revenues, on which the majority of our production taxes

Asset impairments largely related to our oil and 

gas assets and resulted from a significant decline in 
forecasted commodity prices during 2015 and 2016. 
Asset impairments for 2016 and 2015 also related to 
goodwill and other intangible asset impairments related 
to EnLink’s business. Additional information regarding 
the impairments is discussed in Note 6 in “Item 8. 
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this 
report. 

We recognized gains in conjunction with our 

non-core U.S. upstream asset dispositions in 2016 and 
the divestiture of our 50% interest in the Access 
Pipeline in 2016. For further discussion, see Note 3 in 
“Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” 
of this report.  

During 2016, we recognized restructuring and 

transactions costs of $267 million primarily as a result 
of our workforce reduction. For discussion of our

Devon Sources and Uses of Cash

Operating Cash Flow

Net cash provided by operating activities continued to be a significant source of capital and liquidity in 2017. 

Our operating cash flow increased $1.4 billion, or 165%, as compared to 2016 due to significantly higher 
commodity prices. In 2017, our operating cash flow fully funded our capital expenditure program as well as our 
dividends.

Our operating cash flow decreased $3.4 billion, or 80% from 2015 to 2016. While commodity prices 

decreased from 2015 to 2016, the primary driver of the decrease was due to the expiration of certain favorable hedge 
positions that provided us with an additional $2.4 billion of additional operating cash flow in 2015. In 2016 and 
2015, our operating cash flow did not fully fund our capital requirements and dividends; as a result, we utilized 
available cash balances and divestiture proceeds to supplement our operating cash flows. 

Issuance of Common Stock

In February 2016, we issued 79 million shares of our common stock to the public, inclusive of 10 million 
shares sold as part of the underwriters’ option. Net proceeds from the offering were approximately $1.5 billion.

Divestitures of Property and Investments

During 2017, as part of our announced divestiture program, we sold non-core U.S. assets for $415 million. For 

further discussion, see Note 3 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.

39

During 2016, we divested certain non-core upstream assets in the U.S. and our 50% interest in the Access 

Pipeline in Canada for approximately $3.0 billion, net of purchase price adjustments. Proceeds from these 
divestitures were used primarily for debt repayment and to support capital investment in Devon’s core resource 
plays. For further discussion, see Note 3 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.

We did not have significant current cash income taxes resulting from the divestitures in 2017 and 2016.

Prior year amounts have been recast due to change in accounting principle. See Note 2 in “Item 8. Financial 
Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.

Capital expenditures consist primarily of amounts related to our oil and gas exploration and development 

operations and other corporate activities. The vast majority of our capital expenditures are for the acquisition, 
drilling and development of oil and gas properties. Our capital program is designed to operate within operating cash 
flow and may fluctuate with changes to commodity prices and other factors impacting cash flow. This is evidenced 
by our operating cash flow fully funding capital expenditures in 2017. In response to the lower commodity prices, 
our total capital expenditures have been reduced by approximately 50% since 2015.

Acquisition costs in 2016 primarily consisted of Devon’s bolt-on acquisition of assets in the STACK play for 

$1.5 billion. Approximately $849 million was paid in cash at closing with the remainder of the purchase price 
funded with equity consideration. In 2015 our acquisition activity primarily consisted of the Powder River Basin 
asset acquisition in the fourth quarter. For further discussion on acquisition activity, see Note 3 in “Item 8. Financial 
Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.

Debt Activity, Net

During 2016, our debt decreased $3.1 billion. The decrease was primarily due to completed tender offers to 
purchase and redeem $2.1 billion of debt securities prior to their maturity and a $1 billion reduction in short-term 
borrowings. In conjunction with the tender offers, we recognized a $269 million loss on the early retirement of debt, 
including $265 million of cash retirement costs and fees. 

During 2015, our net debt increased $770 million. In June 2015, we issued $750 million of 5.0% senior notes. 

We used these proceeds to repay the aggregate principal amount of our floating rate senior notes upon maturity on 
December 15, 2015, as well as outstanding commercial paper balances. In December 2015, we issued $850 million 
of 5.85% senior notes to fund acquisitions announced in the fourth quarter.

Shareholder Distributions

Devon paid common stock dividends of $127 million, $221 million and $396 million during 2017, 2016 and 
2015, respectively. In response to the depressed commodity price environment, we reduced our quarterly dividend 
from $0.24 to $0.06 per share in the second quarter of 2016.

40

EnLink and General Partner Distributions

Devon received $265 million, $265 million and $268 million in distributions from EnLink and the General 

Partner during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Subsidiary Unit Transactions

In 2015, we conducted an underwritten secondary public offering of 26.2 million common units representing 

limited partner interests in EnLink, raising proceeds of $654 million, net of underwriting discount. See Note 20 in 
“Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report. 

EnLink Sources and Uses of Cash

EnLink’s operating cash flow has increased each year since 2015 as a result of the growth experienced from 

its acquisition activity and continued development activities.

Capital expenditures for EnLink’s midstream operations are primarily for the construction and expansion of 

oil and gas gathering facilities and pipelines. During 2016, EnLink acquired Anadarko Basin gathering and 
processing midstream assets for $1.5 billion. Approximately $792 million was paid in cash at closing with the 
remainder of the purchase price funded with equity consideration and debt. For additional information on this 
acquisition, see Note 3 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report. EnLink’s 
acquisitions in 2015 consisted of additional oil and gas pipeline assets, including gathering, transportation and 
processing facilities. 

During 2017, EnLink divested its ownership interest in Howard Energy Partners for approximately $190 
million. Proceeds were primarily used to pay a portion of the first $250 million installment payment related to 
EnLink’s 2016 acquisition noted above.

During 2017, EnLink’s debt increased $247 million. In May 2017, EnLink issued $500 million of 5.45% 

senior notes due in 2047 to repay outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility and for general 
partnership purposes. In June 2017, EnLink redeemed its 7.125% senior unsecured notes due in 2022 for aggregate 
cash consideration of $174 million. Additionally, EnLink reduced its credit facility borrowings to $74 million during 
2017. As noted above, EnLink made the first installment payment in 2017 related to its 2016 acquisition.

EnLink and the General Partner distributed $354 million, $304 million and $254 million to non-Devon 

unitholders during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

During 2017, 2016 and 2015, EnLink issued and sold approximately 6.2 million, 10.0 million and 1.3 million 
common units through general public offerings and its “at the market” equity program, generating net proceeds of 
approximately $107 million, $167 million and $25 million, respectively. 

In 2017, EnLink issued preferred units in an underwritten public offering generating net proceeds of 

approximately $394 million.

In 2016, to fund a portion of the cash consideration of its acquisition of Anadarko Basin gathering and 
processing midstream assets, EnLink issued 50 million preferred units in a private placement generating cash 
proceeds of approximately $725 million. General Partner common units were also issued as consideration in the 
transaction.   

In 2017 and 2016, EnLink received contributions from noncontrolling interests. For further discussion see 

Note 3 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report. 

Devon Liquidity

Historically, our primary sources of capital and liquidity have been our operating cash flow, asset divestiture 

proceeds and cash on hand. Additionally, we maintain a commercial paper program, supported by our revolving line 

41

of credit, which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow and cash balances. Available sources 
of capital and liquidity also include, among other things, debt and equity securities that can be issued pursuant to our 
shelf registration statement filed with the SEC, as well as the sale of a portion of our common units representing 
interests in our investment in EnLink and the General Partner. The most significant source of liquidity in 2017 has 
come from our operating cash flow supplemented with approximately $415 million of proceeds related to our asset 
divestitures. We estimate the combination of these sources of capital will continue to be adequate to fund our 
planned capital expenditures, future debt repayments, dividends and other contractual commitments as discussed in 
this section.

Operating Cash Flow

Our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables, the most volatile of which are the prices of the oil, 

bitumen, gas and NGLs we produce and sell. Our consolidated operating cash flow increased 165% in 2017 largely 
due to increases in commodity prices. We expect operating cash flow to continue to be a key source of liquidity as 
we adjust our capital program to invest within our operating cash flow. Furthermore, proceeds from our non-core 
asset divestitures will provide additional liquidity as needed.

Commodity Prices – Prices are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. Regional and 

worldwide economic activity, weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these 
products. These factors, which are difficult to predict, create volatility in prices and are beyond our control. To 
mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices, we utilize various derivative financial instruments to protect a portion of 
our production against downside price risk. We target hedging approximately 50% of our production in a manner 
that systematically places hedges for several quarters in advance, allowing us to maintain a disciplined risk 
management program as it relates to commodity price volatility. We supplement the systematic hedging program 
with discretionary hedges that take advantage of favorable market conditions. As a result, entering into 2018 we 
have hedged approximately 40% of our anticipated oil and 50% of our anticipated gas production. The key terms to 
our oil, gas and NGL derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2017 are presented in Note 4 in “Item 8. 
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.

Commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses. 

Significant commodity price decreases can lead to a decrease in drilling and development activities. As a result, the 
demand and cost for people, services, equipment and materials may also decrease, causing a positive impact on our 
cash flow as the prices paid for services and equipment decline. However, the inverse is also generally true during 
periods of rising commodity prices.

Divestitures of Property and Equipment – In 2017, we announced a program to divest approximately $1 

billion of upstream assets. These non-core assets identified for monetization include select portions of the Barnett 
Shale focused primarily in and around Johnson County and other properties located principally within Devon’s U.S. 
resource base. Through December 31, 2017, Devon completed divestiture transactions totaling approximately $415 
million. The most significant asset remaining in this program is select Barnett Shale properties which we expect to 
close in 2018. 

Interest Rates – Our operating cash flow can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. As of December 

31, 2017, we had total debt of $6.9 billion that bears fixed interest rates averaging 5.7%.

As of December 31, 2017, we had open interest rate swap positions that are presented in Note 4 in “Item 8. 

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this report.

Credit Losses – Our operating cash flow is also exposed to credit risk in a variety of ways. This includes the 
credit risk related to customers who purchase our oil, gas and NGL production, the collection of receivables from 
our joint-interest partners for their proportionate share of expenditures made on projects we operate and 
counterparties to our derivative financial contracts. We utilize a variety of mechanisms to limit our exposure to the 
credit risks of our customers, partners and counterparties. Such mechanisms include, under certain conditions, 
requiring letters of credit, prepayments or collateral postings.

42

At the end of 2017, we held approximately $2.6 billion of cash. Included in this total was $732 million of cash 

held by our foreign subsidiaries. 

Credit Availability 

We have a $3.0 billion Senior Credit Facility. The maturity date for $164 million of the Senior Credit Facility 

is October 24, 2018. The maturity date for the remaining $2.8 billion is October 24, 2019. This credit facility 
supports our $3.0 billion of short-term credit under our commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2017, there 
were no borrowings under our commercial paper program. See Note 16 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and 
Supplementary Data” of this report for further discussion.

The Senior Credit Facility contains only one material financial covenant. This covenant requires us to 

maintain a ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization, as defined in the credit agreement, of no more than 65%. 
The credit agreement defines total funded debt as funds received through the issuance of debt securities such as 
debentures, bonds, notes payable, credit facility borrowings and short-term commercial paper borrowings. In 
addition, total funded debt includes all obligations with respect to payments received in consideration for oil, gas 
and NGL production yet to be acquired or produced at the time of payment. Funded debt excludes our outstanding 
letters of credit and trade payables. The credit agreement defines total capitalization as the sum of funded debt and 
stockholders’ equity adjusted for noncash financial write-downs, such as oil and gas property impairments and 
goodwill impairments. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with this covenant. Our debt-to-
capitalization ratio at December 31, 2017, as calculated pursuant to the terms of the agreement, was 27.2%.

Our access to funds from the Senior Credit Facility is not restricted under any “material adverse effect” 

clauses. It is not uncommon for credit agreements to include such clauses. These clauses can remove the obligation 
of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and 
adverse effect on the borrower’s financial condition, operations, properties or business considered as a whole, the 
borrower’s ability to make timely debt payments or the enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement. 
While our credit facility includes covenants that require us to report a condition or event having a material adverse 
effect, the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facility is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse 
effect.

As market conditions warrant and subject to our contractual restrictions, liquidity position and other factors, 

we may from time to time seek to repurchase or retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges 
for other debt or equity securities in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or 
otherwise. Any such cash repurchases by us may be funded by cash on hand or incurring new debt. The amounts 
involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Furthermore, any such 
repurchases or exchanges may result in our acquiring and retiring a substantial amount of such indebtedness, which 
would impact the trading liquidity of such indebtedness. We are currently targeting up to $1.5 billion of debt 
reduction in 2018.

Debt Ratings 

We receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the U.S. In determining our debt ratings, the 

agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including, but not limited to, commodity pricing 
levels, our liquidity, asset quality, reserve mix, debt levels, cost structure, planned asset sales and near-term and 
long-term production growth opportunities. Our credit rating from Standard and Poor’s Financial Services is BBB 
with a stable outlook. In March 2017, Fitch Ratings affirmed our BBB+ rating and revised our outlook to stable 
from negative. In April 2017, Moody’s Investor Service upgraded our credit rating from Ba2 to Ba1 with a stable 
outlook. Any rating downgrades may result in additional letters of credit or cash collateral being posted under 
certain contractual arrangements.

There are no “rating triggers” in any of our or EnLink’s contractual debt obligations that would accelerate 
scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level. However, a downgrade could adversely 
impact our and EnLink’s interest rate on any credit facility borrowings and the ability to economically access debt 
markets in the future.

Capital Expenditures

Our 2018 exploration and development budget is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion and 

funded within operating cash flow. Although negative movements in any of the variables discussed above would 
impact our operating cash flow, we likely would not change our 2018 planned capital investment. Should our 
operating cash flow decrease from our forecasts, we could divest non-core assets to balance capital sources and uses. 

EnLink Liquidity

EnLink has a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. The General Partner has a $250 million 

revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, there were $10 million in outstanding letters of credit and no 
outstanding borrowings under the $1.5 billion credit facility and $74 million outstanding borrowings under the $250 
million credit facility. All of EnLink’s and the General Partner’s debt is non-recourse to Devon. 

As of December 31, 2017, EnLink had total debt of $3.5 billion. Of this amount, $3.4 billion bears fixed 

interest rates averaging 4.6% and $74 million is comprised of floating rate debt with interest rates averaging 3.2%.

EnLink’s 2018 capital budget includes approximately $600 million to $800 million of identified growth 

projects. EnLink’s primary capital projects for 2018 include the construction of the Thunderbird processing plant in 
Central Oklahoma, the Lobo III processing plant in the Delaware Basin and the development of additional gathering 
and compression assets in Central Oklahoma and the Permian Basin.

EnLink expects to fund the growth capital expenditures with borrowings under its bank credit facility and 

proceeds from other debt and equity sources, including capital contributions by joint venture partners. EnLink 
expects to fund its 2018 maintenance capital expenditures from operating cash flows. EnLink employs a strategy 
that includes maintaining stable operating cash flows that are supported by long-term, fixed-fee contracts. 
Approximately 94% of EnLink’s cash flows were generated from fee-based services in 2017. It is possible that not 
all of the planned projects for 2018 will be commenced or completed. EnLink’s ability to pay distributions to its 
unitholders, fund planned capital expenditures and make acquisitions will depend upon its future operating 
performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the industry and financial, business and 
other factors, some of which are beyond its control.

(1) Debt amounts represent scheduled maturities of debt obligations at December 31, 2017, excluding net 

(2)

(3)

discounts and debt issue costs included in the carrying value of debt. 
Interest expense represents the scheduled cash payments on long-term fixed-rate debt (including current 
portion of long term debt). 
Purchase obligation amounts represent contractual commitments primarily to purchase condensate at market 
prices for use at our heavy oil projects in Canada. We have entered into these agreements because condensate 
is an integral part of the heavy oil transportation process. Any disruption in our ability to obtain condensate 
could negatively affect our ability to transport heavy oil at these locations. Our total obligation related to 
condensate purchases expires in 2021. The value of the obligation in the table above is based on the 
contractual volumes and our internal estimate of future condensate market prices.

(4) Operational agreements represent commitments to transport or process certain volumes of oil, gas and NGLs 
for a fixed fee. We have entered into these agreements to aid the movement of our production to downstream 
markets. 

(5) Operational agreements between Devon and EnLink represent fixed-fee gathering and processing and 

transportation agreements. These agreements also include minimum volume commitments that will remain in 
effect for approximately one more year, as well as annual rate escalators. 

(6) Asset retirement obligations represent estimated discounted costs for future dismantlement, abandonment and 

rehabilitation costs. These obligations are recorded as liabilities on our December 31, 2017 balance sheet.

(7) Drilling and facility obligations represent gross contractual agreements with third-party service providers to 

procure drilling rigs and other related services for developmental and exploratory drilling and facilities 
construction.
Lease obligations consist primarily of non-cancelable leases for office space and equipment.

(8)
(9) Other Devon obligations primarily relate to uncertain tax positions as discussed in Note 8 in “Item 8. Financial 

Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report. Other EnLink obligations primarily consist of a $250 
million installment payment on the Anadarko Basin assets acquisition as discussed in Note 3 in “Item 8. 
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.

Contingencies and Legal Matters

For a detailed discussion of contingencies and legal matters, see Note 21 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and 

Supplementary Data” of this report.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the 

U.S. requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from these estimates, 
and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. We consider the following to be our most critical 
accounting estimates that involve judgment and have reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the Audit 
Committee of our Board of Directors.

Oil and Gas Assets Accounting, Reserves, Classification & Valuation

Change in Accounting Principle

In the fourth quarter of 2017, we changed our method of accounting for our oil and gas exploration and 

development activities from the full cost method to the successful efforts method. In accordance with FASB ASC 
250 “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,” financial information for prior periods has been recast to reflect 
retrospective application of the successful efforts method, as prescribed by the FASB ASC 932 “Extractive 
Activities—Oil and Gas.” As required by ASC 250, we have presented the accumulated effect of the change in 
accounting principle from Devon’s inception to December 31, 2014 as a change in the beginning balance of our 
2015 consolidated statements of equity.

To recast our financial statements, we made certain critical estimates, judgments and assumptions to apply 

successful efforts accounting to our historical operations. These critical items are similar to those pertaining to our 
ongoing successful efforts accounting, which are described below. For additional information regarding the effects 
of the change to the successful efforts method, including our underlying successful efforts accounting policies, see 
Note 2 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.

To illustrate the effect of the change to successful efforts accounting, the following table summarizes the $1.9 

billion increase to our historical equity as of September 30, 2017, the date of our conversion. The increase was 
primarily driven by lower impairments, offset by higher DD&A and less capitalized expenses.

Reserves

Our estimates of proved and proved developed reserves are a major component of DD&A calculations. 
Additionally, our proved reserves represent the element of these calculations that require the most subjective 
judgments. Estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data, projected future rates of production and 
the timing of future expenditures. The process of estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves requires substantial 
judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations, particularly for new discoveries. Different reserve engineers may 
make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data. Our engineers prepare our reserve estimates. 
We then subject certain of our reserve estimates to audits performed by third-party petroleum consulting firms. In 
2017, 88% of our reserves were subjected to such audits.

The passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves, when revisions are 

made to prior estimates to reflect updated information. In the past five years, annual performance revisions to our 
reserve estimates, which have been both increases and decreases in individual years, have averaged less than 5% of 
the previous year’s estimate. However, there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be 
necessary in the future. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of 
numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and 
continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.

Successful Efforts Method of Accounting and Classification

We utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and natural gas exploration and development 

activities which requires management’s assessment of the proper designation of wells and associated costs as 
developmental or exploratory. This classification assessment is dependent on the determination and existence of 
proved reserves, which is a critical estimate discussed in the previous section. The classification of developmental 
and exploratory costs has a direct impact on the amount of costs we initially recognize as exploration expense or 
capitalize, then subject to DD&A calculations and impairment assessments and valuations.

Once a well is drilled, the determination that proved reserves have been discovered may take considerable 

time and requires both judgment and application of industry experience. Development wells are always capitalized. 
Costs associated with drilling an exploratory well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as 
to whether proved reserves have been found. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all 
suspended exploratory drilling costs to determine whether the costs should continue to remain capitalized or shall be 
expensed. When making this determination, management considers current activities, near-term plans for additional 
exploratory or appraisal drilling and the likelihood of reaching a development program. If management determines 
future development activities and the determination of proved reserves are unlikely to occur, the associated 
suspended exploratory well costs are recorded as dry hole expense and reported in exploration expense in the 
Consolidated Comprehensive Statement of Earnings. Otherwise, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized. 
At December 31, 2017, Devon had approximately $200 million of well costs suspended for more than one year, 
which largely pertain to its Pike Heavy Oil project. Stratigraphic testing has demonstrated reserves can be produced 
economically at Pike. However, this capital intensive, long-duration project remains unsanctioned by Devon and its 
50% partner, which is the primary reason reserves have not been designated as proven at Pike. With no lease 
expiration at Pike in the near future, management continues to keep the Pike exploratory costs capitalized.

Similar to the evaluation of suspended exploratory well costs, costs for undeveloped leasehold, for which 

reserves have not been proven, must also be evaluated for continued capitalization or impairment. At the end of each 
quarter, management assesses undeveloped leasehold costs for impairment by considering future drilling plans, 
drilling activity results, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such 
projects.  Based on this assessment, Devon impaired $139 million of undeveloped leasehold in the fourth quarter of 
2017. At December 31, 2017, Devon had $1.4 billion of undeveloped leasehold and capitalized interest which 
includes approximately $750 million related to Pike. Consistent with the evaluation above on suspended well costs, 
the costs for Pike continue to remain capitalized. Of the remaining undeveloped leasehold costs at December 31, 
2017, $85 million is scheduled to expire in 2018. The leasehold expiring in 2018 relates to areas in which Devon is 
actively drilling. If our drilling is not successful, this leasehold could become partially or entirely impaired. 

47

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets used in operations, including proved and unproved oil and gas properties, are depreciated 

and assessed for impairment annually or whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant 
deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. For DD&A calculations and 
impairment assessments, management groups individual assets based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level 
(“common operating field”) for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows 
of other groups of assets. The determination of common operating fields is largely based on geological structural 
features or stratigraphic condition, which requires judgment. Management also considers the nature of production, 
common infrastructure, common sales points, common processing plants, common regulation and management 
oversight to make common operating field determinations. These determinations impact the amount of DD&A 
recognized each period and could impact the determination and measurement of a potential asset impairment.

Management evaluates assets for impairment through an established process in which changes to significant 
assumptions such as prices, volumes, and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the 
undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down 
to estimated fair value. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of 
impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount 
rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants. The expected future cash flows used 
for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are typically based on judgmental assessments of future 
production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, and capital investment plans, considering all available 
information at the date of review. Besides the estimates of reserves and future production volumes, future 
commodity prices are the largest driver in the variability of undiscounted pre-tax cash flows. For our impairment 
determinations, we generally utilize the forward strip prices for the first five years and apply internally generated 
price forecasts for subsequent years. We estimate and escalate or de-escalate future capital and operating costs by 
using a method that correlates cost movements to price movements similar to recent history. Changes to any of these 
assumptions could result in lower undiscounted pre-tax cash flows and impact both the recognition and timing of 
impairments. Due to suppressed commodity prices in 2015 and 2016, we recognized significant asset impairments in 
each of those years. With more stabilized and higher pricing in 2017, we did not recognize material asset 
impairments.      

Goodwill and Other Intangibles

Goodwill

We test goodwill for impairment annually at October 31, or more frequently if events or changes in 
circumstances dictate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. While we use data as of 
October 31 for our test, we typically complete the test in late December or early January as the October 31 market 
data used in our test becomes available. 

We assess the qualitative and quantitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit is less 

than its carrying amount. Because quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units, the fair values of 
the reporting units are estimated based upon several valuation analyses, including comparable companies, 
comparable transactions and premiums paid. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an 
impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The determination of fair value requires judgment 
and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions about expected future cash flows derived from internal 
forecasts and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. Critical assumptions primarily include revenue 
growth rates driven by future commodity prices and volume expectations, operating margins and capital 
expenditures.

For the October 31, 2017 impairment tests for Devon’s U.S. reporting unit and each of EnLink’s reporting 

units, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.

Sustained weakness in the overall energy sector driven by low commodity prices, together with a decline in 

the EnLink unit price, caused a change in circumstances warranting an interim impairment test for EnLink’s 
reporting units in 2015 and an update to be performed at December 31, 2015. Using the fair value approaches 

48

described above, it was determined that the estimated fair value of EnLink’s Texas, Louisiana and Crude and 
Condensate reporting units were less than their carrying amounts and a goodwill impairment loss of $492 million, 
$787 million and $49 million, respectively, was recognized in 2015.

Additionally, another interim impairment test was warranted during 2016 for EnLink’s reporting units. Using 

the fair value approaches described above, it was determined that the estimated fair value of EnLink’s Texas, 
General Partner and Crude and Condensate reporting units were less than their carrying amounts and a goodwill 
impairment loss of $473 million, $307 million and $93 million, respectively, was recognized in 2016.

Our impairment determinations involved significant assumptions and judgments, as discussed above. 

Differing assumptions regarding any of these inputs could have a significant effect on the various valuations. If 
actual future results are not consistent with these assumptions and estimates, or the assumptions and estimates 
change due to new information, we may be exposed to additional goodwill impairment charges, which would be 
recognized in the period in which we would determine that the carrying value exceeds fair value. We would expect 
that a prolonged or sustained period of lower commodity prices would adversely affect the estimate of future 
operating results, which could result in future goodwill impairments for our reporting units due to the potential 
impact on the cash flows of our operations. 

The impairment of goodwill has no effect on liquidity or capital resources. However, it adversely affects our 

results of operations in the period recognized.

Other Intangible Assets

In 2015, the assessment of customer relationships was updated due to the factors described in the 

aforementioned goodwill section. This assessment resulted in a $223 million impairment of other intangible assets 
related to EnLink’s Crude and Condensate reporting unit. Level 3 fair value measurements were utilized for the 
impairment analysis of definite-lived intangible assets, which included discounted cash flow estimates, consistent 
with those utilized in the goodwill impairment assessment.

The other intangible assets impairment has no effect on liquidity or capital resources. However, it adversely 

affects our results of operations in the period recognized.

Income Taxes

The amount of income taxes recorded requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal, 

state, provincial and foreign tax jurisdictions. We recognize current tax expense based on estimated taxable income 
for the current period and the applicable statutory tax rates. We routinely assess potential uncertain tax positions 
and, if required, estimate and establish accruals for such amounts. We have recognized deferred tax assets and 
liabilities for temporary differences, operating losses and other tax carryforwards. We routinely assess our deferred 
tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that some portion or 
all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. At the end of 2017 and 2016, we had deferred tax assets that 
largely resulted from the asset impairments recognized throughout 2016. As a result of our recent cumulative losses 
and our current realization assessment, we recorded a 100% valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets 
as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Further, in 2017, we recognized a $660 million partial valuation 
allowance against certain Canadian deferred tax assets as a result of the Canadian legal entity restructuring.  

The accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are often based on assumptions that are subject to a 

significant amount of judgment by management. These assumptions and judgments are reviewed and adjusted as 
facts and circumstances change. Material changes to our income tax accruals may occur in the future based on the 
progress of ongoing audits, changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters.

We also assess factors relative to whether our foreign earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. These 
factors include forecasted and actual results for both our U.S. and Canadian operations, borrowing conditions in the 
U.S. and existing U.S. income tax laws, particularly the laws pertaining to the deductibility of intangible drilling 
costs and repatriations of foreign earnings. Changes in any of these factors could require recognition of additional 

49

deferred, or even current, U.S. income tax expense. We accrue deferred U.S. income tax expense on our foreign 
earnings when the factors indicate that these earnings are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested.  

For our foreign earnings deemed indefinitely reinvested, we do not calculate a hypothetical deferred tax 

liability on these earnings. Calculating a hypothetical tax on these accumulated earnings is much different from the 
calculation of the deferred tax liability on our earnings deemed not indefinitely reinvested. A hypothetical tax 
calculation on the indefinitely reinvested earnings would require the following additional activities:

•
•

•

•

separate analysis of a diverse chain of foreign entities;
relying on tax rates on a future remittance that could vary significantly depending on alternative 
approaches available to repatriate the earnings; 
determining the nature of a yet-to-be-determined future remittance, such as whether the distribution 
would be a non-taxable return of capital or a distribution of taxable earnings and calculation of associated 
withholding taxes, which would vary significantly depending on the circumstances at the deemed time of 
remittance; and
further analysis of a variety of other inputs such as the earnings, profits, U.S./foreign country tax treaty 
provisions and the related foreign taxes paid by our foreign subsidiaries, whose earnings are deemed 
permanently reinvested, over a lengthy history of operations.

Because of the administrative burden required to perform these additional activities, it is impractical to 

calculate a hypothetical tax on the foreign earnings associated with this separate and more complicated chain of 
companies.

Under the Tax Reform Legislation, the corporate income tax rate was reduced to 21% effective January 1, 

2018.  We are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as determining 
the transition tax, remeasuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities and reassessing the net realizability of our 
deferred tax assets and liabilities.

In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting 

Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a 
measurement period not to extend beyond one year after the enactment date. As the Tax Reform Legislation was 
passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017 and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation are expected over the 
next 12 months, we consider the accounting of the transition tax, deferred tax remeasurements, and other items to be 
incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. We 
expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118.

Absent unexpected events and unexpected effects of the Tax Reform Legislation, Devon expects a positive 

impact on its future after-tax earnings, primarily due to the lower federal statutory tax rate.

Non-GAAP Measures

We make reference to “core earnings (loss) attributable to Devon” and “core earnings (loss) per share 
attributable to Devon” in “Overview of 2017 Results” in this Item 7. that are not required by or presented in 
accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP measures. 
Core earnings attributable to Devon, as well as the per share amount, represent net earnings excluding certain 
noncash or non-recurring items that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their published estimates of our 
financial results. Our non-GAAP measures are typically used as a quarterly performance measure. Items may appear 
to be recurring when comparing on an annual basis. In the table below, restructuring and transaction costs were 
incurred in two of the three year periods; however, these costs relate to different restructuring programs. Amounts 
excluded for 2017 relate to asset dispositions, noncash asset impairments including noncash unproved asset 
impairments (included in exploration expenses), U.S. tax reform changes, deferred tax asset valuation allowance, 
derivatives and financial instrument fair value changes, legal entity restructuring and costs associated with early 
retirement of debt. 

Amounts excluded for 2016 relate to asset dispositions, noncash asset impairments (including an impairment 
of goodwill) including noncash unproved asset impairments and dry hole costs relating to exploration expenses, rig 

50

stacking costs, deferred tax asset valuation allowance, restructuring and transaction costs associated with the 2016 
workforce reduction, derivatives and financial instrument fair value changes and costs associated with early 
retirement of debt.

Amounts excluded for 2015 relate to asset dispositions, noncash asset impairments (including an impairment 
of goodwill) including noncash unproved asset impairments and dry hole costs relating to exploration expenses, rig 
stacking costs, deferred tax asset valuation allowance, restructuring and transaction costs, derivatives and financial 
instrument fair value changes and repatriation of funds to the U.S. 

We believe these non-GAAP measures facilitate comparisons of our performance to earnings estimates 

published by securities analysts, which typically make similar adjustments in their estimates of our financial results. 
We also believe these non-GAAP measures can facilitate comparisons of our performance between periods and to 
the performance of our peers.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative 

information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market risk” refers to our risk of loss arising 
from adverse changes in oil, gas and NGL prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The following 
disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably 
possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing 
market risk exposures. All of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than 
speculative trading.

Commodity Price Risk

Our major market risk exposure is the pricing applicable to our oil, gas and NGL production. Realized pricing 
is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our U.S. and 
Canadian gas and NGL production. Pricing for oil and gas production has been volatile and unpredictable as 
discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this report. Consequently, we systematically hedge a portion of our 
production through various financial transactions. The key terms to our oil and gas derivative financial instruments 
as of December 31, 2017 are presented in Note 4 in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this 
report.

The fair values of our commodity derivatives are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the 
relevant price indices. At December 31, 2017, a 10% change in the forward curves associated with our commodity 
derivative instruments would have changed our net asset positions by approximately $260 million.

Interest Rate Risk

At December 31, 2017, we had total debt of $10.4 billion. Of this amount, $10.3 billion bears fixed interest 

rates averaging 5.3%, and approximately $74 million is comprised of floating rate debt with interest rates averaging 
3.2%.

As of December 31, 2017, we had open interest rate swap positions that are presented in Note 4 in “Item 8. 
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report. The fair values of our interest rate swaps are largely 
determined by estimates of the forward curves of the three month LIBOR rate. A 10% change in these forward 
curves would not have materially impacted our balance sheet or liquidity at December 31, 2017.

Foreign Currency Risk

Our net assets, net earnings and cash flows from our Canadian subsidiaries are based on the U.S. dollar 
equivalent of such amounts measured in the Canadian dollar functional currency. Assets and liabilities of the 
Canadian subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting 
period. Revenues, expenses and cash flow are translated using an average exchange rate during the reporting period. 
A 10% unfavorable change in the Canadian-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate would not have materially impacted our 
December 31, 2017 balance sheet.

Our non-Canadian foreign subsidiaries have a U.S. dollar functional currency. However, some of these 

subsidiaries hold Canadian-dollar cash and engage in intercompany loans with Canadian subsidiaries that are based 
in Canadian dollars. The value of the Canadian-dollar cash and intercompany loans increases or decreases from the 
remeasurement of the cash and loans into the U.S. dollar functional currency. Based on the amount of the cash and 
intercompany loans as of December 31, 2017, a 10% change in the foreign currency exchange rates would not have 
materially impacted our balance sheet.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Devon Energy Corporation:

Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Devon Energy Corporation and subsidiaries (the 
“Company”) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings, 
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, and the 
related notes (collectively, the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal 
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control – 
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the 
financial position of as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each 
of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted 
accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal 
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control – 
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has elected to change its method of 
accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities from the full cost method of accounting to the 
successful efforts method of accounting in 2017.  

Basis for Opinion 
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective 
internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial 
reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
contained in “Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.” Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s 
consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based 
on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the 
U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and 
the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of 
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting 
was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that 
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and 
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles 
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the 
consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an 
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and 
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our 
audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe 
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

55

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made 
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s 
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may 
deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 
1.

Devon is a leading independent energy company engaged primarily in the exploration, development and 

production of oil, natural gas and NGLs. Devon’s operations are concentrated in various North American onshore 
areas in the U.S. and Canada. Devon also owns natural gas pipelines, plants and treatment facilities through its 
ownership in EnLink and the General Partner.

Accounting policies used by Devon and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted 

in the U.S. and reflect industry practices. The more significant of such policies are discussed below.

Change in Accounting Principle and Presentation Changes

In the fourth quarter of 2017, Devon changed its method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and 

development activities from the full cost method to the successful efforts method. In accordance with FASB ASC 
250 “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,” financial information for prior periods has been recast to reflect 
retrospective application of the successful efforts method, as prescribed by the FASB ASC 932 “Extractive 
Activities—Oil and Gas.” Although the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development 
activities continues to be an accepted alternative, the successful efforts method of accounting is the preferred method 
and is more widely used in the industry and will improve comparison to Devon’s peer group. Devon believes the 
successful efforts method provides a more transparent representation of its results of operations. The successful 
efforts method also provides our investments in oil and gas properties to be assessed for impairment as of the 
balance sheet date in accordance with FASB ASC 360 “Property, Plant and Equipment” rather than valuations 
based on 12-month historical prices and costs prescribed under the full cost method. For more detailed information 
regarding the effects of the change in accounting principle to the successful efforts method, see Note 2.

As Devon recast its financial statements to the successful efforts method, the financial statements and 

disclosures were examined through the lens of simplicity and transparency. From this assessment, certain changes 
were made to the financial statement presentation not specifically required by the successful efforts method of 
accounting. In general, Devon sought to simplify the presentation of its consolidated comprehensive statements of 
earnings and provide expanded and improved disclosures of key components in its operating results. These 
presentation judgments improve the clarity and utility of the financial operating results for investors and other 
stakeholders. As a result, certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to align to this new approach. To 
ensure financial statement users clearly understand the changes, a description of each enhancement is provided 
below.
•

Operating income – Devon previously segregated expenses between operating and nonoperating on the 
statement of operations. The only material nonoperating expense was generally financing costs. Devon 
streamlined the overall comprehensive statements of earnings by eliminating the operating income 
distinction. 
Upstream revenues – On the statement of operations, Devon is combining sales of oil, gas and NGL 
volumes, as well as oil, gas and NGL derivative activity, into this new line item. With the streamlined 
presentation of upstream revenues, MD&A and other disclosures of these items were expanded.
Production expenses – Similar to streamlining the presentation of upstream revenues, Devon is 
simplifying the presentation of cash-based expenses associated with upstream production. Previously 
these expenses were reported separately as lease operations and production and property taxes in the 
comprehensive statements of earnings. These items are now combined in this new line item. Devon has 
expanded the MD&A and other disclosures of expenses for lease operations, gathering and 
transportation, production taxes and property taxes.

•

Asset impairments – Except for unproved oil and gas property impairments, this line item will capture 
all impairments of Devon’s assets. After research of peers, Devon decided to report unproved 
impairments as part of exploration expenses. Because asset impairments are non-routine adjustments to 
the cost basis of assets, this item was placed adjacent to DD&A, the routine adjustment of the cost basis 
of assets, on the comprehensive statements of earnings. 
Asset dispositions – This line item will capture gains and losses from dispositions of assets. As a full 
cost company, Devon rarely had material gains and losses on asset dispositions. However, when it did, 
such amounts were reported as part of revenues. Devon has more gains and losses under the successful 
efforts method of accounting. Since recognizing gains and losses on asset dispositions are largely 
affected by previously recognized DD&A and asset impairments, this item was placed adjacent to those 
items on the comprehensive statements of earnings.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Devon and entities in which it 

holds a controlling interest. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Undivided interests in oil and 
natural gas exploration and production joint ventures are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Investments in non-
controlled entities, over which Devon has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial 
policies, are accounted for using the equity method. In applying the equity method of accounting, the investments 
are initially recognized at cost and subsequently adjusted for Devon’s proportionate share of earnings, losses, 
contributions and distributions. Investments accounted for using the equity method and cost method are reported as a 
component of other long-term assets.

Devon completed a business combination in 2014 whereby Devon controls both EnLink and the General 

Partner. Devon controls both the General Partner’s and EnLink’s operations; therefore, the General Partner’s and 
EnLink’s accounts are included in Devon’s accompanying consolidated financial statements subsequent to the 
completion of the transaction. The portions of the General Partner’s and EnLink’s net earnings and equity not 
attributable to Devon’s controlling interest are shown separately as noncontrolling interests in the accompanying 
consolidated comprehensive statements of earnings and consolidated balance sheets.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 

the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the 
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts 
could differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. Significant items 
subject to such estimates and assumptions include the following:

•
•
•

•
•
•
•
•
•

proved reserves and related present value of future net revenues;
evaluation of suspended well costs;
the carrying and fair values of oil and gas properties, midstream assets and product and equipment 
inventories;
derivative financial instruments;
the fair value of reporting units and related assessment of goodwill for impairment;
the fair value of intangible assets other than goodwill;
income taxes;
asset retirement obligations;
obligations related to employee pension and postretirement benefits;

•
•

legal and environmental risks and exposures; and
general credit risk associated with receivables and other assets.

Revenue Recognition

Oil, gas and NGL sales are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, 

delivery has occurred, title has transferred and collectability of the revenue is probable. Delivery occurs and title 
typically is transferred when production has been delivered to a pipeline, railcar or truck. Cash received relating to 
future production is deferred and recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met. Taxes assessed by 
governmental authorities on oil, gas and NGL sales are presented separately from such revenues in the 
accompanying consolidated comprehensive statements of earnings.

Marketing and midstream revenues are recorded at the time products are sold or services are provided to third 
parties at a fixed or determinable price, delivery or performance has occurred, title has transferred and collectability 
of the revenue is probable. Revenues and expenses attributable to oil, gas and NGL purchases, transportation and 
processing contracts are reported on a gross basis when Devon takes title to the products and has risks and rewards 
of ownership.

During 2017, 2016 and 2015, no purchaser accounted for more than 10% of Devon’s consolidated sales 

revenue.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Devon is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations, including risks related to 

commodity prices, interest rates and Canadian to U.S. dollar exchange rates. As discussed more fully below, Devon 
uses derivative instruments primarily to manage commodity price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. 
Devon does not intend to issue or hold derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.

Devon enters into derivative financial instruments with respect to a portion of its oil, gas and NGL production 

to hedge future prices received. Additionally, Devon and EnLink periodically enter into derivative financial 
instruments with respect to a portion of their oil, gas and NGL marketing activities. These instruments are used to 
manage the inherent uncertainty of future revenues resulting from commodity price volatility. Devon’s derivative 
financial instruments typically include financial price swaps, basis swaps, costless price collars and call options. 
Under the terms of the price swaps, Devon receives a fixed price for its production and pays a variable market price 
to the contract counterparty. For the basis swaps, Devon receives a fixed differential between two regional index 
prices and pays a variable differential on the same two index prices to the contract counterparty. The price collars set 
a floor and ceiling price for the hedged production. If the applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges 
set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars, Devon will cash-settle the difference with the counterparty 
to the collars. The call options give counterparties the right to purchase production at a predetermined price.

Devon periodically enters into interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate volatility and foreign 
exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in the U.S. and Canadian dollar exchange rates. 
As of December 31, 2017, Devon did not have any open foreign exchange contracts.

All derivative financial instruments are recognized at their current fair value as either assets or liabilities in the 

balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recorded in earnings unless 
specific hedge accounting criteria are met. For derivative financial instruments held during the three-year period 
ended December 31, 2017, Devon chose not to meet the necessary criteria to qualify its derivative financial 
instruments for hedge accounting treatment. Cash settlements with counterparties on Devon’s derivative financial 
instruments are also recorded in earnings. Cash settlements that Devon is entitled to are accrued for in other current 
assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 

63

DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

By using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in commodity prices, interest rates 
and foreign currency rates, Devon is exposed to credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform 
under the terms of the derivative contract. To mitigate this risk, the hedging instruments are placed with a number of 
counterparties whom Devon believes are acceptable credit risks. It is Devon’s policy to enter into derivative 
contracts only with investment-grade rated counterparties deemed by management to be competent and competitive 
market makers. Additionally, Devon’s derivative contracts generally require cash collateral to be posted if either its 
or the counterparty’s credit rating falls below certain credit rating levels. As of December 31, 2017, Devon held no 
cash collateral of its counterparties nor posted collateral to its counterparties.

General and Administrative Expenses

G&A is reported net of amounts reimbursed by working interest owners of the oil and gas properties operated 

by Devon. 

Share-Based Compensation

Independent of EnLink, Devon grants share-based awards to members of its Board of Directors and select 

employees. EnLink and the General Partner also grant share-based awards to members of its Board of Directors and 
select employees. All such awards are measured at fair value on the date of grant and are generally recognized as a 
component of G&A in the accompanying consolidated comprehensive statements of earnings over the applicable 
requisite service periods. As a result of Devon’s restructuring activity discussed in Note 7, certain share-based 
awards were accelerated and recognized as a component of restructuring costs in the accompanying 2016 
consolidated comprehensive statements of earnings.

Generally, Devon uses new shares from approved incentive programs to grant share-based awards and to issue 

shares upon stock option exercises. Shares repurchased under approved programs are generally available to be 
issued as part of Devon’s share-based awards. However, Devon has historically canceled these shares upon 
repurchase.

Income Taxes

Devon is subject to current income taxes assessed by the federal and various state jurisdictions in the U.S. and 

by other foreign jurisdictions. In addition, Devon accounts for deferred income taxes related to these jurisdictions 
using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the 
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates 
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are 
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is 
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Deferred tax assets are also recognized for the future tax benefits attributable to the expected utilization of 

existing tax net operating loss carryforwards and other types of carryforwards. If the future utilization of some 
portion of the deferred tax assets is determined to be unlikely, a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the 
recorded tax benefits from such assets. Devon periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if 
it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Forming a conclusion that a 
valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is negative evidence, such as cumulative losses in recent 
years. See Note 8 for further discussion. 

Devon recognizes the financial statement effects of tax positions when it is more likely than not, based on the 

technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. Recognized tax 
positions are initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not of 
being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to 
such tax positions are included in other long-term liabilities unless the tax position is expected to be settled within 

64

DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

the upcoming year, in which case the liabilities are included in other current liabilities. Interest and penalties related 
to unrecognized tax benefits are included in current income tax expense.

Devon estimates its annual effective income tax rate in recording its provision for income taxes in the various 
jurisdictions in which it operates. Statutory tax rate changes and other significant or unusual items are recognized as 
discrete items in the period in which they occur.

Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Devon

Devon’s basic earnings per share amounts have been computed based on the average number of shares of 
common stock outstanding for the period. Basic earnings per share includes the effect of participating securities, 
which primarily consist of Devon’s outstanding restricted stock awards, as well as performance-based restricted 
stock awards that have met the requisite performance targets. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the 
treasury stock method to reflect the assumed issuance of common shares for all potentially dilutive securities. Such 
securities primarily consist of unvested performance share units.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Devon considers all highly liquid investments with original contractual maturities of three months or less to be 

cash equivalents.

Accounts Receivable

Devon’s accounts receivable balance primarily consists of oil and gas sales receivables, marketing and 

midstream revenue receivables and joint interest receivables for which Devon does not require collateral security. 
Devon has established an allowance for bad debts equal to the estimable portions of accounts receivable for which 
failure to collect is considered probable. When a portion of the receivable is deemed uncollectible, the write-off is 
made against the allowance.

Property and Equipment

Oil and Gas Property and Equipment

Devon follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas properties. Under this method 
exploration costs, such as exploratory geological and geophysical costs, and costs associated with nonproductive 
exploratory wells, delay rentals and exploration overhead are charged against earnings as incurred. Costs of drilling 
successful exploratory wells along with acquisition costs and the costs of drilling development wells, including 
those that are unsuccessful, are capitalized. Devon groups its oil and gas properties with a common geological 
structure or stratigraphic condition (“common operating field”) in accordance with ASC 932 “Extractive Activities – 
Oil and Gas” for purposes of computing DD&A, assessing proved property impairments and accounting for asset 
dispositions.

Exploratory drilling costs and exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells are initially capitalized, or suspended, 

pending the determination of proved reserves. If proved reserves are found, drilling costs remain capitalized as 
proved properties. Costs of unsuccessful wells are charged to exploration expense. For exploratory wells that find 
reserves that cannot be classified as proved when drilling is completed, costs continue to be capitalized as suspended 
exploratory well costs if there have been sufficient reserves found to justify completion as a producing well and 
sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If 
management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated 
suspended exploratory well costs are expensed. In some instances, this determination may take longer than one year. 
Devon reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs quarterly.

65

DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

Capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties are depleted by an equivalent unit-of-production method, 

converting gas to oil at the ratio of six Mcf of gas to one Bbl of oil. Proved leasehold acquisition costs, less 
accumulated amortization, are depleted over total proved reserves, which includes proved undeveloped reserves. 
Capitalized costs of wells and related equipment and facilities, including estimated asset retirement costs, net of 
estimated salvage values and less accumulated amortization are depreciated over proved developed reserves 
associated with those capitalized costs. Depletion is calculated by applying the DD&A rate (amortizable base 
divided by beginning of period proved reserves) to current period production. 

Costs associated with unproved properties are excluded from the depletion calculation until it is determined 

whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to such properties. Devon assesses its unproved properties for 
impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value of 
those assets may not be recoverable. Significant unproved properties are assessed individually. Costs of insignificant 
unproved properties are amortized to exploration expense on a group basis using estimated lease surrender rates over 
average lease terms.

Proved properties are assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in 

circumstances dictate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. Individual assets are grouped 
for impairment purposes based on a common operating field. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset 
may not be recovered, the asset is assessed for potential impairment by management through an established process. 
If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, the 
carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Because there is usually a lack of quoted market prices for 
long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected 
future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants or 
by comparable transactions. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value 
calculations are typically based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, 
operating costs, and capital investment plans, considering all available information at the date of review.

Gains or losses are recorded for sales or dispositions of oil and gas properties which constitute an entire 
common operating field or which result in a significant alteration of the common operating field’s DD&A rate. 
These gains and losses are classified as asset dispositions in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. 
Partial common operating field sales or dispositions deemed not to significantly alter the DD&A rates are generally 
accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized. 

Devon capitalizes interest costs incurred and attributable to material unproved oil and gas properties and major 

development projects of oil and gas properties.

Midstream and Other Property and Equipment

Costs for midstream assets that are in use are depreciated over the assets’ estimated useful lives, using the 

straight-line method. Depreciation and amortization of other property and equipment, including corporate and 
leasehold improvements, are provided using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives ranging from 
three to 60 years. Interest costs incurred and attributable to major midstream and corporate construction projects are 
also capitalized.

Asset Retirement Obligations 

Devon recognizes liabilities for retirement obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets, such as 

producing well sites and midstream pipelines and processing plants when there is a legal obligation associated with 
the retirement of such assets and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The initial measurement of an asset 
retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its fair value, with an offsetting asset retirement cost recorded as an 
increase to the associated property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet. When the assumptions used to 
estimate a recorded asset retirement obligation change, a revision is recorded to both the asset retirement obligation 
and the asset retirement cost. Devon’s asset retirement obligations also include estimated environmental remediation 
costs which arise from normal operations and are associated with the retirement of such long-lived assets. The asset 
retirement cost is depreciated using a systematic and rational method similar to that used for the associated property 
and equipment.

66

DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of business combinations over the fair value of the net 

assets acquired and is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances 
dictate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Such test includes an assessment of qualitative 
and quantitative factors. The impairment test requires the fair value of each reporting unit be compared to the 
carrying value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, then 
goodwill is written down to the fair value of the goodwill through a charge to expense. Because quoted market 
prices are not available for Devon’s reporting units, the fair values of the reporting units are estimated based upon 
several valuation analyses, including comparable companies, comparable transactions and premiums paid.

Devon and EnLink performed annual impairment tests of goodwill in the fourth quarters of 2017, 2016 and 
2015. No impairment was required as a result of the annual tests in 2017 or 2016; however, sustained weakness in 
the overall energy sector driven by lower commodity prices, together with a decline in the EnLink unit price, caused 
a change in circumstances warranting an interim impairment test and write-down for certain of EnLink’s reporting 
units in the first quarter of 2016. Write-downs were also required in 2015 for certain EnLink reporting units. See 
Note 14 for further discussion.

Intangible Assets

Unamortized capitalized intangible assets, consisting of EnLink customer relationships, are presented in other 

long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These assets are amortized on a straight-line 
basis over the expected periods of benefits, which range from 10 to 20 years. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, EnLink’s 
customer relationships were also evaluated for impairment, and in 2015, a portion of these intangible assets was 
considered impaired. See Note 14 for further discussion.

Commitments and Contingencies

Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation or other sources are recorded 
when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities for 
environmental remediation or restoration claims resulting from allegations of improper operation of assets are 
recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. 
Expenditures related to such environmental matters are expensed or capitalized in accordance with Devon’s 
accounting policy for property and equipment.

Fair Value Measurements

Certain of Devon’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value at each reporting date. Fair value represents 

the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants. This price is commonly referred to as the “exit price.” Fair value measurements are classified 
according to a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs underlying the valuation techniques. This hierarchy consists of 
three broad levels:

•

•

•

Level 1 – Inputs consist of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities 
and have the highest priority. When available, Devon measures fair value using Level 1 inputs because 
they generally provide the most reliable evidence of fair value.
Level 2 – Inputs consist of quoted prices that are generally observable for the asset or liability. Common 
examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or 
quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets not considered to be active.
Level 3 – Inputs are not observable from objective sources and have the lowest priority. The most 
common Level 3 fair value measurement is an internally developed cash flow model.

Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for Devon’s consolidated operations except its Canadian 

subsidiaries, which use the Canadian dollar as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of the Canadian 
subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period. 
Revenues, expenses and cash flow are translated using an average exchange rate during the reporting period. 
Translation adjustments have no effect on net income and are included in accumulated other comprehensive 
earnings in stockholders’ equity.

Noncontrolling Interests

Noncontrolling interests represent third-party ownership in the net assets of Devon’s consolidated subsidiaries 

and are presented as a component of equity. Changes in Devon’s ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not 
result in deconsolidation are recognized in equity.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

In January 2017, Devon adopted ASU 2016-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718), 

Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. Its objective is to simplify several aspects of the 
accounting for share-based payments, including income taxes when awards vest or are settled, statutory withholding 
and forfeitures. As the result of adoption, Devon made certain income tax presentation changes, most notably 
prospectively presenting excess tax benefits and deficiencies in the consolidated comprehensive statements of 
earnings and as operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Devon also retrospectively 
applied the new cash flow statement guidance dictating the presentation of shares exchanged for tax-withholding 
purposes as a financing activity. The adoption of the new guidance did not materially impact the consolidated 
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 or previously reported financial information but could 
have a more material future impact.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill And Other (Topic 350), Simplifying 

the Test for Goodwill Impairment (ASU 2017-04). ASU 2017-04 simplifies the accounting for goodwill 
impairments by eliminating the requirement to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount 
as part of step two of the goodwill impairment test. Under ASU 2017-04, an entity should perform its goodwill 
impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge 
should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. However, 
the impairment loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. ASU 
2017-04 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including any interim 
impairment tests within those annual periods, with early application for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests 
performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. In January 2017, Devon elected to early adopt ASU 2017-04. The 
adoption had no impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), 
which established ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). ASC 606 will replace 
existing revenue recognition requirements in GAAP and will require entities to recognize revenue at an amount that 
reflects the consideration to which they expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a 
customer. ASC 606 will also require significantly expanded disclosures containing qualitative and quantitative 
information regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts 
with customers. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 
606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients (ASU 2016-12), which updated ASU 2014-09. ASU 
2016-12 clarifies certain core recognition principles, including collectability, sales tax presentation, noncash 
consideration, contract modifications and completed contracts at transition and disclosures no longer required if the 
full retrospective transition method is adopted. ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2016-12 are effective for annual reporting

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods, and are to be 
applied using the modified retrospective or full retrospective transition methods, with early application permitted for 
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Devon will adopt ASC 606 using the modified 
retrospective method for annual and interim reporting periods beginning January 1, 2018.   

Devon has aggregated and reviewed its contracts that are within the scope of ASC 606. Based on its 

evaluation, Devon does not anticipate the adoption of ASC 606 will have a material impact on its balance sheet or 
related consolidated statements of earnings, equity or cash flows. Accordingly, Devon will continue to recognize 
revenue at the time commodities are delivered. However, ASC 606 will affect how certain transactions are presented 
in its financial statements. Under this guidance, an entity generally shall record revenue on a gross basis if it controls 
a promised good or service before transferring it to a customer, whereas an entity shall record revenue on a net basis 
if its role is to arrange for another entity to provide the goods or services to a customer. Devon will change its 
presentation of certain processing arrangements from a net presentation to a gross presentation. This change will 
impact Devon’s upstream revenues and production expenses by approximately $250 million for 2016 and 2017, and 
will impact 2018 by a similar amount. EnLink will change the presentation of certain marketing and midstream 
revenues to marketing and midstream operating expenses or from marketing and midstream operating expenses to 
marketing and midstream revenues. Devon estimates this reclassification will result in a net decrease in EnLink’s 
marketing and midstream revenues of approximately 6-10%. These estimates are based on historical information and 
could change based on future volumes and commodity prices. These presentation changes will have no impact on 
net earnings or cash flows. 

Based on the disclosure requirements of ASC 606, upon adoption, Devon expects to provide expanded 

disclosures relating to its revenue recognition policies and how these relate to its revenue-generating contractual 
performance obligations. In addition, Devon expects to present revenues disaggregated based on the type of good or 
service in order to more fully depict the nature of its revenues.  

The FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This ASU will supersede the lease requirements in 
Topic 840, Leases. Its objective is to increase transparency and comparability among organizations. This ASU 
provides guidance requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheet. Lessor accounting does not 
significantly change, except for some changes made to align with new revenue recognition requirements. This ASU 
is effective for Devon beginning January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted, but Devon does not plan to early 
adopt. Currently the guidance would be applied using a modified retrospective transition method, which requires 
applying the new guidance to leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest period in the 
financial statements. However, the FASB recently issued Proposed ASU No. 2018-200, Leases (Topic 842), 
Targeted Improvements which would allow entities to apply the transition provisions of the new standard at its 
adoption date instead of at the earliest comparative period presented in the consolidated financial statements. The 
proposed ASU will allow entities to continue to apply the legacy guidance in Topic 840, including its disclosure 
requirements, in the comparative periods presented in the year the new leases standard is adopted. Entities that elect 
this option would still adopt the new leases standard using a modified retrospective transition method, but would 
recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption rather 
than in the earliest period presented. Devon is in the process of evaluating contracts and gathering the necessary 
terms and data elements for purposes of determining the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial 
statements and related disclosures. Recently, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-01, Leases (Topic 842), Land 
Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842. This ASU would permit an entity not to apply Topic 842 
to land easements and rights-of-way that exist or expired before the effective date of Topic 842 and that were not 
previously assessed under Topic 840. An entity would continue to apply its current accounting policy for accounting 
for land easements that existed before the effective date of Topic 842. Once an entity adopts Topic 842, it would 
apply that Topic prospectively to all new (or modified) land easements and rights-of-way to determine whether the 
arrangement should be accounted for as a lease. For Devon, these contracts represent a relatively small percentage of 
the aggregate value of contracts being evaluated but represent a significant number of contracts. 

Based on continuing research, Devon estimates a large number of contracts and data elements must be 
gathered and reviewed to ensure proper accounting of these contracts once this ASU is effective. Devon has 
preliminarily determined its portfolio of leased assets and is reviewing all related contracts to determine the impact 
the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements. Devon anticipates the adoption of this standard will

significantly impact its consolidated financial statements, systems, processes and controls and is evaluating 
technology requirements and solutions needed to comply with the requirements of this ASU. While we cannot 
currently estimate the quantitative effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements, the 
adoption will increase our asset and liability balances on the consolidated balance sheets due to the required 
recognition of right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities.

The FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation – Retirement Benefits (Topic 715), Improving the 

Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. This ASU will require 
entities to present the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in the same line item as other employee 
compensation costs. Only the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is eligible for capitalization. This 
ASU is effective for Devon beginning January 1, 2018, and income statement presentation changes will be applied 
retrospectively, while service cost component capitalization will be applied prospectively. Upon adoption of this 
ASU, Devon will reclassify $7 million, $14 million and $16 million of non-service cost components of net periodic 
benefit costs for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as other expenses. Such amounts are currently classified in 
Devon’s G&A. No other changes upon adopting this ASU are expected to be material.

The FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. This ASU requires 

an entity to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents on 
the statement of cash flows and to provide a reconciliation of the totals in the statement of cash flows to the related 
captions in the balance sheet when the cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents are 
presented in more than one line item on the balance sheet. This reconciliation can be presented either on the face of 
the consolidated statement of cash flows or in the notes to the financial statements. This ASU is effective for Devon 
beginning January 1, 2018, and will be applied retrospectively. Currently, Devon does not expect the adoption to 
have a material impact on its consolidated statement of cash flows.

The FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. 

This ASU clarifies the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating whether a set of transferred assets 
and activities should be accounted for as an acquisition or disposals of assets or as a business. The guidance requires 
an entity to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired, or disposed of, are concentrated 
in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets; if so, the set of transferred assets and activities 
would not represent a business. The guidance also requires that a set of assets must include an input and a 
substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create an output to be considered a 
business. This ASU is effective for Devon beginning January 1, 2018, and will be applied prospectively. Devon does 
not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements; however these 
amendments could result in the recording of fewer business combinations in future periods.

The FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting 
for Hedging Activities. This ASU will expand hedge accounting for nonfinancial and financial risk components and 
amend measurement methodologies to more closely align hedge accounting with a company's risk management 
activities. The guidance also eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness. This 
ASU only applies to entities that elect hedge accounting, which Devon has not for derivative financial instruments 
during the three year period ended December 31, 2017. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods 
beginning January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted in 2018. The ASU is required to be adopted using a 
cumulative effect (modified retrospective) transition method, which utilizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to 
retained earnings in the period of adoption to account for prior period effects rather than restating previously 
reported results. Devon is currently evaluating the provisions of this ASU and assessing the impact it may have on 
its consolidated financial statements if hedge accounting were elected by Devon in the future.

Change in Accounting Principle

In the fourth quarter of 2017, Devon changed its method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and 

development activities from the full cost method to the successful efforts method. Accordingly, financial 
information for prior periods has been recast to reflect retrospective application of the successful efforts method. In 
general, under successful efforts, exploration costs such as exploratory dry holes, exploratory geological and 
geophysical costs, delay rentals, unproved impairments, and exploration overhead are charged against earnings as 
incurred, versus being capitalized under the full cost method of accounting. In addition, gains or losses, if 
applicable, are recognized more frequently on the dispositions of oil and gas property and equipment under the 
successful efforts method. Devon has recast certain historical information for all periods presented, including the 
Consolidated Comprehensive Statements of Earnings, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, Consolidated 
Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Equity and related information in Notes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 
14, 16, 22, 23, 24 and 25.

The following tables present the effects of the change to the successful efforts method in the consolidated 

financial statements.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

Devon Acquisitions

In January 2016, Devon acquired approximately 80,000 net acres (unaudited) and assets in the STACK play 

for approximately $1.5 billion. Devon funded the acquisition with $849 million of cash, after adjustments, and $659 
million of equity. The allocation of the purchase price was approximately $1.3 billion to unproved properties and 
approximately $200 million to proved properties.

In December 2015, Devon acquired approximately 253,000 net acres (unaudited) and assets in the Powder 
River Basin for approximately $499 million. Devon funded the acquisition with $300 million of cash and $199 
million of equity. The allocation of the purchase price was $393 million to unproved properties and $106 million to 
proved properties.

Devon Asset Divestitures

Upstream Assets

In May 2017, Devon announced a program to divest approximately $1 billion of upstream assets. The non-

core assets identified for monetization include select portions of the Barnett Shale focused primarily in and around 
Johnson County and other properties located principally within Devon’s U.S. resource base. Through December 31, 
2017, Devon completed divestiture transactions with proceeds totaling approximately $415 million, before purchase 
price adjustments, and a net gain of $212 million. Estimated proved reserves associated with these assets were less 
than 1% of total U.S. proved reserves. Devon’s remaining divestiture of Johnson County assets is expected to close 
in 2018.

DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

During 2016, in several separate transactions with different purchasers, Devon divested non-core assets 

located in the Mississippian, east Texas, the Anadarko Basin and the Midland Basin. The following table presents a 
summary of Devon’s divestiture activity for 2016.

These divestitures in 2017 and 2016 primarily related to sales of entire common operating fields. Therefore, 
Devon recognized a gain on the transactions. As part of the gain computations, approximately $290 million of asset 
retirement obligations were assumed by purchasers and $80 million of goodwill was allocated to these divested 
assets. 

Access Pipeline

In October 2016, Devon divested its 50% interest in Access Pipeline for $1.1 billion ($1.4 billion Canadian 

dollars) and recognized a gain of approximately $540 million on the transaction. In conjunction with the divestiture, 
Devon entered into a transportation agreement whereby Devon’s Canadian thermal-oil acreage is dedicated to 
Access Pipeline for an initial term of 25 years. Devon will be charged a market-based toll on its thermal-oil 
production over this term. Devon is committed to use less than 90% of the potential pipeline capacity. In addition, 
Devon is entitled to an incremental payment of approximately $150 million Canadian dollars following sanctioning 
and committing to the requisite volume increase in respect of a new thermal-oil project on Devon’s Pike lease in 
Alberta, with such incremental payment being received prior to tolls being payable on such volumes. 

EnLink Acquisitions

In January 2016, EnLink acquired Anadarko Basin gathering and processing midstream assets, along with 

dedicated acreage service rights and service contracts, for approximately $1.4 billion. The purchase price was $1.0 
billion to intangible assets and approximately $400 million to property and equipment. EnLink funded the 
acquisition with approximately $215 million of General Partner common units and approximately $800 million of 
cash, primarily financed with the issuance of EnLink preferred units. The remaining $500 million of the purchase 
price was to be paid within one year with the option to defer $250 million of the final payment 24 months from the 
close date. The first installment payment of $250 million was paid in January 2017 using divestiture proceeds, 
proceeds from equity issuances and borrowings under EnLink’s credit facility. The remaining $250 million payment 
is reported in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and was made in January 
2018 using proceeds from equity issuances and borrowings under EnLink’s credit facility.  

In August 2016, EnLink formed a joint venture to operate and expand its midstream assets in the Delaware 

Basin. The joint venture is initially owned 50.1% by EnLink and 49.9% by the joint venture partner. As of 
December 31, 2016, EnLink contributed approximately $251 million of existing non-monetary assets and cash to the 
joint venture and had committed an additional $285 million in capital to fund potential future development projects 
and potential acquisitions. The joint venture partner committed an aggregate of approximately $400 million of 
capital, including cash contributions of approximately $144 million, and granted EnLink call rights beginning in 
2021 to acquire increasing portions of the joint venture partner’s interest.

In November 2016, EnLink entered into a gathering and compression joint venture with a commitment of 

approximately $40 million to expand its midstream assets in the STACK. The joint venture is initially owned 30% 
by EnLink and 70% by the joint venture partner. As of December 31, 2016, EnLink contributed approximately $29 
million in cash for new infrastructure build. After the initial capital commitment, EnLink and the joint venture 
partner will be responsible for their proportionate share of capital costs.

EnLink Asset Divestitures and Dropdowns

In December 2016, EnLink entered into definitive agreements to divest approximately $278 million of certain 

non-core midstream assets. As of December 31, 2016, these assets were classified as held for sale. During the first 
quarter of 2017, EnLink divested its ownership interest in Howard Energy Partners for approximately $190 million. 

In February 2015, EnLink acquired a 25% equity interest in EMH from the General Partner in exchange for 
units valued at approximately $925 million. In May 2015, EnLink acquired the remaining 25% equity interest in 
EMH from the General Partner in exchange for units valued at approximately $900 million.

In April 2015, EnLink acquired VEX from Devon for approximately $176 million in cash and equity. EnLink 

also assumed approximately $35 million in certain future construction costs to expand the system to full capacity. 
Because Devon controls EnLink and the General Partner, the acquisition of VEX by EnLink from Devon was 
accounted for as a transfer of net assets between entities under common control.

Share-Based Compensation

In the second quarter of 2017, Devon’s stockholders approved the 2017 Plan. The 2017 Plan replaces the 2015 

Plan. From the effective date of the 2017 Plan, no further awards may be made under the 2015 Plan, and awards 
previously granted will continue to be governed by the terms of the respective award documents. Subject to the 
terms of the 2017 Plan, awards may be made for a total of 33.5 million shares of Devon common stock, plus the 
number of shares available for issuance under the 2015 Plan (including shares subject to outstanding awards that 
were transferred to the 2017 Plan in accordance with its terms). The 2017 Plan authorizes the Compensation 
Committee, which consists of independent, non-management members of Devon’s Board of Directors, to grant 
nonqualified and incentive stock options, restricted stock awards or units, Canadian restricted stock units, 
performance units and stock appreciation rights to eligible employees. The 2017 Plan also authorizes the grant of 
nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards or units and stock appreciation rights to non-employee directors. 
To calculate the number of shares that may be granted in awards under the 2017 Plan, options and stock appreciation 
rights represent one share and other awards represent 2.3 shares.

DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

The vesting for certain share-based awards was accelerated in 2016 in conjunction with the reduction of 

workforce described in Note 7. Approximately $60 million of associated expense for these accelerated awards is

Restricted Stock Awards and Units

Restricted stock awards and units are subject to the terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations, if any, that 
the Compensation Committee deems appropriate, including restrictions on continued employment. Generally, the 
service requirement for vesting ranges from one to four years. During the vesting period, recipients of restricted 
stock awards made under the 2015 Plan or 2009 Plan receive dividends that are not subject to restrictions or other 
limitations. However, dividends declared during the vesting period with respect to restricted stock awards made 
under the 2017 Plan and all restricted stock units will not be paid until the underlying award vests. Devon estimates 
the fair values of restricted stock awards and units as the closing price of Devon’s common stock on the grant date 
of the award or unit, which is expensed over the applicable vesting period.

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Awards

Performance-based restricted stock awards are granted to certain members of Devon’s senior management. 

Vesting of the awards is dependent on Devon meeting certain internal performance targets and the recipient meeting 
certain service requirements. Generally, the service requirement for vesting ranges from one to four years. In order 
for awards to vest, the performance target must be met in the first year. If the performance target is met, the recipient 
is entitled to dividends under the same terms described above for nonperformance-based restricted stock. If the 
performance target and service period requirements are not met, the award does not vest. Devon estimates the fair 
values of the awards as the closing price of Devon’s common stock on the grant date of the award, which is 
expensed over the applicable vesting period.

Performance Share Units

Performance share units are granted to certain members of Devon’s management and senior employees. Each 

unit that vests entitles the recipient to one share of Devon common stock. The vesting of these units is based on 
comparing Devon’s TSR to the TSR of a predetermined group of fourteen peer companies over the specified three-
year performance period. The vesting of units may be between zero and 200% of the units granted depending on 
Devon’s TSR as compared to the peer group on the vesting date.

At the end of the vesting period, recipients receive dividend equivalents with respect to the number of units 

vested. The fair value of each performance share unit is estimated as of the date of grant using a Monte Carlo 
simulation with the following assumptions used for all grants made under the plan: (i) a risk-free interest rate based 
on U.S. Treasury rates as of the grant date; (ii) a volatility assumption based on the historical realized price volatility 
of Devon and the designated peer group; and (iii) an estimated ranking of Devon among the designated peer group. 
The fair value of the unit on the date of grant is expensed over the applicable vesting period. The following table 
presents the assumptions related to performance share units granted.

Stock Options

In accordance with Devon’s incentive plans, the exercise price of stock options granted may not be less than 

the market value of the stock at the date of grant. In addition, options granted are exercisable during a period 
established for each grant, which may not exceed eight years from the date of grant. The recipient must pay the 
exercise price in cash or in common stock, or a combination thereof, at the time that the option is exercised. 
Generally, the service requirement for vesting ranges from one to four years. The fair value of stock options on the 
date of grant is expensed over the applicable vesting period. No stock options were granted in 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Certain of Devon’s non-Canadian foreign subsidiaries have a U.S. dollar functional currency, hold Canadian-

dollar cash and engage in intercompany loans with Canadian subsidiaries that are based in Canadian dollars. The 
value of the Canadian-dollar cash and intercompany loans increases or decreases from the remeasurement of the 
cash and loans into the U.S. dollar functional currency. During 2017, Devon recognized foreign exchange gains 
related to these activities resulting from the weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Canadian dollar.

Prior Years’ Restructurings

In 2016, Devon recognized $227 million in employee-related and other costs associated with a reduction in 
workforce that was made in response to the depressed commodity price environment. Of these employee-related 
costs, approximately $60 million resulted from accelerated vesting of share-based grants, which are noncash 
charges. Additionally, approximately $24 million resulted from estimated defined benefit settlements.

As a result of the reduction of workforce, Devon ceased using certain office space that was subject to non-
cancellable operating lease arrangements. Devon recognized $23 million in restructuring costs that represent the 
present value of its future obligations under the leases and impairment charges for leasehold improvements and 
furniture associated with the office space it ceased using.

In 2015, Devon recognized $24 million of employee-related and other costs associated with the reduction in 

workforce made subsequent to the completion of the Jackfish development projects and a decrease in planned 
Canadian capital investment resulting from the drop in commodity prices. 

As part of the U.S. corporate headquarters office consolidation, Devon recognized an additional $54 million 

expense in 2015, due to the inability to fully sublease remaining office space.

Transaction Costs

In 2016, Devon and EnLink recognized $17 million in transaction costs primarily associated with the closing 

of the acquisitions discussed in Note 3.

Devon and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income or capital taxes in various 
state and foreign jurisdictions. Devon’s tax reserves are related to tax years that may be subject to examinations by 
the relevant taxing authority. Devon is under audit in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions as part of its normal 
course of business.

Devon assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets. If Devon concludes that it is more likely than not 

that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, the asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. 
Numerous judgements and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors 
such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices) and changing tax laws.

DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

2017

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Reform Legislation was enacted into law and contains several key tax 

provisions that affect Devon, including a one-time mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a 
reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018, among others. Devon is required to 
recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as determining the transition tax, 
remeasuring U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities and reassessing the net realizability of deferred tax assets and 
liabilities. 

In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting 

Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allows Devon to record provisional amounts during a 
measurement period not to extend beyond one year after the enactment date. As the Tax Reform Legislation was 
passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017 and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation are expected over the 
next 12 months, Devon considers the accounting of the transition tax, deferred tax remeasurements, and other items 
to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. 
Devon expects to complete its analysis within the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118. Provisional 
amounts recorded this quarter are as follows:

(a) Devon’s U.S. segment recognized $167 million of deferred tax expense for the one-time mandatory 

transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings.  

(b) Devon’s U.S. segment recognized $108 million in deferred tax expense and EnLink recognized $211 

million in deferred tax benefit related to the reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21%.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, Devon’s Canadian segment generated nonrecurring capital losses from internal 
legal entity restructuring. A deferred tax asset of $727 million was recognized related to the capital losses, offset by 
a $641 million increase in the valuation allowance.

Throughout 2017, Devon continued to maintain a 100% valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax 
assets resulting from prior year cumulative financial losses largely due to asset impairments and significant net 
operating losses for U.S. federal and state income tax. Devon reduced its U.S. segment valuation allowance by $323 
million in 2017 based primarily on the financial income recorded during the period. Furthermore, a partial allowance 
continues to be held against certain Canadian segment deferred tax assets. The valuation allowances impacted the 
effective tax rate and are discussed in the next section.

Also in the table above, the “other” effect is primarily composed of permanent differences for which dollar 
amounts do not increase or decrease in relation to the change in pre-tax earnings. Generally, such items have an 
insignificant impact on our effective income tax rate. However, these items have a more noticeable impact to our 
rate in 2017 due to lower relative earnings during the period. During 2017, “other” is primarily related to the 
taxation of other financing items.

2016

During 2016, Devon’s U.S. segment recognized an additional $313 million valuation allowance against its 
deferred tax assets. The allowance results from continued financial losses in 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the 
allowance continued to represent a 100% valuation against the U.S. net deferred tax assets. Additionally, the 
Canadian segment recognized a $71 million partial valuation allowance resulting from continued financial losses.   

In the first quarter of 2016, EnLink recognized a goodwill impairment of approximately $873 million. 

Additionally, during the third quarter of 2016, Devon derecognized $83 million of goodwill related to its U.S. 
operations in conjunction with the divestiture of certain non-core U.S. upstream oil and gas assets. These items are 
not deductible for purposes of calculating income tax and, therefore, impact the effective tax rate. 

85

DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

2015

In the third and fourth quarters of 2015, EnLink recognized goodwill and intangibles impairments of 

approximately $1.6 billion, which impacted the effective tax rate.

During 2015, Devon recognized approximately $16 billion of oil and gas impairments related to its U.S. 
operations. These impairments resulted in deferred tax assets against which Devon recognized a $403 million 
valuation allowance.

At December 31, 2017, Devon has recognized $865 million of deferred tax assets related to various net 

operating loss carryforwards available to offset future income taxes. The Canadian segment has $710 million of 
noncapital loss carryforwards expiring between 2029 and 2037. Devon’s U.S. segment has $2.4 billion of U.S. 
federal carryforwards expiring between 2036 and 2037 and $1.7 billion of U.S. state carryforwards expiring between 
2018 and 2037. EnLink has $259 million of U.S. federal carryforwards expiring between 2034 and 2037 and $263 
million of state carryforwards expiring between 2028 and 2037. In the current environment, Devon expects tax 
benefits from the Canadian carryforwards to be utilized in 2018 and beyond and EnLink carryforwards to be utilized 
in 2020 and beyond. Devon currently does not anticipate utilizing the U.S. federal or state net operating loss 
carryforwards, as indicated by the full valuation allowance position in the U.S. segment. 

As a result of the reduction in U.S. statutory income tax rate and favorable temporary differences, Devon 

reduced its valuation allowance by $337 million against the U.S. deferred tax assets in 2017 and remains in a full 
valuation allowance position. Also during 2017, Devon’s Canadian segment recognized a $660 million partial 
valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to the Canadian capital loss carryforward due to projected 
lack of future capital gain income. In the event Devon were to determine that it would be able to realize the deferred 
income tax assets in the future, Devon would adjust the valuation allowance, reducing the provision for income 
taxes in the period of such adjustment.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

As of December 31, 2017, Devon’s unremitted foreign earnings from its international operations totaled 

approximately $908 million. All of this amount was deemed to be indefinitely reinvested into the development and 
growth of Devon’s Canadian business. Therefore, Devon has not recognized a deferred tax liability for U.S. income 
taxes associated with such earnings. If such earnings were to be repatriated to the U.S., Devon may be subject to 
U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. However, it is not practical to estimate the amount of such 
additional taxes that may be payable due to the inter-relationship of the various factors involved in making such an 
estimate.

million, respectively, of interest and penalties. If recognized, $115 million of Devon’s unrecognized tax benefits as 
of December 31, 2017 would affect Devon’s effective income tax rate. During 2017, Devon removed $101 million 
of unrecognized tax benefits, including $50 million of interest, as a result of the settlement of certain tax 
examinations. Included below is a summary of the tax years, by jurisdiction, that remain subject to examination by

Projects with suspended exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year since the 

completion of drilling relate to Devon’s heavy oil operations. Management believes these projects with suspended 
exploratory well costs exhibit sufficient quantities of hydrocarbons to justify potential development. Devon 
continues to assess the development timeline of these long cycle projects.

Asset Divestitures

In conjunction with the U.S. non-core upstream asset divestitures in 2016 discussed in Note 3, Devon 

removed goodwill allocated to these assets.

Impairment 

As further discussed in Note 1, Devon performs an annual impairment test of goodwill at October 31, or more 

frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be 
recoverable. Sustained weakness in the overall energy sector driven by low commodity prices, together with a 
decline in EnLink’s unit price, caused a change in circumstances warranting an interim impairment test of EnLink’s 
reporting units in the first quarter of 2016. Based on that test, EnLink recorded noncash goodwill impairments 
related to its Texas, Crude and Condensate and General Partner reporting units. 

Additionally, during 2015, EnLink recorded noncash goodwill impairments related to its Texas, Louisiana and 

Crude and Condensate reporting units.

Credit Lines

Devon has a $3.0 billion Senior Credit Facility. The facility matures as follows: $164 million on October 24, 
2018 and the remaining $2.8 billion on October 24, 2019. Amounts borrowed under the Senior Credit Facility may, 
at the election of Devon, bear interest at various fixed rate options for periods of up to twelve months. Such rates are 
generally less than the prime rate. However, Devon may elect to borrow at the prime rate. The Senior Credit Facility 
currently provides for an annual facility fee of $7.4 million. As of December 31, 2017, Devon had $59 million in 
outstanding letters of credit under the Senior Credit Facility. There were no borrowings under the Senior Credit 
Facility as of December 31, 2017.

The Senior Credit Facility contains only one material financial covenant. This covenant requires Devon’s ratio 

of total funded debt to total capitalization, as defined in the credit agreement, to be no greater than 65%. The credit 
agreement contains definitions of total funded debt and total capitalization that include adjustments to the respective 
amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Also, total capitalization is adjusted to add 
back noncash financial write-downs such as asset impairments. As of December 31, 2017, Devon was in compliance 
with this covenant with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 27.2%. Devon’s change to successful efforts did not 
materially change this ratio.

Commercial Paper

Devon’s Senior Credit Facility supports its $3.0 billion of short-term credit under its commercial paper 

program. Commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between 1 and 90 days, although it can have a maturity 
of up to 365 days, and bears interest at rates agreed to at the time of the borrowing. The interest rate is generally 
based on a standard index such as the Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR or the money market rate as found in the 
commercial paper market. As of December 31, 2017, Devon had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings.

Retirement of Senior Notes

During 2016, Devon completed tender offers to repurchase $2.1 billion of debt securities, using proceeds from 
the asset divestitures discussed in Note 3. Devon recognized a loss on early retirement of debt, primarily consisting 
of $265 million in cash retirement costs and other fees. These costs, along with other minimal noncash charges 
associated with retiring the debt, are included in net financing costs in the consolidated comprehensive statements of 
earnings. 

EnLink Debt

All of EnLink’s and the General Partner’s debt is non-recourse to Devon.

95

DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

EnLink has a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that will mature on March 6, 2020. As of 

December 31, 2017, there were $10 million in outstanding letters of credit and no outstanding borrowings under the 
$1.5 billion credit facility. The General Partner has a $250 million revolving credit facility that will mature on 
March 7, 2019. As of December 31, 2017, the General Partner had $74 million in outstanding borrowings under the 
$250 million credit facility at a weighted average borrowing rate of 3.2%. EnLink and the General Partner were in 
compliance with all financial covenants in their respective credit facilities as of December 31, 2017.

In the second quarter of 2017, EnLink issued $500 million of 5.45% unsecured senior notes due in 2047. The 
proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility and for general partnership 
purposes. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2017, EnLink redeemed its $163 million 7.125% senior unsecured 
notes due in 2022. EnLink redeemed the notes at 103.6% of the principal amount, plus accrued unpaid interest, for 
aggregate cash consideration of $174 million, which resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of $9 million 
during the second quarter of 2017. The gain is included in net financing costs in the consolidated comprehensive 
statement of earnings.

In July 2016, EnLink issued $500 million of 4.85% unsecured senior notes due 2026. EnLink used the net 
proceeds to repay outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility and for general partnership purposes.

During 2017, Devon reduced its asset retirement obligations by $184 million primarily due to changes in the 

assumed inflation rate and retirement dates for its oil and gas assets.

During 2016, Devon reduced its asset retirement obligation by $287 million for those obligations that were 

assumed by purchasers of certain upstream U.S. assets.

18. Retirement Plans

Defined Contribution Plans

Devon sponsors defined contribution plans covering its employees in the U.S. and Canada. Such plans include 

its 401(k) plan, enhanced contribution plan and Canadian pension and savings plan. Contributions are primarily 
based upon percentages of annual compensation and years of service. In addition, each plan is subject to regulatory 
limitations by each respective government. Devon contributed $60 million, $64 million and $79 million to these 
plans in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Defined Benefit Plans

Devon has various non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, including qualified plans and nonqualified 

plans covering eligible U.S. and Canadian employees and former employees meeting certain age and service 
requirements. Benefits under the defined benefit plans have been closed to new employees since 2007; however, 
eligible employees continue to accrue benefits based upon years of service and compensation. Benefits are primarily 
funded from assets held in the plans’ trusts.  

Devon’s investment objective for its plans’ assets is to achieve stability of the funded status while providing 
long-term growth of invested capital and income to ensure benefit payments can be funded when required. Devon 
has established certain investment strategies, including target allocation percentages and permitted and prohibited 
investments, designed to mitigate risks inherent with investing. Devon’s target allocations for its plan assets are 70% 
fixed income, 20% equity and 10% other. See the following discussion for Devon’s pension assets by asset class.

Fixed-income – Devon’s fixed-income securities consist of U.S. Treasury obligations, bonds issued by 

investment-grade companies from diverse industries and asset-backed securities. These fixed-income securities are 
actively traded securities that can be redeemed upon demand. The fair values of these Level 1 securities are based 
upon quoted market prices and were $342 million and $311 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Also, included are commingled funds that primarily invest in long-term bonds and U.S. Treasury securities. These 
fixed income securities can be redeemed on demand but are not actively traded. The fair values of these securities 
are based upon the net asset values provided by the investment managers and were $401 million and $367 million at 
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Equity – Devon’s equity securities include a commingled global equity fund that invests in large, mid- and 

small capitalization stocks across the world’s developed and emerging markets. These equity securities can be 
redeemed on demand but are not actively traded. The fair values of these securities are based upon the net asset 
values provided by the investment managers and were $157 million and $171 million at December 31, 2017 and 
2016, respectively.

Other – Devon’s other securities include short-term investments funds, an actively traded global mutual fund 

focusing on alternative investment strategies and a hedge fund that invests both long and short using a variety of 
investment strategies. The fair value of these securities is based upon the net asset values provided by investment 
managers and were $135 million and $136 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Defined Postretirement Plans

Devon also has defined benefit postretirement plans that provide benefits for substantially all qualifying U.S. 

retirees. The plans provide medical and in some cases, life insurance benefits and are either contributory or non-
contributory, depending on the type of plan. Benefit obligations for such plans are estimated based on Devon’s 
future cost-sharing intentions. Devon’s funding policy for the plans is to fund the benefits as they become payable 
with available cash and cash equivalents.

Discount Rate - Future pension and post-retirement obligations are discounted based on the rate at which 

obligations could be effectively settled, considering the timing of expected future cash flows related to the plans. 
This rate is based on high-quality bond yields, after allowing for call and default risk.  

Expected return on plan assets – This was determined by evaluating input from external consultants and 

economists, as well as long-term inflation assumptions and consideration of target allocation of investment types.

100

DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

Mortality rate – Devon utilized the Society of Actuaries produced mortality tables and an improvement scale 

derived from the updated tables and the actuary’s best estimate of mortality for the population of participants in 
Devon’s plans. 

Other assumptions – For measurement of the 2017 benefit obligation for the other postretirement medical 
plans, a 7.3% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2018. 
The rate was assumed to decrease annually to an ultimate rate of 5% in the year 2029 and remain at that level 
thereafter. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would not have a material impact 
on periodic benefit cost or benefit obligations.

Expected Cash Flows

Devon expects benefit plan payments to average approximately $76 million a year for the next five years and 

$406 million total for the five years thereafter. Of these payments to be paid in 2018, $3 million is expected to be 
funded from Devon’s available cash and cash equivalents. 

19.

Stockholders’ Equity

The authorized capital stock of Devon consists of 1.0 billion shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per 

share, and 4.5 million shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share. The preferred stock may be issued in one 
or more series, and the terms and rights of such stock will be determined by the Board of Directors.

Common Stock Issued

In January 2016, Devon issued approximately 23 million shares of common stock in conjunction with the 
STACK asset acquisition discussed in Note 3. Additionally, in February 2016, Devon issued 79 million shares of 
common stock to the public, inclusive of 10 million shares sold as part of the underwriters’ option. Net proceeds 
from the offering were $1.5 billion.  

In December 2015, Devon issued approximately 7 million shares of common stock as part of the Powder 

River Basin asset acquisition discussed in Note 3.    

Dividends

Devon paid common stock dividends of $127 million, $221 million and $396 million during 2017, 2016 and 

2015, respectively. In response to the depressed commodity price environment, Devon reduced the quarterly 
dividend rate from $0.24 to $0.06 per share in the second quarter of 2016.

20. Noncontrolling Interests

Subsidiary Equity Transactions

EnLink has the ability to sell common units through its “at the market” equity offering programs. In the third 
quarter of 2017, EnLink entered into additional equity distribution agreements to sell up to $600 million in common 
units through its programs. Future common units that EnLink issues will be issued under the new equity distribution 
agreement. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, EnLink issued and sold approximately 6.2 million, 10.0 million and 1.3 
million common units through its “at the market” program and general public offerings, generating net proceeds of 
$107 million, $167 million and $25 million, respectively. During the first quarter of 2016, the General Partner issued 
common units in conjunction with the Anadarko Basin assets acquisition discussed in Note 3. 

101

DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

In October 2015, EnLink issued approximately 2.8 million common units in a private placement transaction 

with the General Partner, generating approximately $50 million in proceeds. In 2015, Devon conducted an 
underwritten secondary public offering of 26.2 million common units representing limited partner interests in 
EnLink, raising net proceeds of $654 million.

In September 2017, EnLink issued 400,000 preferred units through an underwritten public offering for net 
proceeds of approximately $394 million. As a result of these transactions and EnLink’s acquisition and dropdown 
activity discussed further in Note 3, the table below shows the ownership interest activity in the General Partner and 
EnLink for the last three years.

21. Commitments and Contingencies

Devon is party to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business. Matters that are probable of 

unfavorable outcome to Devon and which can be reasonably estimated are accrued. Such accruals are based on 
information known about the matters, Devon’s estimates of the outcomes of such matters and its experience in 
contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. None of the actions are believed by management to involve future 
amounts that would be material to Devon’s financial position or results of operations after consideration of recorded 
accruals. Actual amounts could differ materially from management’s estimates.

Royalty Matters

Numerous oil and gas producers and related parties, including Devon, have been named in various lawsuits 
alleging royalty underpayments. These suits typically assert various allegations, including that the producers and 
related parties used below-market prices, made improper deductions, used improper measurement techniques and 
entered into gas purchase and processing arrangements with affiliates that resulted in the underpayment of royalties 
in connection with oil, natural gas and NGLs produced and sold. Devon is also involved in governmental agency 
proceedings and audits and is subject to related contracts and regulatory controls in the ordinary course of business, 
some that may lead to additional royalty claims. Devon does not currently believe that it is subject to material 
exposure with respect to such royalty matters.

Environmental Matters

Devon is subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation activities associated 
with past operations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and 
similar state statutes. In response to liabilities associated with these activities, loss accruals primarily consist of 
estimated uninsured remediation costs. Devon’s monetary exposure for environmental matters is not expected to be 
material.

knowledge, there were no material pending legal proceedings to which Devon is a party or to which any of its

Purchase obligation amounts represent contractual commitments primarily to purchase condensate at market 

prices for use at Devon’s heavy oil projects in Canada. Devon has entered into these agreements because condensate 
is an integral part of the heavy oil transportation process. Any disruption in Devon’s ability to obtain condensate 
could negatively affect its ability to transport heavy oil at these locations. Devon’s total obligation related to 
condensate purchases expires in 2021. The value of the obligation in the table above is based on the contractual 
volumes and Devon’s internal estimate of future condensate market prices.

Devon has certain drilling and facility obligations under contractual agreements with third-party service 

providers to procure drilling rigs and other related services for developmental and exploratory drilling and facilities 
construction. The value of the drilling obligations reported is based on gross contractual value.

Devon has certain operational agreements whereby Devon has committed to transport or process certain 

volumes of oil, gas and NGLs for a fixed fee. Devon has entered into these agreements to aid the movement of its 
production to downstream markets.

Devon leases certain office space and equipment under operating lease arrangements. Total rental expense 

recognized for operating leases, net of sublease income, was $67 million, $78 million and $88 million in 2017, 2016 
and 2015, respectively.

22. Fair Value Measurements

The following table provides carrying value and fair value measurement information for certain of Devon’s 
financial assets and liabilities. None of the items below are measured using Level 3 inputs. The carrying values of 
cash, accounts receivable, other current receivables, accounts payable, other current payables and accrued expenses 
included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets approximated fair value at December 31, 2017 and 
December 31, 2016, as applicable. Therefore, such financial assets and liabilities are not presented in the following 
table. Additionally, the fair values of oil and gas assets, goodwill and other intangible assets and related impairments 
are measured as of the impairment date using Level 3 inputs. More information on these items and the pension plan 
assets is provided in Note 6, Note 14 and Note 18, respectively.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values in the tables above.

Level 1 Fair Value Measurements

Cash equivalents – Amounts consist primarily of U.S. and Canadian treasury securities and money market 

investments. The fair value approximates the carrying value.

Level 2 Fair Value Measurements

Cash equivalents – Amounts consist primarily of commercial paper and Canadian agency and provincial 

securities investments. The fair value approximates the carrying value.

Commodity and interest rate derivatives– The fair values of commodity and interest rate derivatives are 
estimated using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward curves and data obtained from 
independent third parties for contracts with similar terms or data obtained from counterparties to the agreements.

Debt – Devon’s debt instruments do not actively trade in an established market. The fair values of its debt are 
estimated based on rates available for debt with similar terms and maturity. The fair values of commercial paper and 
credit facility balances are the carrying values.

Installment payment – The fair value of the EnLink installment payment was based on Level 2 inputs from 

third-party market quotations.

Capital lease obligations – The fair value was calculated using inputs from third-party banks.

Segment Information

Devon manages its operations through distinct operating segments, which are defined primarily by geographic 

areas. For financial reporting purposes, Devon aggregates its U.S. operating segments into one reporting segment 
due to the similar nature of the businesses. However, Devon’s Canadian exploration and production operating 
segment is reported as a separate reporting segment primarily due to the significant differences between the U.S. and 
Canadian regulatory environments. Devon’s U.S. and Canadian segments are both primarily engaged in oil and gas 
exploration and production activities, and certain information regarding such activities for each segment is included 
in Note 24.

Devon considers EnLink, combined with the General Partner, to be an operating segment that is distinct from 
the U.S. and Canadian operating segments. EnLink’s operations consist of midstream assets and operations located 
across the U.S. Additionally, EnLink has a management team that is primarily responsible for capital and resource 
allocation decisions. Therefore, EnLink is presented as a separate reporting segment.

the second quarter of 2015 was considered a transfer of net assets between entities under common control, and EnLink was 
required to recast its financial statements as of December 31, 2015 to include the activities of such assets from the date of 
common control. Therefore, the results of VEX have been moved from the U.S. segment to the EnLink segment for the recast 
period.

Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Operations (Unaudited)

Supplemental unaudited information regarding Devon’s oil and gas activities is presented in this note. The 

information is provided separately by country. 

Included in this note are disclosures of Devon’s results of operations for oil and gas producing activities and 

standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserve quantities. In 
conjunction with Devon’s oil and gas accounting policy change discussed in Note 1, Devon also modified its 
treatment of certain “production support” costs in these two disclosures. Production support costs consisted of labor, 
supervision, materials and supplies for oil and gas production monitoring and support activities, including 
information technology, accounting and certain other administrative support functions. These costs are included in 
G&A expenses in the accompanying consolidated comprehensive statements of earnings. Devon used a method to 
allocate these costs to its country-based results of operations and standardized measure disclosures. In 2016 and 
2015, Devon’s results of operations disclosures included production support costs of $168 million and $224 million, 
respectively, and its standardized measure disclosures included estimated future production support costs of $2.8 
billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. 

Devon’s 2016 and 2015 disclosures have been revised to exclude these amounts.

Based on research conducted by Devon, diversity of practice has existed across peer companies regarding the 

treatment of production support costs in results of operations and standardized measure disclosures. Devon’s 
research of public filings indicates most companies exclude such costs from results of operations and standardized 
measure disclosures, but some companies appear to include such costs in their disclosures. Considering the apparent 
diversity of practice, Devon is making this disclosure change for two primary reasons. First, by converting to the 
successful efforts method of accounting and making this disclosure change, Devon’s results of operations and 
standardized measure disclosures will be most comparable to the vast majority of its peers. Second, allocating these 
costs to more granular common operating fields as opposed to country-based full cost pools is cost prohibitive and 
not materially important to investors and stakeholders, considering such allocated costs represented approximately 
4% of Devon’s 2016 and 2015 oil, gas and NGL sales.

Development costs in the tables above include additions and revisions to Devon’s asset retirement obligations. 
Additionally, Devon capitalizes interest costs incurred and attributable to unproved oil and gas properties and major 
development projects of oil and gas properties. Capitalized interest expenses, which are included in the costs shown 
in the preceding tables, were $69 million, $61 million and $52 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Results of Operations 

The following tables include revenues and expenses associated with Devon’s oil and gas producing activities. 

They do not include any allocation of Devon’s interest costs or general corporate overhead and, therefore, are not 
necessarily indicative of the contribution to net earnings of Devon’s oil and gas operations. Income tax expense has 
been calculated by applying statutory income tax rates to oil, gas and NGL sales after deducting costs, including 
DD&A and after giving effect to permanent differences.

Total proved undeveloped reserves remained consistent from 2016 to 2017 with the year-end 2017 balance 

representing 19% of total proved reserves. Devon’s focus on drilling and development activities in the STACK and 
Delaware Basin was the primary driver of the 128 MMBoe increase in extensions and discoveries. Continued 
development primarily at Jackfish led to the conversion of 73 MMBoe, or 18%, of the 2016 proved undeveloped 
reserves to proved developed reserves. Costs incurred to develop and convert Devon’s proved undeveloped reserves 
were approximately $237 million for 2017.     

A significant amount of Devon’s proved undeveloped reserves at the end of 2017 related to its Jackfish 

operations. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, Devon’s Jackfish proved undeveloped reserves were 209 MMBoe and 
294 MMBoe, respectively. Development schedules for the Jackfish reserves are primarily controlled by the need to 
keep the processing plants at their 35 MBbl daily facility capacity. Processing plant capacity is controlled by factors 
such as total steam processing capacity and steam-oil ratios. Furthermore, development of these projects involves 
the up-front construction of steam injection/distribution and bitumen processing facilities. Due to the large up-front 
capital investments and large reserves required to provide economic returns, the project conditions meet the specific 
circumstances requiring a period greater than five years for conversion to developed reserves. As a result, these 
reserves are classified as proved undeveloped for more than five years. Currently, the development schedule for 
these reserves extends through 2028. At the end of 2017, approximately 196 MMBoe of proved undeveloped 
reserves at Jackfish have remained undeveloped for five years or more since the initial booking. No other projects 
have proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped more than five years from the initial booking of 
the reserves. Furthermore, approximately 88 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves at Jackfish will require in 
excess of five years, from the date of this filing, to develop.

Price Revisions

Reserves increased 111 MMBoe in the U.S. primarily due to significant price increases in the trailing 12 

month average for oil, gas and NGLs in 2017. Reserves decreased 38 MMBoe in Canada due to a significant 
increase in the trailing 12 month average price for bitumen in 2017. The increased price has the effect of increasing 
its royalties, which decreases its after-royalty volumes. 

Reserves decreased 27 MMBoe and 302 MMBoe during 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to lower 

commodity prices for oil and gas. The lower bitumen price increased Canadian reserves due to the decline in 
royalties, which increases Devon’s after-royalty volumes.

Revisions Other Than Price

Total revisions other than price in 2016 primarily related to Devon’s evaluation of certain dry gas regions and 

NGLs, with the largest revisions being made in the Barnett Shale and STACK (Cana-Woodford Shale). 

111

DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

Revisions other than price for 2015 primarily related to evaluations of Eagle Ford and Jackfish. Negative 

revisions other than price at Jackfish were primarily due to a refined reserves methodology that resulted in a reduced 
recovery factor. 

Extensions and Discoveries

2017 – Over 80% of the additions were through our focused efforts in the STACK (120 MMBoe) and the 

Delaware Basin (79 MMBoe). The remaining extensions were added throughout the remainder of Devon’s portfolio. 

The 2017 extensions and discoveries included 66 MMBoe related to additions from Devon’s infill drilling 

activities, which was primarily related to the STACK.

2016 – Of the 126 MMBoe of extensions and discoveries, 97 MMBoe related to STACK, 18 MMBoe related 

to the Delaware Basin and 7 MMBoe related to the Eagle Ford.

The 2016 extensions and discoveries included 74 MMBoe related to additions from Devon’s infill drilling 

activities, primarily consisting of 73 MMBoe related to STACK.

2015 – Of the 118 MMBoe of extensions and discoveries, 38 MMBoe related to the Delaware Basin, 30 

MMBoe related to the Anadarko Basin, 21 MMBoe related to the Eagle Ford and 11 MMBoe related to Jackfish.

The 2015 extensions and discoveries included 13 MMBoe related to additions from Devon’s infill drilling 

activities, primarily consisting of 11 MMBoe at Jackfish.

Purchase of Reserves

2016 – Primarily related to Devon’s acquisition in the STACK play.

2015 – Primarily related to Devon’s acquisition in the Powder River Basin.

Sale of Reserves

2017 – Related to Devon’s non-core asset divestitures in the U.S. as discussed further in Note 3.

2016 – Related to Devon’s non-core upstream asset divestitures discussed further in Note 3.

Future cash inflows, development costs and production costs were computed using the same assumptions for 

prices and costs that were used to estimate Devon’s proved oil and gas reserves at the end of each year. For 2017 
estimates, Devon’s future realized prices were assumed to be $47.86 per Bbl of oil, $31.86 per Bbl of bitumen, 
$2.43 per Mcf of gas and $16.25 per Bbl of NGLs. Of the $5.2 billion of future development costs as of the end of 
2017, $0.9 billion, $0.8 billion and $0.5 billion are estimated to be spent in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.

Future development costs include not only development costs but also future asset retirement costs. Included 

as part of the $5.2 billion of future development costs are $1.3 billion of future asset retirement costs. The future 
income tax expenses have been computed using statutory tax rates, giving effect to allowable tax deductions and tax 
credits under current laws.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to Devon, 

including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify Devon’s financial reports and to 
other members of senior management and the Board of Directors.

Based on their evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that our 

disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934) were effective as of December 31, 2017 to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by Devon in 
the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized 
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial 

reporting for Devon, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934. Under the supervision and with the participation of Devon’s management, including our principal executive 
and principal financial officers, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial 
reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “2013 COSO Framework”). Based on this evaluation 
under the 2013 COSO Framework, which was completed on February 21, 2018, management concluded that its 
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 has been audited by 
KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm who audited our consolidated financial statements as 
of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, as stated in their report, which is included under “Item 8. Financial 
Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

In the fourth quarter of 2017, we added and modified certain internal control processes as a result of changing 

our method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities from the full cost method to the 
successful efforts method. There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the 
fourth quarter of 2017 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over 
financial reporting.
