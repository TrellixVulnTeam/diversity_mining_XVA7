A Message from Chairman Muhtar Kent

OUR INCLUSIVE APPROACH  
TO LONG-TERM VALUE CREATION

Our story began on May 8, 1886, when the very first Coca-Cola® was sold in 
Atlanta, Georgia. From these humble roots, our business has grown to touch 
the lives of people in cities, towns and villages across more than 200 nations. 

Coca-Cola has a long history of refreshing the world. Along the way, we’ve 
written another closely related story, one of growing long-term sustainable 
value for shareowners like you and everyone connected to our business.

In 2017, we added an exciting chapter in this story. President and CEO 
James Quincey shares more about our operational strategies and successes 
in his letter. 

For my part, I’d like to discuss our commitment to long-term value creation 
and how we believe an inclusive approach helps optimize shareowner value 
creation over time.

Legendary Coca-Cola Chairman Robert Woodruff liked to describe how every 
person connected to our business had to be paid from the same dollar.

So our inclusive view of value creation is not new. But it has never been more 
important, as people increasingly choose our brands not only for the 
refreshment in each bottle but also for the shared value we create for:

•  Our shareowners
•  Our consumers
•  Our people
•  Our bottling partners

•  Our customers
•  Our suppliers and other business partners
•  Our non-profit partners and public agencies
•  Our communities and governments

Our shareowners. With each decision, we strive to do all we can to create 
near- and long-term value for shareowners like you. We look at our assets—
including our people, our brand portfolio, our customer and partner 
relationships—and we make choices to maximize shareowner value.

For example, we are strengthening our brand and packaging mix to put the 
right drinks in the right packages in the right places to drive sales and 
revenue—and create incremental value for our shareowners, customers, 
bottling partners and other stakeholders.

Our consumers. We are constantly adjusting to changing consumer tastes 
by polishing our brands, enhancing our beverage portfolio and evolving our 
packaging. Two examples: the robust growth of smaller packages like our 
mini cans and the runaway success of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. Consumer-
focused innovation creates value for our consumers, customers, bottling 
partners and shareowners.

Our people. We need a strong, capable workforce of diverse individuals, all 
bringing their unique insights, experiences and know-how to work every day. 
As a company, we need to be welcoming and inclusive, we need to help our 
people learn and grow, and we need to compensate them in a way that 
rewards the work they do and allows us to retain them.

The Coca-Cola Company

Our bottling partners. In recent years, we’ve reshaped and re-energized  
our bottling system to optimize value creation. In 2017, we completed the  
U.S. refranchising process and helped to create stronger bottlers in China  
and Japan. These and other changes were designed to drive enhanced 
long-term value for our bottling partners, shareowners, customers, 
communities and more.

Our communities and governments. We can’t have a strong, growing 
business unless we are serving strong, growing communities. Much of  
the public good we do is fueled by the economic value we create for our 
customers, helping them employ more people, provide more for their families 
and contribute more to their communities. And we contribute to the public 
good in every community by paying local and national taxes.

Our customers. Our system helps stores, restaurants and other customers 
become more successful by making sure each outlet has an optimal mix of 
brands, packages, marketing support, and fountain and cooler equipment. 
Ultimately, we want the customer value creation of our beverages to outpace 
our customers’ other products or menu items, thus creating new value  
for our customers and opening up new opportunities to grow with them  
in the future. 

Our suppliers and other business partners. Our business relies heavily on 
the power of partnerships with our suppliers, marketing agencies and many 
others. As we grow, we create more value for our partners, from fruit farmers, 
coffee growers and orchard owners to ad agencies, packaging suppliers and 
billboard companies. As Mr. Woodruff described, all of these people are paid 
from the same dollar.

Our non-profit partners and public agencies. We work with many 
partners outside the business world, from the International Olympic 
Committee, FIFA and the Special Olympics to government agencies to 
organizations like World Wildlife Fund, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and 
many others. The work we do together brings new shine to our brands as we 
celebrate the spirit of sport, make our world more inclusive and take steps to 
improve the environment, protect water resources, advance community 
health initiatives and create new economic opportunities.

We also look for fresh ways to create community value by, for example, 
improving access to educational opportunities, critical medicines and clean 
drinking water in underserved communities. In addition, we are committed  
to enabling the economic empowerment of 5 million women entrepreneurs  
with training, mentoring and micro credits. At year-end, we had reached 
2.4 million women, and we are on track to meet our 2020 goal. 

On behalf of the board of directors, thank you for your investment in 
The Coca-Cola Company. Along with James Quincey, his leadership team  
and all our associates, we remain committed to doing all we can to build 
long-term value creation for you and all those connected to our business. 

 
Very best regards,

Muhtar Kent 
Chairman of the  
Board of Directors

A Message from President and CEO James Quincey

WE ARE GROWING  
OUR BUSINESS

We are fortunate to participate in an industry that is diversified across 
brands, categories, channels and countries; a thriving industry with strong 
relative growth within the consumer packaged goods space; and an industry  
in which our Company is uniquely positioned for disciplined growth in 2018 
and beyond. 

As the world’s leading nonalcoholic beverage company, we have the world’s 
most valuable brand portfolio, leading value share positions across multiple 
categories and, thanks to our nearly 250 bottling partners around the world, 
unparalleled distribution capabilities. And yet, after nearly 132 years  
of nurturing this business, we still have ample room to grow.

Early last year, I introduced five strategic priorities to drive accelerated growth 
for our Company and value for our shareowners. I’m happy to report on our 
progress. In 2017, we achieved or exceeded our full-year guidance, solidified  
our leadership position and recommitted to our long-term growth targets. 
What follows is a snapshot of how our priorities are fueling these results. 

1  Accelerating the growth of our consumer-centric 

brand portfolio
The key to unlocking further growth is to start with the consumer, 
offering people a variety of beverages that make everyday moments 
more enjoyable. We refer to this as “Beverages for Life”—a vision that 
combines the brand-building expertise that has created 21 billion-dollar 
brands with a nimbler, test-and-learn approach to launching new 
products around the world. Last year, we expanded our consumer-centric 
brand portfolio by launching more than 500 products. We also rapidly 
scaled Honest Tea® and glacéau smartwater® into multiple international 
markets. And we launched Coca-Cola Zero SugarTM in 20 markets, leading 
to double-digit revenue growth for the brand globally for the year. 

We are balancing our focus on large brands while responding to 
emerging consumer trends, making targeted investments in juices, 
teas, coffees and other categories that complement people’s diverse 
lifestyles. This includes beverages with organic and natural 
ingredients, with reduced sugar or new sugar alternatives, and  
with more vitamins, minerals and protein.

2  Driving revenue growth

We are continuously refining our revenue growth management 
practices to ensure we have the right price and package 
combinations in the marketplace to best meet consumer needs and 
desires. We are turning challenges into opportunities by, for example, 
introducing smaller package sizes that enable people to reduce 
calories while driving revenue growth and margin expansion. We are 
intensifying our focus on premium experiences with brands like Topo 
Chico or ViO Schorle, premium waters and spritzers with a disciplined 
approach to value over volume in the categories we participate in.

3  Strengthening our global system

Our bottling system continues to provide a competitive advantage 
through its global reach and local presence. Last year, we completed 
the refranchising of our bottling operations in the United States and 
China—key milestones in our strategy to strengthen our bottling 
system. We now have a better capitalized, more energized and highly 
focused bottling system. Returning the Company to a capital-light 
asset model means that we can reinvest in brand building and 
innovation while our bottling partners can focus on driving execution.

4 

The Coca-Cola Company

Our bottling partners are not only crucial to getting our brands  
to market, they are the local face of the Coca-Cola system and 
invaluable partners when it comes to investing in, and safeguarding, 
our reputation. Together with our bottlers, we are returning at least 
100 percent of the water used in our finished beverages to communities 
and nature, enabling the economic empowerment of women 
entrepreneurs and taking responsibility for our packaging waste.  
In 2017, we developed our World Without Waste strategy, aiming  
to collect a bottle or can for each one we sell by 2030. 

4  Digitizing our enterprise

Digital touches every part of our business, and we need to 
continuously adapt. We are doing so with a focus on consumers, 
customers and our internal systems. As our consumers continue to 
digitize their shopping habits, we are putting our beverages within  
a click’s reach of desire. We are re-engineering our supply chain and 
using data to inform our decisions. And we are modernizing internal 
systems, empowering associates and allowing them to act with more 
speed and independence. 

5  Unlocking the power of our people

We have made substantial changes to empower our associates. 
During the year, we introduced the role of Chief Growth Officer and 
appointed new management at the majority of our operations in the 
field. Change can sometimes be difficult, but it is necessary to drive 
the business forward. For example, we reduced our corporate office 
headcount to create a leaner, more agile organization and create more 
empowered, accountable business units in the field; and we changed 
our compensation model, introducing metrics that incentivize growth. 

Perhaps most importantly, we are fostering a growth culture that 
encourages accountability, performance and ownership, where  
our associates are curious, inclusive, empowered and embrace  
a test-and-learn mentality. We must be curious about the outside 

world, about how the consumer is changing, about the customer 
strategy and how value is created. We must be inclusive, open to 
ideas and to learning, seeking new opportunities and ways to partner 
with our bottlers to grow our leadership position. Each of us needs  
to feel empowered and able to turn our insights into action. And we 
must act faster and experiment to capitalize on opportunities across 
the categories and countries that we need to succeed in. 

We have a strong foundation
Our system and our more than 500 brands position us as the world’s largest 
total beverage company. We reach 27 million customer outlets across more 
than 20 different channels through our global distribution network in more 
than 200 countries. We hold the number one value position in nonalcoholic 
ready-to-drink beverages, as well as in sparkling soft drinks; juice, dairy and 
plant-based beverages; water, enhanced water and sports drinks; and ready-
to-drink tea and coffee. We are already in a strong position, and we are 
driving value growth across nearly all beverage category clusters.

We are excited to capitalize on the growth potential we see in front of us. We 
believe in the strength of our system, the continued growth of the beverage 
industry, and the actions that we are taking to win in 2018 and beyond. 
Thank you for joining us as we continue to build upon our iconic brands and 
change the way people everywhere engage with The Coca-Cola Company.

 
Sincerely,

James Quincey 
President and 
Chief Executive Officer

The Coca-Cola System Value Chain

How we do business is just as important as what we 
make. We strive to do the right thing for people and the 
planet. We aim to create shared opportunities in every 
community we serve. This graphic illustrates the major 
stages in our value chain, why they matter and how  
we are creating value at each stage.

Water

We aim to give back 
the amount of water 
used in our finished 

beverages to replenish 

communities and 

nature.

Agriculture

Agricultural ingredients, along 

with millions of local farmers, are 
critical to create our beverages. 

Packaging Collection  

& Recycling

Our goal is to collect a bottle or can 
for every one we sell by 2030, and we 

are working to use more recycled 

materials in our packaging.

People & Communities

Equipment
Coolers, fountain 

dispensers and other 

equipment.

From our employees to our consumers, 
people are at the center of everything 

we do. We aim to create value for 

everyone connected to our business, 

including enabling the economic 
empowerment of women through 

programs like  

5by20. 

Customers

More than 27 million 
customers sell our 

beverages to consumers  

in 200+ countries.

12 

The Coca-Cola Company

Business Profile

The Coca-Cola Company is the world’s largest beverage 
company. We own or license and market more than 500 
nonalcoholic beverage brands, which we group into the 
following category clusters: sparkling soft drinks; water, 
enhanced water and sports drinks; juice, dairy and 
plant-based beverages; tea and coffee; and energy 
drinks.
We own and market four of the world’s top five 
nonalcoholic sparkling soft drink brands: Coca-Cola, 
Diet Coke®, Fanta® and Sprite®. Finished beverage 
products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States 
since 1886, are now sold in more than 200 countries.

The Coca-Cola System
We are a global business that operates locally in every 
community we proudly serve. We are able to create 
global reach with local resources because of the strength 
of the Coca-Cola system, which comprises our Company 
and our bottling partners—nearly 250 worldwide.

The Coca-Cola system is not a single entity from a legal or 
managerial perspective, and the Company does not own 
or control most of our bottling partners. Our Company 
sources ingredients; manufactures and sells concentrates, 
beverage bases and syrups to our bottling operations; 
owns the brands and is responsible for consumer brand 
marketing initiatives. Our bottling partners and some 
Company-owned operations manufacture, package, 
merchandise and distribute the finished branded 
beverages to our customers and vending partners,  
who then sell our beverages to consumers.
Our bottling partners work closely with customers— 
grocery stores, restaurants, street vendors, convenience 
stores, movie theaters, amusement parks and many 
others—to execute localized strategies developed  
in partnership with our Company. Through effective 
collaboration, we are able to sell our products to 
consumers at a rate of more than 1.9 billion servings  
a day.

Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company reports its financial results in accordance with 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States 
(“GAAP” or referred to herein as "reported”). However, 
management believes that certain non-GAAP financial 
measures provide investors with additional meaningful financial 
information that should be considered when assessing our 
underlying business performance and trends. Management 

also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making 
financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions and 
in evaluating the Company’s performance. Non-GAAP financial 
measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an 
alternative for, the Company’s reported results prepared in 
accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures do 
not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. 

For additional details regarding the reconciliation of GAAP 
and non-GAAP financial measures below, see the Company’s 
Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 16, 2018 and 
February 9, 2017. This information is also available  
in the “Investors” section of the Company’s website,

Environmental Statement
A healthy environment, locally and globally, is vital to our 
business and to the communities where we operate. We 
view protection of the environment and the resources we 
share as a journey. We began that journey years ago, and 
it continues today. The Coca-Cola Company is committed 
to pursuing more sustainable growth, and we strive to 
conduct business in ways that protect and preserve the 
environment. We are working to address challenging 
environmental concerns by focusing on areas where  
we have the most potential to make positive impact.  
Our associates, business partners, suppliers and 
consumers work together to find innovative ways  
to foster the efficient use of natural resources, the 
prevention of waste and the sound management of  
water. Doing so benefits the environment and makes  
good business sense. For more information, please  
visit www.cocacolacompany.com/sustainability.

Equal Opportunity Policy
The Company is committed to maintaining a work 
environment free from all forms of unlawful discrimination 
and harassment. It is the Company’s policy to prohibit 
discrimination and harassment against any applicant or 
employee on the basis of race, color, religion (including 
religious dress and grooming), sex or gender, national 
origin, ancestry, age, mental or physical disability, medical 
condition, pregnancy, military or veteran status, genetic 
information, citizenship status, marital status, sexual 
orientation, gender identity and/or gender expression,  
or any other reason prohibited by law. It is also the 
Company’s policy to provide reasonable accommodation  
to qualified individuals with disabilities and to the  
sincerely held religious beliefs, practices or observance of 
applicants or employees so long as such accommodation 
does not pose an undue hardship. The Company also 
prohibits retaliation against any individual who in  
good faith complains of perceived harassing or 
discriminatory conduct, participates in a Company or 
agency investigation into such complaints, or engaged  
in other protected activity. 

Scope of the Annual Review
Except as otherwise noted, this Annual Review covers  
the 2017 performance of The Coca-Cola Company and the 
Coca-Cola system (our Company and our bottling partners),
